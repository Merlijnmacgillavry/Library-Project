However, this tourism also has a downside. Hotels and restaurants are constructed one after another, preferably along the coast. This, combined with factors such as climate change and land subsidence and the fact that people tend to prefer living close to the coast, leads to a vulnerable and erosive coast, especially in the departments of La Guajira and Magdalena. Therefore, Project Colciencias was initiated by three local universities and two companies, a large scale study to improve and implement coastal projects in this area. Focus is on areas that experience critical erosion; erosion that puts local economy, environment and national heritage at risk (Oceanus, 2013). Ten objectives are formulated by the five different parties, e.g. characterization of the coast, development of pilot projects and socialisation of coastal projects. <br/>The goal of this multidisciplinary research conducted by TU Delft students in cooperation with Oceanus International is to improve the Colciencias project by combining Dutch and Colombian expertise, technology, efficiency and theory. After analysing the political, cultural, social, hydraulic and environmental situation, and after consulting various stakeholders three research objectives were stated and elaborated. <br/>The first goal is to create a framework to ensure a consistent and efficient implementation of the intended pilot projects. Not only does it cover the hydraulic aspects of a project, it also takes into account the socio-economic, environmental and legal factors. To support the part of the framework that comprehends the hydraulic analysis and the development of alternatives for coastal protection, a detailed document on numerical models is written. This is objective number two. Next to information on numerical models in general, the three main types of coastal models are discussed; coastline, regional - and local morphodynamic models. Eight specific models are then further highlighted, resulting in a decision tree that helps in choosing the best model for your specific engineering application. To test the framework, a case study was executed in one of the critical erosion zones, the village of Ciénaga. The framework was followed concisely to evaluate its effectiveness and efficiency. Among other things, a field trip was organised to carry out experiments and execute a survey to explore the socio-economic values of the region. Next to that, interviews were carried out with officials and local parties to obtain information on past projects and the local legal framework. From the case study it was concluded that the framework functions, but that it should be noted that the case study is only a test of the framework, and that much further research needs to be conducted for the actual design and implementation of the coastal plan for Ciénaga. <br/>Lastly, our goal was to start a dialogue about the impact of integrated coastal zone management and coastal erosion problems. In practice this resulted in many interviews, a survey, attendance of local community meetings, presentations at the Universidad del Norte for stakeholders of the project and an informal gathering of students at the Universidad de Cartagena. Furthermore, the framework shall be distributed to possible stakeholders as well as an informative presentation along with an introductory movie.<br","Integrated Coastal Zone Management Colombia","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","","MP228","10.39100, -75.47940"

Research on the treatment of cartilage injuries has lead to various clinical procedures, one of them being Matrix Induced Autologous Chondrocyte Implantation (MACI). MACI surgery consist of two procedures. During the first intervention cartilage cells of the patient are first harvested from a healthy chondral area in the knee. The cells are cultivated and during the second procedure, these are implanted in the defect using a collagen scaffold. Exact fitting of the scaffold has shown to be important for the success of the surgery. Currently there is no reproducable method to match the size of the defect and the implant, without the use of overlapping scaffolds or removing excessive helathy cartilage. Objective. The objective of this study is to evaluate an instrument designed to arthroscopically create a delimited implantation site in the human knee according to a predefined shape. This shape is used to cut an equally shaped collagen implant to fit in the implantation site. Method. An electronic device, based on a movable nitinol knife that makes a rotational cut was chosen as the best solution to solve this problem. A prototype was build to test to what extent the movement of the knife can be controlled and what forces are acting on the cartilage. The amount of removed healthy cartilage was tested using a virtual test. Results: The mean amount of healthy cartilage that is removed using a predefined outline is 21% compared to an estimated 38% in current methods. The sensor and knife output partially match the prescribed paths, but the first 120 degrees of instrument rotation are not measured. Rotation of the device did not result in slipping of the tip in the cartilage. The knife blade could be inserted into the cartilage with forces lower than 3 Newtons for knife lengths up to 9.6 mm. Making a rotational cut with the instrument was not possible because, the knife rotates around its own axis when the instrument is rotated. Discussion. We have succeeded in testing the proposed design that should be able to produce a geometrically matching, (cell seeded) implant by creating a contained cartilage defect with reproducible size in an arthroscopic procedure. The instrument does not fully work due to insufficient strength of the nitinol strip. There are however, some aspects such a tip placement and minimizing the healthy cartilage removal that give promising results for further application.","matrix autologous chondrocyte implantation; arthroscopy; nitinol; knee; instrument; MACI","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

This measured axial force in combination with a standardized ROM test could be used to objectively assess the soft tissue tension during surgery. It is expected that this instrument will be a helpful tool for inexperienced surgeons, because literature shows that errors made by the surgeon are the biggest cause of early failures and inexperienced surgeons registered twice as much dislocations as experienced surgeons. Therefore, the instrument could improve the success rate and quality of total hip arthroplasty by reducing the number of early failures caused by dislocation resulting from the inadequate soft tissue tension created by inexperienced surgeons. Furthermore, it could improve the patients' quality of living by reducing their limping and pain after the surgery.<br/>The current techniques to obtain the optimal length and angle of the implant are: preoperative radiography, intraoperative leg length assessment and subjective soft tissue tension assessment methods. Factors that influence soft tissue tension, apart from the implant, are either caused by the patient (inter- or intra-personal), the surgeon or the environment.<br/>Although a 3 DOF sensory system integrated in the test stem is preferable, it is likely that measuring only the axial force in a so called 'the neck' of the prosthesis, in combination with a standardized range of motion (ROM) test, provides valuable inside information about the relation between variation in force and success of the procedure. This assessment is not based measuring absolute forces, but on pattern recognition while moving the hip through its range of motion. The validity of this hypothesis should be investigated in future research.<br/>Different sensors have been tested to see if they survive the standard sterilization program of an autoclave, which uses hot steam at 134 degree Celsius, at a pressure of 2 bar for 20 minutes. The linear Hall sensor was chosen based on this test and a list of pros and cons. After that, a design was made in SolidWorks. Then it was manufactured and calibrated. The final prototype can be implanted in a few seconds when the stem is in place, by sliding it onto the stem and plugging it into a monitor. The device is intuitive to use, because the monitor produces real time graphs of the axial force that are easy to understand. Immediate adjustments to the soft tissue tension can be made by switching the head of the implant, while keeping the force sensing neck in place, in order to provide the greatest chance for surgical success. Furthermore, the device is highly reusable, because it can be sterilized with the standard autoclave procedure. Finally, the prototype was tested in a cadaver at the Erasmus hospital in Rotterdam. The axial hip force was measured at rest, when pulling the leg and when moving the leg through its range of motion. Although there were inaccuracies due to the elastic hysteresis of the rubber spring and friction of between axis and cylinder, consistent patterns in the measured axial hip force were observed. Recommendations are proposed in chapter 5 to reduce the errors caused by elastic hysteresis, friction and ROM tracking.<br/>Based on what was learned from the cadaver test and from literature, a standardized test proposal with hypothesis was made. This test should serve as a guideline to get consistent and useful results in future research. This future research should investigate if the axial force measured during these ROM tests provides enough information to objectively assess the soft tissue tension, or if more information is required.<br","Hip joint force; Instrumented hip prosthesis; Soft tissue tension; Implant; Biomechanics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-12-11","","","","","",""

To implement such a system on individual instrument level, a technique that can create Unique Device Identification (UDI) codes is needed. Current UDI systems, such as RFID and barcode scanning, do not suffice. Adding a RFID tag to a large instrument is not a problem, but adding the tag to a small scissor can be problematic. Adding a barcode to an instrument can be done in multiple differ- ent ways such as; laser engraving, adding a sticker or adding a tag with a barcode on it. The tags tend to be removed by medical professionals and stickers can get loose. Laser engraving seems to be a good alternative, if no human material would stay behind in the slots after sterilizing.<br/>Both techniques discussed above are not specific designed for Medical Asset Management. The goal of this thesis is to research if a different technique can be used for MAM; medical instruments identification via lu- minescent micro-particles coating. The main question is:<br/>Is it possible to coat individual medical instruments with a coating via electroless nickel plating, with embed- ded luminescent micro-particles and identify these instruments?<br/>To answer this question, this thesis is divided into 4 parts; Electroless nickel plating of stainless steel; Physic- ochemical characterization of the coatings; Identification of the substrates and Implementation. During the 8 experiments, 316L medical grade stainless steel substrates are coated and characterized. The identification part consists out of building a setup for a UV-C light and creating a Matlab file for automatically identification of the substrates. Medical instrument experts are consulted for the implementation part.<br/>With the use of a nickel strike as a pre-treatment, a successful coating was embedded into the substrates. The Barium Magnesium Aluminate (BAM:Eu) particles were visible via the SEM analysis and was identified via a EDS analysis. Exciting the substrate with the UV-C light resulted in a clear blue substrate. Trying the same experiments with different particles, Yttrium-Oxide (YO:Eu), was not successful. The dispersion of the YO:Eu particles was different in comparison to the BAM:Eu particles. The YO:Eu particles eventually sank to the bottom or agglomerated on the top of the solution. The created Matlab script was successful in identifying both colors. During the discussion of the technique with medical instruments experts, questions arose about the change in material properties. Some properties do change, but the impact of this needs to be further researched.<br/>This research proved the concept of identifying individual medical instruments via a luminescent micro par- ticle coating. It is possible to coat and identify a substrate with this technique.","luminescent; micro-particles; identification; medical instruments","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-12-31","","","","Biomedical Engineering | Medical Instruments and Medical Safety (MIMS)","",""

This camera can be optimised to gain data of a higher quality. Within the ANCE section this optimisation was required mainly to diminish the influence of the ground effect in the data and to increase the resolution of the eventual source plots. The increase in resolution was required to be able to separate engine and airframe noise also for the smaller aircraft. The research started with a quantification of the previous fly-over camera of the ANCE section. It appeared that the fringes from Lloyds’s mirror pattern were present, but different for each microphone. This was due to the edge diffraction and should be solved by placing the microphones at least 30 cm from the edge. The increase in resolution should be solved by doubling the array aperture to 3.4 m. These and many other findings were implemented in a new design. This design consists out of a de-attachable rigid structure of 4x4m placed on adjustable legs to which 64 microphones could be clipped in an Underbrink spiral array configuration. The design was built and tested for fly-over aircraft at Schiphol Airport. The measured data was analysed and it appeared that the fringes from the ground effect were gone.

(mentor); Gerspach, François (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2017","During S-lay pipeline installation, tension fluctuations in the suspended pipeline are compensated by the tensioner system on the vessel. The goal of this thesis is to answer the questions: to what extent does the active tension compensation (ATC) influence the pipeline integrity during offshore installation. Secondly, which tensioner model should be used for pipelay analyses that can give accurate results? And lastly, what is the implication on the existing tensioner models (deadband and linear damping with velocity cap) that are currently used in pipelay analyses?<br/><br/>The pipelay operation is modelled in OrcaFlex with 7 case studies from shallow to deep water based on full-scale measurement data measured during offshore installation. For each case study, three types of measurement data are available: vessel motions, tensioner pay-out motion and pipeline top tension. Vessel motions and tensioner motion signals are used as inputs to the OrcaFlex model, whereas the measured tension signal is used for comparison with the output pipeline top tension for model validation.<br/><br/>It is observed that the ATC becomes more important in deeper water as the reduction in maximum von Mises strain in the sagbend and accumulated fatigue damage become more significant with increasing water depth. The maximum von Mises strain is found to be in between 0% and 2.2% lower from the model with uncompensated tension. Moreover, the reduction in accumulated fatigue damage is more significant as the allowable standby time increases between 3.2% and 19.5%.<br/><br/>Subsequently, different tensioner models are included in the simulation. The tensioner model computes the pay-out motion based on the pipeline top tension deviation from a set tension at each time step. The initial model with specified tensioner motion is then used as a benchmark for the other tensioner models. It is found that the existing tensioner models are not conservative as the maximum von Mises strain and accumulated fatigue damage are underestimated, with the exception of the accumulated fatigue damage in shallow water cases.<br/><br/>As an alternative to the existing tensioner model, a tensioner model with a PI controller is introduced to represent the PI controller of the tensioners systems on the vessel. This PI controller model scripted in Python is implemented as an external function to the OrcaFlex model. <br/><br/>The controller gains are tuned proportional to the logged controller gains from the vessel so that the tensioner model produces the pay-out signal similar to the measured pay-out. Based on the pipeline integrity check, the tensioner model with PI controller is valid and can be used for a more accurate investigation of the pipeline integrity in all cases.<br","S-lay; active tension compensation; tensioner; offshore pipelines; pipeline integrity; sagbend; OrcaFlex; Full-scale measurement; PI controller; Python; Installation; Hydrodynamics; Vessel motions; Tension; Fatigue; von Mises strain","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-12-22","","","","","",""

Recently, the Ahafo South Mining operations owned by the Newmont Mining Corporation and located on a Proterozoic gold belt in the south west of Ghana, indicated that the cost of production must be reduced in order to viably continue the mining operations. For this research, the Ahafo South Mine Site was used as a case study. A site visit of 90 days provided insight in where the efficiency of productivity could possibly be improved. During this visit, historical production- and financial data [2014-2016] were gathered from a diverse group of engineers on site. Several audits were conducted to form a solid hypothesis with regards to the optimization of rock fragmentation. The hypothesis of this research states that improved rock fragmentation will result in a reduction of operational costs and delays along with an increase in crusher- and mill throughput.<br/><br/>This case study was used to investigate the effect of a varying fragmentation on shovel loading time and crusher- and mill performance. The financial impact of a potential blast pattern change was also investigated. After a statistical analysis of the available data on post-blast fragmentation, it was observed that the desired run of mine (ROM) P80 target of 350 mm is rarely met. It was concluded that the ""Kuz-Ram"" model used to predict the fragment size distribution is incorrectly applied, which resulted in a planned blast design that produces a coarse fragmentation with an excessive presence of boulders. This is referred to as ""bad fragmentation"" and proved to contribute significantly to redundant wear-and-tear of mining equipment, delays at the shovel loading operations and the primary crushing station. A correlation between fragmentation and loading time was found after a statistical analysis on the daily average loading time of three Liebherr 9400 shovels. It was concluded that the shovels are only able to produce at the desired rate of 2.4 minutes per truck load when the fragmentation of the ROM meets the P80 target. The Six Sigma principle Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control (DMAIC) was applied to define an accepted interval range of shovel loading time variation (2.4 m. ± 20 s.). This so called target interval was generally not achieved by the shovels. All three shovels show an increase in average loading time during period where the ROM fragmentation was coarser.<br/><br/>Data generated by a VisioRock™ camera showed, in combination with the throughput of the mills, that an appropriate fragmentation is crucial for an efficient milling process. A detailed analysis of the available data, categorized in ""periods of high interest"", demonstrated that the power consumption of the mills significantly increased when the feed consisted of relatively coarse fragments. It was observed that the post-crushed fragmentation was more coarse when a high fraction of the feed originated directly from the pit. This observation proved that the primary crusher is not able to eliminate all boulder related issues prior to the crushing operations as a result of inadequately planned blasts. Due to inaccurate or unreliable data on mill feed, it was concluded that a full mine to mill survey is required to obtain data needed for an accurate optimization of mill performance.<br/><br/>Newmont Ghana Gold Limited (NGGL) stated that at least 2.3M US$ has been saved on a yearly basis since 2015, as a result of the reduction of explosives used through a blast pattern widening. The cost impact analysis showed that it is uneconomical to save costs on explosives by widening the blast pattern, due to the potential downstream effects when the fragment size distribution is affected. The financial data was inconsistent and it is therefore recommended to conduct a detailed analysis to provide insight in the actual overall (financial) benefits of a blast pattern optimization. It is recommended to investigate both ""double-benching"" and the purchase of a continuous surveying camera system. Another recommendation is to narrow the blast pattern down to 3.5 m. by 4 m. so that fragmentation related issues are avoided which are currently to be expected for the continuing production in the Subika- and Awonsu Pit.<br","Rock Fragmentation; Gold Mine; Blast Pattern Selection; Kuz-Ram; Shovel Loading Time; Mill Throughput; Powder Factor; ROM; Mining; Processing; Six Sigma; Optimization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-12-22","","","","Applied Earth Sciences | European Mining Course","",""

During this dune passage arsenic is mobilized causing arsenic levels up to 4 µg/l in the influent of DWTP Katwijk. In this thesis the effectiveness of the MnO4 – Fe(III) dosing was evaluated on RSF influent of Dunea’s treatment plant Katwijk. The goal of the experiments was to reduce the residual arsenic concentration to &lt;1µg/l while minimizing negative effects on further treatment steps. Experiments were performed in a pilot filter filled with filter material originating from the RSFs in Katwijk to ensure conditions were similar to RSFs in Katwijk. The performance of MnO4 – Fe(III) dosing was evaluated at different filtration velocities (4, 6, 10 m/h) and at different top layer materials (anthracite (1.6-2.5mm) and pumice (2.5-3.5mm)). In this research multiple dosages were evaluated and residual As &lt;1µg/l was consistently achieved by dosing 0.5 mg NaMnO4 /l and 1.0 mg Fe(III) /l. It was found that the effectiveness of the MnO4 – Fe(III) dosing was not influenced by the filtration velocity applied in the RSFs. For all the filtration velocities checked the removal efficiency ranged from 60-70%, resulting in As levels &lt;1µg/l. The pumice used appeared to show slightly higher removal rates than the anthracite that was used. However, for full scale application purposes in Katwijk the used anthracite was better suited. The pumice filter clogged faster leading to a pressure loss of 95 cmWc after 6 days while the anthracite filter reached a pressure loss of 73 cmWc. Due to the coarse top layer less particles were removed in the top layer and caused the sand underneath to be loaded more and to clog more quickly. The AOCF process did not negatively influence the filter performance. Mn-, Fe- removal and nitrification all still performed to standards and the turbidity of the RSF effluent decreased from 0.3 FTU to 0.03 FTU. Based on preliminary experiments the sedimentation properties of the backwash water changed and the sedimentation velocity increased. The MnO4-Fe(III) dosage can effectively reduce the residual arsenic concentration to &lt;1µg/l and is ready to be applied at Katwijk. However, the negative effects on the runtime of the RSFs can’t be overlooked. The runtime of the current filters is expected to decrease by about 50% causing a higher stress on the backwash water treatment.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-08-21","","","","","",""

Together.: A strategy to guide and inspire technological innovation across Achmea","Huikeshoven, Leroy (TU Delft Industrial Design Engineering)","Nas, Deborah (mentor); Jaskiewicz, Tomasz (mentor); Fleer, Thijs (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2017","Digitalization is a phenomenon describing the increasing use of information and communication technologies in our society as at large and in our daily lives. They reshape the world around us, how we organise our lives, how we interact with friends and family, and how we work and collaborated. Digital technology makes us more connected and more insightful. Because of digitalization companies like Achmea experience increasingly dynamic markets. Many markets already have experienced significant change, such as the logistics and entertainment industry. The financial and insurance markets are experiencing that change right now. Start-ups working on ‘Insurtech’ and ‘Fintech’ are hot and booming. The Assignment The assignment for this project has been to develop methods for Achmea IT in order to stimulate technological innovation across Achmea. The solution is a strategy called ‘Shaping The Future. Together’ and is meant to align existing innovation processes by creating shared vision about the future among employees. This strategy is an answer to the several problems found during research; (1) the lack of understanding new technologies and its potential by the employees at the divisions and the brands, (2) the struggle to imagine and develop an IT infrastructure that is ready to support new innovations based on new technologies, (3) the lack of governance on innovation processes across Achmea and (4) the lack of a proper process at the research side of innovation. The strategy is designed for Achmea to innovate with digital technologies. It empowers employees to come together across Achmea and collect insights about the future to imagine visions - new interactions between people and products. These visions guide, inspire and steer innovation at Achmea. ‘Shaping The Future. Together’ means connecting different innovation processes within Achmea together. Different processes work together in an iterative (Agile) and open (open innovation) manner to generate knowledge about the future. This is done by doing tests in innovation funnels, generate concepts during hackathons and imagining desirable futures for people and Achmea. Innovation funnels, Customer Arenas, Hackathons, Innovation challenges, Trend reports and whitepapers are structured in a comprehensive way to organise a strong overall innovation process within Achmea and its ecosystem. This innovation process generates knowledge on new value propositions, new business models, new products and services, new business processes, new ways of collaborating and the future state of the IT infrastructure, see figure A. Workshop Except for the creation of visions, most processes are already present within Achmea. Therefore, a custom workshop has been designed for the innovation managers across Achmea. This workshop generates visions with employees on a specific topic. During the workshop these visions are mapped on a timeline to create a path towards the future. The visions are based on insights, data, knowledge and personal values the participants have to collect upfront. These insight can be collect from anywhere; whitepaper, family and friends, experiences, customer research and business analytics. This approache is grounded in literature and argues that futures are created by the action people take based on the knowledge they can muster and the value they have. The workshop has been tested with employees of Achmea and is used by innovation managers at the Innovation and Experience centre IT. The pilot was a success. The energy was high and the participants were impressed about the deep discussion the workshop facilitated. In only four hours they managed to make multiple visions for the future. The strategy, innovation process and workshop is based on a combination of different approaches; Innovation of Meaning (Verganti, 2017), Vision in Product Design (Hekkert &amp; Dijk, 2011), Contextmapping (Sanders &amp; Stappers, 2012), Backcasting (Vergragt &amp; Quist, 2011) and the Three Horizons Method (Curry &amp; Hodgson, 2008).","Innovation and Technology Strategy; IT Services; Design Driven Innovation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

In a work zone, traffic participants share the road with road workers. Road workers are often vulnerable and feel threatened by vehicles passing with high speed. Traffic participants are also at risk since driving with high speeds in work zones increases the severity of risky events. This study aims at designing and testing a new speed management measure for a typical overnight Dutch motorway work zone.<br/><br/>To design a new solution for the problem, a design method is chosen which incorporates human behavioural factors and system engineering. This design method is called Human System Integration (HSI). The current system is lacking flexibility and therefore the work zone and speed limit are sometimes interpreted as not credible. Also, some work phases are more dangerous than others and information about these phases may increase the awareness of the work zone with drivers. The designed solution aims to optimise the credibility of the total work zone system. To optimise credibility, the work zone should meet the drivers' expectations. <br/><br/>In this study a portable changeable message sign (PCMS) is added to the design to set driver expectations about the work zone. The possible displayed messages depending on the work zone phase are: 'Placement of traffic measures', 'No visible work activity', 'Work on crash barrier' and 'Removal of traffic measures'. Furthermore, if there is no visible work activity in the work zone, the speed limit is increased from 70 km/h to 90 km/h. <br/>The design is tested on the A12 motorway in one work zone and compared to two different work zones on the A12. For the evaluation, minute aggregated loop detector data is available. To incorporate these spatial and temporal factors like on-ramps and truck share a Multiple Linear Regression Model (MLRM) is estimated. <br/><br/>The PCMS has a small but significant effect of -1 km/h. The spatial impact of the PCMS is significant up till 2.7 km downstream of the sign location. The evaluation of the increased speed limit shows that speed limit compliance is higher during the 90 km/h speed limit in the 'no visible work activity' phase. <br/><br/>Based on the field trial, the verification of the design requirements and validation of the designs performance, it is concluded that the design looks promising. However, it has not been researched what are the most important factors in the credibility of work zones. It can still be studied which kinds of messages improve the credibility of work zones. And while this field trial uses road side systems, in-car technology may be even more effective in providing this kind of information. The HSI design method could be applied and tested in a more complex technical project. In most traffic systems and in the development of automated vehicles, human factors are important. It is thus recommended to study if the HSI design framework can be useful in this industry as well. <br","Human factors; Systems Engineering; Speed management; Work zones; Credibility","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Upon sodium insertion, N,N’ –bis(methyl)- 1,4,5,8-naphthalene diimide (NDMe) appears to share sodium atoms with three surrounding molecules in the crystal lattice in so called Triple Binding Spots (TBS). Until a sodiation fraction of 0.5, it shows a voltage plateau at 1.78 V versus Na/Na$^+$. For increasing sodiation fractions a voltage plateau of roughly 0.4 V versus Na/Na$^+$ is predicted. The second organic molecule N,N’ –bis(p-tolyl)- 1,4,5,8-naphthalene diimide (NDTo) appears to share sodium atoms between in two or four molecules, forming Dual Binding Spots (DBS) or Quartet Binding Spots (QBS). After Van der Waals corrections, the voltage profile of NDTo shows a sloping voltage between 2.05 V and 1.2 V till a sodiation fraction of 0.5, followed by a rather low voltage plateau at 0.24V versus Na/Na$^+$ until full sodiation. <br/><br/>It is found to be of crucial importance to include a Van der Waals correction in the DFT calculations for NDMe and NDTo. Without Van der Waals corrections, the outcomes of the DFT calculations without exceptions show large deviations from experimental data in all cell parameters. For NDTo, the Van der Waals corrections show more significance for an increasing fraction of sodiation.<br/><br/>Both organic crystals show extreme lattice distortions upon sodiation. NDMe shows a volumetric change of 14,73\% upon full sodiation with changes in vector lengths up to 50,13\%. NDTo shows a volumetric change of 8,24\% upon full sodiation with changes in vector lengths up to 10,41\%. These large lattice distortions demand for the crystal structure to have an exceptionally high flexibility in order to prevent material degradation when applied as anode material in a sodium-ion battery. For this reason a revaluation of NDMe and NDTo as robust anode materials is suggested, based on computational findings as presented here. <br/><br/>Solutions with different concentrations of sodium perchlorate (NaClO$_4$) have been tested in a three-electrode open test-cell to find evidence for an enlarged electrochemical stability window compared to that of distilled water. At a concentration of 10M, close to the saturation limit, the solution shows a stability window between -1.29 V and 1,762 V versus Ag/AgCl, effectively offering a stability window of 3.05 V. In order to test its applicability with an organic anode material, NDMe has been obtained and tested in 10M NaClO$_4$ versus a titanium counter electrode. To proof the open test-cell design to be suitable for yielding reliable results, two easy to synthesize inorganic electrodes that are elaborately described in previous studies have been selected and tested as reference electrode materials. <br/><br/>NDMe shows redox potentials that are well within the improved stability window, suggesting safe use as anode material in aqueous batteries. However, capacity fading was observed upon the first cycles, which could not be quantified. Due to the open test-cell, dissolved oxygen can easily react, and is replenished by atmospheric oxygen. A new type of test-cell that is air tight is strongly recommended. Future research may now look beyond the limitations of the traditional narrow aqueous stability window, by identifying and testing aqueous battery chemistries that approach 3.0 V full cell potentials. <br","DFT calculations; Organic anode material; aqueous sodium-ion; batteries; increased stability window; improved electrolytes","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","51.990800, 4.381264"

After injection into subsurface formation, the carbon dioxide plume can migrate several kilometres until it is fully trapped. Four major mechanisms play an important role in trapping which include structural trapping, residual trapping, dissolution trapping or mineralization. The accurate numerical simulation of the sequestration process is challenging owing to the complexity of buoyancy driven enhanced dissolution and convective propagation of the CO2 plume. To resolve these processes, one often needs an extremely fine computational grid which makes the CPU time prohibitive for modelling at reservoir scale. Several simplified models were proposed which include analytical models (Hesse, 2008; Gasda et al., 2012), vertical equilibrium models (Gasda et al., 2012; (Pruess &amp; Nordbotten, 2011) and an algebraic multi-scale model (Hesse, 2008). Here we proposed and applied the multi-scale models with dissolution for modelling of CO2 sequestration on the large-scale. Several numerical experiments are considered using adjusted small-scale simulation of the plume dynamic in a sloped aquifer. The enhanced rate of dissolution captured in the small-scale models with geometrical properties was then applied to the simulation in the realistic aquifer. A sink term applied at the CO2-brine-interface is implemented in the ADGPRS program. This term numerically acts as the dissolution mass transfer that would otherwise occur in a compositional simulation at fine resolution. It is important to contemplate the slow reduction in dissolution rate after the fingers begin to interact with the bottom of the reservoir. After interaction becomes significant, a reduction in the local dissolution rate is considered. We compared our multi-scale approach with a high-fidelity compositional simulation at high resolution, similar to the results presented in (Elenius, Voskov &amp; Tchelepi, 2015). The applicability of the proposed approach was validated on the numerical model of a realistic aquifer.","CO2-sequestration; CO2-storage; multi-scale approach; saline aquifer","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In order to improve workplace safety in such operations, it is important to select the right explosives and technologies, to issue rules and procedures and to offer adequate training and ensure awareness of hazardous situations. Because multinational mining companies work under different jurisdictions, they have to comply with different rules with different regulators. New Boliden is a Sweden-based mining and metals company, involved in both the extraction, refining and recycling of primarily base metals, with mining operations in Sweden, Finland and Ireland. Given that their aim is to have no Lost Time Injuries (LTI’s) at any operation within the company and that there are prospects of further international expansion and technological developments, it is important to develop working practices that both comply with various legal requirements, are practically usable and lead to a very safe working environment. The aim of the research is therefore to identify applicable legal requirements, technologies and working methods, in order to see if different working practices are compliant with these legal requirements, and whether these different requirements and practices can help to meet both the requirements of different regulators and Boliden’s own mission objectives. This research has identified the legal requirements applying to mining operations in Sweden, Finland and Ireland, and compared working practices in several mines, operated by Boliden Mineral AB in these countries. With a comparable number of relevant legal sources, the legal structure on explosives safety requirements is generally similar. However, Nordic legislation generally puts more generic responsibilities on the employer, whereas Irish regulations are more specific. Blasting requirements in Finland and Sweden are mostly similar and apply to underground and surface mining operations and civil engineering, whereas Irish legislation is tailored specifically to underground mining operations. Significant differences can be seen when comparing explosives handling, in particular explosives storage, Ireland has a very different approach in this respect, which may be helpful in improving safety performance in Nordic mines as well. The main technologies influencing the explosives handling and blasting safety performance are considered to be the initiation systems used, the reliability of explosives and successful implementation of a digital track&amp;trace system. No events leading to human injury have occurred following the utilisation of explosive materials in Boliden Mines in the past ten years. To get a good impression of problematic issues, using both Boliden and international data, it was found that the main types of explosives- and blasting related incidents are misfires, flyrock, toxic fumes and early detonation. Fault Tree Analysis, adapted forms of reliability modelling and the bow-tie method have been used to identify critical parts of the explosives handling and blasting process, based on available statistical data. For more critical cases, root causes of these failures have been identified. Critical activities are these surrounding evacuation of the blasting area, material failures and explosives materials being unguarded. Most incidents appear to be caused by failures in communication between different departments and insufficient awareness of existing safety procedures. Considering that there is overlap between the various operations in terms of legal requirements and practices, especially requirements with a European background, explosive materials used and operational- level working methods, it is judged to be useful to more closely align these practices, since learning from each other’s practices might improve safety levels. Also, alignment of track&amp;trace systems, and the adoption of electronic initiation systems seem to be beneficial in this regard. It is deemed less useful to align more typically national requirements and practices, such as permitting and licensing procedures. In order to be able to exchange best practices, company-wide safety guidelines and reporting based on a clear distinction of responsibilities per activity are recommended. The main conclusion therefore is that alignment of existing safety practices and technology use is achievable given the various legal and operational constraints and is expected to ensure a zero-LTI explosives handling and blasting safety performance.","Mine Safety; Health and Safety Law; Blasting; Hard Rock Mining; European Legislation; Explosives; Explosives Safety; Risk Engineering; Labour Law; Metal Mining","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The project was done in collaboration with the Reinier de Graaf Gasthuis. The implantation of a total knee replacement (TKR) is one of the most successful operations in the field of orthopedic surgery. Unfortunately, in 0.6-2.5% of the cases a periprosthetic fracture occurs. Rorabeck type III fractures are located just above the femoral component of a TKR. Due to the bone tissue and the size of the bone it is difficult to get a good grip and make a solid fixation with current fixation techniques. The graduation assignment is stated as follows:‘’Design a new fixation technique that bridges the femoral component of the total knee replacement and the healthy bone above the fracture and enable a solid fixation’’To do so, the project involves current product analysis, product design, prototyping and validating the final design. <br/><br/>During the analysis phase a list of requirements and demands was created. Combined with the design vision, these are used to generate ideas. From the ideas, three design directions were defined: the smooth surface, clamp cavity and expansion clamp. For each direction the advantages, limitations and unique values were determined. The expansion clamp was expected to be the most promising design direction. It makes use of a fixation device between the longitudinal surfaces by using an expansion clamp. After a second ideation session the most promising concepts have been chosen and presented. To compare the and evaluate the concepts, a Harris profile was created. By analyzing the Harris profile there was chosen to elaborate upon the mechanical expander. <br/><br/>By turning, pushing or screwing a mechanism is activated, panels on the side will spread and put pressure on the implant. There was chosen to use a leaf spring to enable the axpansion. Multiple iteration steps were made to come up with the most ideal design. The features, dimensions, materials and production processes were determined for all parts of the expander. An additional locking plate is designed to fit the expander and bridge the component to the healthy femur above. <br/><br/>In the last chapter, the final design and its main features are presented. Validation is done by talking to an expert, dr. Verburg, and reflecting on the demands, wishes and design vision that were stated after the analysis. In conclusion, it is likely that the expander with the additional locking plate will provide a more solid fixation of a periprosthetic fracture by integrating the femoral component of a TKR. However, it should be mentioned the design has not been validated and tested on its functionality. The expander can be seen as an addition to the currently used LISS plates. Current designs of locking plates can easily be adjusted to fit the expander. Therefore, it is likely that the product will be accepted by the market. Several recommendations have been defined for further development of the fixation technique based on the validation and risk analysis of the final design.","Periprosthetic Fractures; Total Knee Replacement; Medesign; Healthcare; Distal femur; Reinier de Graaf Gasthuis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

(graduation committee); van Dalen, Karel (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2017","As climate change seems to become more and more of a serious issue, a sudden surge of interest in clean and renewable energy sources is inevitable. Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC), or the process of harnessing energy from the temperature difference between the warm upper ocean layer and the cold bottom ocean layer, is one of these renewable energy production methods. In order to pump up this cold water, a large diameter pipe of a length in the order of 1000 m is deployed. A pipe of such large properties will indubitably suffer from problems related to production, installation and drag forces. Up till now these problems have all largely been evaluated. One phenomenon that has been explored less frequently is VIV in OTEC, and this is therefore the main scope of this research.<br/>Vortex-induced vibrations (VIV) are the vibrations that occur when a current flows past a cylinder, shedding vortices at higher Reynolds numbers, leading to an asymmetrical pressure distribution. For this research, the pipe is modelled as a slender Euler-Bernoulli beam conveying fluid, with gravity and ambient flow considered. The model is discretised and rewritten into state-space representation, in order to make it suitable for Python’s odeint ordinary differential equation-solver. A wake oscillator model is introduced to model the VIV phenomenon, and the complete model is used to evaluate multiple scenarios to evaluate the influence of variables as pipe diameter, ballast mass and current velocity.<br/>A typical cold water pipe is made of a light material as for example HDPE, has a length in the order of 1000 m and a diameter of around 2.5 m, kept under tension by a ballast mass in the order of magnitude of 350 tonnes. For this research, this typical cold water pipe is taken as a starting point and subjected to a uniform current flow of 0.4 m/s. The VIV response of the pipe is then evaluated with a range of different variables. First, the pipe is evaluated in steel, FRP and HDPE to establish which material is most suitable. HDPE shows the best fatigue resistance, and is therefore chosen as the material in which the further research will be conducted. The pipe diameter is varied between 2.0 and 6.0 m, the diameter to wall thickness ratio between 12 and 26, the effect of the magnitude of the ballast mass is evaluated and the inflow velocity is changed between 1.0 and 6.0 m/s. Finally, the current flow is varied between a uniform current of 0.1 m/s and 0.8 m/s and a location specific sheared current profile is applied, in order to check whether VIV in the OTEC cold water pipe might occur in a realistic setting.<br/>Depending on the chosen variables, in general the pipe will experience a maximum cross-flow displacement per diameter ranging between 0.6 and 1.0. Furthermore, for each set of variables the pipe will vibrate in a different normal mode, which might lead to the fact that a pipe with less maximum displacement will still experience more fatigue damage. Pipes in larger diameters will definitely suffer from a higher fatigue, however the maximum experienced damage per year was in the order of 10-15, meaning that this is insignificant. The wall thickness will not have a lot of effect. The ballast mass however, can better be chosen high since it prevents vibrations at a high mode and it seems that HDPE is strong enough in terms of yield strength to survive a large mass. Finally, when the pipe is subdued to high currents, it seems as if in-line displacement will become a larger problem then VIV, as the in-line bending reaches dangerously high levels when subjected to a current of 0.8 m/s. It has to be noted however that certain measures can be taken against this displacement.<br/>It is very likely that VIV occurs in a cold water pipe of an OTEC plant as it is subjected to certain current flows, but in the case HDPE is used, this does not seem a large concern.","OTEC; VIV; numerical analysis; wake oscillator model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

Depending on the surface location, the subsidence model of the NAM can under or over predict the amount of subsidence by 4 to 5 cm. This is around 15 % of the current maximum subsidence of 30 cm. The underlying assumption of the NAM subsidence model is that the reservoir, and the overburden above it, behave the same and thus have the same elastic parameters. The purpose of this research is to obtain a better understanding of the role overburden heterogeneities play in man induced subsidence. The main research question is: To what extent do overburden heterogeneities affect subsidence caused by reservoir depletion? Followed by the hypothesis: The heterogeneities of the overburden affect subsidence and should therefore be incorporated.<br/>The results show that modelling the overburden as multi-layered, rather than as one homogeneous layer, leads to a difference of 0.75 cm. This is greater than the measurement error of the InSAR data, which is used to determine the subsidence of the Groningen field, and is significant when compared to the current discrepancy of 4 to 5 cm. Elastic parameters have been calculated from acoustic well data for geological units around the Groningen area. The calculated values differ from the values used by the NAM. When the calculated values are used for the Upper North Sea and Lower North Sea groups, the difference with the reference model is up to 2 cm for a reservoir radius of 3 km and 0.87 cm for a Groningen scale reservoir. The results suggest that the heterogeneities of the overburden affect subsidence significantly enough to warrant further investigation. Due to the fact that the obtained results are for horizontal layers, there is much potential for more complex overburden geology e.g. salt structures and non-horizontal layers.","Subsidence; Overburden; Plaxis; Elastic Parameters","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2017","br/>Scientific investigation of paintings has been facilitated by the development of advanced non-de\-struc\-tive imaging methods. Characterization of painting stratigraphy traditionally requires extraction of small paint samples, thereby limiting its use to a few locations on a painting due to its destructive nature. Alternatively, non-destructive analysis of paint layer stratigraphy and structure across an entire painting often requires highly specialized and costly equipment, and/or the transport of priceless artworks. In addition, most methods are also typically limited to a localized point analysis. <br/><br/>This document proposes an alternative method for the substructure examination of paintings using a mobile macro-XRF spectrometer and a stereographic approach with reduced step sizes. This is coupled with a novel data analysis method which will enable a global study of the topographical features of hidden paint layers. As a prototype to test the feasibility of the method, we utilized a two-layer test sample consisting of pastose bone black pigment on pastose lead white, with an aluminum substrate. High resolution 3D optical microscopy was utilized to establish a ground truth for the thicknesses of both paint layers. <br/><br/>Through successful registration of MA-XRF scans obtained with varying detector geometries into a single hyrbid image, we were able to find a strong correlation between the quanitative height data obtained with optical microscopy and our hybrid XRF image. Our findings indicate that utilizing this approach for visualizing hidden paint layer topographies proves to be very promising. Coupled with novel data fusion algorithms and visualization techniques, additional insight about painterly technique can thus be gained by utilizing existing MA-XRF scanners to scan a painting in multiple orientations.","XRF; hidden paint layers; paintings","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Materials Science and Engineering","",""

(mentor); Lousberg, Louis (mentor); Ineke, E (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2017","Rijkswaterstaat (RWS) is responsible for the design, construction, management, and maintenance of the central infrastructure facilities in the Netherlands. To improve project management, RWS developed a management methodology called Integral Project Management (IPM). At the basis of the IPM model are seven construction processes which are present in a project and the management methodology Projectmatig Werken (PMW). The IPM model ensures that both the seven processes and the PMW are used in practice by prescribing a structure in which five roles work together to form a team. With a clear distribution of tasks, the IPM model creates a structured, open discussion format among the five functions in a project. The dialogue ensures that all aspects of the project are taken into account before a decision is made.<br/><br/>Decentral governmental organizations copy the IPM model as a management structure for their construction projects. One of the agencies is the Ingenieursbureau (IB) of Amsterdam. RWS projects are larger regarding scope, budget, complexity and use of manpower, whereas the IB executes besides larger also smaller, less complex projects. The use of the same project methodology on different types of projects raises the question how the model is used in practice. The current study investigates the use and possible adjustments of the IPM model for IB projects by answering the following research question:<br/><br/>Which adjustments should be made to the IPM model to make it suitable for projects of the host organization?<br/><br/>To answer the main question four sub-questions are formulated:<br/>• What is the current status of the IPM model in the host organization?<br/>• What is the current practice of applying the IPM model in the host organization?<br/>• Are adjustments needed to the IPM model for the projects of the host organization?<br/>• Which adjustments may be made to the IPM model?<br/><br/>In the IB organization, it is not clear what the current status of the IPM model is. The model is being introduced as an optional management method, and project managers are free, but not obliged, to use it. A team has been appointed to bring the IPM model further into the organization, but this faces difficulties in adjusting the model to the needs of the organization. The IB does not have an overview of the finished and ongoing projects, because there is no project portfolio management. The lack of portfolio management makes it hard to assess the performance of the projects and the way they are managed. The larger, more complex IB projects use the IPM model, but when projects become smaller and less complex, the IPM model is not always used.<br/>This report contains a multi-case analysis in which 8 IB projects are studied. The study shows that the IPM model is applied in different ways among the cases. The 8 cases are managed in the following way:<br/>• Case 1 used the IPM model in the overarching team but not in the project team.<br/>• Case 2 a full IPM team was created with five members.<br/>• Case 3 adjusted the IPM model by combining four roles on to two team members<br/>• Case 4 a full IPM team was created with five members.<br/>• Case 5 no IPM model was used.<br/>• Case 6 no IPM model was used.<br/>• Case 7 no IPM model was used.<br/>The adaptation of the IPM model to a municipal organization v<br/>• Case 8 (still on-going) uses the IPM model in an overarching team, managing several sub- projects.<br/><br/>Comparing the 8 cases in a cross-case analysis shows that in some cases the use of the IPM model affects the efficiency of less complex projects in a negative way. The “top-down” approach of distributing the tasks over the 5 IPM roles does not provide the opportunity to make practical adjustments. The teams are too large for the project, resulting in islands to form in the team. Adjusting the IPM model by combining roles does not improve efficiency. The team still had to include external resources in meetings, resulting in unnecessary discussions and affecting efficiency in a negative way. Projects which do not use the IPM model are managed with a “bottom-up” approach. In the “bottom-up” approach the project manager assesses the project and distributes the tasks among the available resources, taking their expertise into account. The IPM model should be adjusted to make it possible for a “bottom-up” approach to be applied in the smaller, less complex IB projects.<br/><br/>To adjust the IPM model from a “top-down” to a “bottom-up” approach the task division of the five working fields is removed. The basis of the IPM model, the seven processes and the management methodology Projectmatig Werken (PMW), is still used. The projects are assessed on the seven process and tasks are formulated by the project manager. The tasks are divided among the available resources taking their expertise into account.<br/><br/>The “top-down” and “bottom-up” approach can be combined in an overarching IPM team that is executing several smaller less complex projects of the IB. The sub-projects are managed overall by the “top-down” created IPM team and “bottom-up” in the sub-teams. The overarching IPM team can create cohesion among the sub-projects by assessing the total project, whereas the “bottom-up” approach provides the possibility to assess the sub-project individually and formulate project specific tasks, leaving room for adequate flexible management on site during execution.<br/><br/>Further research is recommended in three areas:<br/>• The use of the IPM model in other multi-project organizations should be further<br/>investigated. The context of the IB on the projects could have an effect on the<br/>performance that is not considered.<br/>• Man-hours spent on every project are not included into this study. Using data from the<br/>computer program TimeTell, a quantitative analysis can be performed.<br/>• There is little research on management of small projects. A study into management of small projects is recommended, especially resource management in large multi-project<br/>organizations that execute small projects.","Project management; IPM model; adaptation; Municipality; small project","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

It is evident from the investigations that the PA-12 is not a direct replacement for PEI or other similar high-performance polymers due to its performance limitations, but it does exhibit some potential owing to the cost-effectiveness of its processing requirements.

The research into the next generation reusable space vehicle demands the use of active TPS, these systems are not limited to the capabilities of the used material but depend on the active cooling mechanism. A system of cooled metallic TPS is developed at the TU Delft resulting in an increase in the maximum allowable thermal load for a given TPS temperature, this system is the enhanced radiation cooling TPS. The research question is: ""Can an active thermal protection system improve the flying characteristics and the flight performance of a re-entry vehicle?"". The first step in answering this question is to verify the process behind the active TPS. This thesis aims to design an experiment to verify this process.<br/><br/>To answer the research question two tools were developed: a flight simulator and a thermodynamic analyser. The flight simulator provides insight in the behaviour of the rocket and shows the consequences of implementing the enhanced radiation cooling TPS on the rocket. The thermodynamic analyser is used to estimate the wall temperature of the system and shows the effect of the sensitivity analysis of the design of the cooling subsystem. The enhanced radiation cooling system is designed to be mounted on the T-Minus Dart and an experiment to verify the impact of the active TPS is derived using the nominal mission of the rocket. Sensitivity analysis resulted in thin outer shell and a insulation sphere filled with the coolant. The outer shell needs to be as thin as possible in order to maximize the cooling effect. For an outer shell of 0.5 millimetres, the maximum allowable thermal load can be doubled in comparison with an non-cooled flight. If an identical thermal loading is assumed for two return vehicles, the active cooled vehicle can be designed with a nose radius of around 30 % smaller that the non-cooled vehicle. This will result in a vehicle with a higher lift-over-drag ratio, extending the return trajectory which increases the safety of the re-entry flight.<br/><br/>The validity of performing an enhanced radiation cooling experiment is shown by the use of the tools developed in this thesis. The incoming heat flux can be doubled while maintaining the same wall temperatures if the cooling system is applied. This opens the possibility of redesigning re-entry vehicles to achieve a high lift-to-drag ratio.","Active thermal protection system; Enhanced radiation cooling; 6 Degree of Freedom modelling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

It was found that the largest differences between the models occurred at the WAIS due to the strong interaction of sea level and bedrock uplift.

Due to the gas extraction in the Groningen area, undesired induced earthquakes are generated. The strongest earthquake registered to date was in 2012, 3.6 of the Richter scale. Not being designed and constructed to sustain seismic loading, masonry buildings in the area show higher vulnerability than other more recent structures. In 2013 extensive research on the seismic risk has been initiated in order to assess structure and infrastructure vulnerability to seismic events. Smeared plasticity shell element models have shown to achieve very accurate results in blind predictions of full-scale laboratory tests. However, they are computationally very demanding and hence not suitable for parametric studies and fragility curves development. Alternatively, a computationally efficient lumped plasticity model is proposed, meant to be representative of the in-plane shear and rocking behaviour of URM wall piers. The macro-element model is calibrated with quasi-static tests performed in laboratories at TU Delft and Eucentre. In addition, smeared plasticity numerical simulations are used for the calibration of the energy-based phenomenological parameter in the flag-shaped rule for rocking behaviour. A new hysteretic rule has been developed for modelling the flange effect that characterizes slender piers of the Groningen URM buildings. It provides the abstraction for a one-dimensional rate-independent flag-shaped hysteresis with asymmetric backbone. Non-linear time history analyses are performed to assess the response of wall components and to validate the approach against the smeared-plasticity model. Comparable results are achieved in terms<br/>of collapse-mechanism prediction, base shear forces, maximum drifts and energy dissipation. Finally, the macro-element is assembled in an equivalent-frame model which represents a prototype house tested quasistatically at TU Delft. The blind prediction displacement-controlled test shows a 20%capacity overestimation from the lumped plasticity model, proving the necessity of parametric studies for the capacity estimation improvements. NLTH analyses lead to comparable results between the two approaches, in terms of failure mechanism prediction and hysteretic behaviour. The analyses performed with the proposed approach<br/>turned out to be faster by two orders of magnitude compared to the shell element models.","URM; Non-Linear Time History; lumped plasticity; macro-element","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-12-21","","","","","",""

Simulation models support transformative processes by offering a simplified version of reality and a boundary object that unites stakeholders around a simplified representation of reality. The challenge is how to structure the transdisciplinary process of involving stakeholders in simulation modeling and distinguish between a proliferation of approaches within the fragmented field of modelling with stakeholders. <br/>This thesis designs a conceptual framework for a transformative modelling process with stakeholders based on a literature review of existing approaches and twenty-three interviews with modelers. Transformation is conceptualized as a rigorous process in which a system is shifted onto alternative development pathway in light of evolving conceptual frameworks, such as seeing the world as an interconnected system. Approaches to modeling with stakeholders are transformative if the main interest is in stakeholder empowerment, giving the stakeholder control over goal setting and model use. Amongst the fragmented approaches, four distinct forms of transformative modelling can be identified: Group Model Building, Companion Modeling, Challenge-and-Reconstruct Learning, and generic environmental modeling. <br/>The categorization of existing approaches and their essential differences allows for the systematic development and comparison of transformative approaches over time. The development of the approaches occurs within an ideal-typical framework made up of iterative cycles of roughly three phases. First the modeling effort should be frontloaded with framing efforts to become critically aware of practices influences thought, but build a core team or nucleus of friends that see an urgency to collaborate with others on common problems. Elements of ongoing meaningful conversations that engage a growing number of stakeholders in model building should be documented to identify sustainable sources of stakeholder motivation and leads to joint action to address wicked problems. In the second phase, the team is accompanied by experienced model builders and facilitators to build models to support the collective process. Finally, the team translates their conceptual framework into reality by taking concrete action. As transformative modeling matures, developers should collaborate through systematic learning in cycles of planning, action, and reflection across approaches and disciplines to continually improve their practice.","modeling; social design; transformation; collaboration; climate change; decision making; complex adaptive systems; Industrial Ecology; complexity; sustainability; social simulation; social learning; Innovation; participation processes; transdisciplinary","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Industrial Ecology","",""

The current state transport strategy, Strategy 1; the triple trip , Strategy 2; Direct trip from market to sorter and Strategy 3; a direct trip the market with sorted empties to the production warehouse(LCDB). A discrete event simulation model is constructed to evaluate the performance based on an experimental plan. The 4 transport strategies with each 10 input scenarios that capture potential growth, new processing times and other mix of sorted and unsorted empties returned. They are tested based on cycle time, throughput, CO2 emission, inventory utilization, handling cost and storage cost. The transport strategies show that introducing Strategy 3; direct trip from the market to the LCDB is the most beneficial for cycle time reduction and increase in throughput. Depending on the input scenario up to 3.36 weeks €2.359k of cycle time can be reduced and an increase of 4,3% in throughput is realized. Strategy 1; the triple trip reduces 165 tons of CO2 emission per year. Strategy 2; direct trip from the market to Leiter performs the best handling and storage cost reduction with respective €231k &amp; €373k savings. Inventory utilization results show a shift of inventory to other locations in the supply chain since no changes to the initial inventory levels are made when changing transport strategies. A supply chain driven by returnable packaging can be redesigned from a transport logistic perspective with a structured method called DMADE. When combining this method with a new introduced process improvement method called VSM-I a more detailed current state analysis can be performed. By introducing a new transport logistic strategy with more direct returns of RPM to the brewery the performance of the supply chain can be improved drastically.","Reverse logistics; Returnable packaging; Value stream mapping; Process improvement","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-12-15","","","","Marine Technology | Transport Engineering and Logistics","",""

It it therefore extremely important that these memories function correctly during their lifetime in order to prevent catastrophic failures. Already during the design phase, the reliability of the circuit needs to be predicted so that a reasonable lifetime expectation can be given. Although the importance of reliability analysis is clear, in literature not much research on DRAM reliability is available to designers. This thesis proposes a two phased<br/>DRAM reliability prediction model that can be used in the circuit design phase. During the first phase, the circuit performance is analyzed for different wear-out mechanisms affecting different subcomponents in the design. In the second phase, the results of the first phase are then used to determine the reliability of the circuit.<br/>In the first phase, the wear-out effects of Bias Temperature Instability (BTI) Hot Carrier Injection (HCI) and radiation trapping as well as transistor mismatch are examined. BTI is modeled using the RD-model, HCI with the lucky electron model, transistor mismatch with Pelgrom’s model. Wear-out caused by radiation<br/>trapping is modeled as Gate Induced Drain Leakage (GIDL), the data for which are derived from retention time degradation measurements of an irradiated commercial DRAM. The circuit performance is analyzed per subcomponent of the DRAM design in a range of different metrics. Furthermore, the aging effects on a<br/>dwonscaled version of the circuit are investigated.<br/>In the second phase, reliability functions are derived from the results from phase one per wear-out mechanism and per subcomponent. These reliability functions are used in an analytical reliability model which yields the overall circuit reliability.<br/>The results from the first phase show degradation of the retention time as well as degradation of sensing delay metrics. Due to the relative low duty factor of memory cells, BTI and HCI have minor impact on the memory cell circuit performance. Radiation however, renders the circuit useless once the Total Ionizing Dose (TID) becomes more than 126 krad. On other subcomponents than the memory cells, BTI and HCI shift the reference voltage which results in an increase of retention time. BTI and HCI stressing of the sense amplifier<br/>also slightly increases retention time but mainly increases sensing delay. For both reference cells and the sense amplifier it holds that higher radiation doses break down the circuit completely. The same effects hold for the downscaled circuit, although the observed effects are more severe than in the unscaled device.<br/>The system reliability prediction in the second phase shows the importance of individual reliability prediction of the subcircuits and wear-out mechanisms. Via the individual analysis, it becomes clear that the system reliability is mostly impacted by the degradation of the sense amplifier delay due to BTI and HCI. Other metric variations, like the increase in retention time caused by the reference cells, have less impact. It was found that the system reliability decreases to 0.84 after 1·10<sup>8</sup>s at a stressing temperature of 300K. <br","dram; aging analysis; Reliability Modelling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using 6-axis industrial robots with a gas metal arc welding (GMAW)-head, Dutch start-up MX3D prints metal in every direction mid-air. By welding small parts of material at a time along a laser guided - CAD-generated path, self-supporting cross-sections of very complex shapes, such as internally reinforced non-prismatic hollow sections can be manufactured fully automatically. Unlike powder-bed based manufacturing, this technology is not bounded by size limits of a final product, which creates opportunities for fabrication of large-scale structural components and finally entire structures. It is MX3D’s aim, in collaboration with key industry partners, to 3D-print world’s first fully functional bridge spanning 12 metres, to be installed in the city centre of Amsterdam in the course of 2019. The bearing elements of the bridge consist of tubular shaped elements, together building up to a complex-shaped free-form steel structure. These tubular members mainly behave as axially compressed bearing elements, nonetheless it is yet not known how the stability of WAAM-members can be assessed. Several standards for testing (and characterisation) of additively manufactured materials are published by different national and international committees, e.g. ISO/ASTM 529 and CEN-CT 438, but a comprehensive set of international standards has not been achieved yet. It is widely recognised that there is a strong link between manufacturing process parameters and material properties, which requires special attention in this research area. So far there is a lack of sufficient test results to cover a specific manufacturing process. In this research the material properties of MX3D’s dot-by-dot and continuously printed members are studied. This pioneering research provides insight in material and geometrical properties relevant for the stability of (ER)308LSi stainless steel tubular columns. A tubular column is used as existing basic structural element to assess the stability of wire and arc additively manufactured steel members. Advanced 3D-laserscanning technology is applied to characterise and analyse geometrical imperfections. A clear understanding of bending stiffness and buckling behaviour is established by performing four-point flexural bending tests and flexural buckling tests on tubular columns, diameter 33.8mm, thickness 3.7 mm. Tensile properties of milled WAAM specimens are analysed both in - and perpendicular to - their print direction for dot-by-dot and continuously printing. It is verified whether or not the structural properties are in compliance with the existing steel standard (EC3). Additional Vickers hardness measurements and metallographical analyses are performed to examine the microstructure of column samples. Finally, a buckling design graph is proposed based on own experiments, aiming towards a safe model suitable for stability calculations of additively manufactured tubular columns.<br/>It is concluded from experiments that the material properties of 3D-printed steel differ from that of conventionally produced steel. Following the thermal gradient of the weld pool, large columnar grain structures are detected giving rise to anisotropy. Stiffness, strength and ductility prove to be dependent on the print direction.<br/>Whereas the tensile strength top expected values, the obtained stiffness is significantly lower than that of commonly applied steel grades. Inaccuracies of the printing process result in local wall thickness variations and a relatively high out-of-straightness, both negatively affecting the buckling capacity of printed tubular columns.<br/>Yet it should be acknowledged that due to rapid advancements in improving the printing process, the geometrical imperfections are soon expected to reduce drastically. It is recommended to apply active cooling during manufacturing to enhance mechanical properties even further. By combining topology optimisation and WAAM, an optimal material layout can be found ánd manufactured, consequently an excellent material efficiency can be achieved. A promising prospect for future construction projects.","3D-Printed Steel; Stability; Wire and arc Additive Manufacturing; Tubular Columns","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

Oxygen and light are vital in marine ecosystems. The Dutch governmental organisation, Rijkswaterstaat (RWS), has been monitoring the water quality of the Dutch part of the North Sea for the last 35 years. A research vessel takes off to sample parameters such as chlorophyll and TSM every few weeks at fixed locations. Recently, Sentinel-3 satellites started to provide satellite-based information on air or water quality. It is expected that products from the Ocean Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) sensor, on board of Sentinel-3, can greatly improve both the geographical and temporal coverage of these parameters. For the Dutch coastal waters this is challenging, because they predominantly consist of complex coastal waters. This study focusses on the validation of water quality parameters (Chl and TSM) available from Sentinel-3A OLCI observations. To verify the processing line of the OLCI data products it was desired to evaluate the following variables as well: 1) the aerosol optical thickness used in the atmospheric aerosol correction process, which is an important step for deriving the water-leaving reflectance, and 2) the water-leaving reflectance itself used as the main signal for deriving Chl and TSM. OLCI water quality data products were compared to Rijkswaterstaat in-situ measurements for the months May until September of 2017. Furthermore, OLCI’s Chl and TSM were compared with climatologies of MERIS data. The OLCI water-leaving reflectance and aerosol optical thickness data products were compared with observations from the Belgian AERONET-OC station Thornton. To evaluate the spatial distribution of OLCI's aerosol optical thickness comparisons with nearly coincident MODIS-AQUA observations were made. To evaluate the spatial variability of OLCI's data products boxplots were created of Chl, TSM and the aerosol optical thickness. The water quality products of OLCI consist of a Chl product determined by the OC4Me algorithm and a Chl &amp; TSM product derived from a neural network. OLCI Chl obtained from the OC4Me algorithm showed an overestimation of a factor 2 compared to the in-situ measurements. The Chl results of the neural network compared well with the in-situ measurements showing a correlation coefficient of 0.77. OLCI TSM showed an unrealistic underestimation of a factor 4 compared to in-situ measurements. Boxplots showed that the largest spatial variability is found at stations &lt;50 km from the coast for the three water quality products. This unrealistic underestimation of scattering TSM would imply an underestimation of the water-leaving reflectance in all the bands. Comparing OLCI's water-leaving reflectance with AERONET's showed underestimations in the blue and green bands only. OLCI’s water-leaving reflectance of the red and near-infra-red (NIR) bands correlated well with the AERONET-OC measurements. The aerosol optical thickness data product showed unrealistic overestimations of OLCI compared to AERONET-OC, but had a correlation coefficient of 0.58 when comparing it to MODIS aerosol optical thickness product. The spatial variability of OLCI's aerosol optical thickness is very high with differences of more than 40% per kilometre. In general, all products seem to have unrealistic values around clouds and in coastal areas, especially the aerosol optical thickness product. The pixels in those regions are different from other pixels. These results imply that further research into the software implementation of the radiative transfer models, lookup tables, vicarious calibrations and Neural Networks is needed to understand how retrievals of Chl and TSM concentrations are influenced. Such a fundamental understanding is ultimately also of interest for end users and all parties providing products and services for marine applications.","Water quality; Satellite; OLCI; Sentinel-3; Validation; Atmosphere; Remote Sensing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the tested range according to RSM analyses, the optimum weld condition was 261 A (Current), 29 V (Volts) and 0.59 m/min S (Travel Speed) with preheating at 200°C. However, this condition was found to be unsuitable for AM due to its low deposition speed, non - uniform building surface morphology and inter-run porosities when overlapping welds were deposited.

The optimum condition for the input parameters were identified to be 200 A (Current), 18.5 V (Volts) and 1.00 m/min S (Travel Speed).

The water authorities, which own the land of the flood defence, will only permit the turbines if the flood protection assessment satisfies the safety standard after the wind turbines have been constructed. There are three types of failure of a wind turbine: falling over of the turbine, nacelle falling off the tower and blades falling of the rotor. The first two, with their relation to the flood defence, are analyzed in this report. An assessment is made, in which the additional failure probability of the flood defence is determined. The main white spots in the flood protection assessments are: First, the assessment method of wind turbines near flood defences is a gray area, which leaves room for interpretation. Secondly, the effects of the constant vibrations of wind turbines are unknown, this is currently being researched. Thirdly, the size and depth of the crater which develops after an impact of a nacelle hitting the flood defence. This third white spot is researched in this report. The Material Point Method turns out to be a good method to determine the size and depth of a crater. The nacelle of the Enercon E-126 turbine can cause at maximum a penetration depth of 3.8 meters on a dry sea dike consisting of sand. There are two impact locations on the dike which can be distinguished: an impact on the crest and an impact on the slope. If the impact is on the crest, both the crest is and large parts of both slopes are affected. The soil below the slopes is lifted up, this causes the revetment to lose its coherence. An impact on the slope will mainly affect the slope and the crest is only limited affected. However, the size and depth of the crater depend largely on the soil characteristics and the potential energy of the nacelle. Those are taken conservative in the model. So, the penetration depth of 3.8 meters is the maximum. The Expertise Network for Flood Protection gave requirements for wind turbines near flood defences. The case study is again an Enercon E-126 turbine built directly at the inner side of a sea dike in Groningen. Overtopping &amp; overflow, inner slope-instability and instability of the revetment are considered as the governing failure mechanisms for the additional failure probability. When using only conservative assumptions, the flood protection requirements are not satisfied. However, with using more realistic assumptions, the additional failure probability can be determined more precise and therefore be lowered. In the end, the wind turbine can be moved further inland to lower the hitting probability of the flood defence, this will decrease the additional failure probability.","Wind Turbine; Nacelle; Flood Defence; Dike; Flood Protection; Material Point Method; MPM; Impact crater; Crater","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2017","The static stability of stones on mild slopes under wave attack is investigated in this research. The first part of the research is focused on reproducing the physical scale model tests regarding profile change of Kramer (2016) numerically with the model XBeach-G. The erosion profiles modelled with the bed-load transport formulas of Nielsen (2006) and Van Rijn (2007) in XBeach-G do not match the erosion profiles of the profile change experiments of Kramer (2016). The bed-load transport formulas of Nielsen (2006) and Van Rijn (2007) are not able to model the sediment transport in XBeach-G accurately. Furthermore, XBeach-G cannot determine the velocity and acceleration near the bed, because the model solves the flow due to currents and waves for a single layer. Therefore, it can be concluded that XBeach-G should not be used to describe static stability of stones on mild slopes under wave attack. For the application of dynamically stable structures (which is not investigated in this research), XBeach-G functions satisfactorily (Postma, 2016). For further research, a model that solves the hydrodynamics for multiple layers should be applied. In this way, the hydrodynamics near the bed can be used to describe the static stability of stones. <br/><br/>The aim of the second part of the research is to develop a design method that describes the static stability of stones on mild slopes under wave attack. The basis of this design method is the initiation of motion of a stone and the hydrodynamic forces that initiate this movement. The hydrodynamic forces and corresponding mobility parameters are determined with the velocity and the acceleration near the bottom. Using Bubble Image Velocimetry (BIV), the velocity and the acceleration are derived from the videos of the BIV experiments of Kramer (2016) with regular waves breaking on a slope. It is found from the results of the BIV analysis that the effective, adapted Shields parameter θ’McCall can be used to describe movements of stones on mild slopes under wave attack. This mobility parameter has been determined with the bed shear stress of McCall (2015), which added an inertia term to include the influence of accelerations. For initiation of motion of stones, it appears that the stability parameter θcr could be a value of 0.024 (in case no slope correction factor has been applied). To substantiate a design method that describes the static stability of stones on mild slopes under wave attack, the value of 0.024 could be used to define a threshold for initiation of motion of stones. More experiments need to be executed to optimize this value of the stability parameter. Moreover, a statistical value for the stability parameter could be used (like θcr,1%) to describe the static stability of stones by means of a certain number of stones that are allowed to move for a certain number of waves.","stability of stones; initiation of motion; Shields parameter; mild slopes; design method; erosion profiles; BIV analysis; XBeach-G; McCall (2015); Van der Meer (1988); Nielsen (2006); Van Rijn (2007)","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-12-20","","","","","",""

A new metro station (called “Europaplein”) will be positioned underneath the square in front of the venue (also named “Europaplein”) and will have two exits on the square. RAI Amsterdam needs to address some major challenges since 1) the RAI venue is very complex and it can be a challenge for visitors to find the right entrance, 2) one of the exits is situated on a very busy part of the Europaplein square with many ongoing activities, which can be dangerous for pedestrian streams and 3) there will be a large increase of pedestrians on the square once the metro station is in use. <br/><br/>The aim of this thesis is to design a dynamic wayfinding and guidance system for large open squares that is applicable for Europaplein in its function as central entrance area for RAI. The design should guide the visitors of RAI safely and efficiently to their destination in three scenarios: 1) When the Europaplein square is empty (no activities/obstacles), 2) When a large pavilion is situated on the square and 3) When the square is used as a buffer for trucks to load and unload materials. <br/><br/>Based on a wayfinding literature review, best practice case studies and the needs of event visitors of RAI Amsterdam, it became apparent that the ideal design of the dynamic wayfinding and guidance system will contain a mix of two principles: the Landmark principle and the Path principle. Two concepts have derived from the design vision and have been quantitatively and qualitatively researched, to find out which principle should be more dominant in the wayfinding experience. This is done by visualizing the different scenarios in 360 degrees videos for participants and asking them afterwards to answer questions about the concepts. The questions are based on the four walkability criteria: There should be a good reason to walk, the walk should be and feel safe, the walk should feel comfortable and the walk should be interesting. <br/><br/>It was found that both the Landmark principle and the Path principle are needed. The Landmark principle should be more dominant, since it is more familiar with the visitors who are consciously looking for directions. However, the support of the Path principle is needed to increase the awareness of the difference in purposes of the path and areas, and thus the different type of users on the shared space. Although interactive visuals are a good way to gain attention, too much interactive visuals can result in repulsion in stead of attraction.","Wayfinding; Virtual Reality; Signage","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","Strategic Product Design","","52.3412945,4.8905636"

The data in graphs are also referred as graph signals. Graph signal processing (GSP) can then be applied which basically extends classical signal processing to solve problems. Anomaly detection is an example of such a problem. Two hypothetical situations are given, and a detector has to be designed to distinguish between these. Under the null hypothesis, graph structures are considered to be untouched. Under the alternative hypothesis, (unknown) topological changes might have occurred. Now by incorporating a priori knowledge about the graphs, the decision making process should improve.<br/>In most works, a priori knowledge of the graphs under the null and alternative hypothesis was incorpo- rated. This means that detectors were designed which were able to anticipate on possible topological changes. In this thesis, the problem is considered where only a priori knowledge of the graph under the null hypothesis is exploited. This means that detectors are not able to anticipate on potential changes and this where blind detection comes into play. Blind detection is important because it considers a more realistic scenario. In this work, the blind topology change detector (BTCD) and the constrained blind topology change detector (CTCD) are derived which exploit different properties of the data re- lated to the known graph structure. For the BTCD, the bandlimitedness of graph signals was exploited and for the CTCD, the graph signal smoothness. The main question in this work, was to find out what the potentials are with the blind detection principle for graph change detection.<br/><br/>Different test scenarios are used to evaluate the detectors on both synthetic and real data. For the BTCD, the obtained results compare well when information about the alternative graph is available. For this detector, the potential of blind detection was highly visible. For bandlimited graph signals, the BTCD as good as detectors using full information. For the CTCD, comparable results (with detectors using full information) are attained for just a few test scenarios. For small changes, the graph signal smoothness seems to be less powerful as to the graph signal bandlimitedness.<br/><br/>This study showed that graph change detection is still possible without having full information. Some graph signal properties are more powerful w.r.t. others.","graph theory; Detection; Graphs; anomaly detection; blind","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Signals and Systems","",""

However for this to happen, new disruptive technologies with high efficiency and low cost are needed in the market. One possibility comes from multijunction thin film solar cells based on a-Si alloys and nc-Si. For this purpose a–SiO<sub>x</sub>:H is an interesting material since it can have V<sub>OC</sub> values above 1 V and FF above 0.7. However when paired in a tandem structure with a material of an advantageous bandgap, like nc-Si:H. The performance of the tandem solar is limited in output current by the a–SiO<sub>x</sub>:H layer.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Research to increase J<sub>SC</sub> by increasing thickness of the absorber layer show it is not practical to increase the thickness of i-a–SiO<sub>x</sub>:H above 250 nm. Spillover knowledge from other thin film solar cells (GaAs, a-SiGe<sub>x</sub> and CIGS), showed bandgap grading was able to increase performance of the electrical parameters. Grading in a solar cell means that in one of the layers a material property is varied continuously in concentration in order to achieve a different performance.<br/><br/>Our aim was to experiment with bandgap grading in the absorber layer of a–SiO<sub>x</sub>:H solar cells, to try to achieve a higher J<sub>SC</sub> while still retaining the high V<sub>OC</sub> x FF product. Test layers were deposited at different CO<sub>2</sub>/SiH<sub>4 </sub>ratios to determine the dependence of the bandgap (E<sub>04</sub>) and the deposition rate on the CO<sub>2</sub>/SiH<sub>4</sub> ratio. With the experimental data and fitted polynomial equations a method was devised to vary continuously the bandgap in a step wise manner. Using this grading method, experiments were designed where the intrinsic a–SiO<sub>x</sub>:H layer of a total length of 200 nm was subdivided in 3 graded bandgap regions. The first graded region named p-i started from the end of the p-layer with a high bandgap (2.1 eV). Decreasing the bandgap over a certain length until reaching a region with no added oxygen with a low bandgap (1.96 eV.) From here the central i region started, maintaining a constant bandgap for a certain length until the bandgap starts increasing again. This marks the 3rd region called i-n, where the bandgap continues to increase over a certain width until reaching 2.1 eV at the beginning of the n-layer. <br/><br/> <br/><br/>Graded experimental cells results showed that it was beneficial to have a small graded region width in the p-i and i-n region (10-30 nm). Since with this grading length J<sub>SC</sub> could be increased significantly (8% increase) from reference cell values without grading performed. However a small compromise in a drop of V<sub>OC</sub> and FF values around (1-2%) was observed at the same time from reference cell values. The gains in J<sub>SC</sub> are bigger than the loss of V<sub>OC</sub> x FF product and result in a relative efficiency gain of (4-5%) from reference cell. This technique paired with other cutting edge techniques to increase photocurrent can lead to a new record for an a–SiO<sub>x</sub>:H thin film solar cell. Or it can lead to better current matching in tandem or triple junction solar cells.","Solar cell; amorphous; Thin film; silicon oxide; bandgap; Grading; Profiling; Optimization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

Due to the large degree of uncertainty concerning mixed sediment morphodynamics, river authorities conduct field studies to collect data that will help in the calibration of morphological models, eventually used to design effective mitigation measures. <br/><br/>In the present study, we analyse measured data from two field experiments in the Rhine river, that monitored the fate of the mixed-size nourished sediment. In the first study case, we analyse data from a 5 year monitoring campaign at the reach below the most downstream weir in the Rhine river. The sieving analyses of the soil samples collected from the bed of the study reach, reveal the concentrations of various tracer granite fractions at several vertical layers, lateral positions and cross sections along the streamwise direction. Second, we studied the early development of the nourishment pilot study initiated in 2016 at Lobith, a reach situated further downstream in the Rhine river. In spite of the early stage of the nourishment, due to intensive monitoring of the pilot, data are collected in dense time intervals by means of bed surveys, radioactivity measurements for the detection of tracer sediment as well as soil samples, revealing the initial morphodynamic trends in the study reach. <br/><br/>In both study cases we predominantly focus on the migration of nourished sediment in all directions and the main physical processes that regulate the feedback between flow and mixed sediment morphodynamics. We conclude that nourished sediment disperses along the streamwise direction, gets mixed into larger depths as it migrates downstream, but also follows certain paths along the mitigated meandering reaches. We found that especially vertical mixing of nourished sediment is a major control on its streamwise migration. Regarding certain of these aspects, the various grain size fractions of the nourished sediment were seen to behave differently. For example ner fractions <br/>migrated downstream faster, but were also mixed in larger depths below Iffezheim. In the present study we assess the in influence of temporal and spatial flow variability, but also the inuence of small and large scale processes which are relevant in mixed sediment morphodynamics. The feedback between <br/>ow and mixed sediment morphodynamics is key in explaining the main physical processes controlling the fate of nourished sediment, yet more work needs to be done to assess which are the dominant small and large scale physical mechanisms when mixed-size sediment feeding in lowland rivers is considered. <br","sediment nourishments; Rhine river; mixed-sediment morphodynamics; data analysis; longitudinal dispersion; vertical mixing; trajectory of nourished sediment; tracer; coarsening; Iffezheim tracer experiment; Bovenrijn pilot study","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

To this aim, scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive spectroscopy and X-ray nano-tomography were used. Additionally, the effect of local plastic deformation, followed by ageing processes, on the surface precipitation in these alloys has been studied by means of scanning electron microscopy, together with energy-dispersive spectroscopy. Finally, a diffusion-based finite element analysis has been performed to study cavity filling for different combination of diffusion mechanisms. From scanning electron micrographs it can be confirmed, that Fe-W alloys show damage-selective precipitation of the Laves phase (Fe2W). Furthermore, the filling ratios of individual cavities are determined and it is found, that the autonomous healing strongly depends on the duration of the loading at of elevated temperature. From the quantitative analysis of the size and shape of the precipitates and cavities it is found, that the orientation of grain boundaries to the stress direction has an influence on the morphology of the induced-cavities, as well as, the filling ratio. The grain-boundary cavities orientated favourably for the cavity growth show low filling ratios, due to the fact, that their propagation proceeds with a higher rate than the solute transport. The critical volume of a cavity, that can be fully filled with solute atoms, is found to be of the order of 10 μm3, while the average filling ratio for Fe-W alloys is found to be around 50% for the sample loaded to 100% of its lifetime. Moreover, the scanning electron micrographs of the indentation-deformed samples subjected to ageing revealed surface precipitates (Fe2W), which existence has to be further researched. The hardness measurements of Fe-W samples showed that after 200 hours of ageing at 580oC, the strength of the alloy is only reduced if the material has been pre-strained, but it remains constant for the solution heat treated specimens. This result shows, that the process of dislocation recovery dominates over work-hardening only in the case of a high dislocation density. Finally, the finite element analysis revealed, that during the diffusive cavity filling of an equilibrium-shaped void, three different diffusion profile regimes are plausible. Namely, a diffusive filling dominated by volume diffusion, which occurs for a relatively small spacing between neighbouring cavities and is independent of the ratio of bulk and grain-boundary diffusion. Secondly, a diffusive filling governed by volume diffusion with contributing grain-boundary diffusion, which occurs for relatively low ratios of bulk and grain-boundary diffusion. And ultimately, a diffusive filling governed by grain-boundary diffusion, which occurs for relatively high ratios of bulk and grain-boundary diffusion.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

As a result, new aerodynamic modeling techniques are required to model complex non-linear behavior of the aircraft flight envelope. In 2005, the Multivariate Simplex B-Splines method was developed. MSBS are a true general function approximator and are easily integrated in standard identification routines. Their downside is that the basis functions and B-coefficients, forming the B-net, do not have a straightforward physical interpretation. Also creating the triangulation is not a trivial process. Parts of the triangulation domain can require higher approximation power and continuity. The consequence is an overall dense triangulation and high order basis functions. This introduces problems such as over fitting the model and divergent behavior on triangulation boundaries. Physical-Splines make use of a linear transformation that transforms from the barycentric coordinate space to the Cartesian coordinate space, giving the MSBS a physical interpretation. The physical transformation is introduced to the optimization process in the form of equality and inequality constraints. This way a-priori aerodynamic information can form a bound on the stability derivatives. Promising results show that they are robust, prevent over-fitting, prevent propagation of erroneous data, remove divergent behavior on triangulation boundaries, and that they can be used for extrapolation of sparse datasets. Also a stepwise orthonormalization can create physical model structure constraints and set unimportant physical model terms to zero. Overall, the physical constraints make it possible to adjust model approximation power locally and alter the B-net via the physical parameters without breaking them.","Multivariate Splines; Physical Transformation; Physical-Splines; Multinomial Polynomials; System Identification; Aerodynamic Model Identification; Parameter Estimation; Flight Testing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-12-20","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

If insurers lower their premiums without having a model that accurately quantifies the expected claim size, they can be in serious trouble. This research aims to accurately model the premiums and quantify the uncertainty involved using historic claims data from an insurer. The current approach, Generalized Linear Models (GLMs), is compared to some Machine Learning techniques: Random Forests (RFs) and Gradient Boosting Machines (GBMs). Insights gained from these models and other methods (MARS) are then used to improve the GLMs. Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART) and Hierarchical Models (HMs) are then used to quantify the uncertainty. HMs provides the insurer with the means to make proper credible intervals for the total expected claim size of the active portfolio. The HMs also allow the use of risk premium principles that include measures of uncertainty in the pricing of premiums. All relevant models are applied on the dataset of the holdout year. It is apparent that the GLMs and HMs provide too low estimations of the premiums when the profit is tracked. It is therefore prudent to either use the HM with a risk premium principle that incorporates a percentage of the standard deviation in the estimation of the premiums or apply the RF model. The model lift shows that the Machine Learning techniques are better at recognising the risky policies from the non-risky. We recommend the insurer to use RFs to price the premiums and HMs to measure the uncertainty of the active portfolio. It is recommended for further study to either apply other techniques to further improve the predictive performance, to improve the structure of the Hierarchical Model or to include left truncation and right censoring into the model.","non-life insurance; number of claims; claim severity; risk premiums; Machine learning techniques; predictive models; uncertainty quantification; Generalized Linear Models; Random Forests; Gradient Boosting Machines; Hierarchical Modeling; MCMC; Bayesian Additive Regression Trees; Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines; Generalized Additive Models","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-12-20","","","","Applied Mathematics","",""

Understanding the physics and dynamics of glaciers is important in local and global climate predictions and predictions of fresh water supplies. The Himalayas are the biggest storage of fresh water outside the polar regions with many different local climates and glaciers. One important glacier parameter used in dynamic studies is the flow velocity, as the flow velocity is used as a boundary condition in mass balance and run-off models. The flow velocity of a glacier is relatively easy to measure on a large scale using satellite missions and the increased coverage of satellite missions provides the means to large scale velocity monitoring. Robust methods for measuring large scale seasonal and long term velocity dynamics of glaciers, however, remain an elusive goal.<br/><br/>The optical Landsat mission has a long history of monitoring and is thus useful for long term flow velocity analysis. Feature tracking algorithms applied on these Landsat images provide means of automatically calculating large scale velocities. Automated approaches for large scale analysis are difficult because of the lack of validation and good filtering techniques to deal with shadows, surface changes and clouds. Large scale temporal analysis is even harder because the errors arising in the flow velocity calculations are often large compared to the velocities due to the short periods between the images from which the velocities are calculated.<br/><br/>This research proposes, implements and tests a new method for automatically creating large scale velocity time series using the optical Landsat database and feature tracking in the Himalayas. Where normally velocity time series consists of consecutive single velocity fields, the novel method uses combinations of velocities to estimate these single velocities. This method is tested against results from single velocity fields for the Everest region and the Karakoram region. A sensitivity and parameter analysis provides the best parameter settings for the new method.<br/><br/>The result is a novel method that provides validation, robustness and acts as a filter for erroneous velocities. When possible, the new method increases or retains the number of results while increasing the precision. Furthermore, when the number of results is lower, it is due to filtering of erroneous velocities. The new method also provides an error indication which could be of use in future research. The main sources of errors: geo-location and precision of the feature tracking algorithm, are shown to have a large effect on the results and should be as small as possible. The magnitude of these errors make it difficult to measure seasonal changes in flow velocity for slow moving glaciers. Furthermore, Landsat 4-5 TM results are shown not to be useful for dense time series as the geo-location accuracy and artifacts from the TM scanner have a large effect on the precision of these results. The Landsat 8 velocity results, however, show good similarity to results from other researches and show promise for future research.<br/><br/>The sensitivity analysis of this research was incomplete as the complete algorithm was not optimized and future developments might focus on improving this. Also, it was found that the proposed method was very time intensive. A correct choice for the method of calculating flow velocities might drastically decrease the computational effort and improve applicability to large area research. In total, the new method is not only useful for use on the Landsat database, but could be used to improve any optical or radar flow velocity time series.","Glacier velocity; Landsat; Flow; Time series","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","DRAGON IV.",""

The digital image correlation measurement system is based on the tracking of a collective number of pixels from the surface of the reference image to the deformed image. This summation of pixels is called subset. To achieve a reliable measurement in DIC, each of the subsets must contain sufficient speckle pixels. Therefore, there is a firm distinctive intensity pattern contained in a particular subset relative to other subsets. However, with the current DIC method, the user must rely on the intuition and experience for determining these number of speckle pixels. To investigate this problem, a study of measurement and monitoring the behaviour of crossbeam in Orthotropic Bridge due to in-plane quasi-static load is conducted. The reliability of DIC method on measuring strain and deformation in an elastic zone of a steel material is also examined and compared to the other measurement technique such as strain gauge and LVDT. Also, a finite element model is developed to estimate the strain and out-of-plane deformation at the certain location of the crossbeam.<br/>The study focuses on the specific location at the crossbeam with ‘haibach’ shape cope hole, where the strain concentration is expected to be significantly high. The applied quasi-static load is set until 250 kN, with strain gauges and LVDT are installed at the same side of the crossbeam (free edge side), and DIC is installed at the exact opposite side (inner side). Parallel with the test on the Orthotropic Deck Bridge specimen, several benchmarking test is also conducted. These tests are used to examine the problems encountered during the initial experiment.<br/>The study shows that owing to the quasi-static in-plane load, the crossbeam encounter an out-of-plane behaviour. Therefore, to achieve an accurate measurement, a 3-D DIC measurement system is obliged to use. Strain observed into two different directions: x and y-direction, gives different results in term of accuracy. Due to the low strain limit of DIC system, the result in x-direction can be considered as unreliable. For strain measurement in y-direction, some of the results exceeding the low limit strain of the equipment, give a close match result with the strain gauges, within the acceptable amount of deviation. For out-of-plane deformation, all the measurement show a good agreement between the DIC and LVDT technique. The average speckle pattern size that is used in this research is 0.2 mm, and an average area of 38 pixels2 for a particular speckle pattern.

In areas of high insolation or high wind speed, it can be considered that part of the exergy required for these purposes can be retrieved from sustainable energy sources. This idea is expected to be more important when applying enhanced oil recovery. As an example we use solvent (Dimethyl Ether - DME) enhanced water drive recovery. DME is a chemical solvent that has proven to be an efficient oil recovery agent. The recovered DME and oil are both considered products. The main invested exergy considered are the circulation costs of the fluids, separation/retrieval costs and the manufacturing costs of DME – it is assumed that DME is manufactured from natural gas using the single step direct method. <br/>To improve the insight in the production process we develop a simple model of DME enriched brine injection in a 1-D reservoir. The model shows that about 92% of the oil in place is recovered using DME, which includes about 30% incremental production after water flooding. Moreover, 100% of the DME injected is recovered.<br/>For the production /retrieval costs, we use a data set from the literature. The data set gives us the amount of DME /water injected and the amount of DME /oil/water produced. Moreover it gives the pressure drop, which allows us to calculate the power required for circulation of the fluids. Using these data, the exergy recovery factor (ExRF), which is defined as the exergy of the resources minus the exergy invested divided by the exergy of the resources produced (oil and DME) is calculated. It is observed that the ExRF initially increases with time before it declines and becomes negative. The time at which the ExRF becomes zero is called the exergy zero time. The result shows a negative exergy at the beginning of the DME enhanced water flood (DEW) process. As the incremental oil produced increases due to the presence of DME, and as more DME is back produced, which leads to less manufacturing of DME, the ExRF becomes positive. For DME enhanced recovery the initial area below exergy zero time plus the area above the exergy zero time is positive. Cumulatively, the result shows that at the end of the project, about 71% of the exergy is recovered. <br/>The exergy analysis helps us to identify the various components that contribute the most to the exergy loss (~29%). DME manufacturing is found to be the most important contributor to the exergy loss, contributing ~80% (cumulative) to the total invested exergy. It shows that reducing the exergy of manufacturing DME increases the ExRF. The amount of DME lost in the reservoir is shown to also have an effect on the ExRF (not as much as the exergy of manufacturing DME), as it affects the utilization factor of DME. The utilization factor is the ratio of the oil produced (bbls) and the mass of DME injected. If DME is lost more DME must be injected without any increase in oil recovery and thus, DME loss reduces the ExRF.<br/>CO2 hydrogenation is chosen as one of the innovative ways of producing DME from renewable sources. The method utilizes CO2 captured from burning the oil produced from the field in power plants and uses solar PV (photovoltaic) as the source of energy to produce H2 from water electrolysis<br/>The results show that the CO2 captured from the power plant can be used to produce more DME than what is needed in the field. The excess DME can be reinjected or used for other purposes such as electricity generation, methanol production or for other uses e.g. as transportation fuel. It is also found that using CO2 hydrogenation has the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by about 82% compared to using natural gas for DME production, which means the method is cleaner and more sustainable.","Dimethyl ether; EOR; exergy; oil; renewable energy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-12-31","","","","Applied Earth Sciences","",""

Lifetime extension of RPV project deals with the different issues which pose threat to its integrity. One such important issue is the occurrence of pressurised thermal shock (PTS). The most critical PTS scenario occurs during the events of loss of coolant accidents, when the emergency core cooling water is injected to cool down the reactor’s core. This cold water mixes with the hot water while descending in the downcomer of the RPV and result in sudden fluctuation in temperature of the vessel wall, giving rise to thermal stresses in it. Thermal-hydraulic codes, which are generally used for the nuclear reactor safety (NRS) applications, are unable to predict this complex 3-dimensional flow mixing phenomenon. Therefore, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) method are considered useful for the comprehensive study of PTS. However, the validation with the experimental data is required to gain trust in predictive capabilities of CFD methods for PTS studies. A high-fidelity direct numerical simulation (DNS) can provide the data for validation. Moreover, it can give more insight about the flow phenomenon and can form a reference database for the turbulence modelling CFD methodologies. The main aim of this thesis project is to perform an extensive preliminary study for the high-fidelity DNS of the single-phase PTS scenario. The objectives are, firstly to design a well defined and well studied numerical case for this DNS, which will be focused towards the buoyancy driven flow mixing in the downcomer of the RPV, and secondly to validate the DNS of a buoyancy driven flow mixing test case. With the help of several simulations, calibration study was performed to find an optimum physical domain and boundary conditions. In addition, a length scales study was performed which will help in mesh estimation for the DNS. Furthermore, a DNS of Rayleigh Bénard convection is performed and the results are compared with the results of a past DNS. This, in total, will contribute to the PTS studies in the direction which has not been dealt in the past and will form an essential basis for the future DNS of the PTS scenario.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering | Flight Performance and Propulsion","",""

A pronounced focus is on optimising pressure actuated compliant mechanisms. The difficulty herein is the interpretation of the pressure boundary in a TO design. In TO the boundaries are blurry, because of the filtering of the design variables, which is necessary to prevent checkerboarding. Another reason why the boundary is poorly defined is that the optimisation starts from an equally distributed grey, where black and white respectively are solid and void, so the boundary is either the domain boundary or not defined in early iterations of the optimisation. <br/>The methods proposed in literature often try to find the void-solid interface exposed to the pressure source to apply the loading from a pressure line directly. The method proposed in this work, appropriately called the Darcy method, first calculates the pressure field by using Darcy's law governing the flow through porous media and the associated pressure drop. A flow coefficient is introduced that decreases if the virtual element density increases. This results in a design dependent pressure field that can be solved using the Finite Element Method (FEM), which can then be translated to consistent nodal forces that are applied to the TO problem. A drainage coefficient has also been introduced to make sure that the pressure is drained entirely to the environment pressure over the first encountered void-solid interface exposed to the pressure source. The Darcy method has proven to function well in several test cases. The method has been thoroughly tested using several parameter sweeps on a clamping problem objective. The parameters whose influence is examined are: the initial condition, the density threshold value, flow coefficient gradient at the threshold, output spring stiffness and the volume fraction. <br/>Subsequently, some alternative TO problems are solved showing the diversity of the method. In perspective of future research, the Darcy method can function as a great tool to research load sensitivities by tuning the pressure field control parameters. The extension of the Darcy method to 3D or to several load cases comes naturally but has not been tested in this work, this is also recommended for future research.","Topology optimization; Design dependent loading; Pressure load; Darcy's law; Compliant Mechanisms; Soft Robotics; Darcy's method","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-09-30","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Precision and Microsystems Engineering","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2017","This research project aims at obtaining a better understanding of vertically translating the wing and the related wing-body interference effects on the drag and sonic boom. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analysis using the Euler equations has been used to evaluate an airplane with different vertical wing placements at a lift coefficient of 0.15 at a Mach-number of 1.6 and also in zero-lift conditions. Pressure distributions, drag forces and pressure signatures have been calculated in order to assess the performance in terms of wave drag and sonic booms. These results have been analysed to find out why certain effects are happening for these configurations. The low wing configuration has the highest lift-to-drag ratio due to interference on the upper wing surface close to the fuselage. The lift-to-drag ratio for CL = 0.15 is found to be 4.79% higher compared to the worst performing configuration, the high wing configuration. Due to the local geometry of the low wing configuration it is possible to cre- ate additional suction on the upper wing surface, which positively affects the performance. Pressure signatures are extracted at 1 body-length distance (70푚) from the aircraft for several azimuth angles. These distributions show that the low wing configuration also has the lowest impulse and maximum overpressure. The higher wing configurations show an extra peak in overpressure emanating from the trailing end of the wing, which is created due to interference effects. Below the wing surface there is a large volume of the fuselage, while it is absent for the low wing configuration. Therefore the higher wing configurations show an extra peak in the pressure signature.<br/>Next to this discovery, an analysis is presented to relate the geometry of the configurations to the wave drag by assessing the cross-sectional area distribution using different intersection methods. These methods are compared with other methods found in the literature. Two methods which use a single Mach-cone have been analysed, as well as a method incorporating a forward and a backward pointed Mach-cone. One method translates a Mach-cone vertically to align the vertex of the Mach-cone with the centroid of the intersection with the aircraft. This gives an x,z-position which can be used to adjust the area distribution. The drag for the methods using a single Mach-cone was overestimated by a factor of 2, but after multiplying these results by a factor of / the results for the heigh-weighted Mach-cone method approached the wave drag results from CFD within 5%. The double Mach-cone method showed an even better agreement with less variation, while no multiplication factor was applied.<br/>A further analysis has taken place to find out why some methods that incorporate a single Mach- cone to evaluate the cross-sectional area to calculate the wave drag, overestimate the drag by a factor of 2. It is found that these methods do not overestimate the drag for a simple shape, such as a Sears- Haack body. The methods simply overestimate the cross-sectional area, which needs smoothing to obtain an area distribution that is suitable for drag calculation. The double Mach-cone method is a method that smoothens the area distribution, since the forward cone lowers the cross-sectional area in the front of an aircraft and adds cross-sectional area in the tail part of the aircraft.<br/>Further research is required to find out if these methods using a single Mach-cone can be applied to any geometry or not. Next to that it is recommended to research the sonic boom of other aircraft configurations with wings shifted further back to see if the sonic-boom from the tail can be reduced. Further research is necessary to see if the interference effects on the upper side of the wing of the low wing configuration are present in viscous flows. If the positive interference effects from this thesis are present in a viscous flow, this might see a reduction in fuel burn and maybe contribute to commercial supersonic flight becoming a reality again.","sonic boom; vertical wing placement; wave drag; drag; supersonic; pressure signature; lift; zero-lift; area ruling; area rule; Mach; cone","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Although theoretically accurate, some states may not be reachable under the influence of disturbances (e.g. turbulence). In this thesis a stochastic extension to the reachability analysis is applied to a simplified aircraft model. The probabilistic reachability analysis yields the transition probability from a state to the target set. By comparing the deterministic and probabilistic Safe Flight Envelope, it becomes clear that the Safe Flight Envelope can shrink considerably under the influence of turbulence. It is shown that for a 3 sigma (99.7%) confidence interval, the envelope can shrink by as much as 50.8% compared to the deterministic envelope. Furthermore, it is found that for high roll angles, some parts of the deterministic envelope have a 0% transition probability under the influence of turbulence, further emphasizing the importance of probabilistic envelopes.","Reachability Analysis; Safe Flight Envelope; HJB; Probabilistic; Uncertainty Quantification","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-12-01","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

During idling phases of these next-generation OWTs, additional damping is required. This can be achieved through dynamic vibration absorbers (VAs), i.e. dampers. More importantly, wave-induced vibrations can decrease the installation workability of these OWTs up to 50%. VAs which are designed for the operational life of an OWT, are not effective at natural frequencies typical for partially installed OWTs. To reduce installation costs to acceptable values, higher damper effectiveness is required. <br/>The main objective of this thesis is, therefore, the reduction of wave-induced vibrations during OWT installation by non-invasive modification strategies of off-tuned VAs.<br/><br/>In the first part of the research, a passive damper modification is proposed. A numerical model was developed of the stand-alone passive modified VA. Using data from small scale-experiments, the steady state response of the model was validated. However, the passive method was shown to be insufficient in supplying additional damping at installation frequencies. <br/><br/>In the second part, semi-active control strategies were deployed. This semi-active controller, which cannot add mechanical energy through the actuator, results in an inherently stable system. A hybrid control law and a clipped-LQR control law were investigated.

This thesis focuses on researching the potential of the outer layer of the mattress: mattress ticking. <br/><br/>This report describes the methods, outcomes and decisions that were made to create the final product. At the start of the project, the research question was: <br/>“How can recycled ticking materials be used to design pet products, in the most sustainable way?” <br/><br/>The Material Driven Design method (Karana et al., 2015) was applied as a framework to determine the properties of the material, determining the market opportunities for mattress ticking. <br/>Focus groups with the target group resulted in insights, which in combination with interviews with experts and other research, resulted into a preliminary list of requirements where the product should abide by.<br/>After exploring multiple search areas, the search area “Travelling with dogs” was chosen because of the high viability. This search area led to 17 ideas, which were scored using the Harris profile method.<br/>After further elaboration of the three concepts (Fence, Sunshade and Hammock) that scored best, one concept was chosen because it had the highest viability and desirability. This concept (Fence) was developed into the final product: Dipi. Dipi is a simple dog tent that protects dogs from the sun and creates a secluded area for the dog to lay in. The product is lightweight and easy to use. The product is intended to bring along on holiday.<br/>The launch of the product is supported by a marketing strategy and a list of potential production partners, that is proposed to the client company. <br/>After materialising the final design of the product, a prototype was made. The final prototype was tested in an exploratory user test with the envisioned target group, after which final design recommendations were set up.<br/>The thesis is concluded with further recommendation for developing the Dipi and an extensive evaluation of the used methods during the project.<br","design; recycling; ticking; mattress; dogs; sustainability","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

An important design parameter is the first natural frequency of the wind turbine. The first natural frequency is dependent on environmental conditions and different soil conditions such as scour. This research gives a better insight into the sensitivities of these influences on the first natural frequencies.<br/>The first objective was to determine the sensitivity of different influences on the first natural frequencies in a full scale test environment. The first natural frequencies of four wind turbines (two protected against scour and two not protected against scour) in the Eneco Luchterduinen wind farm are constantly monitored and the natural frequencies are identified. It was found that only the water level has an identifiable influence on the identified first natural frequency and that the design natural frequencies and identified natural frequencies differ significantly.<br/>After the analysis from the full scale test different influences on the first natural frequency in a numerical computer model are investigated. The computer model predictions confirm that the water level has an identifiable effect and only small effects of backfilling of the scour hole on the first natural frequency are found.<br/>The third objective was to compare the sensitivity of different influences on the first natural frequency obtained from the computer model and from the full scale test. The effects of the water level are comparable. And the effect of backfill of the scour hole was found in the model but not in the full scale test. Therefore no conclusion is made on the effect of backfill nor on the presence of backfill. It was found that in order to mitigate the differences in first natural frequency of the test turbines and the model the soil should be modelled twenty times stiffer.<br/>The main influence on the first natural frequency of the offshore wind turbines in the Eneco Luchterduinen wind farm is the soil stiffness. The only other identifiable influence was the water level. Also in the design of the wind turbine the soil stiffness is underestimated significantly, implying overconservative designs.","Offshore Wind; natural frequency; scour; Monopile","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

An interesting point for improvement is to limit the loss of pressurized air as conveyors are only effective at the position of the substrate.<br/>The goal of this research is to develop a local pneumatic valve, that is implemented underneath the surface of a floating air conveyor. Depending on the position of a substrate, the valve is actuated using a pressure signal. <br/><br/>A conceptual design is conceived where a nozzle-flapper system builds up pressure when a wafer is floating nearby. This will actuate a relay with a circular waved membrane that snaps to its inverse shape, to open or close a channel. <br/>The proposed nozzle-wafer concept is modelled to investigate its characteristics. It is found that a desired nozzle back pressure can be achieved by setting the appropriate nozzle restriction and supply pressure. However, at higher pressures the fly-height will be influenced by the nozzles. Therefore, a minimal switching pressure for the relay is key.<br/>The arrangement of nozzles and relays in a conveyor is examined. In this research a black box is used for the valve in order for multiple relay concepts to be applicable. With the current function two inputs are needed to fully operate the relay. It is possible to make a grid where substrates move in one direction and an extra array of outlets are active around it, to make a smoother air film. No arrangement is found that can be used in different directions without leaving a single relay open when the substrate has passed.<br/>Simulations of the snap acting relay showed unreliable membrane behaviour. An adjustment is made in the design for the prototype. A design using a circular single curved membrane is introduced, because the models are consistent in converging to a solution of its snapping behaviour. <br/>A layered design approach is used for the prototype, where laser-cut PMMA plates are glued together. Plastic membranes are created with a vacuum form method. Initial testing of these membranes showed unexpected behaviour (e.g. flipping in other shapes and breaking). Also the pressure required to snap back to the starting position is considerable lower. A prototype is built using the only properly snapping membrane that is found. In a static experiment it proved that the relay functions as it is intended. <br/><br/>This concludes the first iteration of the design process. A working snap acting membrane is fabricated and tested. Because of the behaviour of the other tested membranes it is taken into account that this prototype might not have a lifespan higher than switching a hundred times. Simulations showed that a nozzle-wafer system can provide a back pressure to switch a valve. However, this pressure must be minimal, in order that it does not affect the fly-height of the wafer. <br/>Lastly an alternative design is introduced. Using an elastic membrane with different size surfaces, lower pressures can close off air channels with a higher supply pressure. This combined by a nozzle-wafer conveyor with a resistor network underneath is recommended to investigate in the second iteration of the design process.<br","pneumatic relay; snap acting membrane; wafer conveyor; air film; floating wafer","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Mechatronic System Design (MSD)","",""

Such a principle forms the basis of solar sailing, in which the solar radiation pressure is used to accelerate highly reflective lightweight structures called solar sails. Similarly, a laser-enhanced solar sail is a solar sail in which also an external laser beam pointed towards the sail is exploited to generate thrust. In this way an additional laser radiation pressure is exerted onto the sail, hence conferring higher propulsive and steering capabilities, and leading to an increased maneuverability of the sailcraft.<br/><br/>The main purpose of this thesis project is to provide a model of the laser-enhanced solar sail dynamics and to establish the advantages of laser-enhanced solar sailing as compared to ""traditional"" solar sailing. The analysis has been pursued focusing on interplanetary missions and considering ideal sails, i.e. sails able to perfectly reflect the impinging radiation.<br/>Normally, for low-thrust interplanetary missions the propellant consumption and time of flight required for the transfers to take place play a crucial role. However, since solar sails do not exploit any propellant, the traditional and laser-enhanced sailcraft performances have been compared by analyzing their flight-time optimal trajectories, focusing on three different mission scenarios: a Mercury orbit rendezvous, Mars orbit rendezvous and Neptune flyby.<br/>These trajectories have been computed by taking advantage of an evolutionary neurocontrol optimizer, in which newly added functionalities have been implemented with the purpose of optimizing laser-enhanced solar sail trajectories.<br/>The trajectory analysis results have shown that, if laser-enhanced sailcraft are used instead of traditional sailcraft, flight time gains in the order of 8-11% can be achieved for the missions to Mercury and Mars orbits, while a smaller 2.5% gain is achieved for the flyby mission to Neptune.","Laser-enhanced; Solar Sail; Ideal; Trajectory; Optimization; Machine Learning; Evolutionary Neurocontrol","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-07-01","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

While ideally the external surfaces are expected to maintain a smooth profile, this is not the case in most vehicles, which might be laden with discontinuities like steps, gaps, and other protrusions. These could alter the local flow field and could have a drastic impact on the heating and hence should be properly studied. In this thesis, the effect of large protuberances, when placed in both a laminar and turbulent boundary layer is experimentally investigated. Cylindrical elements with height greater than or equal to the boundary layer height, placed on a flat plate were used as protuberances. Quantitative Infrared Thermography was used as the prime investigative tool, assisted by high speed Schlieren and oil flow visualisations. For the laminar interactions, a series of high and low heat flux regions were observed in the wake of the protuberance due to the presence of stream wise vortices. A local peak due to flow reattachment was found downstream of the cylinder along the centreline, whose length from the cylinder trailing edge scaled with the height of the cylinder and was nearly invariant with the diameter and the flow unit Reynolds number. The span wise distribution of Stanton number revealed that the location of heat flux peak formed due to the symmetry plane counter rotating vortices, scaled with the diameter of the cylinder with their peak heating increasing with increasing in diameter. This revealed the possible dependency of the strength and location of the symmetry plane vortex pair with the diameter of the protuberance. The flow transition induced by the elements considered here, moved upstream with increase in unit Reynolds number. Moving upstream, a presence of span wise vortex system was verified. A mean separation length was measured from the centreline heat transfer distribution and an empirical formulation was presented and shown to have good agreement with the current dataset along with recent literature. For the turbulent interaction, direct heat transfer measurements were acquired downstream of the protuberance for the first time. A centreline high heat transfer was observed, with heating of $1.5 - 2$ times the local turbulent case. A series of high and low heat flux regions were observed in the wake, dictating the possible presence of stream wise vortices. Similar to the laminar case, the location of reattachment heating was shown to scale with the height of the cylinder. Additionally, span wise heat transfer profiles show that the wake width increases with increase in height, while remaining fairly constant for a given condition, throughout the length of the measurement domain. Time resolved Schlieren images captured upstream of the protuberance showed a very unsteady separation shock and a relatively steady bow shock wake, together forming the lambda shock system. Probability density functions generated for the upstream separation length revealed that both the mean and the standard deviation of the separation length increases with increase in height of the cylinder.","Infrared Thermometry; protuberance; Transition; Boundary Layer; shock wave","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

(mentor); Prakahsa, Prajwal (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2017","Aircraft design methodologies have been significantly developing from the past few years with the advancements in knowledge based techniques. These methods enable the storage of design knowledge and rules, and reuse them to create different types of designs, thus preventing the designer to perform repetitive tasks. Tasks such as parametric modelling of components, such as the aircraft wing can be automated by storing the modelling processes and the design rules in a knowledge base. With this process, variants of the wing with different geometric parameters can then be generated in a short duration by simply varying certain top-level requirements. It is necessary to extend these design techniques to model aircraft systems in the conceptual design stage. This, not only decreases the time of design realisation but also presents a scope to assess the effects of various inter-dependencies due to systems and make appropriate changes, in the early stages of aircraft design. Developing and demonstrating a framework which aids to assess the influence of the wing subsystems, namely the flight control actuators, fuel tanks and anti-ice elements; on the aircraft design and performance in the conceptual design stage is the aim of the thesis. <br/><br/>This thesis presents a combination of physics based and knowledge based design methodologies to size the wing subsystems and position them in the airframe. Consequently, the methods are integrated into the conceptual aircraft design process to enable multidisciplinary design with supporting domains. The methods are aimed to aid the design of conventional systems architectures and More Electric Aircraft (MEA) systems architectures as well. With these methodologies, the Systems Model Generator (SMG) application is developed in Python to facilitate semi-automatic wing subsystems sizing and orientation in the airframe based on top-level aircraft requirements, initial aircraft design parameters and system specific parameters. The subsystem models generated with the proposed methodology for short-medium range civil transport aircraft are verified and validated as well. Knowledge based systems and subsystems selection are implemented to facilitate semi-automated systems, subsystems and architecture selection, based on the aircraft configuration and systems specific requirements. Methods for automatic iterative fuel tanks sizing and intersection detection are implemented to further reduce the overall design time and make the tool more suitable for integrated sizing.<br/><br/>With the multidisciplinary design framework, the conceptual parametric models, volume, mass, power consumption and position of the subsystems in the airframe are generated and propagated in the conceptual aircraft design stage; thus bridging the conceptual and the preliminary design stages. In the proposed framework, the domains of aircraft design generation, systems selection and sizing, subsystems selection and sizing, engine sizing and mission simulation are considered for the multidisciplinary design process. The domains are integrated with the DLR CPACS-RCE framework. <br/><br/>A case study to demonstrate the process of integrated parametric subsystems sizing of the aircraft, with the proposed framework is presented. The aim of this case study is to assess the influence of the MEA systems architecture relative to the conventional systems architecture for a short-medium range transport aircraft, similar to the Airbus A320-200. In this case study, the quantitative influence of the subsystems' parameters on the aircraft design and performance parameters is determined and analysed. The subsystems' parameters constitute the mass, power consumption, volume and location of the subsystems in the airframe and the aircraft design parameters constitute the aircraft masses such as the overall empty mass and the fuel mass for the mission. The generation and propagation of the design and performance parameters of the aircraft through each domain of the framework are presented and analysed as well with the case study. In this case study, it is observed that the MEA systems architecture results in a lower mission fuel mass relative to the conventional systems architecture by nearly 2.3\%. Furthermore, these results are compared with literature and observed to be in the similar range of 2-7\%. Thus, the validated aircraft design framework presented in this thesis enables to substantially increases and propagate the design knowledge of aircraft systems, in the early design stages.","Aircraft design; Aircraft systems; Aircraft sizing; Parametric sizing; Aircraft subsystems","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2017-12-19","","","","Aerospace Engineering","AGILE","53.46629249999999,9.98100420000003"

Huisman Equipment B.V. proposed a new type of offshore motion compensated crane that is capable of reaching the height of the nacelle of these wind turbines. The crane has a compensation system on the tip consists of a telescoping slewing arm actuated by a hydraulic piston, and a hydraulic motor and slew drive, to compensate in the horizontal direction. Heave compensation is applied to compensate for crane tip movements in the vertical direction. Moreover the system compensates the relative position of the payload to the vibrating nacelle of the wind turbine. This thesis studies the requirements and feasibility of control for such a crane. The study includes an analysis and simulation of the requirements in both motion compensation and relative compensation. It was found that for motion compensation simple proportional controllers with load angle feedback suffices. For relative compensation control methods were synthesized through H infinity optimization, this lead to a 2nd order lead compensator. It was concluded that with simple proportional control the tip position stays within a mean squared distance of around 0.25 m during motion compensation. The load has residual angles of around 5 degrees. The main limiting factors in motion compensation are the ship motion measurements and the actuator dynamics.

This will lead to technical challenges due to a dramatic reduction of rotational inertia in the system (specifically, due to the phase-out of conventional generation units with large synchronous machines) to guarantee, despite these potential inertia issues, stability at 50 Hz.

With their unique root structure they serve as important natural coastal protection and provide habitats with excellent conditions for cultivating fish, shrimp and crab species. Despite all benefits mangrove forests are disappearing at alarming rates around the world but especially in Asia such as the Mekong Delta coast. Therefore, this research focusses on the Ca Mau Province in Vietnam. The Ca Mau province is the southernmost province of Vietnam with mangroves present along the coastlines, the Mui Ca Mau National Park and in mixed mangrove aquaculture farms. Remote sensing has been widely proven to be essential in mapping mangrove ecosystems. Previous research used either expensive optical and radar data sources or free but lower resolution systems. This study is the first that uses the new Copernicus Sentinel-1 radar and Sentinel-2 multispectral satellite missions that provide free available data with high spatial (10-20 meter) and temporal (10-12 days) resolution. Since optical data is prone to cloud effects and radar data is hard to interpret, both data sets are combined to investigate improvements for classifying mangroves. The data is processed in the new online Google Earth Engine platform providing a powerful tool for big data applications such as land cover classification. Optical data is found to separate mangroves by their spectral reflectance mainly in the near-infrared wavelength domain. The dominant mangrove species in the Ca Mau province, Rhizophora Apiculata and Avicennia Alba, are found to be separable from comparing unsupervised clustering results with ground truth locations. The C-band radar signal is dominated by volume scattering, indicating the density of the canopy. Especially VV-polarization has good correlation with canopy parameters. To improve information from the radar signal a temporal analysis is executed. Seasonal variations are quantified and show an increase according to the spatial succession of mangroves. Pioneer species, such as Avicennia genus, show less seasonal variations than mature species, such as Rhizophora genus. With the previous information five classes are defined: urban area, water and three mangrove classes: Rhizophora Apiculata species in extensive shrimps, Rhizophora Apiculata species in natural environment and Avicennia Alba species. A classification method is set-up in the Google Earth Engine with a Random Forest classifier using the satellite data inputs and ground truth training input of the five classes. A combination of the optical data with the temporal information of the radar data is found to be the best data input for separating those five classes. Classification results are obtained for discriminating mangrove types up to an overall accuracy of 87\%. The classification gets less reliable when mangrove species are mixed or at locations where the ground truth training input was scarce. With the resulting yearly land cover maps land cover changes can be detected. Comparing the land cover map of 2017 with a mangrove cover product of 2000 shows a regression along the southern coastline. No significant changes inside the shrimp farms are found between 2016 and 2017 but with the future availability of a long time series of Sentinel-1 and 2 data those can be detected with the method that is resulted from this study.","Mangroves; Remote Sensing; Classification; Sentinel; Vietnam; Google Earth Engine","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Earth Sciences","",""

In the design of mechanical systems however hardly any machine learning applications are being used. Research into the viability of such an application is therefore necessary.<br/>We have performed such research, using a specific type of machine learning, known as reinforcement learning, for the synthesis of kinematic mechanisms. Reinforcement learning is an experience-based learning strategy which has proven particularly successful in learning to play games, like chess, blackjack or Go. In this research it is shown that the sequentially alternating nature of game-playing between actions and reward can also be observed in mechanism design by posing design challenges in a game-like format. We have used a decision- tree based mechanism representation developed by Lipson [1] to create such a game-like world in which mechanisms can be designed. To train an actor to navigate this game-like world both Monte Carlo and Temporal Di erence learning have been applied, in combination with a neural network as nonlinear value function approximator. Moreover a kinematic simulator and scoring modules have been implemented to evaluate synthesized mechanisms.<br/>We demonstrated the successful implementation of the framework and learning algorithm by synthesizing mechanism for two separate path tracing objectives: straight lines and figure- eights. A set of recommended algorithm settings was extracted from a parameter sweep and grid search including a total of 560 test runs. Straight line mechanisms were obtained with a fixed maximum number of 10 nodes, drawing lines with aspect ratios up to 1:1168. Additionally a mechanism was synthesized capable of drawing figure-eight patterns.<br/>We conclude that the use of reinforcement learning in the context of mechanical system design is viable. More specifically using the presented method kinematic synthesis for path tracing objectives can be performed. The current research cultivates the land for future e orts to bridge the gap between the challenges faced by mechanical system design groups and the advancing solutions developed by the computer sciences.","kinematics; synthesis; Reinforcement Learning; Design; Machine Learning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-12-15","","","","","",""

Her project focusses on products based on local materials which can be made DIY by the local inhabitants. One of the sub-topics is creating products with plastic waste. For that reason, DELTAP collaborates with Precious Plastic, a company focussing on local, small scale, plastic recycling. <br/><br/>This topic is converted into this graduation project. The products, designed during this graduation, will be used as DIY templates for others to replicate and used by Prarthana for further research.<br/><br/>To narrow down this project, the Karail slum in Dhaka, Bangladesh, was chosen as research area.

It is estimated that currently 20-30 million oil &amp; gas wells are waiting to be permanently decommissioned worldwide. The maturation of the oil \&amp; gas industry will only continue to increase the number of wells to be abandoned going forward in to the future. Although effective and efficient, the conventional use of cement for the plug &amp; abandonment of wells proves to be associated with certain limitations. Bentonite is being considered as an alternative material for plug and abandonment. Bentonite is a clay which is known for its high swelling capacity, with a potential volume increase up to 300% upon hydration. Additionally, saturated bentonite has a low water permeability and a self-healing capacity. Evaluating bentonite as an alternative sealing material is important to determine its applicability to oil &amp; gas wells. An abandonment plug must be able to mechanically withstand pressure differentials resulting from remaining or recharged reservoir pressures whilst preventing the resulting fluid migration, ideally for an indefinite amount of time. An assessment of the different gas migration mechanisms through a bentonite plug is considered in this study. Four possible gas migration mechanisms through bentonite were identified: advective-diffuse, visco-capillary, dilatant pathway formation and macroscopic tensile fracturing flow. Two of these mechanisms are relevant for the evaluation of a bentonite plug; visco-capillary and dilatant pathway formation flow or a combination of both. From experimental work, it has been observed that gas migration commences at a differential pressure which is in the same range as the swelling pressure produced during the hydration of the bentonite plug. The magnitude of the plug swelling pressure is influenced inversely by the free swelling space and proportionally by the dry density of the bentonite plug. When hydrating bentonite material is fully confined, the gas breakthrough pressure is determined by the dry density of the bentonite plug. In the case of a plug comprising of compacted bentonite pellets a maximum dry density of 1000 kg/m3 can currently be produced; this results in gas breakthrough pressures in the range of 2-5 bar. Experimentally it was observed that a permeability of 20 nD at a pressure differential of 20 bar was observed in a bentonite plug comprising of hydrated granular bentonite material; a permeability which is as low as a cap-rock. This result highlights the potential of bentonite as a sealing material, but practical operational considerations have to be taken before this can be achieved in oil \&amp; gas wells. These results indicate that it is currently not practical to use bentonite as pressure bearing abandonment plug. Further knowledge is required regarding; the pressure-time dependency of the gas permeability; sensitivity of the bentonite swelling pressure to water salinity; and the impact to the bentonite plug quality over prolonged exposure to high temperatures.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

When thermoplastic composites are used, direct joining with the metal substrate can be obtained using welding technologies which melts the thermoplastic at the interface. <br/><br/>Ultrasonic welding is well-known for being a fast, reliable and effective technology for metal/metal or plastic/plastic joining. In this study, a collaboration between Toyota and TU Delft, ultrasonic plastic welding was investigated as candidate joining technology for aluminum/thermoplastic joints in automotive applications. The goal was to understand the main mechanisms involved in the adhesion and how they affect the performance of the joint. Initially, the technique proved to be successful, but moderate strengths were obtained. Therefore, several surface pre-treatments of the aluminum were analyzed to improve performance in terms of strength and durability of the joint; mechanical, chemical and physical treatments were carried out. With laser structuring, strengths comparable to adhesive bonded joints were obtained, but in a much shorter process time. Other treatments such as conversion coating, sandblasting and plasma led to considerable improvements as well.<br/><br/>The encouraging results achieved represent an important step in the development of ultrasonic plastic welding for multi-material joining in the automotive industry.

(graduation committee); Dietrich, André (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2017","Automated vehicles (AVs) are being developed by several companies and research groups worldwide. The implicit communication (e.g., eye contact) of the vehicle or driver seems to play an important role in the expected behaviour of vehicles. It is possible that vulnerable road users (VRUs) are less able to estimate the intention of vehicles (e.g., deceleration, braking behaviour and stopping distance) when this type of communication changes or disappears when AVs are introduced. An external human-machine interface (eHMI) (i.e., a display showing when it is safe to cross) can be introduced to overcome the lack of implicit communication between driver and pedestrian. The goal of this study was to examine the effects of eHMIs of AVs on the crossing behaviour of VRUs.<br/>A virtual reality (VR) simulation was set up, where the participant was standing on the pavement on a two-lane two-way road in a European setting. The yielding behaviour (yielding, non yielding), the type of vehicle (small, medium, large), the type of eHMI and the timing of an eHMI were varied in a within-subject design (N = 28). Four types of eHMIs were implemented, which all consisted of a screen in the front of the vehicle; with the four eHMIs being 1) the Frontal braking lights, 2) a Knightrider animation, 3) a Smiley and 4) a Text showing ‘WALK’ was shown when it was safe to cross.When it was not safe to cross, the Frontal braking lights were turned off, the Knightrider animation was not shown, the Smiley was neutral and the Text showed ‘DON’T WALK’.<br/>Results showed that the presence of an eHMI made participants significantly feel safer when trying to cross. This was measured by measuring the total time that participants indicated they felt safe to cross using a remote control on which participants could press a button. The total time ratio that participants pressed the button when vehicles were yielding was 0.655, 0.743, 0.747, 0.751, and 0.765 for the baseline, Frontal braking lights, Knightrider, Smiley, and Text, respectively. Thus, participants felt safer to cross when an eHMI was present compared to when no eHMI was present. Secondly, the vehicle size was found to play a role in the total time that participants felt safe to cross. Specifically, the total time ratio was 0.746 for a Smart fortwo, 0.732 for a BMW z4, and 0.725 for a Ford f150 in the yielding cases. The total time ratio was 0.206 for a Smart fortwo, 0.190 for a BMW z4, and 0.156 for a Ford f150 in the non-yielding cases. Furthermore, the distance at which an eHMI changes state (e.g., ‘WALK’/‘DON’T WALK’) was found to play a role in the total time that participants felt safe to cross. The total time ratio was 0.796 for 50 m, 0.761 for 35 m, 0.698 for 20 m and 0.655 for the baseline. Participants reported in a post-experiment questionnaire that the Text eHMI was least ambiguous.<br/>Future research can focus on which aspects improve AV-VRU interaction, so that eHMIs can be optimised. Now merely screens in front of the vehicle were tested; other techniques (e.g., projected pedestrian crossings) could yield different results. Differences between research methods can be examined as well, as this study showed differences in revealed behaviour in the simulation and conscious stated preferences of people in the questionnaires.","Automated driving; Virtual Reality; Pedestrians","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","51.9963,4.3759"

Augmented reality based interfaces may help address some of these problems.

To evaluate augmented reality interfaces we introduce naturalism, as an interface property dimension ranging from arbitrary to natural<br/>In this research, we question whether a more naturalistic interface could improve performance, vigilance, and subjective evaluation (workload, acceptance, and engagement). For this we tested an arbitrary, a semi- natural and a natural automation status interface.<br/>These three interfaces were tested in a driving simulator setup using non-interactive real-life driving videos, to which 28 participants had to respond when an automation status error event occurred, which appeared after a precipitating cue such as appearing road construction.<br/>Results seem to suggest that the semi-natural interface improves reaction time performance most, followed by the natural interface. With the natural interface vigilance seems to be improved, and mental demand is decreased, but all results should be interpreted with caution due to small sample sizes and other limitations. It seems that the dynamic response to precipitating cues, an intrinsic property of the semi-natural and natural interfaces, was of influence. The reduced mental demand seems to support our presumed mechanism of reduced cognitive strain. For further research, a more challenging task design and eye-tracking could be promising. To conclude, this research showed that more natural interfaces show potential to improve safety and comfort.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Such a circuit description assumes that any kind of interaction between qubits is possible. However, quantum chips have limited qubits connectivity only allowing, for instance, nearest-neighbor (NN) interactions. That means, qubits need to be placed in adjacent positions for performing a two-qubit gate. In this thesis, a routing algorithm is proposed where physical qubits or planar-based logical qubits are routed to obey this nearest neighbor constraint in a 2D qubit topology. This algorithm tries to minimize the circuit latency or communication overhead. <br/><br/>The proposed routing algorithm is based on a sliding window principle. Different paths, found by using an adapted breadth-first search algorithm, are evaluated based on the interleaving of the corresponding routing instructions, e.g., SWAP operations with previous instructions, and by looking at the disordering of future qubits. The path that will add the lowest number of cycles to the algorithm is then selected and efficiently inserted with the rest of the instructions. This process continues until all the instructions inside the quantum algorithm obey the nearest neighbor constraints.<br/><br/>The routing algorithm is tested for several real quantum algorithms taken from QLib and ScaffCC, as well as for random generated benchmarks. Taking different alternative paths into account and evaluating those paths for possible interleaving with previous instructions, always has a positive effect to minimize the number of added cycles. The results concerning the evaluation of the disordering of future qubits could have a positive or negative effect on the circuit latency depending on the quantum circuit.","Quantum; Mapping; Routing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Microelectronics","",""

Carbon fibre/Polyether-ether-ketone (C/PEEK) is one of the high-performance thermoplastic composites and is replacing metallic and thermosetting counterparts in various aircrafts components. Parts made from such composites undergo multiple heat treatment cycles, and each cycle involves processing at temperatures above melt. At these temperatures, thermal stability is a limiting factor, which results in severe thermal degradation of the polymer, especially in oxidative environments. For this project, the thermal degradation of 8-ply unidirectional C/PEEK composites is investigated. The objectives include finding the reduction in morphological properties of PEEK polymer due to degradation over four different processing temperatures (385, 405, 425, and 445°C), and times (10, 30, 60, and 90 minutes), in two processing environments (air and nitrogen), exploring the effect of oxygen and temperature on degradation, and evaluating the mechanical performance through three-point bending. Thermal analysis through Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) showed that the crystallinity reduces from 32% for an untreated laminate to 28% for the lowest heat treatment condition (385°C, 10 minutes). From there, a steady reduction is observed, with 15% at 425°C, 60 minutes, and 0% at 425°C, 90 minutes and 445°C, 90 minutes. A contour plot for polymer property reduction based on crystallinity serves as a processing guideline for C/PEEK laminates. DSC analysis through the thickness of air treated laminates showed that surface plies degrade faster than the inner plies. This effect is not observed in a nitrogen environment. This showed the effect of oxygen on the surface. Though inner plies were shielded from oxygen exposure, they still showed a higher degradation than nitrogen treated laminates, showing that diffusion of oxygen through the laminates has taken place. At 425°C and 445°C, in air, the through thickness difference is higher compared to 385°C. So, in oxygen environment, polymer degrades faster at higher temperatures than at lower temperatures. In nitrogen, at 385°C, there is almost no degradation, whereas the other three temperatures show an increased degradation. The rate of degradation in different environments and at different temperatures is characterized by computation of activation energies. The air treated laminates showed an activation energy of 126 kJ/mol, whereas, nitrogen treated laminates has 193 kJ/mol. 3-point bending tests are performed to observe matrix failure. No failure was observed at 10, 30, and 60 minutes at 385°C, but from 405°C, cracks starts to appear and cracks initiates at lower stresses with increasing heat treatment conditions.","Degradation; Carbon Fiber Reinforced Plastic; polyether ether ketone; DSC","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering | Novel Aerospace Materials","",""

It focuses on the investigation the performance of the available constitutive models in describing the coupled hydro-mechanical response of peats and organic clays as observed during the stress test. The soil models that are considered are the Mohr-Coulomb model, the Soft Soil model and the Hardening Soil model as are implemented in PLAXIS, a standard commercial finite element code.<br/>The evaluation of the models is performed in two steps. First, the performance of the constitutive models is evaluated by simulating the laboratory tests as single soil element tests with PLAXIS SoilTest facility. Based on the comparison of the numerical results with the laboratory data it is concluded that the HS performs the best compared to the SS and the MC model. In order to achieve good fit it is found that it is necessary to drastically reduce the failure stress ratio, $Rf$ to an average value of 0.15 in contrast to what is mentioned in literature for soft soils. In terms of one-dimensional compression stress path both the HS and SS model are deemed to perform similarly. The MC model is found to reproduce poorly the laboratory tests due to the assumption of linear elasticity - perfect plasticity.<br/>Subsequently, soil models are evaluated through a fully coupled hydro-mechanical simulation of the Leendert de Boerspolder stress test in PLAXIS 2D. The evaluation is done through the comparison of the measured to computed displacements and pore water pressure. It is found that the prediction of the HS model is ``soft'' for peat while the stiffness degradation in the organic clay results in excessive lateral displacements. Response of the SS is found to be better considering both displacements and pore water pressure. The best description of the stress test was found to be possibly by using the SS for the organic clay and the HS for peat. The performance of the MC model is quantitatively good however qualitatively is deemed to be poor. Furthermore, the influence of (a) the soil anisotropy and (b) the interface between organic clay and peat layers are pointed out as factors influencing the outcome of the simulation. <br/>Based on this study, it is concluded that in general the Soft Soil model, at this stage, is recommended for use for both soils. The Hardening Soil model should be used for peat but with caution and mainly when the deviatoric strains are deemed to be important. In this case the calibration should be done focusing on triaxial tests, therefore compromising the oedometric response. Moreover, a high secant stiffness should be considered to describe peat. That might be justifiable due to presence of fibers which under tensioning provide additional stiffness. Moreover, results suggest that the use of the HS model for the organic clay is not justifiable. Finally, the Mohr-Coulomb model should be used only as a rough approximation.","FEM analysis; Leendert de Boerspolder; Plaxis; dyke","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Due to the limited experience, the turbine of an sCO2 power cycle is in literature referred to as the component with the highest risk. In this thesis, a design methodology will be established and used to gain knowledge in sCO2 turbine design by designing and analysing a turbine concept which can be used to generate sCO2 turbine experimental data for validation purposes. The high density of the fluid in combination with the low power output of the turbine results in small turbine dimensions, a high rotational speed and a large axial load when using existing design wisdom. Therefore, the effect of limiting the rotational speed and axial load on the turbine design is evaluated.<br/><br/>The turbine design methodology includes a preliminary design module, an aerodynamic design module and a mechanical design module. The aerodynamic design module consists of a steady-state and transient solver to evaluate the importance of taking into account transient effects when estimating the aerodynamic performance. According to literature, pressure loads can have a significant effect on the stresses in sCO2 turbines. Therefore, the mechanical design module is able to take into account the pressure loading from the steady-state and transient aerodynamic design. <br/><br/>The low power in combination with the limited rotational speed pushes the turbine design away from the desired specific speed range. During the preliminary design, the radial inflow turbine was found to give the best performance while meeting the turbine requirements. The degree of reaction of the turbine is close to<br/>0, to limit the axial load due to the pressure difference across the rotor. As a result of the low specific speed, the turbine efficiency of 74% is lower than usually seen for radial inflow turbines. As no sudden peaks in entropy generation are seen across the rotor channel, it can be concluded that the high curvature of a low reaction radial inflow turbine does not seem to have a detrimental effect on the turbine performance. The main contribution to the losses can be found in the rotor channel as a result of the tip clearance losses and high flow velocities compared to reference turbines, while the stator losses are comparable. A good agreement is found between the steady-state and transient aerodynamic analysis. Based on this, it can be concluded that a steady-state analysis can give a good approximation of the turbine performance, but evaluating more designs would be required to generalise this statement to all small-scale low reaction sCO2 turbomachinery. Due to the low degree of reaction of the turbine, the stresses originating from the pressure load are found to be less than 1% of the total stresses. Based on this, it can be concluded that only taking into account centrifugal loads for a low reaction sCO2 turbine gives a good estimation of the stresses in the turbine during operation. <br/><br/>As this research focuses to a large extend on establishing the methodology, for future research it is recommended to perform a more thorough optimisation of the turbine shape, in particular to reduce the losses in the rotor channel by for example introducing a shrouded design.

(mentor); Henkes, R.A.W.M. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2017","Oil and gas production systems consist of flows in wells, in horizontal and inclined flowlines and in risers. Due to the reservoir composition and changes in pressure and temperature, the flow is often under multiphase conditions. With time, the reservoir matures and the reservoir pressure decreases. The gas rate drops below a critical gas rate, that is required to produce the liquid to the wellhead and the facilities. As a result, liquids build up down-hole in the well. This phenomenon is known as liquid loading, which may kill the well. One of the deliquification methods is to use surfactants, which are injected through a capillary at the bottom of the well. Recent field trials have shown that the injection of surfactants down-hole in a well can prevent liquid loading problems. The surfactants create a foam which forms relatively thick interfacial waves along the wall of the production tubing. The gas core gets more grip on the liquid film, making it easier to produce the liquid to the surface.<br/><br/>Due to the success of the application of surfactants in subsurface vertical wells, it is of interest to investigate whether surfactants can also help to overcome liquid management problems in flowline-riser systems on the surface. The objective of this work is therefore to find the effect of surfactants on two-phase (air-water) flows in flowlines and risers. Experiments were carried out in the Severe Slugging Loop at the Shell Research and Technology Centre Amsterdam. The flow loop consists of a 100 m horizontal and downward inclined flowline with an inner diameter of 0.051 m, followed by a 16.8 m riser with an inner diameter of 0.044 m. The working fluids are air and water, and operation is at atmospheric outlet pressure. Two configurations of the SSL were used. In configuration #1, both water and air are injected into the flowline. The mixture is transported through the flowline to the riser. In configuration #2, water is injected into the flowline. Air is injected directly into the riser base. The dish washing detergent Dreft is used as a surfactant to create foam. The concentration was systematically increased to find the effect on different types of slugging (in the flowline, in the riser and severe slugging at the riser base), the pressure gradient in the riser, the developing length in the riser and the liquid and foam holdup in the riser. Various measurement techniques were used: Differential Pressure Indicators (DPIs), Pressure Indicators (PIs), Distributed Acoustic Sensors (DAS), quick closing valves and flow visualization. <br/><br/>When operating the SSL in configuration #1 with a superficial gas and liquid velocity of u_sg= 1.21 m/s and u_sl= 0.4 m/s, slugging in the flowline is observed. The slugs are identified as growing slugs: the stratified flow builds up regularly due to a growing instability, forming a slug. The average length of the liquid body of the slug is 32 m, the average passing time of the liquid body of the slug is 51 s, and the average slug velocity is 0.66 m/s. Through DAS and pressure measurements one can see that the slugs are mitigated when the surfactant is added. The slugs completely disappear when an effective surfactant concentration of 1000 ppm is added to the air-water mixture.<br/><br/>When operating the SSL in configuration #1 with a superficial gas and liquid velocity of u_sg= 1.4 m/s and u_sl= 0.27 m/s, a severe slugging cycle is found. Without surfactants, the cycle has a period of 109 s in which the riser is filled entirely with the liquid body of the slug before is is pushed out by the air. Pressure drop measurements over the riser show that adding surfactants does not prevent the slugging cycle to occur. However, the creation of foam does increase the amount of gas in the riser, making the pressure build-ups more irregular. The slugging cycle reduces to 89 s when an effective surfactant concentration of 3000 ppm is added to the air-water mixture.<br/><br/>When operating the SSL in configuration #2 with a superficial gas and liquid velocity of u_sg= 0.37 m/s and u_sl= 0.27 m/s, slugging in the riser is observed. Differential pressure measurements were taken over a distance of 3 m at multiple locations: one at the riser base, and two at the top of the riser. The surfactant reduces the differential pressure along the riser. For a concentration of 3000 ppm, the differential pressure reduces by 5.1 % at the riser base and by 18.9 % at the top of the riser.<br/><br/>The pressure drop curve is used to analyze the flow behaviour for a range of superficial velocities. Two types of pressure drop curves were considered: 1) for a constant superficial liquid velocity (u_sl= 0.05 m/s), and 2) for constant gas-to-liquid ratio (GLR= 60 and GLR= 100). For the low gas flow rate region, i.e. the gravity dominated part of the curve, both methods show a decrease in pressure gradient for a surfactant concentration of 500 ppm or greater. In the high gas flow rate region, i.e. the friction dominated part of the curve, an increase in the effective concentration leads to an increase in the pressure gradient.<br/><br/>The developing length of the air-water mixture with and without surfactants is analyzed by means of differential pressure measurements. Measurements were taken over a distance of 3 m at multiple locations: one at the riser base, and two at the top of the riser. With an effective concentration of 3000 ppm, the differential pressure is slightly different for the two locations on top of the riser. This indicates that the flow is not fully developed at the top of the riser. The developing length is slightly increased with the addition of the surfactant. <br/><br/>The foam holdup is analyzed by measuring the height of the foam between two simultaneously closed quick closing valves on the riser. The experimental results are compared with the simulation results from the Shell Flow Correlations. The experimental results show a spread due to the transient behavior of the flow. Despite the spread, the experimental results follow the trend of the simulations. At low gas flow rates, surfactants decrease the foam holdup. At high gas flow rates, surfactants increase the foam holdup. However, the foam holdup decreases for increasing gas flow rates and eventually levels off to a constant holdup value.<br/><br/>It can be concluded from the small-scale experiments that surfactants: 1) mitigate (growing) slugs in flowlines, 2) do not remove the severe slugging cycle, 3) decrease the pressure gradient in the riser for small gas flow rates, 4) slightly increase the development length of the flow in the riser, and 5) decrease the foam holdup for low gas flow rates, and increase the foam holdup for high gas flow rates in the riser.<br/>It is recommended to carry out the experiments on a larger scale, i.e. at higher temperatures, for larger pipe diameters, to better relate to existing flowline-riser production systems. It is also recommended to perform similar experiments to find the effect of the surfactant on other slug types, such as terrain slugs and hydrodynamic slugs, in the flowline.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Many issues relevant to the Bay Area community such as shipping, recreational and commercial fishing, habitat restoration, human health, and environmental water quality are reliant on understanding sediment pathways (McKee et al. [2006]). Existing theories suggest that the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta deliver sediment to South Bay during periods of high river flows. Different hydrodynamic forces, such as the tide, wind and baroclinic flows, redistribute these sediments around South Bay. In this research, trends are analysed using a new set of data (WY2015-WY2017) and sediment pathways in time and space are investigated using a 3D numerical model. In this model, the pathways of three sediment classes with different settling velocities are traced from their source throughout the Bay Area. No such study has yet been undertaken in the South Bay Area. There is a high Delta sediment input to South Bay during periods of high river flow. The local tributaries contribute only marginally to the suspended sediment concentration of South Bay. With a decreasing sediment load from the Delta, the importance of the local tributaries as a sediment source for South Bay could increase. In this research, three different types of sediment exchange between Central Bay and South Bay are observed. The first type is observed during periods of low river flows (Q &lt; 800m3/s). A seaward directed residual flow is found in the channel at Bay Bridge. Sediments are slowly transported out of South Bay. The second type is observed after a period of moderate river flow (Q &gt; 800m3/s). A pulsed sediment flux from the Delta increases the turbidity of Central Bay, resulting in a horizontal spatial variation in SSC from Central Bay to South Bay. The diffusive character of the tide transports the sediments slowly from the turbid Central Bay to the relatively clearer South Bay. The third sediment exchange type is observed after an extreme Delta river flow (QDel ta È 5000m3/s)). The extreme Delta flow refreshes a large part of Central Bay and South Bay. The salinity of Central Bay increases slowly, resulting in a substantially more saline Central Bay than South Bay for a couple of months. The resulting baroclinic flow transports the sediments from Central Bay into South Bay through the landward directed bottom current. Two dominant pathways with opposite transport direction characterise the sediment transport in South Bay. One pathway is located in the channel and is directed southward during periods of high river runoff. The second pathway is located on the extensive east flat and is directed northward during periods of high river runoff. The transport in the channel is dominant during the wet period, resulting in a net transport landward. Besides these two dominant pathways, four re-circulations cells are found, facilitating the exchange between the channel and the shoals. The next step in gaining more insight into the sediment physics is a model studywhich includes bed-interaction with the suspended sediments. A study like this could confirmthe hypotheses opted in this research.","San Francisco Bay; San Francisco South Bay; Sediment pathways; density driven circulation; Delft3D-FM","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Coastal and Marine Engineering and Management (CoMEM)","","37.753, -122.442"

Carbon capture and storage could potentially decrease the required renewable energy capacity, while simultaneously increasing grid flexibility. This research focuses on finding a cost-optimal composition of technologies, while abiding by the goals set in the Paris climate treaty. To investigate this objective, two optimisation models are compared: a linear programmed optimisation model with a high temporal and low technical resolution, and a unit commitment model with a low temporal but high technical resolution. Fixed costs and installed capacities are determined by the linear model. Subsequently, both models calculate the optimal generation mix. Three scenarios for 2050 were evaluated: a 'business as usual' reference scenario with maximum emission comparable to 2014 levels, a scenario with a maximum emission consistent with a 96% reduction in 2050 compared to 2014 and a scenario with that same target and the possibility to implement carbon capture and storage. The results show that the goals set by the Paris agreement increase system costs of the European power sector, but the increase is moderated by deployment of carbon capture and storage. Compared to the linear model, unit commitment increases variable costs, but this increase is modest, serving as confirmation that a linear modelling approach can be sufficient for answering a wide range of questions. To increase accuracy, one might integrate both models and provide a complete answer that integrates long time-spans and a wide variety of technical constraints.","Renewable Energy; Linear optimization; Europe; Unit commitment; Carbon capture and storage; CCS; Industrial Ecology; Paris; COP21; Climate agreement; 2 degrees; global warming","en","master thesis","","","","","","The Master's programme Industrial Ecology is jointly organised by Leiden University and Delft University of Technology.","","","","","","Industrial Ecology","",""

First the main issues associated with the sedimentation of reservoirs are investigated. Most important are the loss of reservoir volume, sediment shortages downstream of the dam and possible blockage of water intakes.<br/>The sedimentation issues occur mostly in sediment laden rivers. Reservoirs close to the origin of the river, for instance in mountainous terrain usually do not suffer from severe sedimentation issues. <br/><br/>A survey is held under authorities responsible for different reservoirs. Results indicate that not all reservoirs suffer sedimentation issues, but part of the worldwide dams and reservoirs does. <br/><br/>The most important conclusion is that sedimentation at this moment will only be dealt with if it is clearly affecting the function of a reservoir or if the function of a reservoir is threatened in the near future. The matter has to be urgent enough that owners are willing to spend funds on mitigating sedimentation issues. If added value can be gained through removing sediment this improves the business case of dredging. In the survey this is verified by the respondents.<br/><br/>Methods of dealing with reservoir sediment are discussed. Different dredging methods for the dredging of reservoirs are presented and investigated. The main advantages of dredging are found to be precise removal of sediment, avoiding large sediment flushes and no excessive loss of water.<br/>Using a 1-dimensional Sobek model, it is shown that part of the sediment entering the reservoir can be used for downstream river restoration.<br/><br/>Different factors that influence the feasibility of dredging are identified. The function of the reservoir is important. For the functions of irrigation, storage of hydro power, water supply and flood control the available volume is for example important. Sediment control is therefore important. <br/><br/>By modelling different shapes for reservoirs using Delft3D, it is found that the type of reservoir only partly determines the location of sediment in the reservoir. Other factors influencing the deposit location are sediment concentration and the type of sediment. The maximum reservoir depth is found to be linked to the dam height. <br/><br/>To determine if the dredging of reservoirs is feasible it has to be clear that the reservoir function or intake is threatened by sediment. Based on the function of the reservoir a business case can be made comparing costs and benefits. Benefits of extra reservoir volume are estimated. Possible added values are taken into account, such as the possible sale of dredged material. A dredging model is created to estimate the costs of reservoir dredging. <br/><br/>This model takes different parameters such as sediment composition, dredging depth, reservoir type and transport distance into account. Using this model for different scenarios it is shown that dredging prices can start as low as 1.01 euro. <br/>If the sediment is made up of soft and loose material this reduces the price of dredging. Furthermore the transport distance of the dredged material to shore has a large influence on the dredging costs. The transport distance for the dredged material must be kept small and the volume of material dredged must be over 25,000 $m^3$ to find a stable price. For all reservoirs these parameters are different, leading to a reservoir specific dredging price estimate. <br/><br/>Low dredging prices are possible under favourable conditions. At these prices, dredging can compete with other sediment management techniques. <br/>On top of that, the added benefits of dredging have to be taken into account: downstream river restoration, the possible sale of dredged sediment and increased downstream soil fertility. These benefits increase the feasibility of dredging a reservoir further. The dredging of certain reservoirs is seemingly beneficial. Reference reservoir dredging projects have to be performed to confirm that this<br/><br/>Further research into the deposition of sediment in different types of reservoirs is recommended. Also more investigations into the downstream return of sediment are recommended.","Reservoir sedimentation; Dredging of reservoirs; Dredging cost model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is decided to focus on this material because of the few researches available on the topic although the material being widely applied, at least in the Netherlands. The<br/>goal of adding cement to the recycled asphalt aggregate is primarily to increase the resistance to permanent deformation (rutting). But, as in all cement-bound materials, in the AGRAC base layer shrinkage cracks might occur which could reflect through the overlying asphalt layers. Because of this, during the last decades the cement content was reduced from the initial 4-5% down to 2-2.5% (by mass). <br/>In order to study the cracking behaviour of AGRAC, in this research one grading and two cement contents (2% and 4% m/m) are considered. A series of tests is performed to evaluate the properties of the two AGRAC mixes at different values of curing time (up to 130 days) and 3 different temperatures (0, 15 and 30°C). The dependence on the curing time and temperature are considered because of the presence in the mix of cement and bitumen respectively. In particular the tests performed are: indirect tensile strength, modulus of elasticity, shrinkage, thermal deformation, Poisson’s ratio and relaxation. The mechanical properties retrieved from these tests are used as input in a model which predicts the occurrence of cracks in an AGRAC base. If cracks occur, the model characterizes the crack pattern in terms of time of occurrence of the cracks, crack spacing and crack width. The calculations are done in two cases: non-weakened (plain) and weakened (with joints) base.<br/>From the laboratory tests performed a dependence of the mechanical properties of AGRAC on the material temperature is clearly visible. Interesting results are also derived from the model, which shows the influence of the time of construction of the base (the worst scenario is observed for construction in August) and the difference in the cracking behaviour between the two AGRAC mixes (2 and 4% cement m/m). It is observed that the AGRAC mix with 4% cement leads to a higher risk of cracking compared to AGRAC 2%. In the worst scenario of base with AGRAC 4% constructed in August many crack series occur with a very close final crack spacing. The model shows how in this case even applying saw-cuts in the base is inefficient in terms of controlling the crack formation process.","cement bound reclaimed asphalt; AGRAC; cement content; temperature; relaxation ITT test; crack pattern; model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the past the improvements of aero engine technology have been achieved by higher turbine inlet temperatures, higher overall pressure ratios, higher bypass ratios and more efficient components. However, these methods hold only limited potential for further improvements. Therefore, research into alternative cycle concepts started. No best solution for future aircraft engines has been identified yet and thus this research continues.<br/><br/>As part of this research, the combined cycle engine has been proposed as a new solution. It has been realised that the thermal energy of the exhaust gases is the biggest energy loss in a turbofan engine. The combined cycle engine uses a combination of a conventional turbofan engine and an additional supercritical Brayton cycle to use this exhaust gas heat to produce additional thrust power. A heat exchanger uses the exhaust gases of the main engine as the heat source for the supercritical cycle. Initial investigations showed many difficulties in the application of this cycle and limited potential for fuel burn reduction. This study aims at investigating the behaviour of different combined cycle engine designs to find an optimal design and to be able to estimate the potential of the concept based on this optimal design.<br/><br/>To predict the behaviour of the combined cycle engine, a simulation framework has been created and the results have been compared to similar investigations in literature. In addition to this, a gradient based optimization routine has been implemented to be able to optimize the system for the maximum range. With this methodology, the effect of the supercritical cycle operating conditions, the configuration of the main engine, the supercritical working fluid, the supercritical cycle configuration and the heat exchanger design have been investigated.<br/><br/>It was found that the behaviour of the system is very non linear. The optimum performance becomes a trade off between the specific fuel consumption and the weight. The operating parameters of the supercritical cycle and the heat exchanger design have the biggest impact on the system performance. The heat exchanger technology plays an important role in enabling good heat exchanger designs in that it limits the minimum size and wall thickness of the heat exchanger tubes. The addition of an inter turbine burner to the main engine was found to be beneficial to the performance of the supercritical cycle and the combined cycle engine as a whole. While a turboshaft configuration of the main engine brings thermodynamic benefits for the combined cycle engine, it causes a higher weight of the heater. Therefore, a turbofan engine is the superior main engine for the combined cycle engine.<br/><br/>The combination of a turbofan engine with an inter turbine burner and a simple recuperated supercritical carbon dioxide cycle has been identified as the best configuration of the combined cycle engine. In this configuration, the cooler is placed downstream of the fan of the main engine. The application of this cycle on a Boeing 777ER could increase the range of the aircraft by 0.46 %. With more advanced production techniques for the heat exchangers, a range increase of 2.15 % becomes possible. However, more in depth research has to be performed, to confirm these results.<br","Combined cycle engine; Waste heat recovery; Aircraft propulsion; supercritical Brayton cycle; Heat exchanger","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2017","Fatigue damage is considered to be one of the most critical phenomenon, contributing to the failure of an aircraft structure. Understanding the fatigue mechanism is essential for considering the different technical conditions that influence the fatigue life of structures. In recent years, fatigue tests are accelerated in order to reduce the testing time of materials/structures being developed, which in turn can reduce the time to market. However, an ideal fatigue experiment should involve testing the structure at its service conditions. Increasing the frequency of the fatigue test can alter the fatigue mechanisms that attribute to damage initiation and propagation. One possible solution to overcome this problem is to understand the effect of frequency on fatigue. By doing so, tests can be carried out at high frequencies and influence of frequency on damage progression can be taken into account during damage prediction. The scope of this thesis is narrowed down to carbon fibre reinforced plastics and aimed at understanding the effect of frequency on damage propagation through energy principles.<br/>Fatigue can be seen as a material degradation process through which the applied work in the form of strain energy is dissipated into damage and other energy dissipation mechanisms. Experiments were performed for Mode I delamination on double cantilever beam specimens manufactured from carbon/epoxy laminate. Within a single fatigue cycle, energy dissipation (energy that is supplied during loading phase and not returned back during unloading phase) and crack growth are mutual. In other words, crack growth occurs with the consumption of dissipated energy and energy is dissipated in creating new crack surface. For simplification of calculation, energy loss and crack growth occurring in one cycle are averaged over that cycle. The averaged quantities dU/dN and da/dN are correlated with each other for different frequencies.<br/>For the calculation of strain energy loss, strain energy at maximum displacement position is calculated from the area under load-displacement plots of the fatigue cycle. For the fatigue tests carried out at a frequency of 5 Hz, assumption that the load-displacement response is linear, holds good. For higher frequencies, the response becomes non-linear due to hysteresis effect. When strain energy was calculated for all the tests with the assumption of linear P-d response, no particular trend on the effect of frequency could be observed in da/dN vs dU/dN plots. Accounting for the non linearity in load-displacement response due to hysteresis provided light on the characterization of frequency effects. The size of hysteresis loop was approximated for different frequencies based on the observations during the experiments. It was also found that, more energy was dissipated to grow a unit crack (more crack growth resistance, 퐺∗) for a higher frequency test.<br/>Two possible mechanisms were investigated to find a suitable explanation for the observed increase in G∗ with the increase in frequency: heat dissipation and internal heat generation that would cause a rise in specimen temperature. Measurements from thermocouple and infra red camera showed that no significant temperature rise occurred in the specimen during fatigue. This confirmed that, for CFRP under mode I fatigue loading, the hysteresis energy due to high frequency fatigue testing did not heat up the specimen, but either got dissipated as heat at a rapid rate or by some other mechanism which is still not clear.<br/>When results were compared with the conceptual model formulated in this thesis, it was found that increasing the frequency increases the available energy, dU/dN and the crack growth resistance, G∗ such that crack growth rate may either increase or decrease (depending on the interaction between the two parameters). Further, a model based on quantitative measurements of heat dissipation at higher fre- quencies and determination of exact coordinates of the hysteresis loop evolution in load-displacement relationship of the fatigue cycles are recommended to fully understand the effect of test frequency in fatigue damage propagation.","fatigue; Composites; Frequency effects; mode I; delamination","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

This viable method is based on increasing the pore pressure in the reservoir and reducing the viscosity of the heavy oil. In particular cases, the increase in pore pressure and thermal expansion related to the steam injection leads to surface deformation – heave. The results show that the level of heave increases when the reservoir thickness is larger. For a 100 m thick reservoir, with a pressure increase of 5 MPa and temperature increase to 570 K, the heave is 80 mm. Increasing the reservoir thickness by a factor of two (200 m) results in an increase of heave by a factor of 1.6 (130 mm). A similar increase in heave results when we increase the pressure increment in the reservoir. In our experiments, pressure and heave are linearly related. Results depends on rock properties, most noticeably the elastic property, Young’s modulus, and thermal expansion factor. An increase in Young’s modulus leads to decrease in level of heave. An increase of thermal expansion factor leads to increase in heave. <br/>When the water required for the steam is extracted from a shallow aquifer, producing this aquifer leads to a reduction of the level of heave that is caused by steam injection. This reduction depends on the pressure reduction in the aquifer and on its thickness. For realistic dimensions and rock properties of the aquifer, this effect appears to be insignificant. Only with very low Young’s modulus (7 GPa) and very thick aquifer, the subsidence due to water depletion can compensate the expansion caused by steam injection.","steam injection; heave; subsidence; heavy oil","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Sturm on microwave reactors was continued. Microwave reactors are developed, because they have potential to increase safety and economically reduce waste. This work focused on microwaves and chemical processes, instead of just heating water, by designing a travelling microwave reactor for non-oxidative methane dehydroaromatization.<br/><br/>The travelling microwave reactor was designed using a structured approach. First, the objective was set to an economical conversion to aromatics of otherwise flared methane. Therefore, a successfully designed reactor is able to reduce the CO2 emissions and make many other reactions economical. Secondly, twenty-one challenges for microwave reactors were found using check-lists and a self-developed phenomena exploration method. This method was used to find unknown challenges on the intersection of established engineering fields. Then sub-solutions solving these challenges were extracted from existing reactors and reactor concepts. Finally, a few sub-solutions were selected and forced to work together to obtain the designed reactor.<br/><br/>The designed reactor consists of a high performance coated asymmetric annular monolith in an inert container with narrowing conductors in axial direction and an anisotropic porous media. The achieved production volume is three orders of magnitude larger than of a mono-mode microwave reactor at same operation frequency.

However, only four orders of magnitude were reached, because the designed reactor hit a flow limit.<br/><br/>The designed reactor with the three plus four order of magnitude improvement is not yet economical feasible. More advanced designs such as the spiralling narrowing rectangular microwave reactor might be. Furthermore, the designed reactor could become economically feasible in case of a more valuable product.

Research into the maintenance of the Dutch coast is continuous and causes the content of the coastline preservation program to change constantly since the initiation in 1990. In recent years, the switch was made from yearly nourishment programs to the use of multiannual nourishment programs, in which an interim nourishment planning is included for 4 years. Next to the nourishments following the ‘Dynamic Preservation’ program, ten large reinforcements were applied along the Dutch coast in the past decade according to the ‘Zwakke Schakel’ project. After reinforcement, the coastline at the ‘Zwakke Schakel’ locations needs continuous maintenance to remain at the desired position.<br/><br/>The combination of the long term maintenance at the ‘Zwakke Schakel’ locations and the multiannual nourishment program, leads to a more or less fixed character of the nourishments program with recurring maintenance nourishments in each period. The question is to what extent also the adjacent coast is maintained by sediment transported from these recurring maintenance nourishments. A situation in which the adjacent coast can be sufficiently maintained by long term application of nourishments at the ‘Zwakke Schakel’ locations, would lead to an even more fixed character of the nourishment program. At this moment, knowledge on the contribution of sediment transported from beach nourishments to the maintenance of the adjacent coast is insufficient. <br/><br/>The research presented in this thesis focusses on one case study. Along the coastal stretch between Scheveningen and IJmuiden, three distinct ‘Zwakke Schakel’ reinforcement nourishments were applied at Scheveningen, Katwijk and Noordwijk. At all locations the coastline was migrated seawards, with varying distances of 60 to 100 meters. The coastal stretch between Scheveningen and IJmuiden is part of the Holland coast and bounded by the breakwaters of the Scheveningen and IJmuiden harbours. Along the Holland coast, sediment transport is dominated by wave related processes wherein longshore transport is the most important sediment transport process. Gradients in longshore sediment transport are therefore an important cause of erosion and accretion. <br/>Results of the yearly measurements done along the entire Dutch coast already show a positive effect of the maintenance nourishments in the area. With a refined version of an existing Unibest-CL+ model the effect of the recurring maintenance is further assessed for the long term. In the model, the longshore sediment transport volumes and resulting coastline evolution are modelled for a timescale of 55 years, starting in 2006 before application of the ‘Zwakke Schakel’ reinforcement nourishments and including the effect of possible sea level rise of 0.2 to 1.5 cm per year. The model is validated by comparing transport quantities (volumes and gradients) and coastline development with real measurement results and results from earlier research.<br/><br/>In order to maintain a positive coastline position along the adjacent coast, the autonomous erosion needs to be sufficiently compensated by the accretion related to the long term maintenance. At several locations in the area of interest initial erosion is expected, after which the erosional trend switches into a seaward migrating trend on the long term, partly under influence of the maintenance nourishments. This process is expected to occur at both Wassenaar (between Scheveningen and Katwijk) and Noordwijkerhout (north of Noordwijk) in the upcoming decades, although the inclusion of some uncertainty in amongst others sea level rise shows that it is unsure whether a positive development at Noordwijkerhout will really occur. The erosional trend at Bloemendaal and Zandvoort, close to IJmuiden, cannot be compensated by the sediment transported from maintenance nourishments. On the time scale of 55 years, the region of influence of the maintenance nourishments does not reach Bloemendaal and Zandvoort. The regions of influence of all ‘Zwakke Schakel’ maintenance nourishments are expected to cover the area from Scheveningen up to around 10 kilometres northwards from Noordwijk in 2060. Individual regions of influences are expected to reach a size of 15 to 24 kilometres up to 2060.<br/><br/>Although in most cases the trends of coastline development within the regions of influence are expected to become positive on the long term, the coastline position itself may be located too much landwards due to the initial erosion. In order to solve this problem, additional (shoreface) nourishments need to be applied at Wassenaar and Noordwijkerhout. At both locations shoreface nourishments are already applied in the past decades, which supports the outcome of the model results. At Bloemendaal and Zandvoort, additional (shoreface) nourishments will surely be needed in order to maintain the coastline. <br","coastal engineering; coastline maintenance; coastline preservation; beach nourishments; Unibest; nourishment program; Rijkswaterstaat; longshore transport","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","KPP B&O Kust",""

The hunting simulator is an animal enclosure wherein a piece of meat, used as prey, is moved by means of a joystick-controlled cable-driven system. The animal caretakers find it difficult to operate the hunting simulator effectively: the position of the prey relative to the hunting cat and enclosure is hard to judge. Evading the fast unpredictable cats requires high prey velocities without crashing into obstacles or enclosure walls. In this study it is hypothesized that providing the operators with haptic assistance through the joystick will help them to improve their performance, i.e. it will allow them to navigate the prey through the enclosure at higher velocities while having fewer collisions. Haptic assistance was designed as a force-stiffness feedback algorithm based on the inverse Time-to-Collision. It was implemented on a purposefully designed virtual hunting simulator operated through a force-feedback gaming joystick. Naive subjects (n=10) participated in an experiment in which they were asked to navigate the virtual prey through a series of waypoints, without hitting the boundaries of the virtual enclosure or the obstacles within it, both with and without the designed haptic assistance. Results show that haptic assistance leads to significant benefits for the operators, as they moved significantly faster while having significantly fewer collisions. In conclusion, the designed haptic assistance is beneficial when used in the virtual hunting simulator, and therefore constitutes a promising method that warrants implementation and evaluation in the real- world hunting simulator.","Haptic Assistance; Collision Avoidance; Time-to-Collision; Haptic Joystick","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Biomechanical Design - BioRobotics","",""

Numerical simulations are performed for horizontal core-annular flow by using the Volume of fluid (VOF) method to solve the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations (RANS) in OpenFOAM. Periodic boundary conditions are used for a small pipe section. With periodic boundary conditions the maximum wavelength at the oil-water interface is imposed together with the oil and water holdup fractions.<br/><br/>Numerical results are compared with recent experimental data. Oil viscosities between 3338 cSt at 20°C and 383 cSt at 50°C are solved with a fixed total flow rate. The 20°C simulation converged to the desired water cut of 20%, similar to the experiment. At this 20% water cut a comparable pressure<br/>gradient is found with the experiment. At higher temperatures (i.e. lower viscosities) deviations from the desired water cut of 20% are obtained. The different water cut values lead to differences between the numerical and experimental pressure gradients.<br/><br/>Additional simulations are carried out for the oil viscosity of 718 cSt at 40°C. Instead of a fixed total flow rate these simulations are solved with a fixed pressure gradient. This solving method is found to be considerable faster. Different holdup fractions and pressure gradients are imposed which resulted in different water cut and flow rate values. Numerical results are interpolated for the experimental water cut values of 9%, 12% and 15% at similar flow rates. Differences of 98%, 24% and 37% are found for the water cut of 9%, 12% and 15% respectively.

The yard specializes in the design, manufacture and supply of a wide variety of dredging tools. One of the tools Damen offers is the Trailing Suction Hopper Dredger(TSHD).<br/><br/>The performance of such a TSHD is described by its production: the amount of sediment loaded in the hopper per unit time. The overflow loss, the material lost overboard, can easily reach up to 30%, which causes a significant decrease of the production. In addition, the turbidity plume caused by these overflow losses can have a negative environmental impact. This turbidity plume reduces light penetration, clogs filter feeders, and disperses contaminants which can be attached to the sediment. Damen is interested in estimating and reducing these overflow losses. Different models to estimate the amount of material lost overboard exist. All these models have their pros and cons. The analytical model of Miedema &amp; Vlasblom(1996) gives a quick and good estimate of the overflow losses, but gives no insight in the flow inside the hopper. The 2DV model of Van Rhee(2002) is able to accurately simulate the flow inside the hopper, but has a large computation time. The 2DV model of this thesis gives a good estimate of the overflow losses, gives insight in the flow inside the hopper, and has an acceptable computation time.<br/><br/>The new 2DV model was developed in OpenFOAM. At the start of this thesis, it was possible to model mixture flow in OpenFOAM, but a sand bed could not be modelled yet. Several features had to be added to OpenFOAM to overcome this problem. The sand bed was regarded as a solid body inside the computational domain. To simulate the influence of this solid body on the mixture flow, boundary conditions were added at the bed interface. Sedimentation was modelled by adding a moving mesh. The closed flume experiments of Van Rhee(2002) have been used to validate that sedimentation is simulated accurately. By comparing hopper simulations with the hopper experiments of Van Rhee(2002), it was shown that the flow in the hopper was also simulated accurately. The computed overflow losses are, however, on the low side. The current version of OpenFOAM can calculate with only one particle fraction. In reality, the smaller fractions of the Particle Size Distribution are pushed upwards, causing the overflow losses to be higher. The 2DV-model gave a deeper insight to the phenomena in the hopper. It was possible to derive several equations which describe the flow in the hopper. With these new formulas, a simple phenomenological model was developed, which was named the 'Layer Model'.","sedimentation; hopper; OpenFOAM; CFD; overflow losses","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-12-31","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","OpenFOAM",""

The recent hurricanes Harvey and Irma are examples of the great devastation that can be caused by a single event, and of the insufficient level of preparedness that is currently present to withstand the adverse effects of such an event. Even in the U.S., which suffers relatively frequently from TCs, and has an extensive track record of historical events, the consequences of Harvey were unforeseen and destructive. Difficulties in determining extreme TC conditions, whether these are rain, wind, wave or storm surge conditions, mostly come from the fact that severe adverse effects caused by TCs are very local. This is the case because the exact track, intensity and size of the storm determine to a large extent which area is affected the most, and what the consequences are for the hydraulic conditions. Small variations in any of these parameters can greatly influence the conditions at any location. This is already the case in regions which suffer relatively often from TCs. In regions that do not suffer as regularly from TCs, data scarcity makes it even more difficult to anticipate adverse consequences. In these regions TCs are nevertheless often responsible for the most severe conditions, and the effects of such events should therefore be quantified in order be able to prepare for such conditions. For extreme cyclone wave conditions specifically, there is an additional problem of feasibly determining extreme wave conditions from cyclone wind conditions. This research presents the Tropical Cyclone Wind Statistical Estimation Tool (TCWiSE) to determine extreme TC wind speeds and focuses on the determination of its accuracy in data scarce regions.

Select the Accelerated Bridge Construction (ABC) approach:<br/>By means of lateral sliding or transportation by SPMTs (Self-Propelled Modular Transporters) entire superstructures can be constructed off-site and transported to their final location in a matter of hours.<br/><br/>2. Retain the existing foundations:<br/>In terms of on-site construction time it would be beneficial to retain the existing foundations. Additionally, theory suggests that a profit in bearing capacity can be obtained compared to the current design codes, which might lead to the total elimination of additional foundation elements required.<br/><br/>3. Avoid intermediate supports:<br/>Less elements are required if intermediate supports are avoided in the new bridge design. This does however lead to longer spans, and to prevent additional groundwork activities from an increase in deck height a higher slenderness must be obtained. Furthermore, the new superstructure design must be as light as possible, not only to allow for foundation retainment, but also to facilitate transportation and speed of erection.<br/><br/>In particular, the technical feasibility of these actions - both separately and combined - required more research. A case study considering a two-span plate bridge was used to investigate these strategy actions. Research was done into the obtainable profit in retained pile foundations and the application of UHPC in a slender and lightweight bridge concept.<br/><br/>It was concluded that the proposed tender strategy has a high potential. Not only is the on-site reduction time diminished but the retainment of the existing foundations and the application of UHPC in a slender and lightweight superstructure may also lead to a highly sustainable design.<br","UHPC; Foundations; UHPFRC; Piles; Set-up; Group effect; Advanced Cementitious Materials; Slenderness; Lightweight; Bridge replacement; Concrete; Infrastructure; Retain; Reuse","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(mentor); Mitici, M.A. (mentor); Lissone, Mike (mentor); Colin, Dominique (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2017","Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS) are becoming more and more popular with an increasing number of companies using them in the fields of precision agriculture, emergency delivery of medical aid and preventive maintenance. Trials are being made to extend their use to public safety, monitoring traffic, providing internet and even air taxi services. These RPAS operations are currently handled on a case-by-case basis and operated in segregated airspace by creating temporary restricted areas for other traffic. With the SESAR Joint Undertaking (SJU) estimating that in the next 30 years 20% of the traffic will be remotely piloted, the option of airspace segregation will no longer be feasible. Therefore, integrating RPAS with current manned operations will be required. In doing so, however, the current levels of safety and efficiency should not be compromised. The command and control link (C2), which connects the remotely piloted aircraft and the remote pilot station, plays a pivotal role in the controllability of the aircraft, ATC communication and conflict detection and avoidance systems (CD&amp;A). This project, which is conducted between Delft University of Technology and EUROCONTROL, aims at establishing a methodology of determining how different percentages of flights that are remotely piloted and different C2 link failure rates influence the number of separation losses (blind encounters). For this, fast time simulations of a 24-hour period of the Dutch airspace are performed in AirTOp. This study will contribute to the integration of RPAS in non-segregated airspace and will serve as an input for the regulatory bodies which are yet to set performance standards on RPAS, particularly the C2 link. Replacing between 10 - 50% of the flights in the Dutch airspace by RPAS with failure rates of the C2 link of 0.01 - 0.001 resulted in 1 - 15 flights being replaced by an RPAS with C2 link failure. This generated an additional number of blind encounters between 1.8 - 23.6, or an increase of 0.09 - 1.18% compared to the baseline situation (same traffic, no RPAS). Also, a linear relationship was found between the number of RPAS experiencing a failure of the C2 link and the number of blind encounters. The project also investigates how an RPAS that experiences a failure of the C2 link right at the moment when it enters an ATC sector in Langen FIR (EDGGPHHM) penalizes key ATM performance indicators. The considered KPIs are: number of potential conflicts, air traffic controller task load, sector occupancy, distance flown, flight time, fuel consumption and altitude deviation. The scope is limited to en-route operations above 500 ft and the contingency strategy followed by the RPAS once it loses the C2 link is to proceed to its destination along its originally submitted flight plan. At the same time, air traffic controllers would enforce a separation bubble around the RPAS, such that a buffer is created for the situations in which the remotely piloted aircraft might deviate from it route or behave erratically. Two RPAS performance models are considered: MQ-9 Reaper, a turboprop with a lower cruise speed and climb/descent performance than current civil aircraft and RQ-4A Global Hawk, a turbofan with a cruise speed close to that of civil aircraft and a rate of climb slightly higher. The results of the Monte Carlo tests are analyzed using ANOVA and MANOVA tests. Increasing the size of the separation bubble around the RPAS with C2 link failure by 20%, 40% and 60% resulted in an increase in the number of potential conflicts of 8.3%, 9.2% and 12.0% when a MQ-9 was used. The impact on controller task load was found to be small (increase of 0.4%) and not affected by the size of the separation bubble. Similarly the other KPIs were not affected by a separation increases of up to 60%. Switching 10-30% of the flights to RPAS and using even larger sizes of the separation bubble (twice or three times as large as the minimum ICAO standards) increased the number of potential conflicts by up to 72.9%, sector occupancy by 11.2% and the additional time spent in the sector by 1.4%. Based on the separation requirements which will be enforced around RPAS, the methodology used in the report can be used to assess the impact of experiencing a C2 link loss on the ATM environment.","RPAS; C2 Link; AirTOp; Fast-time simulation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2017-12-12","","","","Aerospace Engineering","","50.8793199, 4.433191699999952"

This will be done by using a macroscopic traffic flow model (the S-Model) to simulate the real-time traffic flows inside a network. A microscopic emission model (the VT-micro emission model) is further added to also include impact of the vehicle behaviour (accelerating, decelerating, driving at a constant speed, etc.) on the total amount of emission gasses that are exhausted by the vehicles inside the traffic network. <br/><br/>In this thesis the optimization algorithms will be investigated with respect to the reduction of the cost function as well as the computation time needed compute the (sub)optimal solution. The cost function can consist of the Total Time Spent (TTS) by the vehicles inside the network, the Total Emissions (TE) the vehicles exhaust while inside the network, or a combination of both. <br/><br/>We make use of Matlab for implementation of the models and the optimization algorithms and SUMO as a traffic simulator, which will be used to simulate a real-time traffic network. <br/><br/>The traffic flow model and the emission model are both non-smooth and non-convex, which in general would require the use of a global optimization algorithm together with multiple starting points. We also use a smoothening function on the models to work with a local optimization algorithm that works with derivatives of the cost function and both models. By using multiple starting points for this method, we hope to obtain similar results. The optimization algorithms that are implemented and investigated in this thesis are: the Genetic Algorithm (GA), the Simulated Annealing (SA) algorithm, the Pattern Search (PS) algorithm, and the Resilient backPROPagation (RPROP) algorithm. <br/><br/>To compare the results of the four optimization algorithms, four different scenarios are considered. The final results show that all control methods perform better than the FT controller. Overall the GA algorithm performs best without using a multi-start approach, with PS and SA having similar results. The RPROP method is either close to the other methods (0-2%) or quite far off (10-15%), depending on the scenario. When looking at computation time, PS is the fastest. It is twice as fast compared to the GA in most scenarios. SA however takes around fifteen times the amount of computation time compared to the GA. RPROP has varying results again compared to the GA algorithm. A better cost function for the TTS as well as a more optimized algorithm for the RPROP method can resolve both of these issues but future work might need to prove this.","Traffic control; urban; optimization algorithms","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(graduation committee); Ås, Sigmund (graduation committee); Luiken, Ralph (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution); Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) (degree granting institution)","2017","A global focus on the shift to renewable energy has introduced international targets for sustainable energy production, which have strongly increased the interest in offshore wind turbines (OWT’s). In order to make offshore wind energy even more competitive, the levelised cost of energy for this industry has to be brought down. One of the OWT aspects that can still be developed further, with respect to the cost, is the foundation. As these structures usually have a design lifetime of 25 years and are subjected to cyclic loading, the foundation design is often driven by the fatigue limit state. In order to monitor the fatigue damage imposed on the structure, the stress history at certain “hot spots” needs to be known. Whereas measuring at every hot spot is not feasible, schemes have been developed to estimate the stresses based on a limited amount of sensors. <br/><br/>In this study two distinct approaches for the estimation of operational strains are investigated. The first approach is based on interpolation of section forces which are obtained from strain measurements at different levels; subsequently interpolated section forces can be transformed into strains using basic constitutive relations from structural mechanics. Since the strain measurements have to be taken from the region of interest, i.e. below the mudline, Fibre-Bragg Grating strain sensors are suggested for this application since they are both light and small, thus increasing their chance of survival during pile driving. It is found that the underlying assumption for the Section Force Interpolation (SFI) method, that the moment distribution between two measurement levels can be approximated as varying linearly with the distance to the point of interest, is valid. Therefore, the bending moment of a point in between two measurement levels can be calculated, as well as the related strains.<br/><br/>The second approach is the Multi-Band Modal Decomposition and Expansion (MDE) technique that was introduced by Iliopoulos et al. [1]. This method uses numerically or experimentally obtained structural mode shapes to expand a number of vibrational response measurements into modal responses for a considered frequency band of the measurement data. For OWT’s one quasi-static and two dynamic bands are considered. The total operational strains are obtained by superposition of the strain contributions estimated from each band. Modal strain distributions and strain sensors are used to estimate the strain response in the quasi-static band and a combination of mode shapes, modal strain distributions and accelerometers is used to estimate the strains contribution from the dynamic bands. Furthermore, it is investigated if the Mulit-Band MDE method can be improved to reduce its sensitivity to measurement noise; therefore the Least-Squares (LS) algorithm is replaced by a weighted LS algorithm which can assign weight to measurements according to their relative noise levels. <br/><br/>A number of sensor arrangements and load cases are investigated to find the sensitivity of the estimation accuracy of the Multi-Band MDE method. As the error in the estimation of fatigue consumption should be narrowed down to 2%, it is essential that the optimal sensor arrangement is selected for each operational condition. It has been found that both estimation techniques perform well for uncontaminated input signals, where the MDE outperforms the SFI method. However, if significant levels of white noise are introduced to the measurement signals, the accuracy of the results obtained with the MDE strongly decreases, whereas the SFI technique shows a lower sensitivity to measurement noise.<br/><br/>[1] A.

These bactericidal surfaces are artificially mimicked on the surface of the implant to reduce the infection rate, which is one of the main complication after joint replacement. The bactericidal properties of the nanopatterned surface are a promising feature. However, the non-cytotoxicity of the surface of the implants should not be compromised. So far, no optimal nanopatterned surface regarding the geometrical features has been found yet. This study focusses on the computational modeling of the nanopatterned surface using Finite Element approaches to simulate the interaction between bacterial cells (Staphylococcus aureus) and host cells (osteoblast) with the nanopatterned surface. The final aim of the project is to show how geometrical features of the nanopatterned surfaces can influence the bacteria’s and cell’s fate. The geometrical parameters of the nanopatterned surface are height, width, interspace, radius and the shape and are varied to create different types of nanopatterned surfaces. The simulations have been performed based on the experimental examination of the bactericidal and cytotoxicity properties of nanopatterned surfaces. From the numerical analysis, it is concluded that among different geometrical parameters of the nanopatterned surface, only width and interspace of the nanopillars have a direct bactericidal effect. The nanopatterned surface with a small/intermediate width (50 nm) in combination with a large interspace (300 nm) has been found as the most optimal nanopattern resulting in bactericidal properties and non-cytotoxic properties for host cells. The results of this project can be considered as a guideline for the proper design of geometry of nanopatterned surfaces and can be verified by further experimental investigations.","Nanopatterned surfaces; Finite Element modelling; Bactericidal properties; Non-cytotoxic properties; Parametric study; Optimization study; Geometrical features","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-12-12","","","","Biomedical Engineering | Tissue Biomechanics and Implants","",""

It confirmed the initial expectation that an increased expansion angle significantly decreases the total pressure recovery, a measure of efficiency, that is achieved by the intake.

By using the prediction model’s outputs to virtually trigger vehicle loop detectors, the outputs of an adaptive controller can be extracted in advance of actual vehicle arrivals. This will enable service providers to send out time to green/red (T2G/R) information or green light optimal speed advice (GLOSA), which are driver assistance use cases that aim to efficiently guide vehicles through intersections, in anticipation of known upcoming signal states. The main requirements for developing the prediction model are that it should be scalable to different intersection configurations, adaptable to different traffic conditions and should encompass the nonlinearity of traffic flow behavior. Since it fits these criteria, the developed model is a multi-task learning recurrent neural network with exogenous inputs (NARX), which is designed to match the traffic flow simulation abilities of a well adopted analytical traffic flow progression model. Both models were tested for a corridor in Delft that experiences almost consistent free flow conditions, and on an intersection in Haarlem with varying traffic conditions. For both case studies the neural network outperformed the analytical model. Most notably, it was better adaptable to long queues at intersections, had lower average error values, made fewer large errors, and better recognized the effect of a source/sink. When interfaced with an adaptive controller to test the predictive control methodology proposed, the superiority of the designed neural network model over the analytical model became more prominent. At no point did the neural network’s prediction errors result in queue spill-back, which was not true for the analytical model. However, the overall accuracy of the NARX model was still not yet satisfactory enough for practical application (especially for highly under-saturated traffic conditions) without the use of corrective measures. Nonetheless, due to its significant superiority over the widely used analytical model, with regards to both accuracy and adaptability, this model can be considered as a new starting point for traffic flow progression modeling.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-10-15","","","","Transport, Infrastructure and Logistics","",""

The focus of this research is hence the design, simulation and evaluation of a possible cast glass interlocking geometry using Finite Element Analysis (FEA). For this purpose, design criteria are formulated from literature; considering glass, polyurethane (used as interlayer) and interlocking systems. As interlocking systems are determined by their boundary conditions, a case study of a monument is chosen to provide additional design criteria. The goal of the case study is to provide a reversible and reusable restoration and consolidation alternative for the current invalid restorations.<br/> The design criteria obtained then are combined into an initial geometry, whose parameters are varied to test their sensitivity to its shear capacity, using FEA. Christensen’s failure criterion is used to locate prone areas in the geometry, and to evaluate the theoretical moment of failure. This output value combines the three principal stresses into a failure envelope, hence can generate contour plots to envision peak-stress-prone areas. This is important especially for glass structures, as they are prone to peak tensile stresses.<br/> From the results design diagrams are created and applied on a conceptual cast glass interlocking consolidation design for the monument chosen as case study: The Lichtenberg Castle ruin.<br/> The initial design is moreover prototyped to check its interlocking capabilities, residual stresses and deviations introduced by shrinkage. <br/> <br/>Being able to evaluate possible geometries using FEA can decrease costs and time when searching for a new interlocking geometry. Prone areas are easily highlighted using the Christensen’s failure criterion output. Hence peak stress sensitive or invalid geometries can be discarded before reaching the prototyping stage, which is time consuming and costly.<br/> The creation of a methodology to predict this behaviour is hence valuable for further research on other cast glass geometries and can moreover be applied in any other field when analysing solid complex geometries.<br/> Another goal is to find a cast glass brick design which not only can consolidate the monument of the case study, but is moreover applicable in other projects or configurations. The brick then is not a one-solution design, but can be reused in other projects. <br/> <br/>The geometry hence is varied using Grasshopper plug-in for Rhinoceros. By exporting the geometry using a STEP-file, a solid can be loaded into DIANA FEA, where it can be analysed using their newly implemented output value of the Christensen’s failure criterion.<br/> The geometry of the monument is gained through a 3D laser scan, resulting in a point cloud. The point cloud is adapted using Autodesk Recap, then further processed in Rhinoceros. <br/> <br/>The Christensen’s failure criterion output is a proper and fast way to evaluate possible cast glass brick designs. Any compressive stresses on the interlocking brick geometry are beneficial for its shear capacity, as is an increase in interlocking amplitude or brick height. Increasing the amplitude however affects the allowable tolerance negatively, which is also the case for a decrease in brick height. Decreasing the brick height hence results in both negative effects.<br/> The conceptual design for consolidation of the Lichtenberg Castle tower can replace the current interventions with equal or higher capacity, even for all conservative assumptions and simplifications. The design can still be altered less conservative after more experimental results and simulations come available. <br/> <br/>The methodology applied can now be further developed and performed on other complex geometry designs. The presented multifunctional cast glass interlocking brick design, and its variations can be further investigated and applied in other projects.","computational design; cast glass; interlock; Christensen; Monuments; consolidation; Glass; Finite Element Analysis; polyurethane; Lichtenberg; ruin; Structural Design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Building Engineering - Structural Design","4TU Bouw",""

Reclamation is the process of creating new land from ocean, riverbeds or lake beds. New land is created by hydraulic placement of sand. The hydraulically placed fills are characterized by low densities and show a high variety in packing throughout the field. The relative density of the fills depend on placement method and whether the placement takes place aqueous or subaqueous. After the placement Vibro-densification techniques are used to densify the soil. Conventional vibro-densification techniques have difficulties penetrating hard soil layers to reach the loosely packed layers. This makes that land reclamation is not always financially feasible. The Sonic drilling technique might be used to improve the penetration in hard layers. Reducing the process time make the use of land reclamation more accessible. However, the sonic drill technology is not well understood at the moment. There are no reliable guidelines that make it able to estimate the driveability of a certain profile in to the ground with the help of sonic vibrations. This research focusses on better understanding of the sonic drill technology and the contribution of a sonic drill to a new compaction technique.<br/><br/>On a reclaimed land site in Amsterdam an innovative method for installing elements in dense and hard sand layers was tested. The method focuses on sonic drilling/installation with vibrations up to 180Hz to reduce soil resistance whilst pushing the elements into the ground. This method has shown to generate less disturbances to the surroundings whilst achieving a higher penetration rate in comparison to conventional installation methods. <br/>The sonic vibrator generates pressure waves at the top of the element. The elasticity together with the inertial properties of the element allow the waves to propagate through the element. The pressure waves travel through the element and become partially transmitted to the surrounding soil. At the sides the mainly shear waves occur while at the tip both pressure and shear waves are present. During the wave propagation energy is lost due to scattering, radial damping and proper damping. <br/>The sonic drill technology uses high frequency vibrations to strongly reduce soil resistance. The resistance of the element against penetration is reduced by liquefaction, inertia effects and a temporary reduction of porosity of the soil.<br/>The observations from the tests form the basis for the establishment of model which simulates vibratory pile driving. The model is able to describe the installation process for different type of elements. The model might be used in the future to predict the penetration time using only the CPT data.<br/>It can be concluded from the tests that the sonic vibration method is an effective solution for installing elements in a short amount of time in challenging ground conditions and with minimal vibration and settlement disturbance. <br/>Finally, in terms of further study, it must be noted that several major simplifications and assumptions underlie the model, which may be improved upon with more rigorous constitutive modelling and numerical analysis.<br","Sonic drilling; High frequency vibrations; Field tests; Soil improvement; Hard soil","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-12-11","","","","Geo-Engineering","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2017","An important design choice for Haptic Shared Control is the magnitude of assisting forces: high assisting forces are beneficial during agreement between operator and controller, but also result in larger conflict forces in case of disagreement. In order to use higher forces without increasing conflict forces, literature proposes Adaptable Haptic Shared Control: using real-time operator grip force measurements to smoothly scale the magnitude of assisting forces. For full hand grip force no objective measurements comparing Haptic Shared Control versus Adaptable Haptic Shared Control are known and only very limited data on this comparison is available for finger pinching and subjective measurements. In order to prove that, using grip force to adapt the magnitude of assisting forces indeed leads to reduced conflict forces while maintaining the regular Haptic Shared Control performance during agreement, an experiment is required. It is hypothesized that Adaptable Haptic Shared Control will reduce conflict forces during disagreement and that the larger the disagreement the higher the grip force. Both an Adaptable and regular Haptic Shared Controller are designed and implemented on an actuated joystick, which is extended with a 2D dynamometer to allow real-time grip measurements. Eighteen subjects participated in an experiment where they used the Triar joystick to steer a virtual object along a path consisting of a multisine (agreement) interspersed with straight sections containing obstacles that needed to be avoided (conflict). After the adaptable and regular haptic shared control condition a Vanderlaan questionnaire was provided to the participant with the question to score them compared to manual control. During the path following task, both the Adaptable Haptic Shared controller and regular haptic shared controller provide similar increased performance in lateral deviation compared to manual control (p&lt;0.01). During obstacle avoidance, the Adaptable Haptic shared control significantly decreased conflict forces compared to haptic shared control (p&lt;0.01), but at a price of brief increased grip force. No significant difference in grip force was found between obstacles sizes (conflict). The subjective usefulness and satisfying score of adaptable and regular haptic shared control are both positive compared to manual but do not significantly differ from each other. Result show that with Adaptable Haptic Shared Control humans prefer increasing their grip force to lower the Haptic Shared Control forces during disagreement.

The property of thinness stems from shells’ capacity to store membrane strain energy without much deformation. As a result, buckling failures often govern the design of shell structures. These buckling failures usually start locally, at a location where a combination of curvature and membrane forces is met. Moreover, shells tend to be imperfection-sensitive structures, that is, real-life shells (with initial geometric imperfections) usually cannot resist loads as high as the theoretically predicted critical buckling load. Advanced finite element analyses can accurately predict these so-called nonlinear buckling loads but require significant time and computation effort. On the other hand, current design equations are simple yet highly inaccurate and often penalize strength significantly. This treatise caters a Python script that executes nonlinear finite element analyses (using ANSYS Mechanical APDL) to generate a database of the nonlinear buckling loads of shell portions with varying membrane forces, curvatures and magnitudes of initial geometric imperfections. The aim, beyond the scope of this treatise, is to perform a parametric regression on said database to device design equation(s) that accurately predict the nonlinear buckling load of linear-elastic shell structures with initial geometric imperfections based merely on the linear elastic results of a geometrically perfect shell model.","thin-shell; nonlinear; buckling; imperfections; curvature; membrane forces","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These spectra represent material properties, i.e. the spectral signatures. So, classification of HS imagery is based on material properties. This thesis describes a framework to perform pixelwise classification of HS images of a fixed scene subject to varying ambient conditions. TNO has recorded HS images over the course of one year, every hour between sunrise and sunset. Therefore, this data set is subject to a range of lighting, weather and seasonal conditions, degrading the recorded data. Traditionally, atmospheric models are used to correct for these effects, recovering spectral information. In this work a Fully Convolutional Neural Network (FCN) is trained to perform the segmentation task which also learns to correct for ambient conditions, eliminating the need of implementing an atmospheric model or applying image normalization. A single FCN (U-Net) is implemented to solve a five-class segmentation problem, distinguishing broad leaf trees, grass, sand, asphalt and artificial grass. To start training a neural network, the training data set requires a corresponding ground truth. A sparsely annotated mask is designed which fits images covering the entire recording period. In single-scene segmentation, annotating using a sparse mask is a quick method which allows for moving object borders. Furthermore, it avoids inclusion of mixed pixels. In order to reduce computational load, the training data set is formed by many small patches taken from the original HS images. Consequently, the network is trained with local spectral-spatial information. Training the standard U-Net proves to be limited to training data sets under relatively constant ambient conditions. In order to further enhance generalization over seasons, the network weights are rearranged so that a similar number of weights is maintained. This network is essential for training a complex training data set, as it is able to extract more informative features. The standard U-Net trained with a simple training data set (i.e. relatively constant ambient conditions) achieves an accuracy A &gt; 94% for both sunny and rainy test images irrespective of time of the day. However, this model is valid for a limited period of time. The customized U-Net trained with a complex training data set (i.e. highly varying ambient conditions) yields segmentations with an accuracy ranging between 86 and 93%. This model is valid for a longer period of time, covering multiple seasons. So the experiments show that there is a trade-off between segmentation accuracy and duration of model validity, which is controlled by network weight arrangement.","Deep Learning; Convolutional Neural Network; Fully Convolutional Neural network; Image segmentation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2017","The recent advances in complementary technologies have given a new impulse in the research activities related to distributed propulsion. Light electric engines, whose performance is rather insensitive to scaling, improved battery capacities and autonomous flight all contribute to this trend. Promising concepts featuring electrically powered distributed propellers along the wings are expected to improve aero-propulsive efficiency, high-lift capability, vertical take-off &amp; landing capability and operating costs. Problems associated to the exploitation of these benefits are, among others, the many new design freedoms and the associated growing design space. The design space exploration requires new tools that are capable of dealing with lifting surfaces, interacting strongly with multiple propellers. Furthermore, the tool's ability to include viscous and thickness-effects is crucial for understanding and assessing the new vehicle architectures. The goal of this thesis is twofold and starts with the implementation and validation of a body-force approach to model propellers in a (U)RANS simulation by volumetric source terms. A coupled lifting-line code, being executed in the extracted RANS flowfield, provides the propeller blade forces that are acting on the fluid. The validation is performed by comparing the simulation method on closely coupled propeller-wing configuration with a meshed-propeller URANS simulation. The comparison shows a very good agreement for the two different approaches. A further comparison to an experimental set-up of an over-the-wing propeller provides further confidence in the methods capability of modelling propellers in the close vicinity of a lifting surface. The second goal is the better understanding of the flow phenomena for selected promising configurations. On the one hand, wing-tip mounted propellers in pusher and tractor arrangements are compared for non-twisted and ideally-twisted wings. The thrust-drag balanced configurations show that the total required shaft power is less for a pusher arrangement in case of a non-twisted wing. For the ideally-twisted wing, the two arrangements are equally good in reducing required shaft power. The tractor arrangements have a wing drag reduction of 10% while the pusher arrangements show an increase in propulsive efficiency of 8-9%. The isolated lifting-line simulations showed that the tool is capable of capturing the trends but that it cannot achieve the accuracy of a viscous analysis. On the other hand, lift-augmenting propellers have been installed in front of the leading edge as well as on different chord-wise positions over the wing. The over-the-wing installed propellers showed the highest increase in lift coefficient (up to 107%) whilst strongly decreasing wing-drag. A more upstream positioned propeller achieved a higher drag reduction but a downstream positioned propeller showed higher lift augmentation. The leading edge propellers had the highest lift increase (60%) when being contra-rotating. For the high-lift propeller configurations, the lifting-line code was able to capture major trends. The performed work shows for the first time a viscous analysis on how wing-tip mounted propellers can improve the aero-propulsive efficiency of a configuration and compares trimmed pusher and tractor arrangements. It was further shown, how the new body-force approach can lead to very accurate viscous simulations of distributed propeller-wing configurations with relatively low computational effort.","distributed propulsion; aerodynamics; CFD; propeller-wing interaction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2017-12-08","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

In Janssen (2014) a new wavefront reconstruction algorithm is introduced to be used with the Shack-Hartmann sensor that does not present cross-talk. To our knowledge, this method has never been demonstrated. In the current research, Janssen's method and the conventional least-squares method are compared on a modified Michelson interferometer setup with a spatial light modulator to first remove the aberrations of the complete system, and subsequently introduce specific aberrations for which the Zernike coefficients are reconstructed using both reconstruction methods. It is found that both methods work equally well with optimal fitting powers. When fitting fewer than the optimal amount of fitting powers, it was found that Janssen's method accurately recovered Zernike coeficient amn when n + 1 powers are fit, while the conventional method achieves the same accuracy only at n + 2 fitting powers, especially when aberrations introducing cross-talk are present. When more than the optimal amount Zernike powers are used, it is seen that Janssen's method presents aliasing at lower fitting powers. At the optimal fitting power, the RMS landscape for both methods is shown to be similar, and therefore they are equally susceptible to errors due to mis- estimation of the center position and radius of the beam on the ShackHartmann<br/>sensor.

Current techniques in Infection Prevention Control consist mainly of using chemical agents which leave chemical waste hazardous for Health care personnel. Typical chemical disinfectants needs minutes($&gt;$ 2 minutes) to be reduce the bacteria load by 1log10(90\%) reduction where in sterilization a respected 6log10(99.9999\%) reduction need to be achieved. A potent technique in effectively and efficiently reducing bacteria load is considered in replacing current Infection Prevention techniques. Plasma, especially Cold Atmospheric Plasma, is a upcoming effective technique in reducing bacteria load by the way plasma attacks the prokaryote’s cell envelope, proteins and DNA. Plasma studies show effective reduction of various common pathogenic micro-organisms like Methicillin-Resistant S.Aureus. The simple technique is already applied in the reducing bacteria load in the food industry, disinfection of wounds and tissue generation and pose no health risk when applied on human skin. This Master's project focuses on the implementation of Cold Atmospheric Plasma in Health care.

Along with the development of remote sensing instruments, the first methods that were developed to nowcast precipitation are based on the extrapolation of radar echoes, which are still widely employed in mobile and web applications today. However, the forecasting skill of these extrapolation based methods degrades rapidly with time. Especially in the case of convective rainfall extrapolation methods are not able to forecast the development of these precipitation events that have a more turbulent nature, primarily because they lack the description of the physical processes that govern the formation and dissipation of convective precipitation. For that reason, efforts in nowcasting are shifting towards numerical weather prediction (NWP) based methods. “High resolution” (&lt;4km) NWP models covering a limited area are employed for their ability to describe large scale convection. Still, especially for accurately forecasting precipitation, these high resolution models require a detailed initial state which is generally not achieved by conventional initialization from global models having a much coarser resolution (&gt;25km). To obtain a more accurate and detailed description of the initial state so called data assimilation methods have been developed, which use detailed information from recent observations to update the model. In this study it is investigated whether the precipitation forecasting skill of a regional Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model covering the Benelux can be improved by means of variational data assimilation. To that end, a variety of atmospheric observations is assimilated into a 4-km resolution WRF model using the accompanying WRFDA system with a 3DVAR rapid update cycling strategy. Besides conventional observations from surface weather stations, airports and soundings, observations from remote sensing platforms like radar (reflectivity and radial velocity) and zenith total delay (ZTD) from GPS are also assimilated. In a case study featuring a large squall line it is shown that assimilation of every single type of observation results in a notable improvement of forecasting skill, except for the radar assimilation of hydrometeors whose impact on the forecast is negligible after having precipitated to the surface. Especially assimilation of estimated humidity based on radar reflectivity yields a significant improvement during the full 6 hours of the forecast. The ability of the other types of observations to positively impact forecasting skill is attributed the large scale forcing by wind convergence along the cold front that is driving the formation of precipitation. Overestimation of precipitation quantity in the scenario without assimilation however is aggravated when radar derived humidity is assimilated, most likely as a consequence of the rapid update cycling strategy.","nowcasting; precipitation; Data assimilation; radar; GPS; WRF; WRFDA; 3DVAR; variational data assimilation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This is illustrated by a wide variety of market releases of LKA systems, and a large body of literature illustrating different designs and various evaluation methodologies that are often performed in driving simulators. As a result, it is unclear how design choices impact driver steering behaviour and acceptance, and extrapolate this to real-world driving where driver distraction is often a reality. This study presents a detailed evaluation methodology to compare three haptic LKA designs in a single real-world truck driving study. These designs are constructed based on two haptic LKA approaches found in literature; continuous support and bandwidth support. It is hypothesized that continuous support is favored over bandwidth support but that both LKA approaches are effective and well-liked when implemented in real-life and show to be particularly effective for distracted drivers. Two of the evaluated systems were triggered to generate haptic torques only when the predicted lateral error exceeded a bandwidth of 0.4 m: a single-bandwidth system (SB); that shuts off the guidance when the predicted lateral error returned within the bandwidth, and a double bandwidth system (DB); that shuts off the guidance when a second inner bandwidth (close to lane center) is reached [38]. The third evaluated system generated continuous haptic torques towards the lane center: a continuous double bandwidth system (CDB). Sixteen participants drove four trials on a private test-circuit; one trial without and three trials with haptic support. For each support system, participants drove both a distracted and a non-distracted condition. The results show that compared to manual control, all three support systems provided equal benefits in terms of accuracy and prevention of large lateral errors (&gt;0.7m). When a lane departure did occur both DB and CDB support systems showed shorter lane departure times with smaller lateral errors compared to manual driving. The DB and CDB support systems showed high driver acceptance and reduced large swerving behaviour that was observed during distracted driving. All three support systems however lacked effectiveness and driver acceptance during curves. Ultimately the CDB support system was the overall preferred haptic LKA design. This study shows the potential for DB and CDB support to be used in real-life, however higher driver satisfaction can be achieved when the support systems are able to cope with humans’ driving behaviour during curves.","Haptic shared control; lane keeping assist; steering wheel feedback; continuous guidance; bandwidth guidance; driver acceptance; real-life experiment; secondary task; driver distraction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-12-07","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Vehicle Engineering","",""

Thus, to what extend can the turnaround time be reduced and passenger comfort be enhanced by conventional and novel fuselages? What would be the opportunities offered by a Prandtl Plane configuration on the reduction of turnaround time and enhancement of passenger comfort?

This phenomenon is referred to as transition radiation. The energy radiation can also be generated by the change of velocity or path of the source (radiation in a non-uniform motion), as well as when it moves faster than waves can propagate through the medium (Vavilov-Cherenkov or Mach radiation). <br/>Transition radiation is of high importance for both use railways and high-speed railways because the velocity of the trains may approach the wave velocity of the soil in the substructure. This leads to an amplified radiation of waves which cause plastic deformation in the railway track in the vicinity of the transition zone.<br/>In the first part of this thesis, the solution for the system composed of an infinite beam resting on inhomogeneous Winkler foundation with a smooth transition in stiffness and subjected to a constant moving load is obtained. The proposed solution is computed for a finite system incorporating a set of non-reflective boundaries such that it mimics the behaviour of the infinite system. The response is obtained using a combination of a transform method (i.e. the Laplace transform) and a numerical method (i.e. the Finite Difference Method). With the obtained solution, the transition radiation and the influence of the length of the transition zone on it are analysed. <br/>The response obtained for the system with smooth transition in stiffness exhibits a change in magnitude when compared to the response obtained for an abrupt transition. Increasing the length of the transition zone causes a decrease in the magnitude of the excited free waves at the transition. For a very long transition zone, the overall behaviour of the response changes, leading to a significantly shorter radiated pulse, implying that the excited free waves are more localized in space. In addition to the change in magnitude, also a phase shift is observed between the two responses. <br/>In the second part of this thesis, the solution for the system composed of an infinite beam resting on inhomogeneous and non-linear Winkler foundation, and subjected to a constant moving load is obtained. The Winkler-stiffness behaviour is assumed to be piecewise linear, and consequently, the system behaves linearly between non-linear events. This enables the solution to be obtained using a mixed time-frequency approach combined with the Finite Difference Method for the spatial discretization. The computed response incorporates the non-reflective boundaries and the smooth transition in stiffness, obtained in the first part of the thesis. The solution is used to determine the possibility of plastic deformation introduced by the transition radiation, and the parameters influencing it. <br/>The plastic deformation exhibited in the transition zone is observed to be a consequence of a constructive interference of the excited free waves and the approaching eigenfield. The influence of two parameters on the resulting plastic deformation is analysed, namely the length of the transition zone and the velocity of the load relative to the wave velocity in the system. Increasing the length of the transition zone reduces the magnitude of the excited free waves, therefore leads to a less pronounced constructive interference between the excited free waves and the eigenfield, and thus to a decrease in magnitude of the plastic deformations. Surprisingly, in the case of the load velocity close to the wave velocity in the system, enlarging the length of the transition zone does not lead to significant reduction in the plastic deformation exhibited. <br/>The solution method presented in this thesis includes inhomogeneous foundation with a non-linear behaviour and the infinite extent of the model is correctly accounted for. Therefore, it could be used for the initial design of transition zones. Given the stiffness jump that has to be bridged between the two domains, the optimum length of the transition zone can be obtained such that minimum damage results in the railway track.<br","Transition Radiation; Non-linear; One-dimensional","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-12-31","","","","","",""

Due to the growing interest in acquainting children with these creative problem-solving skills at a young age, research has been being carried out on design toolkits specifically aimed at children. <br/>The central aim of this graduation project has been to explore the potential of a family-friendly design game—with a fun-factor—that engages kids to learn and practice essential 21st century skills through an open and creative mindset. The examination of literature in the interest of this topic outlined the foundation for a set of design criteria.<br/>In the conceptualisation phase, a selection of game mechanisms has been used to generate a variety of ideas. These ideas were then clustered using a morphological map, resulting in three design directions. Through iterative design cycles, these design directions have been developed to a concept level. Using predefined design criteria, the most promising concept has been selected through a weighted scoring method. This concept has been developed into a paper prototype to evaluate with the target group.<br/>A practice-based research methodology has been employed, through 5 playtesting sessions with families with kids ages 8 and up. Qualitative data has been gathered through several sources, such as interviews, observations, generated ideas, and film footage. In total, 3 prototypes have been evaluated and developed through the ‘Build, Measure, Learn’ loop. The key insights gained through the playtesting sessions with families show a positive relationship between the embedded game elements and a fun-factor. Overall, through a safe game environment with mild competition, a fun gaming experience is evoked through an open and creative attitude.<br/>The insights coming forth from this practice-based study have led to a family-friendly design game for the consumer market. The final design has taken the first steps in making children acquainted with the 21st century skills in a safe and competitive game environment. The findings may be of great interest for other game designers and design education in general. The argument put forth here is that if a game has a fun-factor, players would feel more inclined to play and replay a game. Further research should investigate if repeatedly playing this game increases learning efficiency of the 21st century skills.","21st century skills; design game; design thinking","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","","Co-Design with Kids: Early acquisition of 21st century skills",""

The port complex of Bahía Blanca has the second largest throughput in Argentina considering tons, mainly attributed to the agro – and petrochemical industry. The port handles containers as well, however with an average of 30 thousand TEU/year this throughput is rather small. The authority of the Port of Bahía Blanca sees opportunities to increase container throughput in the port due to recent developments in the region. The container throughput is estimated for 2040, considering the petrochemical cluster and fruits. Four different trends show a container throughput of respectively 30, 155, 250 and 360 thousand TEU/year. The capacity of the container terminal is estimated at 50 thousand TEU/year, based on the equipment, the dwell time and the terminal area. The terminal should improve when throughput will increase. To start, number of calls and call size are assumed based on future throughput, decreasing the average dwell time for export containers. Additionally, a larger quantity and more advanced equipment is required to handle the increase in throughput. Lastly, the terminal area itself can be increased significantly from 8ha to 22ha in its maximum configuration. The increase in storage area allows the capacity to grow from 50 thousand TEU/year to 215 thousand TEU/year. It is important to realize that further expansion of the terminal is not possible and a new location has to be considered. A multi criteria analysis in combination with a financial analysis on the possible location showed that two out of four possible new locations are suitable for the development of a new container terminal. The new container terminal should have the capacity to handle the expected container throughput generated locally. The possibility to attract additional cargo to the port was researched as well, since the Port of Bahía Blanca has an advantageous depth compared to the Port of Buenos Aires. However, on the short term it is not expected that Bahía Blanca can profit from the draught limitations in Buenos Aires since port calling cost are almost the same, Buenos Aires is located conveniently and not operating at capacity and current shipping routes are not expected to change their routes majorly.","port; container; terminal; throughput; location","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","","MP227","-38.788145, -62.276945"

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2017","The phenomenon by which a spacecraft can both approach a celestial body and start performing revolutions around it, without needing to manoeuvre in between, is known as ballistic capture. For ballistic capture to take place, the spacecraft must be under the gravitational influence of at least 2 celestial bodies. Therefore, it is possible to design heliocentric transfers to Mars culminating in ballistic capture. With an impulsive-thrust strategy, these have already been studied, but were found to be less fuel-efficient and longer-lasting than Hohmann transfers. The objective of the present thesis is to investigate the characteristics of Earth–Mars low-thrust transfers to ballistic capture.<br/><br/>Small spacecraft are very mass- and power-constrained, so orbit transfers are challenging for them, especially to interplanetary destinations. To try and shift this paradigm, the study was carried out assuming the spacecraft to be a 16-unit CubeSat. In addition, to improve the relevance of the results for the design of a real mission, the decision was made to model the spacecraft's environment with many perturbing forces, including third-body perturbations, solar radiation pressure and non-spherical gravity. Furthermore, the performance of the thruster was modelled as being a function of the spacecraft's distance to the Sun. <br/><br/>Ballistic capture orbits at Mars were found in a systematic way, by investigating the past and future behaviour of candidate states with respect to Mars and collecting the states corresponding to capture into a capture set. The most regular orbits of the capture set were found among those making the closest approaches to Mars, but the opposite appears to be true about the orbits with the longer lifetime, which can reach more than a decade. Furthermore, two groups of capture orbits were identified: one coming from the inside of Mars' orbit, the other from the outside, with the orbits of each group being relatively close to each other.<br/><br/>Some capture orbits were selected, each with a different arrival date at Mars, and targeted from Earth, on multiple departure dates. The spacecraft was assumed to leave Earth's orbit with the planet's velocity and the heliocentric transfers were designed with an interior-point method, after direct transcription and collocation. It was found that if the spacecraft is given enough time, the low-thrust strategy requires roughly the same fuel regardless of Earth departure or Mars arrival dates. In addition, terminating a low-thrust transfer to Mars in ballistic capture does not carry additional costs, when compared to simply rendezvousing with the planet. The revolutions that the spacecraft is guaranteed to perform around Mars are then cost-free. With the assumed spacecraft and departure conditions, only around 5 kg of propellant are required to reach Mars and get ballistically captured. Nevertheless, the spacecraft needs to fly for at least 3.5 years, which can be too long for a CubeSat.","Ballistic capture; Low-thrust transfer; Earth–Mars transfer; CubeSat; Perturbing forces; Solar electric propulsion; Capture set; Trajectory optimisation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-12-06","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Traditional approaches to this problem, such as increasing road capacity, do not offer long-term solutions. Combined with rising environmental concerns, the demand for smarter solutions has never been higher. One such solution, which has gained significant ground in the past decades, is automated vehicle platooning. <br/><br/>A vehicle platoon is an interconnected dynamical system consisting of automated vehicles driving in close proximity, coordinating their movement through measurements and sometimes inter-vehicular communication. By allowing driving in close proximity, platoons have the potential to increase road capacity, whilst reducing fuel consumption. Platoons are subject to safety and performance requirements. In order to meet these requirements the vehicle platoon needs be string stable, such that effects of disturbances are not amplified in the upstream direction of the string of vehicles. String-stable platoons also help preventing ghost traffic jams, typically caused by human driver behaviour. Advancements in vehicle platooning research have mostly been concerned with longitudinal automation, and consequently with longitudinal string stability. However, driving at small inter-vehicular gaps also requires lateral automation. Naturally, this means that string stability in the lateral sense is required.<br/><br/>Therefore, the objective of this MSc thesis is to develop a lateral control method for automated vehicle platoons that yield string-stable behaviour. In the first part, an error model based on a vehicle-following control strategy, which uses vehicle path following, is derived. This model is then used to describe the path-following problem within a platoon. In the second part, a control strategy is proposed using the H∞ framework, such that path following and lateral string stability are guaranteed a-priori. <br/><br/>The robustness properties and the performance of the designed controller are analysed by means of frequency-domain analysis and time-domain simulations. Finally, path following and the string-stability properties of the controller have been validated experimentally. The experiments performed confirm the theoretical analysis, thereby showing that lateral string stability is obtainable using the proposed method. <br","Lateral Control; String stability; Path following; H-infinity control; Experimental validation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Extreme consequences of this effect may include injuries for crew members, and damages to deck equipment resulting in downtime for the vessel. The accepted method to predict this non-linear phenomenon is a combination of model tests and potential solver. Nevertheless, model tests are generally conducted at the end of the design phase leading to serious problems if the moonpool performance is not sufficient. CFD solvers proved their capability of modelling complex flow phenomena and their use as a design tool for the moonpool is growing. However, a complete verification &amp; validation is still missing. In the present work the water motion inside a moonpool and the forces on the hull, for a vessel in head waves without forward speed, are estimated using the MARIN software ReFRESCO. In doing so, the goal is to define the accuracy of the code for a rectangular moonpool with sharp edges without additional damping devices. For a deeper comprehension of the physics involved, a stepwise approach was followed. The work starts with an empty domain in which only regular waves were generated to assess the propagation and absorption of waves in ReFRESCO. Secondly, fixed vessel simulations were performed to study the influence of grid dimension, mesh refinement and boundary conditions. Then forced heave oscillations were simulated to estimate the damping and added mass. Verification studies were carried out for all the presented to this point.

In recent decades, the ice-sheet has been losing mass rapidly and has nearly doubled its contribution to sea-level rise. One main contributing factor has been the recent widespread acceleration of the tidewater glaciers that terminate in deep and narrow glacial fjords. However, our understanding of the subsurface water properties causing this acceleration has been extremely limited owing to the lack of observations around these locations. We hypothesize that while the ice-sheet is not coupled to the ocean in the current General Circulation Models (GCMs), they can still be used to improve our understanding of the subsurface warming around these regions. In this study, we first evaluate two GCMs (HADGEM2-ES and GISS-E2-R) around three tidewater glacier locations, by interpolating the high resolution CTD data to the GCM grid. Our results substantiate that GISS-E2-R performs better than the HADGEM2-ES model along the Western Margin. However, along the Eastern Margin, we find that the HADGEM2-ES model is more consistent with the observations. The modelled spatio-temporal variability of water masses was investigated in a Pre-Industrial and Historical simulation, later used to quantify the evolution of subsurface warming under a future warming (RCP 8.5) scenario. Our results show that the Kangerlussuaq glacier (shelf) is more sensitive to greenhouse gas (GHG) forcings than Helheim and Jakobshavn. With respect to the Pre-Industrial climate, the mean warming of the Kangerlussuaq shelf under the RCP 8.5 scenario is 3.76°C, which is considerably greater than Helheim (2.38°C) and Jakobshavn (1.92°C). This is predominantly driven by the subsurface Return Waters of the Arctic Atlantic which are seen to warm the most under a future warming (RCP 8.5) scenario. For each of the three simulation, we decompose the Ocean Heat Content (OHC) time-series into intrinsic oscillatory modes so as to discern and quantify the high frequency variability from the multi-year/decadal variability and trends in the OHC. Where the contribution from the high-frequency modes to the total energy contained in the OHC signal is considerable in a Pre-Industrial scenario; the Historical and RCP 8.5 derived OHC are seen to contain a very dominant low-frequency response to GHG forcings, which contains (almost) all of the energy contained in the signal. For the RCP 8.5 scenario, we infer that at Kangerlussuaq, such a response is considerably greater than other locations. Furthermore, a consistent long-term increasing trend is seen in the upper ocean heat content for Kangerlussuaq, throughout the 21st century (1.01 × 10^8 J/m^2/month), unlike our inferences from other locations. This trend is found to be an order of magnitude higher than Helheim (2.36 × 10^7 J/m^2/month) and Jakobshavn (1.27 × 10^7 J/m^2/month). Our results also indicate that sea-ice free months at the Nares Strait (A.D. 2055 onwards) allows for a relatively greater mixing of the Lincoln Sea and Baffin Bay waters, which is consistent with the decline and stagnation of the rising OHC at Jakobshavn.","Greenland ice sheet; tidewater glaciers; GCMs; climate projections; spatio-temporal variability; Kangerlussuaq; Helheim; Jakobshavn","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","66.35000, -38.20000"

The high energy density and good storage properties of fossil fuels have made them the most important energy source for the last centuries. Moving away from fossil fuels towards greener, biomass-based energy and energy carriers is hindered by the technological gap due to the maturity of conventional processes compared to sustainable ones. This thesis focuses on a process of converting biomass into methanol. The process is a small-scale application which is mobile so it can be moved towards the source of the biomass, with the aim to reduce transportation costs. The specific focus lies on the conversion of the gasification-derived syngas into methanol. For this an extensive literature study was conducted to find suitable technologies and process kinetics. Aspen Plus® with the integration of Excel was used to model the chosen technologies. The process was divided into three unit operations. The methanol reactor unit with a recycle stream, the CO2-removal unit to prepare the gas for the reactor unit and a H2-recycle unit to increase the utilisation of the hydrogen. Each unit operation was modelled separately to study the influence of their parameters and to determine which parameters have the largest influence. Finally, when integrating all unit operations within one model, these selected parameters were used to determine the operating conditions and process design.<br/><br/>The aim of the developed model was to predict and improve the process for different applications with integrated hydrogen supply from renewable sources. The disadvantage of utilising renewable energy sources for the production of hydrogen is the intermittent supply of electricity for the electrolysis of hydrogen. Therefore the process needs to be able to accommodate different levels of hydrogen production. The first case is the base case without any hydrogen input. It is given a syngas-input and the CO2-removal unit runs at full capacity. Building upon this model, the behaviour of the system for hydrogen supply integration was modelled in the second and third case. The second case introduces additional hydrogen and therefore the CO2-removal unit can be turned down. The third application adds CO2, which was removed in case one, to the system and increases the hydrogen input. The study of these processes shows, that the operating pressure of the methanol reactor unit has a very large influence on the energy requirements of the process but also on the production of methanol. In respect to the power and cooling requirements of the process a low pressure is favoured but much larger quantities of methanol can be produced at higher pressures. With the chosen designs for the cases a respective methanol production of 47.6 t/d, 96.8 t/d and 180.6 t/d is reached. The integration of hydrogen leads to two major concerns for the process. The integration requires much larger equipment due to higher flowrates and the quality of the product decreases as a higher CO2/CO-ratio produces more water. The thesis served its purpose by developing a model of the process which can be further used to optimise the process on a techno-economic level.","Methanol synthesis; Aspen Plus; Process design; biomass","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The Diffuser Augmented Wind Turbine (DAWT) is a promising concept where the turbine is embedded into an airfoil-shaped diffuser (also named shroud or duct), which has the function of increasing the mass flow across the rotor. Such device is<br/>designed to overcome the low wind speed present in urban locations.<br/>Noise regulations represent a limit to the installation of wind turbines in urban areas. To the author’s knowledge, the far-field noise generated by DAWTs has been investigated only by Hashem et al. [31], who reported noise increase up to 20 dB compared to unaugmented turbines. However, the noise generation mechanisms are not clear yet. Furthermore, only partial data [15] on the<br/>fluid-dynamic behaviour of DAWT when operating in yawed inflow conditions are present, with no information on the noise pattern.<br/>The current study investigates both the fluid-dynamic and acoustic fields for a ducted wind turbine using a computational approach. The commercial DonQi turbine is taken as reference. The fluid-dynamic flow field is computed using the Lattice-Boltzmann Method solver Exa PowerFLOW. The Ffowcs-Williams and Hawkings (FW-H) analogy is employed to compute the far-field noise.<br/>Three cases are investigated: the ducted turbine at 0 deg and 7.5 deg yaw angles and the unducted turbine at 0 deg yaw angle.<br/>The fluid-dynamic analysis reveals that the presence of the diffuser accelerates the flow in the tip region, resulting in a significant increase of the thrust and the power produced by the turbine. In correspondence, the tip vortices present a higher intensity. These vortices interact with the boundary layer of the diffuser and form long vortical structures convected beyond the diffuser trailing<br/>edge. The presence of a yaw angle creates a non-axisymmetrical velocity pattern at the rotor disk, resulting in a power drop of 10.8%. However, no stall on the blades is detected. Contrarily to the observations by Cresswell et al., a separation region is formed on the diffuser suction side.<br/>Regarding the far-field noise, the directivity pattern for the unducted turbine presents a zone of low noise above the rotor. The addition of a diffuser causes a noise increase by approximately 5 dB upwind and downwind and by up to 15 dB in the low noise region, resulting in a more uniform noise distribution. This effect is ascribed to the higher flow speed in the tip region and to the diffraction<br/>of acoustic waves by the diffuser. Increasing the yaw angle to 7.5± is found not to have a relevant impact on the far-field noise.","Diffuser Augmented Wind Turbines; Lattice-Boltzmann Methods; Noise; Windenergy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The collection of data of communicating vehicles in traffic offers live information about the traffic conditions, which can be used to control traffic optimally. It is expected that in the coming years a new vehicle type will take part in traffic that is able to navigate through traffic without driver and communicates with traffic controllers to share its information and receive its optimal trajectory: the automated vehicle. The automated vehicle is different from the autonomous vehicle, which does not communicate with traffic controllers or other traffic.<br/>The traffic mixture consisting of conventional, connected and automated vehicles will change gradually over time. Designing a traffic control strategy that performs well for traffic consisting of different shares of these three types of vehicles and requires only a limited amount of computational power will be a main challenge in traffic control the coming years. <br/>This report proposes a traffic control strategy and assesses the influences of this strategy on the network wide traffic conditions using a traffic simulation. In this way, the research will provide insight in the effects of vehicle connectivity and automation on the network wide traffic conditions.<br/><br/>Based on the live traffic information from the communicating vehicles in a network, traffic can be controlled from two sides: the traffic signal control and the automated vehicle trajectory control. The traffic control method proposed in this report works as follows: first, the traffic controller collects all the information of connected and automated vehicles in the network to update the vehicle set. Locations and speeds of connected and automated vehicles can be obtained directly. Automated vehicles also provide the traffic controller of information of the non-communicating vehicles in their surroundings, detected by their sensors. Then, the virtual departure time of each vehicle will be determined, which is the time at which the vehicle would depart not hindered by other traffic or traffic signal and can be calculated using the kinematic laws. Also the corresponding virtual departure speed is determined for each vehicle. Then, starting from the first vehicle on the link, the expected departure time will be calculated, based on the virtual departure time and the traffic signal state. The expected departure times and speeds of the other vehicles on the link will be based on their virtual departure time, the expected departure time of the vehicles in front of the vehicle and the signal state. The virtual and expected departure times and speeds are used for both the signal control and the trajectory control.<br/>This report presents a decentralized signal control to limit the computational power required in large traffic networks. This signal control is based on the original back-pressure algorithm, which compares the downstream traffic conditions with the upstream traffic conditions around an intersection and makes decisions for the signal control based on the difference in back-pressure of different movements on an intersection. The proposed signal control strategy takes the approaching and exiting vehicles within a certain range from the intersection into account. At the start of each time slot, a prediction is made for the pressure of a link on the intersection at the start of the next time slot, based on the current number of approaching and exiting vehicles on a link, their expected departure time from the intersection and the expected traffic demand. Based on the predicted pressures at every link that is connected with the intersection, the traffic controller decides whether it should switch the traffic signal at the start of the next time slot. <br/>The proposed method for the trajectory control of the automated vehicles is based on the decisions of the traffic controller regarding the traffic signal and the expected departure times and speeds of the vehicles in the network. The main goal of the trajectory control is to use the green phases in an optimal way, i.e. maximizing the amount of departing vehicles per unit of green time. The trajectory control should limit accelerations and decelerations in the network as much as possible to limit emissions and traveller discomfort. Therefore, a third type of departure time and speed, the smooth departure time and speed, is introduced and compared with the expected time and speed of an automated vehicle to optimize its trajectory. The smooth departure time is the moment in time at which the vehicle would depart from the intersection if it would accelerate constantly to the expected departure speed over the total distance to the intersection. If the expected departure time is later in time than the smooth departure time, the vehicle will slow down and vice versa. If the smooth departure time is equal to the expected departure time, the vehicle will accelerate constantly towards the intersection.<br/>The proposed control method is tested in a traffic simulation to obtain the effects of the method on the traffic conditions for different traffic scenarios. For each scenario the average traffic time delay, average green time, average and maximum queue length and average acceleration and acceleration time is retrieved from the simulation to assess the effects of the proposed methods on the traffic conditions. The simulated network consists of a two-directional main road with five signalized intersections with side roads. The traffic consists of only cars and other modes of transportation are neglected for simplicity. Different shares of connected and automated vehicles and different vehicle flows in the network are tested.<br/><br/>The simulation results show that the proposed signal control strategy leads to relatively short green times, which decrease the intersection throughput and the ability of adjusting the green time ratio between the two crossing roads to the traffic demand. Traffic on the main road encounters relatively longer green times and shorter queue lengths than traffic on the side roads. The throughput of the intersections does not satisfy the traffic demand and therefore, the first intersection will function as a bottleneck and lowers the traffic flow at the next intersections. Therefore, queues especially occur at the first intersection that vehicles encounter. The results show that the higher the penetration rate of communicating vehicles is, the better the traffic controller is able to adapt the signal sequence to the current traffic situation. The signal control requires several improvements in order to function optimally, but has the potency to be a suitable decentralized control method in a partly connected and automated environment.<br/>Results regarding the proposed trajectory control show that a higher share of automated vehicles in the network results in a higher average acceleration in a relatively shorter total acceleration time, which is a result of the fluctuations in the vehicle speed due to the trajectory control. However, automated vehicles increase the average number of departing vehicles per unit of green time, which leads to shorter queues and less average travel time delay in the network.<br/>Next to the proposed signal control strategy, an existing coordinated signal control strategy is implemented and tested in the simulation without connected or automated vehicles to compare the results with the proposed methods. Simulations of this green wave control result in larger average travel time delays and larger queue lengths due to relatively shorter green phases. The average acceleration, however, is relatively low, since the green wave strategy avoids vehicles to decelerate to complete standstill after they cross the first intersection of the traffic corridor. <br/><br/>This research shows that vehicle connectivity and automation offer the ability to improve network wide traffic conditions applying a decentralized traffic control method to control signalized intersections and automated vehicles. Although the proposed traffic control method is not optimized yet, it shows that low shares of connected and automated vehicles in traffic already make a significant difference in the network wide traffic conditions and that the signal sequences and automated vehicle trajectories can be even optimized if these shares get higher. Since the control strategy is decentralized, the required amount of computational power of a traffic controller is limited to the amount that the control of one single intersection requires and is not depending on the network size.<br/>This research provides several recommendations for further research to improve the proposed strategy. Instead of taking only vehicles into account within a certain range from the intersection, which all have the same contribution to the back-pressure, an interesting alternative is to take all vehicles around an intersection into account for the back-pressure and add a certain weight to each vehicle based on the distance to the intersection. This weight can be used to determine the contribution of each vehicle to the back-pressure. Next, a threshold for switching and a dynamic slot time instead of a fixed one could be improvements to the proposed method and should be tested in further research.<br/>The trajectory can be optimized especially regarding the vehicle accelerations and decelerations. It is recommended to avoid the occurring speed fluctuations in the proposed method by optimizing the acceleration rate that is used for automated vehicles to reach the desired trajectory.<br/>It is recommended to test the proposed method in more realistic traffic simulations in further research to get more insight in the effects to real traffic. In that way the control method can be adapted to real traffic. The simulation of this research uses many assumptions regarding several parameters which require further research to optimize the performance of the control method. Last, before implementing the proposed method or a similar method in traffic, further research is required regarding the traffic safety. Especially the fact that automated vehicles are able to depart from intersections exactly at the moment the traffic signal switches to green could lead to unsafe situations, since other traffic users are not yet used to this behaviour of automated vehicles.<br/><br/><br","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Change leads to uncertainty, and as a result, risks appear. A lot of projects fail due to uncertainty and risks. Especially complex projects are more vulnerable to risks (Hertogh &amp; Westerveld, 2010). Complex projects are seen as large projects with long time schedules, multi-ownership, involving substantial resources, significant political issues and significant novelty (Chapman &amp; Ward, 1997). The root causes of project related risks are mostly part of the organizational dynamics and multidisciplinary nature of the business´ organization (Thamhain, 2013). For this reason, risk management becomes important, which is especially crucial in technology-based projects. Risk management must be seen as an ongoing review process in the whole Project Life Cycle (Thamhain, 2013). Chapman and Ward (1997) stated already in 1997 that risk management must be a core process within the strategic management of any business or organization. No matter the size, the activity, or the sector. Risk management has the aim to reduce risks (Nicholas &amp; Steyn, 2012). Widely, a lot of research is performed to risk management standards. These standards give hands on managing risks and are mostly described in an abstract way as it must be applicable to all projects. The general risk management standards that are defined in literature are implemented in all mature risk management organizations in extreme complex projects to manage risks (Caño &amp; Cruz, 2002). Risk management is a process that should be integrated within project management (Nicholas &amp; Steyn, 2012; Zou, Chen, &amp; Chan, 2010). It is widely recognized by leading project management institutions that risk management should be an integral part of the project management (Caño &amp; Cruz, 2002). While making risk management an integral part of project management, it is necessary that risk management must be adopted by the project management approach. Risk management is not just a management tool that can be added besides the project management but it must be part of the project management (Chapman and Ward, 1997).","Risk management; risk maturity model; Project Management","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

Additionally, DIPS does not require a form of reward function crafting and is robust to hyper-parameter settings. DIPS is evaluated on a simulated model of the DelFly Explorer which is tasked to perform a window fly-through maneuver. It is demonstrated that DIPS efficiently and effectively improves the BT behavior policy performance for three simulated environments with increasingly large reality gaps.

Solutions exist using hexapods or gangways that make a stiff connection by clamping to a customized offshore structure. State of the art gangways allow for a stepless workflow and have a rubber tip which does not require specialized landing structures. However, in these solutions contact force variations are high. This results in a reduction of safety due to the loss of contact or slipping motions. Therefore, a system with force sensors in the tip is proposed. This allows for the tip forces to be used in feedback control. Literature on this subject describes hydraulic actuator force control, impedance control, or force control in free moving robotics. Literature fails to describe suitable solutions to the hydraulic force control problem where motions are dictated and force tracking is required. In this thesis the dynamic problem of force-position control with hydraulics is simplified, allowing linear analysis and controller design. A 3D model has been created and used to show the need for force feedback after which an analysis is performed on the actuator dynamics. The root locus method is used to close the force control loop with a proportional-integral controller. This results in a complete force-position control structure which tracks a force setpoint on a moving object. The controller structure has been implemented during sea trials and showed significant improvement in the force control performance. This approach of force control using hydraulic actuation is expected to significantly increase safety in offshore operations.","Motion Compensated Gangway; Hybrid Force-Position Control; Offshore; Hydraulic Actuation; Speed Feedforward; Sensitivity Analysis; Proportional Integral Control","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-11-24","","","","","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2017","The purpose of the research is to provide insight into the conversion of a second-hand vessel into an Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC) plant. To this end, a 10 MW ship-shaped OTEC platform, located in the waters around Curaçao, has been designed.<br/>At present, only a few of OTEC plants are in operation, primarily with the purpose of research and development. These projects consist of small scale onshore platforms, the biggest of which produces a maximum of 100 kW of continuous electricity. The lack of existing large oshore OTEC installations, together with the time frame of the project, limit the project to a concept design. Ultimately, the report will serve as a guideline for the implementation of ship-shaped OTEC platforms.<br/>The use of Systems Engineering (SE) has been motivated by the need to establish a clear structure to address effectively the challenges posed by the complexity of the installation. This methodology facilitates the revision of the performance of the ship-shaped OTEC throughout the design process. <br/>From the initially defined Top Level Requirements (TLRs) a plant architecture has been developed, covering the engineering of the power plant, selection of mooring system and dimensioning of the second-hand Panamax bulker to be converted. The research has brought forward the main drivers of the design: process ducting, water pipes and, particularly, heat exchangers. As a result, the integration of process equipment, mooring system and hull has rendered an optimized platform layout.<br/>The proposed solution was, then, assessed with regards to the utilization of space on board and the stability of the hull. While the ratio of occupied versus empty space is deemed adequate, it is necessary to add ballast water to increase the draft and the use of alternative solutions, such as bilge keels or fixed ballast in the top side tanks, to dimish the excess of stability of the hull.<br/>Overall, the findings of the research suggest that the construction and operation of a ship-shaped OTEC plant is feasible. Nevertheless, a holistic validation demands for the incorporation of all new components, followed by structural and hydromechanic analysis of the platform. Lastly, it is recommended to study the use of different heat exchanger types and power ouputs that could derive in more space-efficient<br/>design.","OTEC; Ship-Shaped Platform; Concept Design; Ship Conversion; Systems Engineering","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-12-04","","","","Marine Technology | Ship Design, Production and Operations","",""

Business models illustrate the rationale of how organizations create, delivers and capture value. The business model approach and more specifically the business model canvas is a tool that is widely used by academics, entrepreneurs and consultants to map out how organizations work and how different characteristics such as value proposition and distribution channels relate to each other. By studying professional and academic literature on (downstream photovoltaic) business models, a set of six categories are selected. These categories vary from straight forward project providers where customers purchase a small photovoltaic installation to complex business models that include third party ownership and even aggregation of distributed electricity generators that are clustered as a virtual power plant. The research shows that the business model canvas approach is a valuable tool to assess and describe photovoltaic business models. This thesis unveils that major differences in business models are present between first-party and third-party ownership. The latter projects are often financed by banks, utilities or investment funds that maintain much higher standards in quality control, risk mitigation and are less comfortable with dealing with unstable policy environments. It also becomes clear that third party business models can only succeed in an environment with stable policies and proper access to financing. As feed-in-tariffs and long term power purchasing agreements are getting less common in mature market, another wave of business model shuffling can be expected in the solar industry. More uncertain revenue streams, curtailment and electricity market exposure will lead to new models with a different kind of investors. Although utility companies have not yet played a major role in the photovoltaic industry, they do have competitive advantages in the coming years as they have experience with energy trading.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The initiative aims to demonstrate the technical and economic feasibility of CCS and show that it can be deployed on a large scale for power plants and energy-intensive industries that emit large volumes of CO2. The partially-depleted Q16-Maas gas condensate field could potentially be used to permanently store the captured greenhouse gas (CO2). The case study shows the potential that this field has for CO2 storage and also examines other options for life-cycle extension. The case study is based on macroscopic scale reservoir behaviour and simulated in the fully compositional simulator, Eclipse 300. Gas reservoirs have a proven track record for safely trapping gaseous phases in the subsurface over long geological timescales. As long as initial reservoir conditions, mainly pressure (=296,5 bar), are not exceeded, CO2 in supercritical phase should be safely stored. According to literature, with increasing storage time, the CO2 is even trapped more securely, although this process may take hundreds to thousands of years.<br/>The results of the case study show that approximately 1.1 million tonnes of pure CO2 can be stored in Q16-Maas field. By side-tracking the original well and producing the attic gas in the reservoir, 160 million cubic meters of additional gas can be recovered, along with condensate. If the side-tracked well is then converted to a CO2-injection well, the CO2 storage capacity is increased to 1.4 million tonnes. This injectable CO2 volume is less than the two million tonnes originally estimated and this is due to the influx of water from a strong aquifer that has partially filled the void left by depleting the gas field.<br/>The possibility of enhanced gas and condensate recovery using CO2 has also been investigated in this case study, as the use of CO2 for miscible floods in hydrocarbon reservoirs has been proven and used successfully as a tertiary recovery method. The reservoir simulation of the Q16-Maas field shows that there is no additional hydrocarbon recovery by CO2 flooding. Sidetracking to and producing from an updip location in the reservoir is equally as productive. The reason for this is attributed to presence of a strong water aquifer, together with the varying reservoir quality and thickness prevents the successful application of CO2 enhanced hydrocarbon recovery. The total cost of transport and storage (OPEX and CAPEX) was estimated to be 71.5 million euro. Assuming CO2 storage volume of 1.4 million tonnes, the project would need to receive roughly 50 euro/tonne in order to breakeven for storing and transporting the CO2, the capturing is not included.","CO2-storage; ROAD pilot; CCS","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

When electrical power is applied to the silver trace, the plastic will heat up because of Joule heating in the silver trace the plastic will react to the heat by bending. This makes it an example of 4D printing. Compared to other 4D printed samples, PTAs have the advantage that they can repeat their motion. Additionally, PTAs are able to focus their energy locally, because of the placement of the silver traces. <br/><br/>To create a better understanding of the potential of PTAs, the Material Driven Design Method (Karana, et al., 2015) was used and set of cards with the different qualities was created.

(mentor); Ziar, H. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2017","Despite the fact that the price per watt-peak for photovoltaic modules are decreasing rapidly, there is a large population of people which have still not implemented photovoltaic technology in their everyday lives. An important reason why PV is still not the main source of electrical energy for these people is the uncertainty that comes with installing a PV system on the roof of a house. Consumers are afraid that an investment in a PV system will cost them too much money, while it will take a long time before their investment is paid back for. Therefore, it is important to accurately estimate the energy yield of PV systems before installation. By doing so, consumers will be more likely to see the benefits of a PV system, thus implementing the technology on their houses.<br/><br/>This thesis aims to improve the accuracy of the annual energy yield estimation using LiDAR data and a new model for the albedo component of irradiance. LiDAR has been used to determine the irradiance on a surface previously, however, this thesis uses LiDAR data in the Unity 3D game engine, which enables the user to apply changes and build on the environment rapidly. This eliminates the disadvan- tage of LiDAR data, which is often outdated, thus missing crucial objects surrounding the location of the potential PV system.<br/><br/>Ray-casting is used extensively to determine the sky view factor, view factor, shading factor and to determine the surfaces visible to the PV module. Being able to determine the sky view factor without doing any field work greatly reduces the time required to design a PV system.<br/>The albedo component is often neglected entirely when estimating the irradiation on a surface, while it may significantly contribute to the energy yield, reaching up to 10% of the total. The albedo com- ponent is mainly important for highly tilted PV modules or BIPV. The albedo component is also crucial for bifacial PV modules. Measurements have shown that the albedo of a material is not determined easily using a sample of the material along with two inversely installed pyranometers making up an albedometer. It has been found that the albedometer is only able to determine the specific albedo of a location for the weather condition and the time in which the measurement has been done. Extensive research has been done in order to determine the factors which have an influence on the albedo of a location. The spectral reflectivity of materials is expected to play an important role in finding a final model which describes the albedo factor accurately.<br/><br/>In order to estimate the irradiance due to reflectance, first the irradiance on the surfaces that are visible to the PV module are estimated one by one along with the view factor of each of the visible surfaces to the PV module in question. Finally using the reflectivity of the material of each surface, the contribution of each surface to the irradiance on the PV module as a result of reflectance is summed up resulting in the albedo component of the irradiance. The same method is used for the back side of the PV module to determine the irradiance on the back side of a bifacial PV module.<br/><br/>This research aims to play an important part in the automation of PV system design, striving to com- pletely eliminate necessary field work, while improving the accuracy of the predicted annual energy yield.","albedo; irradiance; photovoltaic; model; reflectance; spectral albedo; bifacial PV; bifacial; LiDAR; ray casting","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","PVision",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2017","Offshore assets experience wave forcings on a daily basis. Whilst the assets are designed with an airgap to protect the deck from these impacts, environments are prone to change, leaving the airgap to be insufficient. <br/><br/>Wave-in-deck (WID) is the phenomenon of waves hitting the deck despite of the airgap. The forcing exerted on the deck by wave-in-deck is an additional force for which the substructure is not designed. These forcings can cause the material to fail and the structure to collapse.<br/><br/>The impact due to WID causes very large stresses in the substructure that result in plastic material behaviour. Elasto-plasticity is introduced by setting a yield limit on the strain the material experiences. If the strain exceeds this limit, the material enters the plastic regime and permanent deformation occurs. <br/><br/>Taking drag and elasto-plasticity into account, the dynamic response of the structure is estimated. This process is a time-consuming process which can be significantly reduced with the use of a dynamic amplification factor (DAF).<br/>In this case, the static response of the structure is multiplied by the DAF resulting in the dynamic response. But an appropriate DAF has to be available for the result to be accurate.<br/><br/>This study investigates the dynamic influence of wave-in-deck forcing which results in a recommendation for the appropriate DAF applicable for regular, linear waves.<br/><br/>Using the linear wave theory and Momentum-Flux method the WID forcings are calculated for a selection of wave shapes, these include wave amplitudes from 19.1-24 meters and wave periods from 8-20 seconds. Each wave shape has a different force-time history and wave-in-deck period (T_WID). For each of these wave shapes the static and dynamic response is calculated with the help of the Finite Difference Method (FDM) and the ODE45 solver. These responses in turn estimate a DAF for each of the wave shapes. <br/><br/>Theoretically, a DAF is expected to peak at the natural period of the structure. By dividing the natural period (T_N) by the WID period, an estimation is made on the location of the frequency overlap and where the DAF is expected to peak. <br/>This research shows that the peak dynamic amplification occurs at the ratio T_WID/T_N≈1, which agrees with the analytical research done by J.M. Biggs.<br/><br/>This study shows the DAFs for purely elastic and elasto-plastic systems but as realistic offshore structures experience elasto-plastic material behaviour, the accurate DAF should be applicable to these systems. In these systems, there are different forms of DAF depending on the type of response required, this study discusses; displacement, curvature, stress and work.<br/>The forms of DAF are not interchangeable when calculating a specific dynamic response. <br/><br/>The DAF can applied to estimate the occurrence of material failure. As the DAF for stress is unusable for estimating material failure when in the plastic regime, the DAF for work is recommended. The coinciding dynamic response is compared to the failure limit of work. <br/>When this limit is exceeded, it will indicate material failure and subsequent structure collapse.","Wave-in-deck; Dynamic Amplification Factor; Plasticity","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-12-01","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""
