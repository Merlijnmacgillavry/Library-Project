(mentor); Filippov, S. (mentor); Koppenjan, J.F. (mentor)","2010","The field of Project management has evolved considerably over the last decade. With globalization and the ever increasing complexity of IT projects, project management has become ever more critical for IT consultancy firms and software service/product suppliers. Based on a survey conducted by Sogeti, only 30% of the IT projects undertaken by multiple firms were classified as ‘successful’. What factors do really influence the success of an IT project, is a critical question that has been raised over and over again due to the huge financial losses, alarming rate of unsuccessful projects and failure to establish ultimate goals. Some of the commonly identified factors that influence IT project success are Customer Satisfaction, Internal process, Financial, and perception alignment of the key actors involved in the project. One of the critical success factors for project success is explicit business case. In this research the impact of using an explicit vendor business case over an IT project success is investigated. The word ‘’explicit business case ‘’ refers to a business case which is well formulated, documented and is regularly updated throughout the project life cycle. Furthermore, a vendor business case is a document prepared on the basis of the information shared by the customer. Although vendor business case is built for guiding the vendor, but it’s initiated by the customer. What makes vendor business case special is, it includes the benefits and goals for vendor for taking the project but also includes the key value drivers from the customer’s business case, as customer satisfaction is an important element for the overall success from vendor’s perspective. Considering the vastness of the field of project management, and ensuring that the research is carried out within the established scope, only key aspects of project management relevant to the field of IT projects have been considered. Broadly classifying the success of a project can be measured from two angles; i.e. from the standpoint of a customer and that of a vendor. The research focuses on the success definition and evaluation from the vendor perspective. In the current research undertaken, Sogeti Netherlands B.V. has been chosen as a research partner, which is an established IT vendor with a diverse range of ongoing projects in its portfolio. The above scoping of the research led to a refined subject question as follows - How could the use of an explicit business case affect the IT project success? Note: The business case and success measures are from vendor’s standpoint To initiate the research, an analytical framework was developed to answer the primary research question. The analytical framework encapsulates two different angles; the static and the dynamic. Static angle represents the extent of information exchanged (between customer and vendor) at a given point in time. On the other hand, dynamic format represents a situation when the information exchange is continuous between customer and vendor, and also within the actors (Bid manager, Contract manager and Project manager) involved from the vendor side. A detailed literature review was conducted to build an understanding of the outcomes from similar performed researches in the past. The literature indicates that capturing the vital information and addressing the key issues at the onset of a project is important to the success of the project. Previously conducted researches also established a positive relation between business case and project success but the relation between explicit vendor business case and IT project success perceived from vendor perspective, has not been addressed. Another important finding from the literature review indicated lack of proper communication between key project actors as a key factor responsible for project failure. On basis of the above mentioned findings drawn from the literature review and the analytical framework, a research methodology was designed. This primarily involved qualitative approach of sampling certain projects and investigating all related details. Five different projects (at Sogeti), at various stages in the project life cycle, dealing with different IT technologies and varied project sizes were chosen. All key related managers were selected for personal interviews. Based on the primary research question, a detailed questionnaire was designed to be used for the interviews. The data collection was further refined to capture important aspects of business case usage in IT project management practices at Sogeti, which were identified as critical in addressing the research question. The data received from the interviews were thoroughly analyzed, and one of the approaches used in the analysis was measurement of coherence between different answers. To compare and merge the answers gathered from the interviews, different ranges (high, medium and low) measuring the coherence were developed and introduced. These ranges correspond to the level of coherence of answers given by various actors associated with the project. During the analysis, it was found that, answers give by actors were not completely coherent which can affects the project success. It was also seen that managers follow different strategies in the decision making tradeoff. After analyzing the interview data it can be concluded that with the use of an explicit vendor business case, the coherence in the answers found between the actors can be improved which may also affect IT project success positively. Although various different factors play a role in project success, not only the explicit vendor business case, but framing, maintaining and using an explicit vendor business case throughout the entire project life cycle would increase coherence of project drivers. It was also concluded that having an explicit vendor business case may curtail the ambiguity of decision making on issues related to the tradeoff made by the actors involved from the vendor’s side and increase the overall IT project success. The above mentioned conclusions were further translated into recommendations. One the important recommendations is, it is recommended to use an explicit vendor business case to curtail the subjectivity (in perception and decision making) of the actors (Bid manager, contract manager and project manager) during the complete life cycle of the project. The research findings contribute to the importance of having an explicit vendor business case throughout a project management life cycle and creating an environment which ensures transparent and dynamic information handover among the key actors. The research also aims to contribute positively to the IT project success.","business case management","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2010-07-27","Technology, Policy and Management","TSE","","MOT","",""

(mentor)","2010","The efficient use of the power budget in mobiles and small satellite applications is of primary importance because of the reduced size of the power sources. The limited power supply has to be spent wisely. In a transmitter, the power amplifier is the main consumer of that budget, which is why it has to be as efficient as possible. Unfortunately, high efficiency in power amplifiers is strongly related to non-linearities and hence distortion. However, several techniques help to improve the linearity of the power amplifier. One of the most powerful means to linearize a system is using negative feedback. In this work the analysis of a mixed-signal Cartesian feedback is carried out. Cartesian feedback offers two challenges: stability and phase shift. In a feedback system with a time delay in the loop, instability is likely to happen. Phase shift is the result of the time delay in the loop and non-linearities of the power amplifier. First a model of the mixed-signal system is proposed, and the stability of the system is analyzed. Second, a model of the phase shift is proposed, and the conditions under which it can be reduced are given. The model is implemented in the digital domain. In order to realise this a design consisting of a phase shift detector, a signal rotation and a magnitude computation was created in VHDL and then synthesized, while targeting FPGA and 90nm CMOS technology. An FPGA implementation shows a power consumption of 33.31[mW] for a total budget of 1.7[W] (1.96% of the total budget). The system reaches a 60° of phase margin with a loop gain of 10, for a bandwidth of 9.6[kHz]. The results show that it is possible to improve linearity at the expense of bandwidth when using Cartesian feedback.","Cartesian feedback; linearization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Electrical Engineering","","Microelectronics","",""

(mentor); Wilkens, J. (mentor)","2010","Process-based morphological models are widely recognised as a valuable tool for predicting coastal and estuarine morphological developments. However, long-term morphodynamic models are still considered to be in the process of development. Considerable uncertainty is therefore anticipated when these models are being applied in long-term estuarine problems. Hence, evaluation of the performance of such models against observations becomes crucial in establishing their credibility. The aim of this dissertation is to assess the performance of a morphodynamic model, PISCES, developed by HR Wallingford, quantitatively against the observations by using assessment method such as Brier Skill Score (BSS). The Dee Estuary has been chosen to model, since the availability of comprehensive repeat bathymetric datasets (2003-2006) covering the entire estuary and showing significant morphological changes during that period. Morphological modelling starting from 2003 for a three-year period will allow detailed comparison with the 2006 datasets. Much effort has been taken to apply various input reduction and morphological acceleration techniques to reduce the simulation time. However, there were serious issues been identified when applying morphological factor in the model. Also, the Dee Estuary consists of complex bathymetry with the huge intertidal area making the system challenging one to model. Due to various uncertainties and failure of the model, modelling was only being carried out partially. The results are therefore a measure of whether the model performs in right direction in achieving the observed morphology. Overall model performance was poor, although quantitatively reasonable agreement was obtained in deeper and some of the shallower regions. In addition, several modelling scenarios were performed and results were compared in order to assess the model performance for the morphological tide, and different morphological factors and morphological time steps. The overall morphological patterns were unchanged, but they varied in magnitudes. This study concludes that, the present morphodynamic model consists of several uncertainties and cannot reproduce the observed morphological behaviour, thus further research is required to remove the inconsistencies and improve the model performance.","Process-based models; Quantitative assessment; Morphological factor; Morphological tide","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","CoMEM - Coastal and Marine Engineering and Management","",""

The establishment of such an organization means that profit cannot flow to the initial private stakeholder. On the other it means the creation of a selfreinforcing mechanism that enables direct local re-investment of revenues from indirect value capturing. The establishment of a foundation or association could be a condition for municipalities contributing to private maintenance and management of public space.

Statistical Static Timing Analysis (SSTA) is a category of methodologies to analyse the variations in delay due to PVT variations. This thesis work is a part of the MODERN project, which is involved in developing a new SSTA methodology. In this thesis, the variation of the delay in 45nm standard cells is analysed. In industry practice, the Monte Carlo method is often used to estimate the statistical moments. This method needs a large number of simulation iterations and these simulations are parameter distribution dependent. A fast statistical moment estimation method is proposed in this work. The proposed methodology is at least 100 x faster than the Monte Carlo method and simulations are independent of the parameter distribution. In the SSTA methodology of the MODERN project, the signal waveforms with their variations are preserved at each pin of the standard cell. The concept of a ""set of waveforms"" as a representation of a variable electrical signal is also developed in this thesis work. Possible methods to represent the set of waveforms and their integration with the timing analysis methodology are analysed. The pseudo circuit based representation turns out to be the most compact model. A methodology for the analysis of the accuracy and efficiency of the pseudo circuit model is proposed.","STA; SSTA; digital circuit; timing analysis; EDA; PVT; variation; Monte Carlo; 45nm; methodology; simulation; MODERN","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics","","Circuit and System Group","",""

Ports as trade commercial centres, in which international markets and national economies meet, must start considering how the impacts of extreme climate change influence their port management and operations. This particular study focuses on extreme changes in climate that may affect the development, operations and infrastructure of ports. In particular, research has been done into sustainable mitigation plans that have been implemented by port authorities in relation to GHG emissions, energy consumption, fuel consumption, sea level rise and extreme weather protection and ice coverage, with the goal to analyse the potential environmental adaptability of ports operations to climate change effects. This study was based on a survey and case studies that provided primary and secondary data for the development of a comparative analysis among 10 different ports. The information gathered identified the range of measures and policies that ports are developing with a view to responding to climate change impacts. The study also uses Multi-Criteria Analysis to examine the degree of integration and adaptability of ports to climate change challenges, and the positive externalities such adaptations can bring to ports. In general 40% of the ports investigated in this project have implemented not only GHG emissions and energy and fuel consumption mitigation plans but have also conducted research into the vulnerability of the port to sea level rise and extreme weather. The MCA results indicate that it is important for ports to start considering climate change impacts and developing sustainable mitigation and adaptation plans for their port operations in order to bring benefits to the port and the surrounding areas.

The objective of this research is to develop and evaluate an intelligent group recommendation mechanism that is integrated in a well-structured decision process. As a result, a prototype of an online intelligent group decision support system for travel consumers has been built, which we refer to as Trip.Easy. Subsequently, we set up a user experiment and invited over a 120 participants, divided into 30 groups. Each group was instructed to organize a city trip while using Trip.Easy. After each session, the participants were asked to fill out a questionnaire. The results show that users were satisfied with the outcome of the session and with the recommendations of Trip.Easy during each session. Furthermore, analyses show that even groups with a relatively high measure of conflicting preferences, are guided towards a satisfying outcome.

Indeed, real estate is a relevant aspect which supports the primary tasks of the knowledge institutions and creates their urban environment. In this context, university campus as real estate object never stands alone but forms an integral part of a socio-physical context. It does so, by influencing city developments and contributing to social formation, since universities expand their own institutional mission beyond their borders to the city. Accordingly, the management of university campus has become a complex decision making process that involves many internal and external stakeholders whose interests and visions differ according to local socio-economic conditions. This research focuses on managing and dealing with real estate decisions for university campus in a specific context, which main topic –Management of university campus- is grounded on previous and current research in this field that has been carried out by the researcher Alexandra den Heijer within the Real Estate & Housing department at TUDelft in co-operation with campus planners of all Dutch universities called “Managing the university campus”, which provides universities with conceptual model and tools to improve campus management. Nevertheless, since methods and instruments provided by theory and empirical research are generic, this research arose to test their applicability to improve campus management in a specific case: The university City of Bogotá (UCB). Thus, this case is the starting point and target for the intended results, which main purpose is to provide practical advice to improve its campus management by using established conceptual instruments within the domain of Real Estate Management in different contexts and outlining the urban position of the university in the city as a source of complementary instruments to improve campus management.","Campus Real Estate Mangement; The university City of Bogota","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture","Real Estate & Housing","","Corporate Real Estate Management Laboratory","",""

(mentor); Gaydadjiev, G.N. (mentor)","2010","The ever-shrinking technology features have as a direct consequence the increase of defect density in VLSI chips. Going into the nano-scale era, the fabrication procedures cannot keep improving at the pace of the aforementioned shrinking of technology features. Fault Tolerance emerges as a much cheaper solution and it is imperative in the future to be able to build a reliable system with unreliable components. Reconfigurable realization platforms offer the ideal substrate for such approaches, because of their regularity and reconfigurability, which allow for the basic resources to be substitutable, relaxing the defect-free requirement for the whole chip. Sparing and matching techniques allow for substitution and alternative utilization of resources respectively, paving the way to the nano-scale era. Although a significant number of research works have focused on sparing, very few actually go on to reusing the defective resources and even in these cases, the characterization is conservative, sacrificing more functionality than it needs to. We focus on improving the particular drawback, by proposing two distinct methods for high resolution fault diagnosis of reconfigurable logic resources. The methods are based on the function generator and shift register modes of operation of an FPGA slice. We choose to decouple the diagnosis problem from those of fault detection and localization that have been extensively researched and in this way relax the fault coverage requirements for our methods: It is critical to rescue the core functionality of a defective resource with minimal cost, rather than cover 100% of its possible faults. Substitutable Resource Characterization is performed based on the diagnosis result in a modular manner. Both diagnostic testers are prototyped on FPGA and applied to a real Circuit Under Test, with the help of fault injection. The experimental results show that our approach offers the basis for a viable, low-overhead integrated fault tolerance strategy, which we hope to continue developing in the near future.","Fault Tolerance; Fault Diagnosis; Matching; Reconfigurable; Substitutable Resource","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics & Computer Engineering","","Computer Engineering M.Sc.","",""

(mentor); Mosselman, E. (mentor); Schielen, R.M.J. (mentor); Uijttewaal, W.S.J. (mentor); De Vriend, H.J. (mentor)","2010","Hydraulic structures are present in the designs of different Room for the River projects in the Netherlands. Examples are longitudinal weirs, groins, summer dikes and weirs in the inlet of a side channel. Morphological simulations with Delft3D are frequently carried out to investigate the effect of such projects on for example hindrance for shipping and dredging costs. It is important that also the physical processes around hydraulic structures are correctly modeled in these situations. At the upstream slope of a hydraulic structure, the larger depth-averaged velocity causes an increased sediment transport capacity and increased actual bed shear stresses. The latter is reinforced by a change of the velocity distribution over the vertical with respect to uniform flow. Opposite, the gravity component along the slope results in a higher critical bed shear stress than in flat bottom conditions. At steep slopes, (partial) bed-load transport blockage could occur. Delft3D is meant to model flow phenomena of which the horizontal length and time scales are significantly larger than the vertical scales. Near hydraulic structures, this is generally not the case. These structures are parameterized as weirs in a depth-averaged Delft3D model in engineering practice. The only effect of these weirs is an additional energy loss in the momentum equation. The parameterization aims at representing the influence of the weirs on the flow at larger scales. The local flow around the structures (including turbulence, vertical velocity components and actual shear stresses) is not correctly modeled. Moreover, there is no direct influence of the weir on sediment transport (like increased critical shear stresses and bed-load transport blockage). This inaccurate way of modeling could result in errors in the prediction of the morphological effects of hydraulic structures. The objectives of this study are: (1) Assessing the performance of the current way of Delft3D modeling of sediment transport around hydraulic structures in three-dimensional flows. (2) Making recommendations on the modeling of sediment transport around hydraulic structures in hydraulic engineering practice. The performance of Delft3D has been judged by comparing the results with the results of the numerical model FLUENT. FLUENT is an advanced flow modeling system, in which sediment transport can be studied by analyzing the trajectories of discrete particles. Firstly, some laboratory experiments describing flow and transport over structures have been modeled. In this way, the performance of both models has been investigated and mutually compared. The results of FLUENT gave confidence to use FLUENT as an instrument to judge the performance of Delft3D in modeling three-dimensional flow and transport over hydraulic structures. A three-dimensional flow situation has been designed, which resembles the flow over a longitudinal weir. In Delft3D, all bed-load transport and suspended-load transport that reaches the weir also passes the weir. In FLUENT, this is not the case. Suspended-load transport is distributed between the main channel and the zone behind the weir in the same ratio as the discharge. The distribution of bed-load transport strongly depends on the particle diameter. This difference shows that the parameterization of weirs in depth-averaged Delft3D models gives significant errors in the prediction of sediment transport over hydraulic structures, especially when bed-load transport is dominant. The transport magnitude can be reduced by increasing the bed level points near the weir to crest level. In this schematization, nearly all bed-load transport is blocked and suspended-load transport is reduced. A weir without increased bed level points overestimates the sediment transport over the structure. When the bed level points are increased until crest level of the weir, the sediment transport over the weir is underestimated. The sediment transport over the weir can be tuned by an increased bed level somewhere between zero and crest level. The distribution of sediment between the main channel (index 1) and the area behind the weir (index 2) can be described with a relation S2/S1 = C*Q2/Q1: The value of C as given by Delft3D can be judged with the following rules of thumb: (1) Suspended-load transport is distributed between the main channel and the zone behind the weir in the same ratio as the discharge, so C = 1. (2) For bed-load transport in three-dimensional situations with clearly oblique flow over the weir, the coefficient C can be related to the excess shear stress at the upstream slope, in which the actual and critical Shields parameter are adjusted for slope effects. (3) In situations where the flow is directed almost perpendicular to the crest of the structure, the conclusions of Lauchlan (2001) are recommended. Nearly all mobile sediment is transported over the structure in these situations. The coefficient C in Delft3D can be influenced by giving the bed level points near the weir the right height.","Hydraulic structures; Numerical modelling; Sediment transport; Delft3D; FLUENT; Morphology; Ruimte voor de Rivier; Room for the River; Computational Fluid Dynamics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Hasselaar, B. (mentor)","2010","Klimaatinstallaties regelen het binnenklimaat van gebruiksruimtes. Gebruiksruimtes moeten een aangename temperatuur en voldoende ventilatie hebben. Er zijn twee type systemen namelijk decentraal en centraal en wanneer ze beiden gebruikt worden, dan heet dit een hybride concept. Centrale installaties worden meestal bovenop het gebouw geplaatst, van waar uit ventilatieleidingen door het gehele gebouw lopen, zodat deze alle ruimtes kan ventileren en klimatiseren. Decentrale installaties worden lokaal in de ruimte toegepast en zijn meestal geïntegreerd in de gevel. Decentrale klimaatinstallaties systemen bieden grote voordelen ten op zichtte van de centrale systemen, vooral op het gebied van gebruik en bedieningsgemak scoren decentrale systemen beter. Het binnenklimaat is per ruimte en per gebruiker te regelen. Ruimtes zijn flexibeler voor functie verandering, doordat de verwarm, ventilatie en koelcapaciteit in te stellen zijn en daarbij kan er gemakkelijker extra installaties geplaatst worden om de capaciteit te vergroten. De flexibiliteit hangt wel af van de geveldoorvoer. Ook kunnen decentrale installaties aanzienlijk in de bouwkosten van het gebouw besparen. Het grootste nadeel is dat decentrale installaties een niet al te grote worp hebben en dat ze in contact moeten staan met de buitenlucht. Ruimtes middenin het gebouw kunnen niet direct geventileerd worden. Het gebruik van dunne ventilatieleidingen die direct naar de buitengevel lopen, zou dit kunnen oplossen. Decentrale systemen bieden niet alleen in de nieuwbouw grote kansen. Ze zijn ook interessant voor renovatieprojecten doordat de systemen eenvoudig geplaatst kunnen worden zonder dat er extra leidingen geplaatst hoeven worden. Dit hangt echter af van het type systeem en van het renovatieproject. Bij renovatie van huizen wordt de schil beter geïsoleerd en worden kieren beter gedicht. Hierdoor is het gebouw luchtdichter en gaat er minder warmte verloren. Dan zal er ook minder vers lucht de ruimte infiltreren. Het gevolg is dat er meer verse lucht geventileerd moet worden. Veel gebruikers laten de ramen in de winter dicht en zetten de roosters dicht, omdat ze het vinden tochten. Hierdoor wordt er onvoldoende geventileerd, waardoor gezondheidsklachten kunnen optreden. Decentrale systemen spelen hierop in doordat ze tochtvrij en vraaggestuurd ventileren. In Nederland wordt nu de centrale installaties veel toegepast, mede doordat de mogelijkheden van decentrale installaties niet bekend zijn en deze nog volop in ontwikkeling zijn. Er zijn verschillende type decentrale klimaatinstallatie systemen met verschillende manieren van koelen en verwarmen en ventileren. Een aantal systemen ventileren volgens een hybride concept en andere volledig decentraal. Er zijn systemen die afhankelijk zijn van een centrale verwarming en/of koelsysteem. Sommigen zijn onafhankelijk van andere installaties en zijn overal in het gebouw decentraal toe te passen. De systemen zijn in dit onderzoek toegepast op en case studie, waarna ze met elkaar vergeleken zijn. Uit het onderzoek komt naar voren hoe belangrijk de toepassing van warmteterugwinning(WTW) bij het ventileren is. Dit bespaart niet alleen energie, maar het bespaard ook in de benodigde verwarmcapaciteit, omdat er minder warmte verloren gaat. Ook het gebruik van nachtventilatie is energiezuinig. Door de gehele nacht door te ventileren, wordt de warmte uit de ruimte en vooral constructie onttrokken. De constructie kan gedurende de dag de warmte uit de ruimte ontrekken, zodat de constructie opwarmt en deze vervolgens in de nacht weer kan afkoelen. De belangrijkste factor waarop een keuze tussen decentrale systemen gebaseerd kan worden is de capaciteit op het gebied van ventilatie, verwarming en koeling met daarbij de percentage WTW. Uit het onderzoek blijkt dat de bestaande decentrale systemen een te kleine ventilatiecapaciteit hebben om grote kantoorruimtes en vergaderruimtes, welke hogere ventilatie-eisen hebben, te ventileren. Daarbij zou de percentage van de WTW en het koelvermogen verhoogd kunnen worden. De Smartbox is een systeem die hier op een energie zuinige manier mee om gaat, echter is deze nog niet in productie en is er alleen nog een prototype van gemaakt, maar het bied wel perspectief voor de toekomst.","decentralized climate system; decentrale klimaatinstallatie systeem","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","2010-06-29","Architecture","Building Technology","","Climate Design","",""

(mentor)","2010","In dit rapport wordt een probabilistisch (diepte-) ontwerp gepresenteerd voor het binnengebied van de haven van Rotterdam. Ook worden de mogelijke faalmechanismen (bodemberoering en verminderd manoeuvreerbaarheid) bestudeerd. Als referentie modellen zijn bestudeerd de modellen Harap en Protide van Rijkswaterstaat, en CADET van US Army Corps of Engineers. Deze modellen zijn echter toepasbaar in open wateren (buiten de haven) en verschillen hiermee, zoals in het rapport naar voren zal komen, met het model voor het binnengebied. Het probabilistische ontwerp beoogt inzicht te verkrijgen in de sterkte “R” (resistence) en de belasting “S” (sollicitation) van een systeem. De nautisch gegarandeerde diepte kan dan gezien worden als sterkte (R) in het model en het getij, de golven, squat en diepgang als belasting (S). In deze studie worden twee zogenaamde faalmechanismen onderscheiden:  Bodemberoering  Verminderde manoeuvreerbaarheid/bestuurbaarheid De verschillen tussen de twee faalmechanismen in de bepaling van de kielspeling zijn onderzocht. Daarin zijn de hiervoor genoemde parameters gerelateerd aan het faalmechanisme. Zo is gebleken dat niet alle factoren relevant zijn voor elk faalmechanisme. In geval van het faalmechanisme bodemberoering is logischerwijs geen rekening gehouden met de manoeuvreermarge. In geval van verminderd manoeuvreren wordt het aspect ‘scheepsbewegingen in golven’ niet in beschouwing genomen, vanwege het dynamische karakter van het aspect. Gezien de zeer beperkte golfindringing kan gesteld worden dat het faalmechanisme bodemberoering niet dominant is. Bovendien ligt de referentiediepte bij dit faalmechanisme (geconsolideerde bodem) lager dan de referentiediepte van het faalmechanisme verminderd manoeuvreren (nautische bodem). Het faalmechanisme verminderd manoeuvreren is dan ook het uitgangspunt van het model. Hierbij is de aanvaardbare kans (het criterium) op verminderd manoeuvreren 1%. Met behulp van de Monte Carlo Simulatie is de kielspeling Z bepaald aan de hand van verdelingen van de parameters in formule (1), waarbij moet gelden Z<1 om falen te voorkomen. De simulatie is uitgevoerd voor de havens en het Beerkanaal in de Maasvlakte 1. Vervolgens is de diepte in de havenbekkens geoptimaliseerd door de nautisch gegarandeerde diepte te verhogen of verlagen tot dat de diepte net voldoet (<1,0%). De conclusies uit deze studie zijn:  Het is mogelijk om ook voor het binnengebied de diepte op een probabilistische manier uit te rekenen;  In het onderzochte gebied is het faalmechanisme “verminderd manoeuvreren” dominant ten opzichte van het faalmechanisme “bodemberoering”;  De probabilistische methode lijkt een voordeel op te leveren in de orde grootte van tienden meters tot zelfs meer dan 1 meter;  Toepassing van een toelatingsbeleid binnen de probabilistische methode is noodzakelijk;  De mogelijkheid bestaat om het toegepaste model uit te breiden tot een operationele tool.","probabilistic; port design; risico","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2010","Nowadays large organizations are confronted with the increasing complex network of processes, information flows and stakeholders which all should be managed to provide the customer with end products and services. In a utopia, every actor in an organization would be able to have an overview of his area of concern. Management would have a precise high level overview of all the business processes and their interaction with the information they manipulate through applications. They would exactly know which processes and actors are affected by a business decision. The operational employee would exactly know how the decisions he makes influence the organization as a whole. Unfortunately, misalignment is the biggest challenge of current organizations. The Rijkswaterstaat is no exception. To cope with the complexity the Enterprise Architecture and Consultancy (EAC) team of the RWS has adapted the RWS Enterprise Architecture Framework (RWS-EAF) as blueprint to structure the organization. This methodology combines the Integrated Architecture framework (IAF, which is the result of years of practical experience of Capgemini) with the DEMO methodology, a scientifically founded method for modeling the essence of an organization. The RWS-EA framework has already proven its value. During the Application Portfolio Rationalization project, the DEMO based business architecture has been linked to the applications used within the RWS. Still it proves to be a challenge to maintain a synergy within the enterprise architecture framework. As a result, the alignment between the business and the application/IT infrastructure is less than optimal. The thesis’s objective is to improve this connection by elaborating on an essential transitional stage in between; the Information Architecture. The products in the RWS-EA are analyzed by positioning them in a DEMO perspective. An assessment framework created during research is consulted to qualify the current Information Architecture of the RWS. To further synchronize the RWS organization, UPP process models created by Beheersorganisatie Processen en Systemen (BPS) of the RWS are included by using a methodology adopted from previous research. A DEMO based methodology which allows development of products for the Business, Information and Application organization is demonstrated with the use of a case study. The most notable models are the Process Structure Diagrams (PSD) which satisfies the DEMO-3 specification and the Natural BID models which are based upon a proposal of the EAC team. The cross relationship between the products and their place within the RWS-EAF are depicted. The proposed design of the Information Architecture is qualified to the assessment framework. Some final thoughts are given about the methodology as developed, the integration in the architectural tools and the possibilities for further improvement in future iterations.","computer science; information architecture; DEMO; enterprise architecture; Rijkswaterstaat; ontology","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Information Systems","","Information Architecture","",""

Two main courtyards represent the most prominent features. Their setup is based on the ancient Roman 'domus' type. The first courtyard - 'atrium' - is open to public and surrounded by shops. The second courtyard - 'peristyle' - gives access to the surrounding flats. It is of private nature and offers a small garden. The design is based on research into Berlin Mietskasernen in general and 'Meyer's Hof' in specific. Amsterdam's former shipyard area NDSM on the Northern shore of the Ij is the chosen site for the project. However the building complex is designed with the intention to generate a prototypical solution to Amsterdam's housing shortage. The ambition is to address the problem by means of large scale residential buildings based on the notion that there is plenty of room for densification within the city’s boundaries. Hence the project represents a counter-initiative to the Dutch suburbia-supporting VINEX strategy.","Mietskaserne; domus; NDSM","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture","Architecture","","ExploreLab","",""

(mentor)","2010","When a group decides to plan and organize a vacation, many researchers mention that group decision making within the travel planning problem often leads to suboptimal decisions. This can be explained by the fact that the process of travel group decision making is typically ineffective. To overcome some of the problems, we propose an intelligent Group Decision Support System named Trip.Easy that creates synergy between human and machine intelligence in order to improve group decision making. The objective of this study is to develop a prototype of the Trip.Easy GDSS that combines a well-structured decision process with domain knowledge and an intelligent recommendation mechanism that facilitates reaching a consensus for the group trip planning problem. As a result, a well-designed group decision process is provided that (i) facilitates users and makes them aware of all interesting outcomes by providing intelligent recommendations, (ii) supports collaboration at a distance, (iii) minimizes irrational acts due to various influences and (iv) facilitates effective communication by means of a clear and fair process that converges to an outcome that satisfies all group members. Subsequently, a structured experiment has been designed and conducted to empirically acquire measurements of users’ satisfaction for the designed group decision process. A total of 120 participants, divided into 30 groups, were invited for the experiment. Each group was instructed to organize a city trip while using the Trip.Easy GDSS. After each session, the participants were asked to fill in a questionnaire. Analysis of the data showed that users were satisfied with the decision process of Trip.Easy GDSS. Users perceived the interaction through the graphical user interface with the Trip.Easy GDSS during the decision process as user-friendly. Furthermore, users valued the process as fair. Based upon these findings, we may conclude that the proposed group decision process that is integrated in the Trip.Easy GDSS prototype is able to facilitate users to converge towards a satisfying travel destination.","group decision support system; group decision process; group decision-making; human-machine interaction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-06-29","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Man-Machine Interaction group","","MKE","",""

(mentor); Behrends, T. (mentor)","2010","In this study metallurgical processing of two different kinds of zinc-bearing residues have been performed: Zinc A and Zinc B. These residues have been stored for over 15 years in Rotterdam Harbor. The chemical compositions of the residues have been determined and showed that zinc ferrite is a major phase present. Zinc ferrite is not soluble under normal alkaline and acidic conditions and is not recovered by the Waelz-process, which is commonly employed for such zinc-bearing residues. An innovative flowsheet for processing zinc ferrite-bearing residues has been developed during a pre-feasibility study, with goal to selectively recover zinc, including zinc from zinc ferrite. The innovative flowsheet consists of the following steps: (1) Water pre-washing: removing water soluble salts, in particular the chlorides in Zinc A (~9%). (2) 1st step alkaline leaching with caustic soda (NaOH): dissolving free ZnO into solution, for both water-washed Zinc A and original (unwashed) Zinc B. (3) Roasting of the first leach residue in the presence a suitable reagent: decomposing the zinc ferrite to free ZnO. (4) 2nd step alkaline leaching with NaOH: dissolving all free ZnO into solution. (5) Solution purification by cementation: removing impurities in particular lead and copper, by using zinc powder. (6) Electrowinning of zinc in NaOH solution: the purified zinc bearing solutions are subsequently precipitated to the final product of Zn metal. Optimal operating conditions for the processes are deduced from a literature review in which similar residues are processed. Additionally, optimal operating conditions for the conversion of zinc ferrite into zinc oxide has been investigated using synthetic zinc ferrite with addition of Mg(OH)2, Ca(OH)2, NaOH, or Na2CO3. Finally, Na2CO3 has been chosen as reagent and used in experiments with real zinc-bearing residues. Zinc A is water washed to remove the chlorides present. Then both the water washed residue of Zinc A, and Zinc B, are leached in an alkaline solution of 5M NaOH at 90?C for 1 hour. Both zinc and lead are selectively extracted, leaving iron oxides and zinc ferrite in the residue. The filtercake is fused with Na2CO3 at 950?C for 2 hours to convert zinc ferrite into zinc oxide. The calcined product is leached in fresh alkaline solution of 5M NaOH to recover zinc. The final residue is then water washed to remove residual sodium. The filtrates from the first and second leaching step are purified, with use of zinc dust, or directly used for electrowinning experiments. The removal efficiency of chloride, sodium and potassium during water washing of Zinc A were 62%, 41% and 71% respectively. Overall dissolution yields for Zinc A and Zinc B of zinc and lead were 82%, 80% and 64%, 78% respectively. Cementation of impurities (Pb, Cu, Cr) with zinc dust followed by an electrowinning step achieving a grade zinc deposit of 94%. Finally, it can be concluded that the combined hydro -and pyrometallurgical flowsheet is technically feasible. Furthermore, results can be improved further by optimization of major operating steps.","zinc-bearing residues; hydrometallurgy; zinc ferrite; leaching; roasting; electrolysis; zinc","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Resource Engineering","","Mineral Engineering","",""

(mentor)","2010","The Nevado del Ruiz volcano is an active and dangerous volcano in the Andean volcanic belt. Measuring seismic activity is one of the most reliable and widely used techniques to monitor and predict renewed volcanic activity. Seismic activity can be caused by several different underlying physical processes. It is of interest to the earth-science observatories monitoring potentially dangerous volcanoes to determine the underlying cause of the registered earthquakes. Typically segmented seismic recordings are classified by hand often based upon their frequency contents. An automated system capable of discriminating reliably between several different seismic recording classes can potentially release the human expert from the labor intensive classification task. An Interesting question concerning the frequency representation of the segmented seismic recordings is: if it is better to use only frequency information in the form of a single spectrum or to use a time frequency representation such as a spectrogram. Furthermore it is of interest to see if the ordering of the spectral frames inside the resulting spectrograms is of importance. In this study a justified spectrogram representation is developed for the segmented recordings from the Nevado del Ruiz volcano. Using this spectrogram representation we also look at five different classification strategies in combination with a large number of different classifiers. Often seismic events such as volcanic tectonic earthquakes, tectonic earthquakes, rockfall etc... are registered by several seismic stations. It is of interest to see if the recordings of multiple stations can be combined to improve classification results. Furthermore it is of interest to see how well the untrained and trained classifier systems generalize to the recordings of other stations.","pattern recognition; seismic recordings","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Media and knowledge engeneering","","Pattern recognition","",""

(mentor)","2010","Probleem In de huidige economische situatie (2009) zijn bedrijven genoodzaakt het aantal banen te verminderen. Voor ING Nederland heeft dit directe consequenties voor de huisvesting. Door de continue veranderingen in de organisatiestructuur en fluctuaties in het aantal medewerkers ontstaan mismatches tussen vraag en aanbod die vragen om een flexibel portfoliobeheer. Door meer flexibiliteit in de portfolio kunnen onnodige kosten bespaard worden en kan beter aan de kwalitatieve en kwantitatieve vraag voldaan worden. Op dit moment is er te weinig inzicht in wie en wat de gebruiker is om de functionele eisen vast te kunnen stellen en acties te ondernemen om de mismatches op te lossen. Daarbij wordt de flexibiliteit op dit moment beperkt door een niet doordacht beleid voor investeringen en desinvesteringen. En is het voor ING nog niet duidelijk welke gebouwen belangrijk zijn voor de organisatie en hoe deze binnen de portfolio behouden kunnen worden wanneer kantoorruimte afgestoten dient te worden. Vraagstelling Op welke manier kan een portfolio analyseinstrument bijdragen aan het strategisch beheren van de vastgoedportfolio door inzicht te bieden in de gebruikers, hun specifieke wensen aan huisvesting en de mogelijkheden die er zijn om het aanbod aan de vraag te matchen, zowel in kwalitatieve als kwantitatieve zin? DAS Framework Het DAS Framework (Designing an Accommodation Strategy) (De Jonge, Arkesteijn, et. al. , 2008) beschrijft een manier om de doelen (de vraag) en de middelen (het aanbod) op elkaar af te stemmen. Het Framework is flexibel opgesteld zodat voor zowel verschillende actoren als verschillende soorten vastgoed, op verschillende niveaus en voor verschillende tijdbestekken de afstemming opgesteld kan worden. De methode heeft vier afstemmingsmomenten van waaruit begonnen kan worden de strategie vorm te geven. 1 Mismatch tussen huidige vraag en huidig aanbod Wat hebben we nodig? vs Wat hebben we? 2 Mismatch tussen toekomstige vraag en huidige aanbod Wat zouden we nodig kunnen hebben? vs Wat hebben we? 3 Alternatieven Overbruggen mismatch toekomstige vraag en huidig aanbod Wat hebben we? vs Wat zouden we nodig kunnen hebben? 4 Step-by-step plan Het realiseren van: Wat is in de toekomst gewenst? Theorisch kader Als basis voor dit onderzoek worden de verschillende ele-menten in het ‘DAS Framework’ (De Jonge, Arkesteijn, 2008) gebruikt en uitgewerkt in zes deelgebieden. 1 Necessities De huidige en toekomstige vraag zijn de wensen en eisen (‘Necessities’) van de organisatie. Door het groeperen van afdelingen in clusters wordt de vraag geoptimaliseerd. Als opdelingscriteria worden vijf eigenschappen gebruikt: 1 Codificeerbaarheid 2 Afhankelijkheid 3 Scope 4 Representatie 5 Functie De kwalitatieve vraag van de gebruiker wordt vertaald in concrete vastgoedeigenschappen door middel van vier stappen: 1 Weegfactoren strategische doelstellingen 2 Weegfactoren criteria per strategische doelstelling 3 Schaalverdeling eigenschappen per criterium 4 Tetra bepaling weegfactoren en schaalverdelingen De kwantitatieve vraag wordt beschreven in werkplekken door de bezettingsgraad en flexratio per gebruikersgroep te vermenigvuldigen met het aantal werknemers. 2 Supplies Het huidige en toekomstige aanbod van de portfolio (‘Supplies’) beschrijft welke middelen voorhanden zijn om de organisatie te huisvesten. Het kwalitatieve aanbod wordt bepaald door de beoordeling van de gebouwen op de schaalverdelingen die bij de kwalitatieve vraag zijn gedefinieerd. Het kwantitatieve aanbod wordt beschreven in het aantal beschikbare werkplekken van de gebouwen. 3 Fitting Het matchen van de huisvestingsvraag, kwalitatief en kwantitatief, met de beschikbare portfolio wordt in dit onderzoek ‘Fitting’ genoemd. De kwalitatieve fitting wordt verkregen door de kwalitatieve beoordeling van de gebouwen af te zetten tegen de kwalitatieve eisen (welke gebouwen zijn geschikt bevonden per gebruikersgroep), de kwantitatieve fitting door het verschil tussen de huidige en toekomstige beschikbare en gevraagde ruimte. 4 Decisioning ‘Desicioning’ beschrijft in dit onderzoek het opstellen van alternatieven om de mismatch tussen vraag en aanbod door gebouwingrepen op te lossen. Elke portfolio samenstelling wordt opgebouwd vanuit vier analysemomenten. Eerst wordt nagegaan wat wenselijk is, vervolgens wat de ruimtebehoefte is, dan wat mogelijk is en als laatste wat noodzakelijk is. 1 Eerste analysemoment beoordeeld welke van de beheerde gebouwen aansluit bij de kwalitatieve vraag. 2 Tweede analysemoment wordt bekeken in welke mate de keuze van de gebouwen op basis van de kwalitatieve normen matcht met de ruimtebehoefte van de organisatie. 3 Derde analysemoment geeft een overzicht in welke mate de gewenste portfolio samenstelling op basis van analysemoment één en twee, binnen het natuurlijk verloop van de huurcontracten gerealiseerd kan worden. 4 Vierde analysemoment geeft inzicht welke ingreep genomen kan worden aan de hand van de verhouding tussen de houdbaarheid voor de organisatie en de afstootbaarheid van de gebouwen in de markt. De uitkomsten van de verschillende analyses bepalen de objectbeslissingen per gebouw om tot een passende portfolio samenstelling te komen. 5 Considering Het vergelijken en afwegen van de alternatieven in financiële zin wordt in dit onderzoek ‘Decisioning’ genoemd. De discounted cash flow berekening geeft per alternatief aan wat de totale investering is bekeken over een bepaalde tijdsperiode. Het verschil in DCF waarde geeft aan welke samenstelling het meest rendementbewust is. Daarnaast zal de invloed van elke portfolio samenstelling op de winst- en verliesrekening aangegeven worden. 6 Executing De objectbeslissingen van de meest geschikt bevonden portfoliosamenstelling kunnen vertaald worden in een stappenplan zodat bij uitvoering (‘Executing’) ervan de portfolio op een afgewogen manier beheerd wordt. Model De theorie van de bovenbeschreven deelgebieden is omgezet in een model zodat de werkbaarheid vergroot wordt. Om de practische toepasbaarheid van het model te testen in een case opgesteld. Als case is ING regio amsterdam gebruikt. In het consideringssheet kan de vraag naar en het aanbod van de huisvesting geanalyseerd worden. De analysemomenten geven inzicht welke gebouwen gewenst zijn, welke huisvesting gevraagd wordt en wat per gebouw mogelijk is. In hetzelfde sheet kunnen objectbeslissingen aan gebouwen gegeven worden, zodat de match tussen vraag en aanbod gerealiseerd kan worden met inachtname van de mogelijk- en onmogelijkheden van de individuele gebouwen.","Corporate Real Estate Management; Model; Optimal real estate strategy; Dynamische organisatie; DAS Framework; Kwalitatief kwantitatief; Huisvesting","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","2010-11-24","Architecture","Real Estate & Housing","","Corporate Real Estate Management","",""

(mentor)","2010","In the high tech precision industry capacitive sensors often are used to measure distances with sub-nanometre accuracy and stability. It is well known that the dielectric constant of the medium between the sensor electrodes changes with the environment and is of influence on the measurement results. However, measurements performed at the Delft University of Technology in an environment with changing humidity, with an electrode spacing ranging from 10 ?m to 100 ?m, showed disturbances of more than hundred times the expected value; in those measurements up to 250 nm was found instead of the expected disturbance of 1.7 nm. After inquiry also Physik instrumente could confirm such behaviour. Because such anomaly is of severe influence on the stability and accuracy of capacitive sensors in this report the influence of humidity is studied and described in detail. A possible explanation for the disturbances is the adsorption of water on the capacitive electrodes. Water is a dipole molecule that easily adsorbs on almost all surfaces. The amount of adsorbed water as well as the shape (smooth layer or droplet) depends on the humidity level as well as on the material type (hydrophobic, hydrophilic), roughness and contamination. When water molecules adsorb on the capacitive electrodes, the average dielectric constant between the electrodes increases. Each molecular layer of water disturbs the capacitive measurement with an amount equal to its layer thickness of 0.31 nm. In a number of publications the presence of adsorbed water is recognized, but the anomalous effect is attributed to short circuiting due to water layers adsorbing on the insulators. From most studies in other fields it appears that only a few nanometres of water is adsorbed. Those who reported on thicker layers described that when the adsorbed layer thickness passes 1 nm, droplets start to form, with heights up to 100 nm. Since no clear relation could be found in literature, a measurement setup was designed and built. This setup consisted of a capacitive sensor and an optical reference sensor; a laser interferometer. The capacitive sensor contained one aluminium electrode and one semi-transparent electrode of gold-palladium sputtered on a fused silica surface, which enabled the interferometer to measure at exactly the same location as the capacitive sensor. When measuring at the same location the same adsorbed water droplets could be measured. It follows from theory that both measuring concepts should respond in opposite direction to water layers. This difference could be used to determine the total water layer thickness. ii When using this experimental setup with an electrode spacing of 50 ?m while changing the humidity level from 30 to 90 %RH, differences in sensor output up to 400 nm were found. These differences were proven to be dependent on the relative humidity and can be described with a power function. From measurements conducted with different electrode spacings it appeared that the effect did not depend on the electrode spacing. Therefore the assumption of adsorbed water on the capacitive electrodes holds. The effect of changing water layers on the laser interferometer was much smaller than expected. This can be explained by water droplets that diffuse the laser beam; the beam only reflects on the electrode at locations where the (wetted) surface is smooth. All in all the effect of adsorption of water on capacitive measurement is proven to be more than known in literature. However, since in practice the humidity is changing far slower than during the measurements in this report, sub-nm stability still is possible when using capacitive sensors.","Humidity Effect; Sensors; Positioning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2010-07-14","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Precision and Microsystems Engineering","","","",""

The program aims at identifying probable systemic shifts in the social and economic domains likely to affect our business and create intellectual property in new areas. By developing future scenarios (narratives) and accompanying concepts (provocations) the Probes team aims at challenging conventional thinking and stimulate debate both inside and outside of Philips Design. This debate helps to develop an understanding of the research domain, which can then be translated back to medium- and short term projects, stimulating people in thinking things can be done in a different way. At first the focus of this project was on finding out how insights on the Electronic Tattoo provocation could be made valuable as a source of inspiration for the internal design community of Philips Design, Therefore the context studies were aimed at the internal and external communication of the Electronic Tattoo provocation and the current insights generation and communication. From these context studies it became clear that the main problem preventing the insights from the provocation being inspiring for the designers was the lack of engagement of the designers with the Design Probes. This lack of engagement is caused by the fact that the designers do not feel they can contribute to the Design Probes and do not see the link with their own work. This is caused by the lack of dialogue between the Probes team and the designers and the limited amount of information the designers get about the purpose of the Design Probes within the innovation strategy of Philips Design and the narrative behind the provocation. These findings led to the formulation of the design focus for the concept development, which is on the design of a communication tool to stimulate dialogue between the designers and the Probes team, make it easy to share inspirational materials with colleagues and with that enable the inspirational information from the Design Probes to spread through the company. The communication tool should match the current way of handling inspirational materials of the designers, allowing for serendipitous encounters with inspirational materials outside their project scope, stimulating critical thinking about the proposed future possibilities and the development of their own point of view about it. The information from the Design Probes should be communicated when the designers are looking for inspiration themselves at their personal workspace, as part of their daily work. When looking at the insights, it is concluded that contextual insights should be generated for the Electronic Tattoo provocation as they are currently not available. The contextual insights allow the designers to connect to the experiences of the consumers as well as their own, which helps them to develop their own opinion about the issues addressed in the probe narrative and the insights. Three concepts have been developed; the Probe Sketch Tables, Personal Probe Book and Probe Talks App. The concepts are based on the same principles,but make use of different media. For the evaluation an experiential prototype was made of one of the concepts and tested at Philips Design in Eindhoven. The conclusions from the evaluation are that the concepts complement each other and should be implemented together, as they all match different preferences of handling inspirational materials of the designers.","Design Probes; inspiration; contextual insights","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","","",""

They do not consider the complex nature of city and take little into consideration of the welfare of people. Then, the question comes, what is a proper model of building cities? A city serves as a receptacle of life. There are various lifestyles co-existing in a city. They can be categorized into scales, e.g., global scale (L), local scale (S) and those in between (M). A good city should give places and provide diverse choices for all the lives happening together and interacting with each other. In this sense, the vitality will be achieved. On the other hand, a city is an emerging systems with its own internal growing force. Therefore, the diversity can not be simply imposed by designers’ own wish. It has to be reached by embracing the self-organization process of the city. Therefore, to achieve the real diversity (L, M, S), the study considers Complexity Theories of Cities as one of the theoretical bases. It tries to search for an innovative approach, through which the self-organization process of cities could be properly guided and facilitated.","Beijing; urban rural syndicate; urban complexity; urban vitality","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture","Urbanism","","Complex Cities","",""

(mentor); Stikkelman, R.M. (mentor); Grievink, J. (mentor)","2010","The thesis research was conducted at the section E&I (energy and industry) of the faculty of Technology, Policy and Management. The world around us is complex and this complexity is only expected to increase as technological development spurs on. This complexity arises from social and technical parts that interact with each other and co?evolve over time, resulting in emergent system behaviour and structure. Today’s industrial systems are interesting examples of socio?technical systems that contain large aggregates of technical components and actors that make economic and strategic decisions, which shape the physical world. It is impossible to predict or steer future developments of these systems because of the non?linear interaction and feedback loops between the different social and technical components. However, insight about the fundamental behavioural modes and possible evolutionary pathways can be gained by building a computer model. In this thesis agent?based modelling (ABM) was used; in ABM, an agent represents an independent socio?technical component in the system. It has a state that represents the physical and economic assets and a behavioural component in which reasoning and decision?making takes place which in turn influence the state of the agent and interactions with the outside world. Maasvlakte II, the new extension of the Rotterdam harbour area that is currently under construction is an ideal case study to expand experience with ABM; the ambition of the Port of Rotterdam is to realise sustainable chemical facilities, like a synthesis gas cluster that uses different types of feedstock to produce a variety of clean end products, like fuels and value?added chemicals. The problem with previously built ABMs is that the technical detail represented is too limited to apply it to syngas networks; the technical part of the agents is currently modelled as a black box and generic facilities are taken as a starting point. The question is whether this lack of detail makes a significant difference for the structure of the syngas cluster that evolves and the agent decision?making. The main question of the research was therefore: “What is the added value of Agent based modelling of large scale syngas networks at Maasvlakte II with ‘grey?box’ models representing syngas technologies instead of black?box models?” The research method consisted of a literature study of the different syngas technologies and building the agent?based model. Developing the ABM entails conceptualisation and formalisation of the syngas technologies in an ontology (the system decomposition method), making a storyboard of the agent’s behaviour and transcribing this to (pseudo?)code. There was unfortunately not enough time left for full implementation and running of the model. The main added detail that was proposed is a description of the composition of the gasifier feedstock and syngas, and a more detailed description of technologies that may influence this composition; i.e. treatment units and reactors are described separately, and descriptions of reactors are diversified to several reactors that produce low or high quality syngas. The general conclusion from the research is that the expected added value of adding technical detail to the black box descriptions of syngas technologies is related to the increased realism of network connections, while unfeasible connections are ruled out by the constraints that are imposed by adding technical detail in describing different reactor types and including the syngas composition. The description of treatment units and impurities in the composition of streams also make it better possible to evaluate the sustainability of the system and economic viability of routes from feedstock to end product. The amount of work that should is involved in adding technical detail to the agentbased model is however considerable, and the added value is partly offset by the problems that were found during the research. The three main problems are: There is a myriad of different syngas technologies, and it is very easy to get lost in the details, while it is hard to conceptualise them and formalise them. This is because all detail levels are somehow connected. The major problem of this class was to decide how the mass balances should be dealt with; the optimal solutions lies in between using a few standard input and output compositions without calculating anything, or detailed calculation of the composition as is done with flowsheeting programs like ASPEN. The second main problem was that the technical detail added does also imply that agents will have to reason about the design criteria that are added, which means that the more technical detail is added, the more (pseuco?)code has to be written to capture agent reasoning and decision?making. The final main problem was that in some cases this reasoning and decision?making is so complex that it can hardly be captured in (pseudo?)code, for example strategic behaviour and contract negotiation. The largest danger is falling in the trap of (having the intention of) adding too much detail. The main recommendation is thus to define the level of detail per case study, and at a level relevant for the context of that case study; it is better to have a partial model than no model at all. For the research of syngas network evolution over time one should focus on the interface between syngas producing and syngas consuming technologies, which means including the composition of syngas and factors that influence this composition, like different reactor types and gas treatment technology. When evaluating the sustainability of a syngas network, one should also include pre?treatment of gasifier feedstock. A second recommendation is to conduct a parameter sweep for certain variables of which it is unsure how they influence the decision?making of the agents or when the behaviour of the agents is too complex to capture with simple (pseudo?)code. The final recommendation to be made when conducting agent?based modelling is to be aware of the fragile balance between too much and too few detail; the system should be defined in such an extent that the behaviour of the agents is restricted in a realistic way while leaving enough degrees of freedom for the system to exhibit complex and emergent phenomena. Future research should focus on solving the problems with mass balance calculations by taking a chemical engineering point of view and learning from how flowsheeting programs have tackled these problems previously, and figure out what the breath and depth of the interplay is between technological details, social decision?making, and economic aspects of the model.","agent-based modelling; syngas networks; Maasvlakte II; synthesis gas","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2010-07-01","Applied Sciences","Product and Process Engineering","","Chemical Engineering","",""

Long travelled swell measured in the Pacific coast of Costa Rica, wind swell from the Atlantic coast of Costa Rica, short period wind waves from the Ebro Delta in Mediterranean coast of Spain, and waves measured during the passing of Hurricane Wilma near Cancun, Mexico were analyzed. A total of 5795 wave records from the sites above were analyzed. A statistical stability analysis of the wave data was done. The measured wave height distribution was compared with the Raleigh distribution. The corresponding significant wave height and period distribution based on the zero down crossing method was obtained for all the records. The joint individual wave height-period distribution was obtained and the characteristic statistic wave heights and periods were obtained. The time variation of these parameters, including the skewness and kurtosis of the time series were obtained to determine the statistical stability of the data. A detailed spectral analysis using the Fourier transform was done on all the records. The whole record for each location was represented as time variant frequency energy spectrogram. The highest measured record’s spectra for each site were examined in detail. The peakedness, band width, grouping, regularity spectral parameters, and the six principal moments of all the wave records were obtained. The spectra were then compared to the JONSWAP spectrum. Special attention was taken into the non-linear components present in the spectra. Temporal and energetic wave grouping parameters were analyzed using the run length theory. Low frequency modulation was examined against grouping observation. The capability of the variance spectra based on the Fourier transform to describe the measured wave grouping was analyzed and confirmed through the spectral grouping parameter Ka. The long waves present in the records were analyzed using a low pass filter. Spectral analysis was carried out on the filtered time series. The results between the different sites were compared and Longuet-Higgins set down equation under wave groups was calibrated and validated to predict the long wave spectral significant wave height, given the wave spectral significant height, the peak spectral period and the water depth outside the breaker zone. A spectral analysis using the Hilbert Huang method was done to the most energetic measured events of each record. A detail comparison was done between the result of the Fourier transform variance spectral analysis and the Hilbert Huang method. The limitations of the Fourier based spectra and the new Hilbert Huang transform spectra were examined in detail.","Wave Spectra; Wave Groups; Long Waves; Infragravity Waves; Hilbert Huang Spectra","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Section Hydraulic Engineering","","CoMEM - Coastal and Marine Engineering and Management","",""

Software maintenance on this system is hard to perform, because of the dependencies between the different components. This thesis answers the main research question: ”To which extent do existing software maintenance principles apply to changing a running software system based on a Data Distribution Service with Complex Event Processing?”. To answer this research question, an existing change request procedure is used as a basis to create a new change request procedure. A formalising method is added to have a formal way for the developer to analyse the impact of a change. This is needed because of the dependencies within the DDS/CEP system, it is easy to forget to change an important part of the system. The hardest part of the change request is the fact that the system is already running in a production environment, so if a mistake is made, data may be lost. To help with this complex problem a DDS monitoring tool is developed in this thesis, which visualises the structure of the DDS. This tool has more features to ease the maintenance of the system, such as highlighting edges in the graph with similar QoS settings. The case study is performed on a prototype of a system, to show this change request procedure is sufficient, which is verified with the tool.","DDS; CEP; Software maintenance; Data Distribution Service; Complex Event Processing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Software Technology","","","",""

The generalized crisis of several industrial sectors contributed to the appearance of derelict industrial areas. The establishment of new and more severe environmental legislation associated with an increasing public pressure related with the need to protect the environment and the people’s desire for interaction with nature or the natural world increase the development of landscape reclamation project. An important step towards a sustainable city is represented by enhancing the cast-off industrial areas with the optic of the recovery and of reuse of the existing heritage. The transformation of derelict sites into parks and public spaces represents a significant enhancement to the quality of life and land use, and at the same time marks a new commitment to the transformation of once-industrial sites to new cultural, programmatic and environmental uses from sustainability point of view. The Industrial Revolution was a period from the 18th to the 19th century where major changes in agriculture, manufacturing, mining, and transport had a profound effect on the socioeconomic and cultural conditions starting in the United Kingdom. Take London for example, in the pre-war period, 1934-1938, expanding industry was mainly concentrated in Greater London: nearly half the total number of new factories, employing 25% or more opened in the country were in the Greater London Region, especially in East London. However, through the change of economy, the most of industrial areas become the underuse space. How to redevelop old industrial area is the main issue of London. Therefore, the study case of this project is Lower Lea Valley, the deprived industrial area, in east London. Today, it has the opportunity to redevelop by 2012 Olympic Game.

(mentor); Xiao, Y. (mentor)","2010","Vanadium is an important industrial metal that is mostly used as an alloying element in steel and to a lesser extent in titanium. It is generally produced in combination with other metals such as iron, titanium, and uranium. The typical production method begins with salt roasting of the ore or concentrate to produce a water soluble form of vanadium. Then the vanadium is leached, purified and precipitated as vanadium pentoxide. Most of the vanadium pentoxide produced is then combined with iron to create a ferrovandium alloy, via aluminothermic reduction, that is suitable for the iron and steel industry for alloying. Vanadium is also found in crude oil in a range that can vary from 10 to 1400ppm depending on the location. As the oil is processed and refined the vanadium becomes enriched. Specifically it is enriched in the fly ash of heavy fuel oil power plants. While the original concentration of vanadium in oil is very small the amount of oil extracted from the earth is very large and this makes fly ash a significant source of vanadium. The vanadium that is contained in the heavy oil fly ash can be recovered by two general methods: hydrometallurgical and pyrometallurgical. The hydrometallurgical route usually involves leaching, purification, and precipitation to produce V2O5. This V2O5 can then be used to produce ferrovanadium. The developmental pyrometallurgical route directly uses the fly ash in combination with a reductant (C, Al, or Si) and a source of iron to produce a ferrovanadium alloy. This thesis investigates one pyrometallurgical method, which uses two industrial waste products, heavy fuel oil fly ash and basic oxygen furnace dust, to produce a ferrovanadium alloy. The carbon contained within the fly ash is used as the reductant so only fluxing agents must be added to the charge. The result is a very efficient process that requires very few virgin raw materials. The results show that a ferrovanadium alloy with 15% vanadium can be produced by high temperature smelting of heavy oil fly ash and basic oxygen furnace dust. There are some impurities that remain in the metal, mainly nickel (~4%), sulfur (~5%), and carbon (~1.5%). The carbon to metal ratio had the largest effect on the final metal quality. The slag quality is also important to the final quality but more work must be done in this area. Simple water leaching tests were done on the as-received fly ash and the slag produced from smelting. The leach solution produced from the slag contained 100 times less metals than the solution produced from the as-received fly ash.","ferrovanadium; heavy fuel oil fly ash; BOF dust; recycling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Section Resource Engineering","","","",""

The MV2 is a large reclamation project at which both soft and hard sea-defenses are applied. Soft sea-defenses exhibit steep initial profiles during construction. Understanding how this sea-defense behaves under storm conditions is important to predict its stability and to optimize its construction scheme. There is little information available on the behavior of non-equilibrium profiles. Therefore the availability of the XBeach model, in combination storm data from the MV2, provides a unique possibility to obtain more insight in the morphological behavior of non-equilibrium profiles. Steep cross-shore profiles tend to be highly dynamic and are not in equilibrium. Most models which predict the behavior of sandy coasts are based on empirical relations derived from data of equilibrium profiles. Storms, however, exhibit a relatively small temporal scale, which implies that these empirical models are generally unsuitable to predict the response of a profile during storm events. With this in mind and in order to approach the objective, a thorough data analysis was done. From the data analysis the main cross-shore and longshore morphological processes were identified and a profile analysis, and mass balance of the soft structure was carried out. The information obtained from this was used to compare with the results of commonly used empirical and semi-empirical engineering tools. And also used as input for the processed-based simulation (XBeach), and for the comparison with its results. A net loss in sediment was observed from the outer contour boundaries due to longshore transport but not sediment is lots offshore from the cross-shore profile. The upper profile suffered greatly from the storm, presenting very large erosion volumes in a small-time scale. Due to the assumptions based on pre-storm equilibrium profile conditions made by the semi-empirical, their application yielded results that were difficult to compare to the results of the data analysis. In general, the approaches underestimated the response of the steep non-equilibrium profile. The 1DV simulations of the process-based model however, represented the cross-shore profile response rather well. Its comparison with the post-storm data analysis, demonstrated though that there is a need for a 2DH or 3D simulations, due to the large variability in shoreline orientation, elevation and steepness of the profile alongshore.","morphodynamics; non-equilibrium profile; coastal; Maasvlakte-2","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","CoMEM - Coastal and Marine Engineering and Management","",""

(mentor); De Vlugt, E. (mentor)","2010","The goal of this study is to quantify the recovery of spinal reflexes at the elbow after neurosurgical intervention in patients with brachial plexus injuries. So far, main focus was on the recovery of muscle force and little on sensory- and reflex system. As reflexes play an important role during normal movement, it is of interest to determine to what extend reflexes have been restored after surgery. Arm admittance (dynamic relationship between displacements in a response to forces) at endpoint level (hand) was estimated using force perturbations in two directions (horizontal) applied by a two-joint robotic manipulator. Three different task instructions were used to provoke different intrinsic and reflexive behavior, being a position task (PT), a relax task (RT) and a force task (FT) where the subject was required to minimize hand displacements, not react to the perturbations and minimize force deviations (being compliant) respectively. Ten patients with brachial plexus lesions participated in this experiment and were suffering from varying degrees of arm dysfunction. All had successful recovery for the biceps (MRC grade 3 and higher) after surgical nerve repair of the n. musculocutaneous. Estimated intrinsic and reflexive parameters were compared to those of a control group (n = 10, age and sex matched). The task instructions had great influence on the admittance, especially between the PT and RT. In all patients, reflexive activity was found corresponding to assumed muscle spindles (velocity- and position feedback) and Golgi tendon organ (force feedback) function. For the PT, the difference in parameters between patients and control subjects was largest. Overall, patients exhibit more intrinsic stiffness at the shoulder and elbow than the control subjects, an indication of co-contraction, and less reflexive feedback at the elbow. There are two possible explanations for this: 1) The intrinsic and reflexive properties did not recover to the combination as before the injury and are not cooperating correctly, and 2) The patients are relying more on intrinsic control than on reflexive control (different control strategy). Whereas the control group uses an energy efficient approach, i.e. less intrinsic and more reflex activity, the patients appear to use a more maximal activation approach resulting in co-contraction. It is possible that the exercises performed during rehabilitation which focus on muscle force do not provoke enough reflexive behavior. More research, e.g. experiments that are designed to disable co-contraction, is needed to verify if the use of co-contraction is learnt or a necessity. Conclusion: reflexes do recover after surgery to severe Brachial plexus injuries, the amount of reflex function is less or less effective than for the control group.","brachial plexus; reflexes","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2010-08-26","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","BME","",""

(mentor); Varbanescu, A.L. (mentor)","2010","Multicore systems have become an indispensable part of our everyday life. They represent a viable alternative for increasing processor performance without hitting the memory and power walls. However, the shift from traditional programming to multicore programming has a critical influence in three dimensions: the applications, the software tools, and the hardware platforms. In this thesis, we focus on the application dimension, and we investigate the performance potential of a 3D bodyscan SAR processing algorithm running on several multi-core processors. To allow for the processor variety, the solutions are based on OpenCL, a language that enables inter-platform portability for a large set of multicores. To allow for performance, we choose to mainly evaluate and optimize for NVIDIA GPUs, but also for Intel GPPs and ATI GPU. Our solutions design and implementation follow a step-by-step strategy. First, we analyse the application to determine its functionality, data characteristics, and performance requirements. Next, we design and implement a sequential reference solution, and we evaluate its performance. We use this particular solution to design a set of possible parallel solutions, which are also evaluated in terms of performance and platform utilization, using a generic prototyping platform. Further, we select the most promising parallel solution for a first portable OpenCL implementation. All platform-agnostic basic optimizations, are applied now, towards a new application, with increased performance and no decrease in portability. After these basic optimizations, we show how several platform-specific optimizations can be applied. Basically, in this step, we trade portability for performance. For this work, we specifically target NVIDIA GPUs, and we show the potential performance impact of data and memory-related optimizations on the case-study application. Finally, we gather all these steps and findings into a generic, empirical strategy that enables programmers to reason about OpenCL applications in a systematic manner, letting them decide the level of the trade-off between the application portability and performance. Our main conclusions are twofold. First, we conclude that OpenCL is a promising standard (and language) for enforcing the implementation of portable multicore applications. Second, we conclude that the bodyscan application is a good fit for running on multicore platforms, and we recommend the GPUs as the target platform for such an application. For future work, we propose to advance in two directions. First, as generic research, we propose to focus on the strategy validation and refining, as well as on a more abstract way to derive the parallel OpenCL versions. Second, on the application/technical side, we plan to focus on finding and implementing hardware-dependent optimizations of the OpenCL solution on various hardware platforms.","milticore; SAR processing; bodyscan; OpenCL; portability","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2010-12-15","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Parallel and Distributed Systems Group & Embedded Systems Group","","Embedded Systems","",""

(mentor); Hermans, W. (mentor); De Hoog, M. (mentor)","2010","‘Urban regeneration’ has been an important concept for many post industrial urban areas. There might be uncountable reasons why the places need to be regenerated with the urban complexity. Some places are simply too old and some of them are too small for the new urban demands. Sometimes the urban places are forced to be regenerated by war or terror attack. However, we can find the common motivation from all the regeneration cases, it can be summed up in ‘losing or challenging the original function’. The ultimate goal of every single urban regeneration process is ‘making better place’, and the process will be done by replacing, modifying or strengthening the original function. In this project, the urban regeneration process is started by the lost function as a city airport. The key element is ‘Emptiness’. Regeneration by emptiness is not special cases in this post modern era, for example, many industrial sites and factories moved away from urban area and the empty places have been filled with diverse new functions. However, this project has its very special aspect from its extreme size. ‘380ha space of inner-city’ was emptied in a day. Moreover, the nature of airport is giving a very different perspective to the project – it is all _at, hardly connected surrounding urban fabric, controlled by one single building, unusual topography by the runways, and etc. In short, the main concern of the project is about how the huge emptiness can be filled with new urban functions for the metropolis Berlin and the neighborhoods, at the same time, it will be considered which part of the space can be preserved for the future of Berlin.","urban regeneration","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2010-07-05","Architecture","Urbanism","","Urban regeneration","",""

In order to generate hypersonic flows in wind tunnel for aerothermodynamic testing, a shock tube type setting is generally known as one of the most commonly used methods. Similarly Hypersonic test facility at TUDelft (HTFD) is a Ludwieg tube type wind tunnel which is made of a storage tube connected to the test section through a converging diverging nozzle which expands the high pressure and temperature gas in storage tube to achieve high speed flows in test section. The tunnel is started by a fast opening piston-valve which creates a strong shock progressing in to the nozzle while an expansion wave progresses in to the storage tube. The appeal of this kind of facility to the hypersonic flow regime lies in the relatively long run times (0.1 to 0.2 seconds), large test section (30 cm) and high Reynolds numbers (order of 5 – 50e+06 m-1).But there are also some technological limitations to such facilities like supply of high temperatures and pressures for times long enough to perform a measurement, fast instrumentation and power requirements to run the tunnel, just to name a few.","","","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","","","","",""

(mentor)","2010","Construction of breakwaters is performed consecutively from core layer, filter layer, up to the armour layer. During construction, excessive damage is often encountered on core layers due to environmental conditions. The damage behaviour of core layers is similar to berm breakwater structures, where the initial profile is reshaped into a more stable S-shaped profile in response to environmental loads. In addition, when breakwaters are exposed to oblique waves, longshore transport occurs due to wave force components parallel to the structure alignment. Many researchers have studied the behaviour of profile reshaping and longshore transport on berm breakwaters. Nevertheless, very little information is available about the behaviour of core materials. Most of the studies also focused on investigating the behaviour of breakwater trunks (the straight part of breakwaters), and not much is known about the behaviour of breakwater roundheads. To investigate the behaviour of berm breakwater roundheads that consist of core materials, a physical model was performed in the Hydraulic Laboratory at Delft University of Technology. The model is exposed to two different wave loads (H_s=8 cm;10 cm); two different stones grading, which is narrow (D_n85?(D_n15=1.3)), and wide grading (D_n85?(D_n15=6)); and three different wave obliquities (0°, 30°, and 45°). In total, twelve tests were performed based on a combination of the above mentioned parameters. During the tests, the data and profile changes were measured using laser profiling, video recording, and manual measurements. The result of laser profiling is then processed using MATLAB software to obtain 3-Dimensional plots that represent the breakwater models. Based on the 3-dimensional plots, the analysis of profile reshaping and longshore transport could be performed. Several profile reshaping parameters, such as crest recession length (Rec), crest length (l_c), step length (l_s), crest height (h_c), step height (h_s), and slope below crest (?_3) were measured and then compared with the calculated values using existing design formulas. The measured values in roundheads were also compared to the measured values in trunk sections. The effect of stone grading, wave loads, and wave obliquity were also investigated. Finally, a model to calculate the longshore transport on berm breakwater roundheads is proposed.","Berm breakwater; Roundheads; Oblique waves; Longshore transport; Grading; Breakwater cores","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","CoMEM - Coastal and Marine Engineering and Management","",""

Around and in between the VINEX locations, in the space that is still not used, there are potentials for further development and especially for improving the role and position of the VINEX neighbourhoods in the region. The focus of this research is set from the point of view of the network city theory. The society is changing and with this the perception of the urban area. According to the different network theories it is now all about flows, connections and nodes. From different theories and methods about nodes and places follows that the potentials for future development is to be found near train stations, where the node and place value play and important role. A new model is developed based on a theoretical underpinning to define the potentials of public transport nodes. This model can be used as a tool for regional and urban design and is used in this project on the area in between Rotterdam and The Hague. With the model and an analysis of the region a vision for the region is made. From this vision the focus was on VINEX neighbourhoods within the region, the location of Ypenburg is selected for further research and a design to improve the position of Ypenburg in the region is made. In the end the design is tested on the model, and with the new developments the position of Ypenburg in the region has improved. Now the location is making use of the available potentials and plays a role in the region instead of just being a residential VINEX neighbourhood. The method and model can be applied in a different context as well, because of the focus on different scales this can be seen is a tool for urban design on multiple scale levels.","VINEX; regional development; urban design; node place model; Ypenburg","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2010-06-22","Architecture","Urbanism","","","",""

(mentor); Molenbroek, J.F.M. (mentor); Schrama, J. (mentor)","2010","The subject of this thesis is the design of a Float System for Poly Products BV, a specialist company that develops and produces composite products. Poly Products has acquired the rights and the design of an existing float system, the Easy Float systems Health 800. The assignment calls for the development of a Float System for the European wellness and medical markets. Float systems enable people to float on salinated water in an isolated environment as a means of therapy. The core of this therapy is to isolate a person from external stimuli. Initially called Sensory Deprivation therapy, nowadays the term R.E.S.T. (Restricted Environmental Stimuli Therapy) is used. A float system provides a light free, sound reduced chamber with a highly concentrated solution of Epsom Salt and water maintained at a constant temperature of 36oC. The idea behind R.E.S.T. is to offer people the possibility of improving aspects of their health, either physical, emotional or psychological. People use it both to relieve and to prevent stress. Float systems are mostly found in the wellness industry. There are many theories as to how R.E.S.T works but research has shown it is effective as a method to reduce stress and improve sleep patterns. Beside stress related effects, floating is also used in the treatment of skin diseases such as Psoriasis. It is well known that some skin diseases can be treated by spending time in and around the Dead Sea between Israel and Jordan, where a combination of salt water and UV light have a positive effect on the symptoms. Float systems typically consist of a cabin, containing a bath, made from glass fibre reinforced plastics and a separate water treatment system. Over the years float systems have become more elaborate with the inclusion of light and sound systems for comfort and / or therapeutical use. The exteriors have also become more sophisticated, developing from the early box shaped cabins into organic shapes with complex surfacing. An evaluation of existing float systems has shown that access to the cabin is poor in general. The surface of the bath in the Health 800 was found to be too small. The integration of a shower into the float system has a number of benefits, corrosive salt water is kept within the system and operators don’t need to install a separate shower. A big drawback of the Health 800 is that it isn’t designed to be assembled on site. It will have to be placed in one piece which won’t fit through any door. A study into the rules and regulations concerning swimming pools learned that water quality of float systems will be inspected if the surface area of the bath is bigger than 2m2. Inspection is executed by local government in The Netherlands (and most other European countries). The inspector’s main concern is public health and they have the freedom to change or add requirements per swimming pool where they deem necessary. The law also sets certain requirements for the water treatment system. The construction of a water treatment system for a float system can get very complex as these systems usually aren’t constructed to deal with highly salinated water. It was decided to leave development of the water treatment system to a specialist company. After concluding research the following main requirements were set for the new float system; Inclusion of a bigger bath than the Health 800, Use of an integrated shower, Include additional features in the form of UV and mood lighting which can also be used in therapies, The styling concept should evocate the essence of floating, The construction has to be as such that parts fit through a standardized door and the system can be assembled on site. All these requirements were integrated or resolved in the new float system design. Especially the integration of the shower turned out to be a challenge both from an engineering as an aesthetic point of view. As a result of the assembly requirement the final float system design is now also modular with a number of product configuration possibilities.","floating; stress; psoriasis; UV therapy; wellness; well-being; epsom","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design","",""

The methodology of the regional analysis carried out goes through the historical evolution of the region focusing on the processes of urbanization, industrialization and development of infrastructures. The study shows how along the defined stages, the relation between city and nature has evolved until the present situation where its boundaries are fragmented and blurred. The analysis of the different patterns of growth and its extrapolation allows to develop different possible models of growth. A closer up in the Vallès Plain area allows the definition of specific strategies aligned with the regional developed scenario.

(mentor); Bier, H.H. (mentor); Sobota, M. (mentor)","2010","In my MSc3 I have designed an adaptive facade component that uses pressure difference, created by the wind forces upon the building and the temperature difference between inside and outside, to filter carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxides from the desired oxygen and to change the temperature to a desired level. This research has been extended to the entire building, which is optimized in shape to deal with changing wind directions throughout the year to create a minimum amount of turbulence zones around the building and to set up a system for natural ventilation on the building scale. A minimum of turbulence around the building is desired to enhance walking opportunities in a city that is known as the Windy City. This is achieved by adding curvature to the entire body of the building and placing sharp edges on strategic points to maximize the influence on each wind direction. Entrance zones and walking routes around the building turn into more pedestrian friendly environments. The shape of the tower is modeled to maximize the pressure differences upon the facade to use the facade components to their full capabilities. The obtained shape minimizes the air streams downwards when hitting straight upon the facade, which increases the amount of turbulence on ground floor. (Something that is seen here in Delft at the EWI building, which constantly creates turbulence zones at walking routes.) The air entering through the facade components is distributed around the building before entering the individual functions. The outlet of air is in the middle of the building where the heated air rises up to the grand openings in the building. These two openings decrease even more the amount of air traveling to the ground floor and accelerate the air passing through them. The acceleration of air implies a decreasing in pressure and through this suction the heated air is drawn out of the atrium. With the increasing wind speed being directed linked to the decreasing in pressure, it is seen that there is only a limit to the amount of overpressure on the building to 1 when wind speeds decrease to 0, while this doesn’t go for the amount of suction, as the wind speed could increase to infinity. Another theme determining the architecture of the building is the social interaction that is obtained by the placement of functions throughout the building. The social interaction is achieved by the different groups using various functions in the building, which also functions as a transportation hub to the city. The users are varying from residents to commuters and from employees to visitors. The amount of social interaction has different gradations according to the functions placed on various heights with peaks on the first few levels and the shopping mall with food court from the 16th floor up. The interior architecture is focused on its place in the natural ventilation scheme and the different functions defined for the building. Functions are not merely linked by elevators, but mainly by the spiraling inner organization that links different floors together and allows for social interaction. The placement of each individual function is determined by its interaction to other functions, its need for daylight and its need for speed.","motion environment; wind pressure; parametric; integration; chicago; turbulence","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2010-06-24","Architecture","Architecture","","Hyperbody","",""

(mentor); Van der Helm, A.J.C. (mentor)","2010","The TikTegel, by Serious Toys, is a game computer that looks like a tablet, without keyboard, mouse or traditional screen. Players interact with the board by placing objects on it and receive auditive and visual feedback by sound and parts of the board that light up. The objective of the project is to use the tangible interactive possibilities of the TikTegel to create a new learning aid for the first two classes of primary school in the Netherlands. Education in group 1-2 is a versatile process that includes both learning specific things and general development. In the classroom teachers create an environment where children 'learn' in different ways: pupils are completely free to decide what they do, teachers take up child initiatives or activities are prescribed by the schedule or as a result of personal development of a pupil. A set of predefined targets imposed by the government, the Kerndoelen, are used in different ways to set up educational activities. Rules of a game create a structure that can lead the activity of playing in a specific (educational) direction. When knowledge and challenges are included in a, for players, meaningful way a game can create educationally valuable and internally motivating activities. A game on the TikTegel consists of multiple different interactive reactions to physical objects. It can create an adaptable structure that provides multiple interrelated educationally valuable experiences. The TikTegel can create a ‘small world’ (physical and reactive) based on the rules and logic that we want a pupil to learn at that moment. This objective includes three opportunities that combine the qualities of the TikTegel with education in group 1-2: learn about physical aspects, a structure of different behaviours that induce combined learning effects and adjustment to an individual pupil. The final design is a set of five separate games in which the weight of objects has to be used in different ways to be successful. Objects, games and difficulty levels are put together in such a way that progress requires an increased notion about the concept of weight and advancing skills for applying this knowledge throughout the games. The level of difficulty adapts to the playing pupil. New challenges are provided in small steps, giving pupils the possibility to find out something themselves. When this finding out is too slow or absent the system will provide more guidance. A working prototype with the five games was used for one week in a classroom. Observing pupils and feedback from teachers showed that the material creates an internally motivating and educationally valuable activity. Pupils learn about weight and the exploratory approach is recognised to train cognitive thinking skills. As mentioned above there are different needs towards the learning process. In the prototype teachers appreciated the exploratory character (to develop thinking skills) more than the guidance (to guarantee learning specific aspects of weight). Additional optimisation should reveal if there is a balance in which this material can foresee in both needs.","tangible interaction; children; education","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor); Breemen, E.E.J. (mentor); Schwietert, H.R. (mentor)","2010","This report describes the “Remote Monitoring to Support Health Care” project in which an application is designed to ambulatory measure the movements of the human back. The final design of the application called the Remote Monitoring Navale Application is part of the existing Remote Monitoring System of Evalan. Together with the other components of the system, the RMNA is capable of ambulatory monitoring the movements of the patient’s back and to provide feedback which can be used to support the health care by improving treatments. The initial target group of the Navale Application is patients who are rehabilitation after a Hernia Nuclei Pulposi surgery through treatment at a physiotherapist. This target group is a result of an explorative study to search for new opportunities for the RMS of Evalan in order to increase their market off-set. During this study the market, the medical field, the stakeholders and future aspects of a new application are research and analyzed. The first conclusion of the analysis showed that Evalan should focus on health problems which treatments can be monitored with relatively simple and cost effective sensors. The second conclusion showed that there are three interesting combinations of medical treatments and monitoring possibilities; Osteoarthritis, Dorsopathies and Multiple Sclerosis. Finally the choice has been made to focus on the Dorsopathies and especially on the HNP patients. The target group can, after the development, be expanded to patients with health problems which are caused by or are in any other way related to movements of the (lower) human back such as chronic lower back problems. This is a very interesting option because yearly 1,6 million people have this complaint and it costs approximately nine billion each year in the Netherlands. The design of the RMNA comprises of a tight fitting garment with six flexible stretch sensors which will be worn under the clothes and assesses the movements of the back by measuring the elongation of the skin caused by the movements. The garment is especially developed to transfer the elongation of the skin to the attached sensors while maintaining a high level of comfort. A significant and yet unexplored aspect of the design is the locations of the flexible stretch sensors. The optimal placement is researched by conducting multiple tests with a prototype and by reviewing results of a finite element analysis of strain patterns on the back while performing movements by Mattmann (2008). The results are that the location for a flexion movement is vertically in the centre at the height of the L3-L5 vertebrae, the location for a lateral movement is vertically at the side of the body at the height of the L2-L4 vertebrae and the location for a rotational movement is diagonally, off-centre and at the height of the L3-L4 vertebrae. At the end of the project the design of the RMNA is evaluated by testing the performance of the prototype. The performance is defined as the ability to classify movements correctly and to measure the deflection of the movement accurately. At the same time the RMNA as part of the RMS is tested by adding a prototype algorithm which can translate the measurements of the RMNA automatically in a classification and the deflection of the movement. The results of this test show that the RMNA scores almost perfectly without clothes (classification 100% and deflection 95%) and a little less with clothes on top (classification and deflection 73%). The simple prototype algorithm has an average accuracy of 80%. The results of the test also indicated areas for improvement which are translated into recommendation for further development. The first recommendation is to adjust the RMNA to perform better with clothes on top. The second recommendation is to optimize the RMNA so that other movements of the body are having less influence on the sensors. The third recommendation is to improve the reliability of the software on the M-doc and to increase the number of sensor inputs. The last recommendation is to enable the algorithm to make iterative loops to optimize the accuracy of the classification and the deflection of a movement.","design; remote monitoring; flexible stretch sensors; Hernia Nuclei Pulposi; lower back problems; smart textile; integrated sensors","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Integrated Product Design","","","",""

Apart from trading on a small scale, it has a limited operating history. The company originally focused on developing a micro-CHP system, but after a while, its founders decided to first develop a technically less-complicated condensing boiler: the Nano30. Because TMBC had managed to get hold of a new type of heat exchanger, it was able to develop a heater that is only half the size of the smallest appliance with similar specifications on the market today; it is therefore easier to handle and can be installed virtually anywhere. Despite this interesting value proposition, it will not be easy for TMBC to enter the European thermotechnology market. Because of economies of scale, competitors have a cost advantage over TMBC. In addition, sales of the Nano30 will be completely dependent on installers, who are not keen on trying new and unfamiliar products. In order to win their trust, TMBC should collaborate with an established heater manufacturer that is looking to extend its product line. By offering Nano30s under the wings of a partner, TMBC can quickly conquer the niche market segment of ultra compact condensing boilers, without having to build a pan-European brand, and a sales and service organization. To attract the attention of such partners, TMBC should demonstrate the technical and commercial feasibility of the Nano30, by launching it on a small scale, under its own brand, in a manageable market, such as the Netherlands. By making the internet an integral part of sales and support, TMBC will be able to offer the Nano30 at a competitive price. This report demonstrates that this strategy will lead to profitability in the second quarter of 2013, two years after the product launch. Moreover, it will provide TMBC with a firm position in the thermotechnology industry.","condensing boiler; product launch; strategy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2011-06-24","Industrial Design Engineering","Strategic Product Design","","","",""

We investigated the mechanisms of the application, their traffic characteristics and their communications structures. Through global experiments, we analyzed the different aspects of Quality of Experience (QoE) for these applications. Audio quality, video quality, interactivity level, audio/video synchronization and worst cases are studied. The measurement results help us to understand the behavior and mechanism of video conferencing, and also the QoE of different applications.","videoconferencing; survey; mechanism; QoE","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2010-07-10","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics & Computer Engineering","","Computer Engineering","",""

(mentor); Van de Voort, J. (mentor)","2010","The Amsterdam inner city with its medieval urban structure has always been a popular destination for tourists from all over the world. The canals, warehouses and the unconstrained lifestyle have become the trademark of the city. Especially this last property has become dominantly visible in the inner city structure, not only from an architectural but also from an economic point of view. Since the 60’s and 70’s the city’s sex and soft drugs policy attracted many tourists. These industries flourished and gave Amsterdam the characteristics of an ‘open air theme park’. This tendency initiated the debate about the use and image of the monumental inner city. This development forms for a large part the social context for the design of a commercial building in the centre of the Amsterdam inner city, located between the Kalverstraat and Rokin. The building should take position in this debate and make a statement about the future of the inner city. However, not only today’s social context plays a role in the development of this new building: At the end of the 19th century a hotel-restaurant designed by Pierre Cuypers embodied the grandeur and sophisticated lifestyle of Amsterdam which has partially disappeared. This ‘Hotel Polen’ was located at the exact same plot as our building location and formed a meeting point for artists, businessmen and politicians. The building consisted of a coffee shop at the Kalverstaat and a hotel and restaurant at the Rokin side, which overlooked the outfall the river Amstel. In 1977 the building was demolished because of a fire. With the project ‘1012’ the City of Amsterdam takes position in the above mentioned debate by proposing a decrease of the ordinary and an increase of the extraordinary with a representative strip through the inner city called the ‘red carpet’. This red carpet follows roughly the direction of the soon to be completed North/South line and should contain a concentration of higher end fashion and gastronomy. This building, located on the red carpet, should endorse the City’s ambitions in the form of a reinvention of the former ‘Hotel Polen’ and therefore it contains a varied and upscale mix of functions, including a hotel-restaurant. These functions are placed around a secluded public courtyard where one could escape the daily life bustle. Therewith it builds upon the typical Amsterdam courtyard tradition.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture","Architecture","","","",""

(mentor); Nicholls, R.J. (mentor)","2010","Coastal floodplains in the south of England are at high risk of tidal flooding due to extreme water levels. The breaching of coastal defences is the most dominant source of floodwater and is a spatially and temporally uncertain process. However, there is an increasing requirement for predictive breach modelling for the simulation of coastal flood inundation. The main aim of this project is to investigate how the LISFLOOD-FP models predictions of flood inundation are affected by the variation of simplified breach representations. The research focuses on how the time varying representation of inflow discharge (represented by the QVAR boundary condition type in the model) can be utilised in a range of different breach scenarios, and how in turn this affects the flood inundation characteristics for a rural floodplain at Lymington/Pennington and an urban floodplain at Old Portsmouth. An inflow model based on an offline weir discharge equation was derived and validated in a simulation of the December 1989 storm surge event at Lymington/Pennington. The different breach scenarios then utilised this proposed inflow model and systematically varied the two breach parameters of breach growth and breach initiation timing for a 1 in 200 year extreme water level condition at both study sites. Analysis of the results indicate that the rate of breach development and the timing of breach initiation has a considerable effect on the overall flood extents and the rate and pattern of inundation at both the rural and urban study sites. Furthermore, comparison of the two study sites using individual benchmark floodplain compartments and simulations with a combined rural/urban DEM showed that the presence of elevated urban features on the floodplain has a significant influence on the flood inundation characteristics. Further research is required to assess the limitations and the validity of the proposed QVAR inflow model for modelling breaching events. Also, the evaluation of the two breach parameters in a probabilistic setting is recommended to assist in managing future coastal flood risk on both rural and urban floodplains.","Floodplain; LISFLOOD-FP; Digital Elevation Model; Breach","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","CoMEM - Coastal and Marine Engineering and Management","",""

(mentor)","2010","During the construction of breakwaters contractors often encounter undesired reshaping of exposed core material. This reshaping is comparable to the deformation process of berm breakwaters in which the outer profile reshapes into a more stable s-curve. In the case of oblique waves this deformation is enhanced by a longshore transport of stones leading to even more loss of material and damage. Throughout the years few formulas were derived for both processes which describe the behaviour of berm breakwaters as well as gravel beaches reasonably well. These formulas however turned out to be inadequate when it comes to describing the behaviour of core material. In particular the influence of the wide grading of quarry run, commonly used as core material, is to a large extent unknown and generally not described in the available relations. To investigate this influence of the stone grading on both the two-dimensional deformation and longshore transport new physical model tests were carried out in the wave basin at Delft University of Technology. In total 12 tests were executed in which two different gradings, three different angles of wave attack and two different wave spectra were tested. Data collected from the tests included wave and profile measurements together with the displacements of stones, originating from two colour beams which were applied in the middle of the trunk. These data along with visual observations eventually led to a conceptual model describing stone movements in both transverse and longshore direction. Using Matlab three-dimensional profile and erosion models were generated from which the different profile parameters were determined. With respect to the distance from origin, for each test an exponential relation was derived to describe the stone displacements. After determination of the area of uniform transport these exponential relations were used to calculate the total longshore transport by means of extrapolation and multiple integrations. Subsequently all parameters found were compared to the formulas currently available for both processes. Regarding the deformation parameters the test results produced the best fit with the formulas derived in [MERLI 2009]. Still on several occasions a deviant relation was found concerning the influence of wave obliquity. In addition, the formulas became less accurate for the narrow grading used in the tests, which fell outside the range tested by Merli. However, for the crest height of the deformed profile test results deviated completely from the available formula as no influence was found whatsoever for all tested parameters. Here the deviation was contributed to a higher instability of the part above the initial deformation, partly due to the steepness of the slope. On the subject of the longshore transport clear trends were found describing the influence of the varying parameters. Both a higher wave load and wider grading lead to an increase of the longshore transport. For the wider grading, however, this increase gave a rather distorted image, as not all fractions in the mixture were transported evenly. Due to segregation the coarsest fractions were mostly transported in the transverse direction while the finer fractions were transported further away in the longitudinal direction. Alternatively, computation of the longshore volume transport proved to be more representative. Regarding the effect of wave obliquity an increase in angle of wave attack of 30 to 45 degrees was accompanied by a decrease in longshore transport; though this decrease was less than already available formulas indicated. However despite the fact that it describes a completely different trend concerning this particular influence, the best fit was found after multiplying the relation derived by [ALIKHANI 1996] with a factor 100.","grading; breakwater; core; reshaping; two-dimensional deformation; longshore transport; stone displacement; physical model test; wave obliquity","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2010","The aim of this research is to find an answer on the question of how we should deal with situations where there has been a very large expansion -which results in a shifting gravity point- and we have to search for densification opportunities within existing urban areas. In these situations the new basis of the housing area at the edge of the city can be used to add new facilities within the city and make new development more successful, mainly in the in-between area. To sustain a certain amount of facilities, an area needs a sufficient amount of people within the proximity (Montgomery, 1998) and the new expansion can provide this. The dependency of the housing expansions on the existing city for their daily needs (Hereijgers and Velzen, 2001) will probably result into an increasing amount of traffic flows. This means that the in between area can benefit from its new position within the city and use it as a potential. Therefore, the main research question of this thesis is: how can we implement new housing oriented developments within the area in between a large housing expansion and the urban core in growing Dutch cities, by dealing with a shifting gravity point and making use of the support provided by the housing expansion at the edge of the city? The major challenge of this research is to reveal the development potential of areas that find themselves in comparable situations as described above, find out which developments will fit into these urban structures and how these developments should be implemented. The cities of Amsterdam, Den Haag, Utrecht and Amersfoort will provide interesting study cases for these analyses, as they are realizing four of largest expansions in The Netherlands (Boeijenga and Mensink, 2008).","Post-Vinex; densification; urbanization; axis development; Utrecht; Leidsche Rijn","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2010-06-25","Architecture","Urbanism","","Complex Cities","",""

(mentor)","2010","Knowledge of the complex subsurface is becoming increasingly important: for hydrocarbon exploration, possible storage of CO2, and the production of water for geothermal heating and energy production purposes. An example of a complex reservoir is a reservoir formed by alluvial fan sediments. Although research into alluvial fan deposits has been conducted, the geometry and sedimentary environment of alluvial fan deposits is still not completely understood at this time. 3D modelling of these sediments will contribute to the knowledge of alluvial fan reservoirs and give predictions of inter-well connectivity, hence improving production. To gain a better understanding in the reservoir architecture of alluvial fan deposits, an outcrop study in the Sis-palaeovalley, in the Tremp-Graus Basin in the Southern Pyrenees was conducted. An outcrop wall with a studied height of approximately 220 meters, in an area with a length of 1200 m and a width of 950 m, is investigated and mapped by using lithostratigraphic logs, photo panels and correlation observations. By analysing the gained data, a 3D reservoir architecture computer model is built giving a representation of an alluvial fan reservoir. Four lithofacies are encountered in the field: the conglomerate-, sandstone-, siltstone-, and limestone lithofacies. In the lower part of the outcrop the stacking of the sediment layers is farther apart compared to the upper part of the outcrop. This stacking pattern can be explained by a combination of climatic and tectonic events because of their mutual influence on the accommodation space, relative base level, and sediment supply. The built model gives insight in the alluvial fan outcrop and can form an analogue for alluvial fan reservoirs. With the improved knowledge and understanding of the reservoir architecture of alluvial fan deposits an increased production of water or hydrocarbons from alluvial fan reservoirs can be achieved, with a more sustainable well planning.","reservoir architecture modelling; alluvial fan","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geotechnology","","Section Applied Geology","",""

(mentor); Mekel, M. (mentor)","2010","The advanced technology of today has reduced the need of testing medical equipment on human patients. The invention of the lung simulator has made it possible to test ventilators without putting the condition of test patients in jeopardy. The device also allows medical staff to be trained in a safe and more rapid way. Several types of lung simulators are available. The digitally controlled variant is the most versatile one for simulations. This type has easily adjustable static and dynamic properties, which, in contrary to traditional passive mechanical simulators, make it possible to simulate different types of breathing. The available design of a digitally controlled lung simulator, however, has one major drawback. The system uses a motor-ball screw assembly to drive a piston in the air compartment. One of the properties of this assembly is that the motor shaft motion is negligibly affected (not ‘backdrivable’) by air pressure exerted on the piston by an external source. The result of this is a feedback system that needs to realize the entire dynamic response to pressure changes, by active control of the motor. Because of this, the system can easily become unstable for certain settings of the static and dynamic properties. The objective of this thesis is to determine what the best alternative actuator is for the lung simulator, to the end of making it more stable than the current version. By improving the existing lung simulator and improving its range of operation, and its performance, it can be made more effective and accurate, which will result in better healthcare. To reach this goal, firstly the desired requirements for the lung simulator will be obtained from the end user. After this, a literature study about alternative actuators shall be conducted. With the results of the literature study, a ranking of the alternative actuators are determined. From the literature study eight alternative actuators have come up. These are the moving coil actuator, moving iron actuator, permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM), ironless core motor, piezoelectric actuator, pneumatic actuator, hydraulic actuator and wax motor. The most important requirements on which the different actuators are evaluated are backdrivability, force linearity, force, precision, speed and stroke length. Of the eight alternative actuators, except for the PMSM and the ironless core actuator, all the others have an insufficient score on one or more of the requirements. A comparison of the PMSM and the ironless core actuator shows that the backdrivability of the ironless core actuator is better, and that it has the best overall score. The conclusion is that the ironless core actuator is the most suitable alternative for the lung simulator. The use of the actuator should increase the stability of the lung simulator. However, no testing was possible because of malfunctioning hardware and time shortage. Therefore no practical confirmation could be obtained about the effects of the new actuator on the system. It is recommended to put the top-ranked actuators to the test in a prototype. From the test results it will be possible to confirm whether the instability of the original lung simulator was indeed caused by the actuator, and whether the ironless core motor is indeed the best suitable alternative actuator for the lung simulator.","Respiratory; Simulator; Lung","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","2010-10-07","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Delft Center for Systems and Control","","","",""

(mentor); Scholten, V. (mentor); Cunningham, S. (mentor); Van Ogtrop, F. (mentor)","2010","This research has been performed with the organisation of NedTrain. NedTrain is an organisation which is responsible for the maintenance on the rolling stock of the Dutch railway system. In 2006 they have implemented project portfolio management in their organisation however they struggle to manage it properly. For that reason they want to assess and improve their project portfolio management. This can be realized by using maturity models which is an instrument to criticise the project portfolio management of an organisation. The objective of this research is to compare project portfolio management maturity models to the scientific literature. It will link the aspects described in maturity models with the topics described in the scientific literature to identify the theoretical gap, to identify the practical use of the maturity models and to provide improvement measures for NedTrain’s project portfolio management. Eventually the goal is to develop a framework which can criticise all the aspects of project portfolio management for an organisation. Based on the objective the following research question is formulated: “How useful are maturity models to diagnose and give recommendations on the project portfolio management of an organisation?” The question will be answered using the case study research approach. The first step in this research is performing a literature review on project portfolio management. The focus of this review is on project portfolio management in general, the bottlenecks most organisations encounter and the best practices of project portfolio management. According to the literature, organisations encounter problems in several areas of project portfolio management. The most important problem areas are project management activities, information management and resource management. These problem areas will be used in the comparison between the literature and the maturity models. The second step in this research is selecting a maturity model which can assist in defining, measuring and improving NedTrain’s project portfolio management. In this study several maturity models are tested on their suitability using selection criteria. Based on the criteria the model that is most suitable for this study is the Portfolio, Programme and Project Management Maturity Model (P3M3). The P3M3 model consists of several process perspectives including: management control, risk management, resource management, etc. The process perspectives are compared to the problem areas described in the literature, to enrich the P3M3 model and ensure it covers all the topics of project portfolio management. The comparison revealed that ‘project management activities’ and ‘information management’ are not described in the P3M3 model but are relevant according to the literature. This identifies there are gaps in the P3M3 model and so the topics are added to the model. Eventually a modified and improved P3M3 model is used to determine the maturity of NedTrain’s project portfolio management and to provide improvement measures. The next step in this research is the use of the modified P3M3 model to determine the current situation of NedTrain’s project portfolio management. The assessment is performed by several experienced employees of NedTrain including the project portfolio manager and the manager of fleet services. The different perspectives on the answers were discussed with the involved employees to deliberate on the final outcome and to generate practical recommendations. Eventually the assessment illustrates that benefits management, risk management and resource management are the most underdeveloped process perspectives in NedTrain’s project portfolio management. These underdeveloped process perspectives are reviewed against the literature. This indicates that portfolio resource management is to some extent already acknowledged in the scientific literature, but research on portfolio benefits management and risk management is not yet performed, since the review on these topics had no result. Therefore it is recommended that both topics will be reviewed in further researches. In this study several recommendations are given on the underdeveloped process perspectives. The most important recommendations on NedTrain’s project portfolio management are: - Start at the top and make sure the senior management supports project portfolio management; - The base of project portfolio management is a well defined project management process, make sure project management is mature enough. The specific recommendations on the three underdeveloped processes in NedTrain’s project portfolio management are for NedTrain’s benefits management: - Create a framework to centrally manage and track the delivery of portfolio benefits. This framework should have explicit statements on how benefits enabled by initiatives actually contribute to business value and strategic objectives. For NedTrain’s risk management: - Make sure the risk analysis will not only be conducted in the early stage of a project but also further in the project, it should become a constant management process. And for NedTrain’s resource management: - There should become policies and processes describing how portfolio resources are acquired, managed and deployed. Based on the results obtained from the assessment it can be concluded that the modified P3M3 model provides an impressive list of bottlenecks and improvement measures for the organisation. Although further research needs to be performed on the modified P3M3 model, it will be very useful tool for organisations to provide a first impression on the maturity of their project portfolio management.","project portfolio management; maturity","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2010-06-22","Technology, Policy and Management","Technology, Strategy and Entrepreneurship","","","",""

The graduation project for Philips and TU Delft consisted of two parts. A literature study showed that very little information is available on people’s preferences regarding dynamic lighting. Therefore an extensive user study was carried out in the first part of the project, to find out what the specific requirements are that people have with regard to dynamic lighting settings. The goal was to find out what needs and wishes people have concerning dynamics in light atmosphere creation. In two sessions of the user study the participants were shown a large quantity of dynamic lighting settings in a living room environment and were asked to judge these settings on preference and naturalness. The quantitative analysis of the data gathered showed interesting trends in preference regarding the different dynamic settings. Interviews were held with the participants after each setting and these provided information for a qualitative analysis. Colour and speed are concluded to be the most important parameters that people want to change when it comes to dynamic settings. Also, the more a dynamic setting resembles a natural setting, the more it is preferred. The correlation between preference and naturalness is high (r=0.645). The results and conclusions of the quantitative and qualitative analyses were used in the second part of the project. The goal of this second part was to develop an interaction concept for the creation and control of dynamics in light atmospheres. The most important focus point was the usability; to make sure that people are able to interact with the concept in an easy and intuitive way. A partially functioning digital prototype was created which was used in evaluation sessions. From the evaluation sessions can be concluded that the proposed concept is generally appreciated. Recommendations are however given to further improve the concept. The relevance of this thesis lies in both parts of the project. The user study provides important insights in an area which is still largely uncovered. It functions as a fundament in the analysis of the perception of dynamic lighting. The concept functions as a showcase of what can be done with knowledge on dynamic lighting. Because the concept is generally appreciated it can function as a starting point for the development of interaction concepts for the creation and control of dynamic lighting settings at home.","dynamic lighting; atmospheres; interaction concept; coloured light","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2011-06-22","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor)","2010","The graduation project is called “City, catch the time! Rediscovering socialist neighbourhoods in a new capitalist society”. The study case is Vilnius, capital of Lithuania. Focus of the project is socialist housing estates, known as microdistricts. In the beginning of the year I have stated that those housing estates constructed until 1990s in all cities of the former USSR are declined, unattractive, and unsafe. However after analysis of the study case city Vilnius I have found that the city has more problems than the housing estates. There is a big threat of sprawl, and all developments go away from sustainability. While housing estates are popular among citizens, have public transportation, green space, room for development. Although still have a threat of decline and stigmatization. Considering threats of the city and advantages of housing estates I have developed vision for the city: instead of mono centric sprawling city it has to become a polycentric city with network of centralities, connected by public transportation. A huge socialist housing area in the north of the city supposed to become one of the centralities. Now the site is in a complete city periphery, big sleeping district with 150 000 residents. Strategy goal was to change that periphery into a centrality. According to study of modernist city was defined rules how it could be changed into a compact and diverse city. This part of the project is named concept rules for the strategy. Applying these rules, transport oriented development principles and advantages of the site was designed strategy how revitalize housing estates area and create a lively centrality. The strategy is divided into phases and projects like: developing three main axes with public transportation and creating an urban centre in between them. The centre is connected with the microdistricts. This connection is a tool to revitalize housing estates by changing their public space system and adding functions on the nodes. The strategy also defines links from microdistricts to the surrounding landscapes. In the design part was elaborated one of the routes linking housing areas and the centre. The route project has main intervention areas: the centre – conversion of shopping malls into urban blocks, pedestrian shopping street, station area and urban square; in Fabijoniskes microdistrict – forming urban street, designing new houses along the route, moving public and commercial functions to the route, designing urban square and park avenue; in Pasilaiciai microdistrict is formed route with a cultural and sports program, is designed community square and leisure and entertainment park. The approach of the project is to have less open space, but high quality and make space for new low rise housing. The effect of the interventions is - lively integrated housing areas, created centrality and a polycentric city.","Post war housing; regeneration; post socialist city; large scale housing estates; strategy; network","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture","Urbanism","","Complex Cities studio","",""

(mentor); Gielen, M.A. (mentor); De Voogd-Claessen, H. (mentor)","2010","Study shows that children like to play active, but are playing more and more physically inactive (by means of computer and television). Creazi, the company in this assignment, aims to change this and wants to have a product for children that is fun to play with, and also helps to achieve a healthy lifestyle. From earlier design they had a vehicle for adults, which might interest children as well. The Banjy a vehicle that is driven by the movement like made on an elliptical trainer. This was the starting point for this graduation project. Four identical (red) test models of the Banjy were provided to test and adjusted later in the project. In order to find out what children’s preferences are and whether they like to play with the Banjy, an interaction research was started. In this research several smaller studies were performed. First of all children playing with the Banjy’s, which were provided at a playground, were observed and interviewed. Then some families got a Banjy for two weeks and were interviewed afterwards about it. Thirdly, children of five classes at primary schools were asked to design a vehicle based on the movement made on an elliptical trainer. A Banjy-hyves was made to keep in contact with the children and discuss with them. Finally, literature was consulted to support all gathered information. The main result of this research was that children do like to play with the Banjy, because they like the movement with both arms and legs. Also the way of steering is liked. The main negative aspect of the Banjy was the size. It made the vehicle difficult to store at home. Based on the results some decisions about the new design were made. It would be a children’s toy vehicle, targeting at children in the age between 8-12 years. Because the vehicle is for private use, the Banjy needs to be small, so a total redesign for a smaller version is needed. During the idea generation some interesting options were found, that remarkably all used the movement of an elliptical trainer. These ideas lead to four promising concepts. From these concepts the Banjy STUNT was chosen as the basis for further design, with the remark that options for playing together needed to be optimised. The Banjy STUNT is totally different from the previous test models, both in form and in function. The Banjy STUNT has the levers bend backwards, has the ability to drive in two directions, and has a higher learning curve which challenges children for a longer time span. Children have a lot of options on how to use the Banjy Stunt. They can stand and drive forward, even with someone sitting in the front and they can stand or sit to ride backwards. Because of the large differences with the red model, the size of the Banjy STUNT and placing of the pivot points were optimised first. Two (blue) adjustable test models were made to test the most optimal levels for the ergonomics. Next to the pivot points the steering mechanism, form of pedals and form of the levers were optimised. These blue models were tested by children, also to check how they experienced the new vehicle. Most striking was the design of the form of the levers. The form and motion of the lever influence the posture and the movement of the user. The posture and motion are very important factors of riding convenience. The children all had their own preferences as a result of their length differences. In order to offer all children in the age-group of 8 to 12 years old the possibility to find a pleasant posture, the levers will be made adjustable. The information gathered form the test was used to improve the size, form and placing of pivot points for the final model. Also the name Banjy STUNT was changed to Banjy Play, because children did not manage to stunt with the vehicle within a short time. With having the ergonomics right, the design for the Banjy Play was completed. However some details are recommended to be improved, to make the design safer and stronger, before production. To conclude, this graduation project has resulted in a redesign of the Banjy, the Banjy Play; a vehicle that is demonstrated to attract children and their parents, in form, in playing abilities and in storage options.","children; toy vehicle; play","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design and Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor); Lukosch, S.G. (mentor); Overbeek, S.J. (mentor); Lee, C. (mentor); De Vreede, G.J. (mentor)","2010","To solve complex problems brainstorming with a Group Support System can be a helpful tool. Social comparison and association effects are factors that stimulate the generation of creative and high quality ideas or concepts. Also, the GSS’ capabilities that allow a group to work in parallel contributes to the swiftness with which a fast growing set of ideas is generated. Groups of 10 to 15 are able to produce 100 to 150 ideas in as little as 15 minutes. The set of generated ideas however also has some limitations. Typically the set of ideas is characterized by redundancy, ambiguity, off-topic ideas and a lack of shared understanding. Extracting the key ideas from such a large set of ideas is time consuming and easily cause the facilitator and participants to suffer from cognitive overload. Extracting the key ideas is a process in which the group uses a combination of selecting and summarizing ideas and uses clarification techniques to create shared understanding. To address these challenges, groups and facilitators can benefit from methods and techniques to effectively extract the key ideas from the brainstormed list of ideas, without losing any promising ideas. Such techniques and methods are typically referred to as convergence methods. In interviews with professional facilitators we indeed found that they considered convergence to be difficult and time consuming. Also a large body of literature, mainly GSS case studies, was found that describes hurdles to convergence. These hurdles include (1) information overload at the beginning of a convergence task and (2) the cognitive effort required to complete a convergence task. Therefore the main research question of this thesis is: ‘how can convergence processes become more successful and effective?’. Based on an analysis of the current set of methods for convergence we identified four opportunities to improve the successfulness and effectiveness of a convergence process. The methods included in this study originate from the ThinkLet library, the method database of the International Association of Facilitators (IAF) and from a literature review. The identified opportunities are:  Removing the task of detecting redundant concepts away from the facilitator to lower his/her workload.  Improving the current hurdles that exist when converging in a parallel way, as is done is the FocusBuilder thinkLet among others. The current limitations of this thinkLet include: o Lack of comprehensiveness of the end result o Inability for the facilitator to monitor the process  Creating a scalable and fast pre-selection method.  Improving support for inexperienced facilitators to manage a convergence process in a large group. Classifying and comparing the methods found was possible by using a classification scheme based on two axes, (1) the output of a method and (2) the way of working implied by a method. By using the example of a creative problem solving workshop, in which we tried to find a match between a method for convergence and a convergence task for different scenarios, we have identified the opportunities for improvement. The differences in the scenarios were in the number of participants and facilitator skill level. In response to these opportunities we have designed three artefacts. One new thinkLet, Divide&Conquer, is developed that enables large groups to quickly make a pre selection of concepts. Secondly we designed a modifier to the FocusBuilder thinkLet. This thinkLet supports the creation of shared understanding, achieves a reduction of the concepts under consideration and removes redundant concepts from a brainstorm artefact in a scalable and fast way. Thirdly a technique for similarity detection, normally used for plagiarism detection and automatic grading of written texts, is adapted and evaluated for use to detect redundant concepts in a brainstorm or convergence artefact. The technique uses normalized vector representations of concepts based on a thesaurus to detect similar concepts. To assess the effectiveness and success of the designed artefacts the following process and result oriented metrics are used; process oriented: acceptance, satisfaction, facilitator dependence, scalability, commitment, productivity and efficiency. Result oriented: speed, redundancy, reduction, refinement, comprehensiveness, shared understanding (ambiguity), satisfaction and commitment. Evaluation in groups of the technique for similarity detection, the new Divide&Conquer thinkLet and the modified FocusBuilder thinkLet revealed that:  Even with a moderate detection rate of 50% participants are able to remove redundant concepts faster than participants that did not use the artefact in which concepts were ordered according to the automatic detected redundancies. Evaluation however is limited to one case study. Further evaluation is needed to validate the results and research the use of similarity detection within the new and other thinkLets.  The Divide&Conquer thinkLet can be used within groups to quickly make a pre-selection of concepts that the group deems worthy of paying further attention to. The process and results of the thinkLet were accepted by the participants of two workshops, however the process needs thorough explanation before the start to reach agreement on the process. The thinkLet achieves a pre-selection quicker than other pre-selection methods because in principal less votes than the number of participants are collected per concept. Based on the average value and standard deviation it is decided whether more votes per concept are needed. This increases speed and therefore scalability of the pre-selection process. The pre-selections made in the evaluation workshops with this thinkLet contained only on-topic items and reduced the original brainstorm artefact by 50% on average with a standard deviation of 10%. Besides explaining the process and presenting the results no facilitator efforts are required.  The modified FocusBuilder thinkLet can be used on a brainstorm artefact directly or after a pre selection has been made. The thinkLet fosters the creation of shared understanding and achieves a (further) reduction in the number of concepts under consideration by removing and summarizing redundant concepts and removing off-topic concepts. The thinkLet uses sub groups of participants that work on sub sets of concepts in parallel and convergence is achieved in three or four rounds. In previous case studies the comprehensiveness of the end result was too low. We removed the first round from the thinkLet, in which the participants work alone, to limit participant bias. Evaluation revealed that the comprehensiveness of the end result increased, without changing any other values that already were positive. Because of the parallel way of working the thinkLet is fast and scalable. Facilitator interventions are needed to explain the process and to present the end result, the real convergence effort is executed by the participants, therefore facilitator dependence of this thinkLet is low. The inability for the facilitator to monitor the process also is an opportunity for improvement of this thinkLet. A design for this is described, but is not evaluated. The outcome of this project is relevant for every professional interested in efficient collaboration within his project team, business unit or organisation. But also for practitioners, facilitators and collaboration engineers, because it proposes solutions for the time consuming step of convergence in GSS supported meetings. Further effort is however needed to evaluate the performance of the two thinkLets within more workshops, but the results indicate that the field of evaluation can be extended to organizations and professionals. Further research is needed to improve the accuracy of detection of redundant concepts and to integrate the detection technique within the two thinkLets mentioned.","GSS; ThinkLets; Convergence; Collaboration; Normalized Word Vectors; Similarity detection","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Systems Engineering - Multi Actor Systems","","Systems Engineering, Policy Analysis & Management","",""

In deze thesis wordt onderzocht welke van de meestgebruikte implementaties van low-power draadloze protocollen het beste geschikt is voor de draadloze communicatie in een home automationsysteem. De implementaties die met elkaar worden vergeleken zijn Bluetooth, ZigBee en Z-Wave. Dit is van belang voor het bedrijf Domatic die aan de hand van deze thesis een keuze gaat maken voor een low-power draadloze implementatie. Allereerst baseren wij ons op een literatuurstudie naar de relevante eigenschappen voor een dergelijk systeem. Hieruit blijkt dat Bluetooth het snelste informatie kan overzenden, het bereik van Bluetooth en ZigBee het beste is en dat ZigBee het meest energiezuinig is. Vervolgens zijn metingen verricht om de prestaties van de implementaties in de praktijk met elkaar te kunnen vergelijken. Hieruit blijkt dat het bereik en de stabiliteit van ZigBee het beste is en dat de sneheid van Bluetooth het beste is. Het is niet mogelijk gebleken om metingen uit te voeren voor Z-Wave. Vervolgens worden de resultaten van deze metingen geïnterpreteerd en op basis van de literatuurstudie en deze interpretatie een keuze gemaakt voor welke implementatie het beste geschikt is. Bluetooth blijkt vooral goed te presteren op korte afstanden en met weinig obstakels tussen zender en ontvanger. Zodra er een betonmuur of een verdieping tussen zit, wordt het onmogelijk een verbinding op te zetten. De doorvoersnelheid van data is hoog, maar dit gaat ten koste van bereik en energieverbruik. Aangezien bij een home automation-netwerk met name stabiliteit, een groot bereik en laag energieverbruik van belang zijn, is Bluetooth hier niet goed voor geschikt. ZigBee heeft veel van de nadelen van Bluetooth niet. Het kan goed omgaan met obstakels tussen zender en ontvanger en kan makkelijk verbindingen opzetten als de zender en ontvanger zich op verschillende verdiepingen bevinden. Bovendien is het bereik makkelijk uit te breiden door het toevoegen van eenheden die data kunnen doorsturen. Het heeft een vrij lage datasnelheid, maar daarmee wint het terrein op energieverbruik en is het mogelijk om meer apparaten binnen een netwerk te ondersteunen. Z-Wave is geschikt voor een home automation-systeem, maar er zitten enkele nadelen aan. Zo is de latency groot ten opzichte van ZigBee waardoor het langer duurt om opnieuw een verbinding op te zetten. Z-Wave is standaard niet beveiligd, waardoor eventueel kwaadwillende personen makkelijk toegang kunnen krijgen tot het netwerk. Het bereik van Z-Wave is ruim voldoende voor een home automation systeem en de hoeveelheid apparaten die aangesloten kunnen worden is ook ruim voldoende. Tenslotte is Z-Wave een gesloten standaard die wordt beheerd door het bedrijf Zensys. Alleen tegen betaling is inzicht mogelijk in de standaard. Dit zorgt voor hogere kosten en maakt een product dat gebruik maakt van Z-Wave afhankelijk van de keuzes van Zensys. Omdat ZigBee op alle punten beter dan of gelijkwaardig presteert aan Z-Wave, is ZigBee de beste keuze voor een home automation-systeem. Bluetooth presteert niet goed genoeg om in aanmerking te komen voor gebruik in een dergelijk systeem. Domatic kan dus ook het beste voor ZigBee kiezen.","home automation; zigbee; bluetooth; z-wave; draadloze protocollen","nl","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Circuits and Systems","","","",""

An analysis of the problems to use formulas derived from wind tunnel experiments in the modeling of transport on the field is carried out. It is followed by the derivation of a model describing the relation between the transport measured with saltiphones and the wind speed for specific conditions. However, no relation is derived between the transport measured with saltiphones and volumes transported and an extrapolation of the model to the whole beach remains incomplete.

The type and composition of the drilling fluids, and drilling techniques, helps the reader to identify the basic concepts of drilling muds (fluids), and their environmental impacts.

The introduction to modern techniques for exploration, innovation of new high performance environmental friendly drilling fluids, will increase the vision of the reader towards the best available techniques. The liquid and cuttings reinjection in the subsurface (into deep geological formations), in the form of slurry, is the new technique and is normally used, to meet the environmental regulations at many offshore and onsite exploration sites, to preserve the other usable resources, like water and avoid the spreading of contamination in the subsurface. For this, the geotechnical requirements, and the injection techniques are discussed in this thesis, so that the goal for sustainable environment may be approached by environmental friendly drilling waste disposal practices.

A recent run for licences has sparked questions on the optimisation and recovery of geothermal energy from the subsurface of the Netherlands through optimal project placement. The effect of heterogeneities on interference of geothermal projects in the West Netherlands Basin and the target Early Cretaceous Delft Sandstone Member has not been sufficiently studied. The objectives of this study are: (1) to gain a better understanding of the geological setting, the depositional setting and the heterogeneities of the primary target Delft Sandstone Member; (2) to show the effect of heterogeneities in the subsurface on interaction and interference of flow on closely placed geothermal systems; and (3) to build a subsurface dynamic reservoir model with which optimal well performance and placement can be assessed. The basin evolution, depositional setting and depositional processes of the Delft Sandstone Member are determined by combining the available data. The seismic, well, core and cutting data are combined to build a static 3D reservoir architectural model of the Delft subsurface. The static model is incorporated with the flow characteristics from petrophysical log data and used for temperature and fluid flow behaviour simulations. By modelling flow and temperature behaviour, the flow rates and production temperatures of a single geothermal system and the interference of the different geothermal systems were determined and quantified. This study gives new insights and a better understanding of the reservoir architecture of the Delft Sandstone Member. The Vrijenban Syncline is the predominant structure in the Delft subsurface and the sediments of the Delft Sandstone Member are deposited by a meandering fluvial system in three different depositional settings, controlled by tectonic movement. The depositional characteristics related to subsidence and accommodation space increase can have a large impact on the reservoir behaviour of the Delft Sandstone Member. It has therefore been chosen to include this effect in the model. From the flow simulations in the Delft Sandstone Member it shows that different geothermal systems closely placed within one reservoir will have pressure interference. From this study it is concluded that multiple geothermal systems can be placed in one reservoir and sustain economic production temperature for over 30 years. Different geothermal systems in one reservoir will however communicate in the reservoir creating both positive and negative effects on flow that are large enough to respectively improve or badly affect the economics of a project. The results of this study will be a base case for further research as it will form a benchmark for future local and regional geothermal studies. Simulations of multiple well configurations to determine optimal well placement can now be performed. This will ensure and provide the foundation for a true roll out of geothermal systems through the western parts of the Netherlands.","geothermal","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-06-18","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geotechnology","","Petroleum Engineering","",""

(mentor); Tassoul, M. (mentor); Knijnenburg, D. (mentor)","2010","In today’s society sustainability has become a widely accepted and hot topic. Companies attempt to attract customers by projecting their ‘green image’ with the aim of strengthening their position in their respective industries. In the event business, organizers are becoming increasingly aware of the importance of minimizing the emissions due to transportation, energy usage and waste production. Even with this increase in awareness, Sustainability mainly remains a behind-the-curtain activity. Current approaches, such as recycling or green energy consumption, loose momentum do to their lack of interaction with the public. The greatest obstacles faced when attempting to implement any sustainable approach is the public. Because the public always tends to choose the easiest, fastest and least expensive way. This problem must be tackled by any sustainable alternative wishing to make an impact. This project puts forward an innovative sustainable approach to reduce an event’s ecological footprint, in which the public will be won over by showing them that you do not have to stop having a good time to make a difference. The basic principle behind the developed concept is to reduce an event’s ecological footprint by serving drinks in a personalized re-usable plastic cup, ‘Your Cup’. In addition to the environmental advantages of using reusable instead of disposable cups, Your Cup will introduce new crowd pleasing features to an event. It will enable users to tap & pay for drinks by themselves, reducing the current undesired drinking queues. The RFID chip installed into Your Cup will make it possible to track and trace Your Cup users during the event. By scanning Your Cup at one of the touchscreen supported ‘interaction points’, users are able to choose from a range of fun and informative applications, from ‘your friend finder’ to ‘your drinking statistics’. All applications are designed to improve the user’s event experience and stimulate interaction amongst users. Due to the great variety of possibilities Your Cup entails, not only an improvement of an event’s ecological footprint, but an enrichment of an user’s point- and post- event experience as well arises.","sustainability; your cup","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2011-06-18","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","SPD","",""

The result of this project comes in the form of a pattern book, which can be used by designers and other actors such as housing corporations and local residents, when dealing with these issues. The researched context is that of late post-war neighbourhoods, and the neighbourhood Zevenkamp in the city of Rotterdam is used as a case for study and design. Since the project is concerned with the relation between social use and physical properties, and strives to take an eye-level perspective to sustainability, a lot of emphasis is placed on incorporating the perspectives of local residents, with a particular focus on youths and elderly persons living in the neighbourhood. About sixty intervention patterns are developed, at different levels of scale, concerning built-up area, program, and particularly public space. Patterns deal mostly with two social sustainability aspects that were deemed most relevant within the specific context of late post-war neighbourhoods. These are firstly social safety, since aspects related to this appear to be the greatest threat to the future value of these neighbourhoods. Secondly, possibilities for social interaction, since this is the most important (potential) quality of these neighbourhoods. Preconditions for these two aspects are also strongly correlated. Urban design proposals are made for three crucial neighbourhood parts, namely an individual building block, the main traffic structure, and the central axis consisting of the neighbourhood centre and park areas, to test if and how these patterns can be translated into a coherent design.","social sustainability; late post-war neighbourhoods; Zevenkamp","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2010-06-18","Architecture","Urbanism","","","",""

(mentor); Dijksman, B. (mentor)","2010","With the continued growth of world population comes the need for more energy resources to quench the thirst of the energy insatiable world we live in. Geothermal energy is green and is a sustainable way of providing our energy needs. Formation water at depths greater than 3,000m in the Netherlands is a potential source of energy to generate electricity. Over the study area observed formations are buried deep enough to reach water temperatures in excess of 1000C, and this could conceivably be used for the generation of electricity with very low CO2 emissions. Four seismic surveys L3NAM1985P (146.6km2), L3NAM1991A (414.5km2), Z3NAM1990D (762.2km2) and Z3AMC1989A (544.6km2) were interpreted and integrated with well data including well tops to help in this evaluation. The Detfurth and Volpriehausen (Triassic) of the West Netherlands Basin in the Zuid Holland area are established to be potentially good reservoirs for geothermal development. This is due to the fact that stratigraphically, they are the deepest sandstones and consequently most likely to reach sufficient depths. These objectives are too deep to be visible and adequately interpretable on seismic due to the low impedance contrast and because it is overlain by the strong reflectors of the evaporates of the Upper Germanic Triassic. Therefore, surfaces for these objectives were generated based on formation markers in the wells that intersected the Triassic using 3D gridding in Jewel Suite. Generally, the reservoir interval from the top of the Detfurth to the base of the Volpriehausen contains enough thick sequences of porous sands. The gross thickness ranges from 95m in well VAL-01 to 163m in P15-14. Two porosity/permeability relationships have been used for calculating N/G at various permeability cut-offs of 0.1mD, 1mD, 10mD and 100mD. Net sand ranges from 0.14m to 58.04m for 10mD and 0.1mD permeability cut-offs respectively. The zone in and around Wells MON-03, P18-A-02, P15-01 and P15-14 show the best reservoir intervals based on average porosity and N/G values. Based on different scenarios the average porosity ranges from 6.5% to 16.2% and N/G ranges from 0.6% to 30.8%. Primary porosity and permeability are generally low in the mapped area, but it is expected that permeability and connectivity are enhanced locally through fracturing. The objective is highly faulted, and hence this will serve as conduit for water leading to a higher level of connectivity and water production. Heterogeneity remains an issue of concern due the high level of Vcl is some of the intervals. But it is believed that they will generally not serve as a barrier or baffle to flow, i.e. it will reduce the vertical permeability but not the important horizontal permeability. The objectives in the mapped area suggest that aeolian and fluvial facies occupy more than 50% of the rock unit. Aeolian sandstones are known for their excellent reservoir qualities. They are well sorted with good porosity and permeability. This means that a larger part of the rock unit within the mapped area is of good reservoir quality. The focus of the oil industry is on the structural highs. Prospective areas for geothermal exploitation occur in lows. The lows have no well penetrations and are usually considerably deeper than the much shallower oil fields. It is, however, suspected that structuration and formation of highs and lows is relatively late and that diagenesis predates structuration. This would imply that the shallow oil fields have porosities representative of much greater depths. This is borne out by the fact that there is hardly any relationship of porosity against depth. When this proves to be accurate it would have a very positive effect on the development of geothermal energy, since this reduces the uncertainties involved in a project like this.","Bunter; Geothermal; Reservoir","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Section Petroleum Geosciences","","Petroleum Engineering and Geosciences","",""

(mentor)","2010","This thesis presents the design of the mechanical and electrical structure of a novel interaction force sensor, in which a micro-gripper can be easily integrated. Independent force/torque detection in six degrees of freedom (DOF), a wide force range (a few mN) and a high resolution (at ?N and ?Nmm level) are obtained. Piezoresistors are used for the detection of the interaction force due to the suitable force range and resolution. The interaction force sensor is fabricated with integrated circuit (IC) compatible processes. In the micro-handling domain, micro-grippers are used for applications in micro-manipulation, life science and micro-surgery. In these fields, the micro-parts to handle have dimensions from a few ?m to hundreds of ?m. Typically, force sensing with ?N and sub-?N resolutions over a range of a few mN is needed. The lack of interaction force sensing, in current micro-grippers, limits the applications in these fields. Current external devices, able to detect the interaction force along multiple DOF, are difficult to be used in a micro-gripper due to assembly and calibration problems. Therefore there is the need for high resolution, six DOF interaction force monitoring integrated within micro-grippers. In this thesis, a mechanical and electrical study is carried out for the development of the interaction force sensor according to typical requirements in micro-handling. Three different concepts are considered, all consisting of several beams with multiple integrated piezoresistors. Parameters such as dimensions and shape of the beams as well as the piezoresistor number and connections are taken into account in the design process. The different concepts are evaluated and compared based on their resolution, sensitivity, crosstalk, stiffness, dimensions, number of piezoresistors and the accessibility of the gripper. The final design of the interaction force sensor has a dimension of 3 x 1.5 x 0.03 mm3 and it is capable of measuring six DOF independently, using 16 silicon integrated piezoresistors. Finite element models (FEM) show that resolutions between 1.5 – 8.5 ?N and 2 – 10.5 ?Nmm could be reached, for respectively force and torque measurement. Force/torques up to 30 mN and 37 mNmm can be measured. A micro-gripper fabricated by IC compatible processes can be easily integrated in the interaction force sensor. However, the heat generation of the gripper has to be taken into account, since it causes thermal expansion (and therefore stresses) in the sensor. This effect influences the performance of the interaction force sensor in terms of crosstalk and resolution. The influence on the performance due to the heat generation of a thermal micro-gripper is studied. The fabrication of the interaction force sensor is done at the Delft Institute for Microsystems and Nanoelectronics (DIMES). An experimental setup is also proposed to validate the theoretical performance of the fabricated interaction force sensor.","micro-gripper","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2010-07-14","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Precision and Microsystems Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Stive, M.J.F. (mentor)","2010","This study extends the theoretical approach developed by JUMELET [2010] to acquire a physical description of the notional permeability coefficient applied in the VAN DER MEER stability formulae [1988]. Van der Meer introduced this coefficient to ensure that the permeability of the structure is taken into account, however due to the empirical character of Van der Meer equations and because prior to Jumelet's research there was not an available physical description of the notional permeability factor, the determination of this factor was rather vague. Because of the fact that the stability relationship includes the P-coefficient, it has to be estimated somehow and, therefore, the research carried out by JUMELET [2010] is, to some extent, the starting point to achieve the required physical description of the notional permeability coefficient. To obtain this physical description, the volume-exchange model is introduced, in which the external and internal processes that take place within a breakwater are coupled. The external process is described by a wave run-up model while the internal process is described by the Forchheimer? equation for the water flow through a porous medium. According to JUMELET [2010], the notional permeability parameter P is highly related to the run-up reduction coefficient from the volume-exchange model, and thus Jumelet defines an expression for this coefficient by means of coupling the notional permeability factor with the volume-exchange model. Because of the simplicity of the notional permeability coefficient formula developed by JUMELET [2010], further research is required to analyze the actual correlation between the notional permeability factor and the so-called run-up reduction coefficient (obtained from the volume-exchange model). This study focuses on developing a general formula for the notional permeability coefficient based on JUMELET [2010] and analyzing the real influence of the hydraulic parameters and structural properties on the P-factor. As stated by JUMELET [2010], the permeability of the structure depends not only on the structural properties but also on the hydraulic parameters. In this way, a physical description of the notional permeability coefficient is given and can be applied in Van der Meer stability equations to design breakwaters. Moreover, a damage level analysis has been performed to compare the observed damage by VAN DER MEER [1988] with the estimated damage through the combined method of Jumelet's model, the generalized formula for the notional permeability coefficient and Van der Meer stability equations, which leads to introducing the combined method as a tool to determine the maintenance policies in breakwaters by taking into account the damage that waves causes on them.","Breakwater; Stability relations; Notional permeability coefficient; Damage; Porosity; Volume-exchange model; Run-up reduction coefficient","en","student report","","","","","","","","2010-06-21","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","CoMEM - Coastal and Marine Engineering and Management","",""

(mentor)","2010","On a national level need has arisen for Turkey to realise a new large capacity gateway port. At the Black Sea coast in the province Zonguldak a flat area is available at the delta of the regional river Filyos. According to a previous feasibility study this location is considered optimal for the port. The extent of the captive area is promising. There is expected cargo transport demand from the metropolitan area of Ankara and of the planned local industry. Furthermore, the site conditions and possibility to connect with the hinterland are favourable at Filyos. The objective for the thesis study is to develop a port layout that offers capacity for the forecasted throughput at adequate operational conditions. To guarantee that the requirements with respect to operational conditions are met, several engineering solutions are implemented in the design. The operational conditions for merchant vessels depend to a large extent on the possibility to manoeuvre in the harbour and to load and unload at berth. These conditions are amongst others influenced by the climate of wind, waves and currents. Focus laid in this thesis study is on the wave climate in the harbour and at the berths. A well considered allocation, orientation and shape of the harbour entrance and berths is therefore essential. The other focus is laid on the dry infrastructure. Sufficient space for storage and through transport of cargo is required. Furthermore, advisory is needed with respect to the superstructures and the use of human resources. In order to design the port layout a thorough analysis is carried out in the thesis. The various boundary conditions for the project are analysed and reported. Amongst others, an overview is provided of socio-economic developments, hinterland connections and forecasts of throughput & vessel sizes for various scenarios. Furthermore, physical conditions are analysed, which are primarily based on obtained survey data. Where information about boundary conditions lacked, starting points are used of which a separate overview is provided. For the main requirements of the project an overview is made, which completes the boundary condition analysis. In order to develop the layouts, minimum component dimensions are required in combination with an overview of the preferred shape, orientation and location. For this purpose different design guidelines are followed. In order to derive required dimensions in time phasing of the project is chosen. Three significantly different alternatives are considered in the project including phasing for the medium term (until 2020) and long term (until 2030). These layouts are evaluated on the basis of the following requirements: nautical accessibility and safety, loading and unloading ability at berth, through transport and storage ability, robustness and coast morphological impact. The best layout is selected for further refinement on basis of a qualitative Multi-Criteria Evaluation (MCE) and on an analysis of capital costs. Costs have turned out to be decisive in the selection of the best alternative. The most promising alternative of the previous step is refined with respect to the inner harbour configuration. Different terminal and berth positions and orientations are considered, resulting in two variants of the layout alternative. The layouts are given a quantitative value with the use of an MCE, which are based on model simulations and engineering judgement. A coast morphological model (UNIBEST CL+) and a wave model (SWAN) have been setup for this purpose. Both the resulting values and estimated capital costs of the different layout variants turned out to be close to each other. The layout with the highest ratio of value over cost is selected as best.","Masterplan; Filyos; layout; design; port","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Ports & waterways","",""

Dutchband is a young company, which develops products to increase efficiency in the event world, such as the tokens or coins as replacement for money and wristbands to replace the traditional admission tickets. The token is used in different places, at small events it is possible to break the tokens of the string manually and sell them, but once the numbers of visitors increase, as is the case on a major event such as Lowlands or Sensation, this can be automated. For instance by using one of the three machines Dutchband has developed. Pin dispenser Cash dispenser Hand dispenser All machines work with the same principle to dispense the tokens. Inside these machines, the rolls of tokens are mounted, unrolled and broken off automatically. For the hand version there is a person sitting in a booth takes care of the payment and manages the machine with a few buttons. To create an even faster and cheaper service, the pin and cash machine do this fully automatically, reducing cost of labour. Currently the machines can only dispense tokens in a multitude of five or four tokens. Since the cash machine only accepts standard euro bills there is a problem with payment for certain token rates. To solve this problem the cash machines needs to become more flexible and able to provide every amount of tokens instead of the multitude of 5. This makes possible to remain using the machine in the future. The product developed in this graduation project is created to cut the tokens in multitudes of one token. The main problem was divided into three sub problems Separating; the physical separation of the tokens from the string, this resulted in a specially designed cutting devices which bends and cuts the token Propulsion; unrolling the string to the correct amount of tokens and feeding it in to the machine so it can be broken off, this resulted in a new system, to count the tokens as they pass and check how many tokens are still in stock. Aligning; crucial in dispensing the tokens without unwanted damage, this resulted in a new approach to correct errors in aligning, by comparing the length of the individual tokens, travelled distance by the token string and actual distance from sensor to break line and correcting accordingly. After the three main problems had been developed into three different concepts they are combined into a full functioning prototype to demonstrate its ability to cut tokens, which provided a satisfactory result.","Design; token dispenser; cutting device","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2011-06-18","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design","",""

The latest development, the introduction of the Bachelor-Master structure, has shifted the focus of the educational system to more activating and practical pedagogy. Parallel to this change, the number of students at the Delft University of Technology will increase drastically in the next ten years. Up till now, the solution was to build larger lecture rooms. However, research shows that on average only 32% of the seats in the Delft University of Technology lecture rooms is used. This calls for a different approach; not the number of seats should be increased, but the utilisation of seats. This utilisation can be increased by a higher flexibility of rooms. A part of this flexibility can be achieved by the upcoming technology of video conferencing; lecture rooms can be linked to each other and students in one lecture room can watch a lecture given in another lecture room. With the help of aiming microphones and cameras, students can even ask their questions to the teacher from another room. This is already being tested at the faculty of 3ME. The other possibility to increase flexibility is by changing furniture. The furniture in the rooms at the DUT currently has only one purpose; either lectures or group work. Increasing the possibilities of the rooms can cause more usage and thus enlarge efficiency. Such creation of flexibility by developing new furniture was the goal of this project. Furniture company Eromes also saw an opportunity in this project and with the help of their experience and manufacturing possibilities a piece of furniture had to be designed that could accommodate both lectures and group work. It had to be easy to use and combine the work space and comfort of a group work table, with power and network connections, and the practical side of fixed lecture furniture. The result of this project is the Flexstool; lecture room furniture capable to accommodate both lectures and group work or a combination of both. The latter allows lectures to have practical intermezzos. The Flexstool consists of a frame with a fixed table, a bench and two rotating chairs. Each Flexstool unit can be used by five or, if necessary, six persons. Two persons can take place on the rotating chairs in the front and three or four can be seated on the bench. The users seated on the bench use a fixed table, while the users on the rotating chairs use tables attached to their chairs. These will rotate with the chairs, resulting in an individual table when in lecture mode and, when joined with the fixed table, one large group table. If the Flexstool is used in three combined lecture rooms, each with a current capacity of 100 seats, the occupation of these rooms can be increased from 64% to 100% and the utilisation of the rooms can be increased from 21% to more than 60%. Besides a computer design, a prototype of the Flexstool was made. This prototype is a complete working model of the design, with the same aesthetics as the Flexstool would have when produced in series.","lecture room; ergonomics; furniture; design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","","",""

(mentor); Roozenburg, N.F.M. (mentor)","2010","This thesis shows the iterative design process of developing a business model (BM) for Ndassie. This start up company offers decentralized, renewable energy solutions to people that lack access to the electricity grid. The main market will be rural areas in developing countries, which is part of the ‘Base of Pyramid’ market. This target group consists of 3-4 billion people and is therefore the biggest market in the world with a yearly growth rate of 8%. However, this market has its own characteristics. It is hard to reach the population due to bad infrastructure and inhabitants are not able to purchase expensive products due to a lack of savings. Almost 1,6 billion people lack access to electricity. They get lighting from their kerosene lamps, which are hazardous, unhealthy and costly. Solar energy and led lighting is a good and sustainable alternative. The sun is for free and in countries like Cameroon, there are good sun conditions. However, most solar product require high initial investments. A micro credit can help users in affording these products. Another way to make solar energy accessible to the population are community systems. A community system is a recharging center in a rural community where the population can recharge their battery for a fee. Energy is generated via a solar panel. An entrepreneur can run this business and he will take care for the recharging service. This leads to lower initial costs of the light for the end user, so solar energy becomes affordable for the poorest of the poor. When designing the lamp so that the battery is separate from the light, you can even choose to let the end user only buy the light and rent the battery. If possible, the end user can buy both light and battery. Therefore the community concept improves accessibility and affordability to a great extend. In this report we did research on the BoP market and its specific characteristics. Making products and services accessible, affordable, acceptable and creating awareness are four key factors in doing business in these countries. We investigated important aspects for Ndassie in the context of Cameroon. Since this graduation project is about making a BM, we provide some theory about business models in general and in the context of BoP countries. This is illustrated by some existing BM of companies which sell lighting products to the poor. Lessons were derived and integrated in the development of the BM for Ndassie. In the second phase of this report we distinguish two BM for Ndassie: B2B and B2C. The B2B business model deals with the core business of Ndassie: selling complete businesses to local entrepreneurs. This enables entrepreneurs to start their own ‘recharging service’ in a rural community. Ndassie wants to work with a micro franchise concept. This means that the entrepreneur gets a complete ‘business in a box’ (BaB) with all promotional and administrative material included. The entrepreneur is called the franchisee and Ndassie the franchisor. The franchisee can just focus on his core business, which is renting batteries for a fee. Ndassie will develop new product concepts, takes care for promotional materials and sets the short and long term strategy. Besides, Ndassie provides the franchisees with trainings on sales, technology and bookkeeping. Working with this franchise concept will reduce business failures, lowers the barrier to start a business and can build a strong and coherent brand. We investigated the needs and wants of the end user in the B2C model. This bottom up approach is really important, because it puts the end-user in the center of the design process. He is the one who really uses the light product. That’s why the Value Proposition of Ndassie is as much as possible adapted to the needs of the end-user. One of the findings is that besides the great need of light, the population also uses energy for their radios and mobile phones. By differentiating in concepts and mentioning their (dis)advantages, we advise Ndassie in the design of their final product. For both BM we did a broad research on all choices the company still have to do. This contains choices on technical aspects, like the type of battery and the best supplier for solar panels, but also on training materials and pricing strategies. The goal is to make an offer which is similar to the kerosene lamp. If Ndassie can offer a sustainable, high quality led light for the same price as a kerosene lamp (about USD 12), the end-user is able to afford it. The charging service should be similar in use, but it should be cheaper to recharge your battery than to refill your kerosene lamp, while providing a higher quality of light (safer, cleaner and higher brightness). By calculations on costs and revenues we proof that Ndassie can offer the end-user a financial advantage of 10-30% by replacing the kerosene light by their product. If Ndassie also provides energy for radios, which are now running on expensive dry cell batteries, the advantage can be around 50%. In the final phase we elaborate the franchise concept and describe how Ndassie should reach the end user by offering a procedure. Besides, all information of the business model generation phase is aggregated into the B2B and B2C business models. To test whether we made the right choices, we validated the model by asking two groups who did their Integral Design Project on a similar assignment in the BoP lighting context. Because they both visited a BoP country (Cameroon and Kenia), they were able to offer some valuable advices. Most of these are integrated in the final model, but some were given as recommendations to Ndassie. Ndassie is a start-up company and therefore faces many risks.

Industrial Design Engineering Master Integrated Product Design. The research is based on the following defi nition of sustainability: Able to continue existing because of attributed value and adaptation to the energetic, material, ecological and social context. The research on the four contexts and values of Feijenoord has revealed these possibilities for sustainable recreation:  The energetic context offers wind, biomass, sun and tide as local energy sources. Effluents of the adjacent factory of Unilever can be converted into energy. Existing technology can be used to turn biological waste and CO2 into food.  The material context is being developed into the central recreation cluster of Feijenoord. The abandoned harbour allows for recreational use of water as an extension of public space. There are local waste materials that can be used in the design.  In the ecological context, water- and songbirds can benefit from a recreational facility that stimulates biodiversity. The north end of the harbour is suitable for an ecological shore.  The social context has the main opportunity that inhabitants are willing to invest in their surroundings. A park that is maintained with help of the community shows that people are committed as long as nothing is obligated.  The prevailing values in Feijenoord are conservative, seeking enjoyment and following tradition. A modern group of inhabitants is being attracted to Feijenoord, and they like challenge, experience, and self-realisation. The use value of the design has the highest priority but it should also have experience and narrative value. The context analysis led to the vision of sustainability as a natural phenomenon of prosperity; I want people to experience the retention and enjoyment of nature by adding value to the surroundings trough rest, re-creation and togetherness 2.0. From this vision, four recreational functions of the facility have been deduced:  a communal living room  a self-suffi cing food garden  a co-workshop  Fort Feijenoord These functions have been elaborated in five concepts. The chosen product is a fitness fountain which uses human power to purify or aerate water. It offers the possibility to add value to the environment trough an enjoyable activity. The product is designed to have a minimal environmental impact in production and disposal, and an eco-effective impact during use. A playground based on fitness fountains is a gift to its surroundings, in Feijenoord and other parks.","sustainable; recreation; Feijenoord; EMES+V; EMES+W; fitness; fountain","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design for Sustainability","","","",""

This is where an exchange of traffic between highways and secondary roads is possible. However, not all interchanges are functioning optimally. The main problems that occur around interchanges concern the traffic flow and safety. This research wants to explore the possibility that alternative forms of interchanges solve these problems. The research questions are as follows: 1. What affects the lay-out of an interchange? 2. How can the quality of an alternative design be evaluated? 3. How can the alternative designs contribute to solving the problems at interchanges? This study provides insight into what issues affect the design of an interchange and integrates these issues together with possible interchange designs into an assessment framework. In order to do this, the pros and cons of different interchange designs are considered. The assessment framework can then help in making design choices for new or modified connections. There are several aspects of the design of an interchange that have to be taken into account. The function of the interchange in the network is important, as is the right-of-way required by the proposed interchange. During the design of traffic constructions it is always important to pay atten-tion to the safety of road users and the principles of Sustainable Safety. In order to be able to find the right interchange design one must also have information about the required capacities. What amount of traffic will use the interchange and at what times? Special issues here are slow and freight traffic. More towards the detailed design, there are various statutory requirements and design guidelines which also must be met. Finally, there are costs, which in itself may not be too high, but must also be reasonable, compared to the benefits. In the assessment framework the most im-portant aspects are considered. The literature review delivers remarkable results. There are sources available that show various unconventional interchange types capable of competing both in terms of flow and in terms of road safety with the more common interchange types in the Netherlands. Especially the diverging diamond interchange and the contra-flow left interchange are attributed a high performance. The single point urban intersection has fewer advantages in terms of applicability and is more dependent on certain conditions, such as the absence of slow traffic. Literature review shows that the most interesting interchange types for inclusion in the assessment framework are the compressed diamond intersection, the bone roundabout, the contra-flow left interchange, the single point urban intersection and the diverging diamond interchange. These alternatives are preferred above the double on- and off ramp, the multiple-lane roundabout and the turbo-roundabout with traffic lights. Those alternatives have either too much influence on the traffic on the highway, are unsafe or are too expensive. The five alternatives are simulated with the program VISSIM. In this program they are subject to eight intensity distributions. The following variables were used: intensity on secondary road, intensity on on and off ramps, the presence of slow traffic and the amount of freight traffic. The performance is evaluated based on five different indicators: the total travel time, total delay, average delay, average waiting time and the amount of non-arrived vehicles. Based on the results of this simulation the contra-flow left interchange and, at lower intensities, the diverging diamond interchange turn out to be alternatives with a good traffic flow. By combining the results of the literature study and the computer simulation an assessment framework can be established. To make the use of this framework as simple as possible, it is de-signed as a tree. This way, only the most necessary considerations need to be made during the design process. The decision tree is shown in Figuur 0.1. This study shows that there are oppor-tunities to compensate problems with the flow and safety at interchanges with alternative forms of interchanges. This study brings an assessment framework that guides in choosing the right al-ternative, in a way that provides the user clarity about what the beneficial points of a certain design are.","Interchange; Alternative design; Single Point Urban Intersection; Diverging Diamond Interchange; Contraflow-left Interchange; Turbo-roundabout Interchange","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Transport & Planning","","","",""

(mentor)","2010","Peer-to-peer (P2P) technology allows us to create self-organising and scalable systems. The distributed nature of these systems requires a solution for finding interesting peers. In the context of P2P file sharing, finding peers who are downloading the same file is referred to as the swarm discovery problem. In BitTorrent, this problem is solved using a central server, called a tracker. This central component hinders the scalability of BitTorrent. We have designed a distributed swarm discovery algorithm, called 2-Hop TorrentSmell. It is composed of two parts. The first part builds on top of an existing keyword search system to find peers who have recently downloaded a certain file. The second part consists of an algorithm called RePEX, which allows a peer to stay in touch with swarms it is no longer in by periodically recontacting previously encountered swarm members. Our RePEX algorithm leverages a widely used BitTorrent extension for swarm discovery called PEX. We have conducted a study to understand the reliability and usability of PEX to optimize the design of our solution. We have implemented the RePEX part of 2-Hop TorrentSmell as an addition to the Tribler P2P network. For the evaluation of our RePEX algorithm, we have tested it on the 10 largest swarms on a public tracker. In addition, we have deployed the algorithm in a beta version of Tribler and let it run on swarms the user has downloaded from. Evaluation results show our algorithm is scalable and effective in popular swarms.","tribler; p2p; distributed; tracking; bittorrent; swarm; discovery","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Computer Science","","Parallel and Distributed Systems","",""

(mentor)","2010","The nearshore zone is an active zone that can be quite inhospitable to humans due to violent wave breaking and strong rip currents. Rip currents are shore normal jet-like currents that typically extend from near the shoreline out past the line of breaking waves. Observations have concluded that a rip current system generally consists of 4 parts. Part 1 is the shoreward mass transport due to the waves carrying water through the breaker zone in the direction of wave propagation. Part 2 is the movement of this water mass parallel to the coast known as a longshore current. Part 3 is the rip current itself, a seaward flow of water through a narrow rip channel. And part 4 is an alongshore movement outside the breaker zone of the expanding rip head. With the use of the numerical model XBeach, in which a non-hydrostatic model based upon the numerical scheme as developed by Stelling and Zijlema (2003)was implemented, the fluid motions in the nearshore zone are simulated. The method of Stelling and Zijlema utilizes an edge based compact difference scheme for the approximation of the vertical gradient of the non-hydrostatic pressure. This ensures accurate wave breaking and dispersion characteristics, which is important for an accurate simulation of the nearshore hydrodynamics. Two test cases are used to verify the model for replication of the hydrodynamics in the nearshore zone. The first case consists of irregular wave breaking in a laboratory barred surf zone. The second case is a wave induced and bathymetry driven rip current in a directional wave basin. The numerical model is further developed with the addition of an eddy viscosity model and a non-reflecting boundary condition. With these additions the depth averaged model gave very satisfactorily results for both cases. The XBeach model is an accurate and efficient simulation package for the dynamics in the nearshore zone. This study shows that application to real world situations should give realistic and accurate results. Therefore the model could be applied in coastal engineering applications and in the research for energy extraction methods from wave induced currents.","Non-hydrostatic pressure; Rip currents; Breaking waves; Surf zone","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Environmental Fluid Dynamics","",""

These deformations can have an adverse effect on nearby structures, for instance pile foundations, cables and ducts. This research concentrates on the horizontal deformations, which are most prominent at the outer sides of the embankment. A case where horizontal deformations have resulted in damage is reported by Fellenius and Johansson (1972). They presented a case where several piles of a building in Huddinge near Stockholm buckled due to excessive horizontal movements.

(mentor)","2010","Assignment: The assignment was to design a product around CHESS' Wireless Sensor Network technology ‘MyriaNed’ that shows the potential of the WSN technology towards new clients for CHESS and supports independently living elderly people in their daily life. However, elderly people are not always open to new technologies. The challenge is to overcome this and tempt future elderly people to adopt a WSN-based product in their daily life in order to prolong the time they can live independently. Analysis: To live independently people need a certain level of physical and mental health. When people grow old, they get sleep disorders (insomnia) more often. To make elderly people accept a new technology it should fulfil a certain need. Improving elderly people’s night’s rest can contribute to their health and mood and through that to their independence. Light exposure and physical activity are seen as suitable strategies to improve people’s night’s rest. This offers interesting opportunities for applying WSN technology, because the nodes can be combined with sensors measuring light and movement. To show the potential of MyriaNed an usage case is proposed. In this case the user wears a WSN element that measures light and activity and provides feedback on these parameters, throughout the day. The element has to be worn visibly outdoors, but can be taken off indoors; then the MyriaNed estimates the amount of light the user receives. When the user is outside he gets a signal that another user is near. This is enabled by the MyriaNode in the product. Through this feature social communication between users is stimulated. The user gets basic information at the wearable part, in and outdoors, extensive feedback is provided externally. Final design 'nlightn': This thesis results in the design of 'nlightn' |?n'la?tn| .It contains a MyriaNode, a light sensor, accelerometer and a display. It will be worn like a bracelet around the wrist, because the user is familiar with wearing a watch; the gesture of checking the feedback is similar to taking a look at a watch for the time. On the wristlet a tab sticks out that can turn around a pivot point. This provides a friendly interaction with the product. The light sensor is positioned on top of tab to measure light continuously. The top side also contains an 'attention light', which starts blinking when the user is close to another user outdoors. Flipping the tab reveals an interface of two buttons and a display. One of the buttons is dedicated to show information on light exposure, while the other button is dedicated to show information on activity. The display shows the amount of received light/activity on a LED bar. It provides advice whether the user needs more [+] the same [o] or less [-] light/activity to perform sleep enhancing behavior. Conclusions & recommendations: In the proposed usage case elderly people are supported in remaining independent by a MyriaNed application that stimulates the user to perform sleep enhancing behavior by measuring and giving feedback on the amount of received light and the performed physical activity. The potential of MyriaNed is emphasized in the case, because it enables wireless dynamic feedback and social communication between users. The proposed case fits in the living environment of future elderly people because they are health focused and willing to invest in products that support their independence. On the simple to use bracelet, the user can access the feedback while performing daily activities, without being forced to wear it all day at home. This makes the product fit in the user's daily life. As elderly people experience sleep disorders more often, they are motivated to accept nlightn because it benefits to non-pharmacological sleep enhancement. Besides it enhances spontaneous, superficial contact between users. To evaluate the product a usage research was conducted with a prototype without electronic functionality (Figure 3). From the research was concluded that users have a positive attitude towards nlightn; they perceive its benefit over pharmacological insomnia treatment, are content about the appearance of nlightn and appreciate the concept of receiving dynamic feedback throughout the day. They indicate that they would be willing to wear the product in daily life and take its advice into account. However, the test subjects of the usage research emphasize that their willingness to use the product and adjust their activities towards the product's advice, depends on the reliability and functionality of the concept. These aspects could not be evaluated in this research. The next step towards defining the feasibility of the concept is to complete the WSN product portfolio. Together with a basic software design that provides simulated feedback an initial experiment could be set up. CHESS can use this working 'network prototype' for promotional purposes as well, because it clearly communicates the potential of MyriaNed towards clients. If the concept is regarded as promising based on the outcomes of the initial experiment, an algorithm can be developed to make the concept fully assessable in a second experiment. To evaluate the expertise of the algorithm and the effect on the user's night's rest more experimenting will be needed. Besides these continuation recommendations, several opportunities that could increase the user acceptance of nlightn are illustrated; like applying a LCD display and making it modular. Other opportunities might be to cooperate with housing corporations, in order to develop a MyriaNed service network for 55+ housing properties.","wireless sensor nodes; elderly users; independent living; sleep enhancement through light exposure; product design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design","",""

(mentor)","2010","A well-known problem in peer-to-peer networks is free-riding, where users do not share resources in return for what they consume. Free-riders can be distinguished in two categories: diehard free-riders that are willing to subvert the network’s protocol in order to free-ride, and lazy free-riders that are reluctant to share but do follow the protocol. An important body of research focuses on die-hard free-riders in the popular BitTorrent file-sharing network, but in practice diehard free-riding in BitTorrent is not often observed. Lazy free-riding, on the other hand, is often observed, and in this thesis we investigate whether BitTorrent provides lazy free-riders with an incentive to share. Based on a game-theoretical model, we prove that this is the case for some lazy free-riders, but not for all. We then proceed to investigate the same for BarterCast, a new distributed reputation mechanism that is added to the BitTorrent-based Tribler network to provide additional sharing incentives. Based on an extended version of the same model, we prove that BarterCast also provides incentives only to some lazy free-riders, but not for all. We verify these results with simulations, and find that in practice, even fewer incentives are given than our model predicts. However, we show that lazy free-riding can provide a gain but also a loss, and that the net result is difficult to predict, which can be seen as an additional incentive against free-riding.","BitTorrent; file-sharing; P2P systems; incentives; reputation systems; modeling; game theory","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2010-07-08","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Computer Science","","Algorithms Group","",""

(mentor); Brinkgreve, R.B.J. (mentor); Kringos, N. (mentor)","2010","The stability of the slow moving Big Rock Mesa (BRM) landslide located in California (USA) was analysed. A detailed description of its geometry and soil structure is presented. For the stability vital shear zone and unsaturated zone were identified. The strength and permeability of the different layers that exist in the BRM were determined using computational methods and from literature data. The stability of landslides is susceptible to rainfall and changes to the groundwater level. The corresponding pressure changes cause slopes to become unstable. In dry periods the landslide is stable and in wet periods displacements by deformations occur. For the BRM landslide the rainfall data and displacements recorded with inclinometers were analysed. A water balance was made for a critical and stable period to evaluate the hydraulic flow. Besides rainwater it is likely that also water from adjacent areas flows into the BRM mass. Most of the rainwater is stored in the unsaturated zone of the BRM, which has an average thickness of about 42.5 m. Only a part of this water disappears by run-off and dewatering. The water pulse in the unsaturated zone is slowly drained by the evapotranspiration. The groundwater level profile of BRM was determined from measurements and computed with a statistical program called Surfer. The infiltration of water into the unsaturated zone reduces the suction. This suction is smallest over the vertical infiltration length of the water pulse. The water pulse propagates deeper into the unsaturated zone when rainfall increases. The reduction suction weakens the soil. Consequently, the stability of a slide increases with evapotranspiration and decreases with water infiltration. The stability of the BRM and the flow through the unsaturated zone was analysed with the finite element program Plaxis. However, due to the size of the BRM a full coupled analysis of deformations and hydraulic flow was not possible. Instead steady state calculations were performed. The flow through the unsaturated zone was compared with results from the one-dimensional flow program called SWAP. For the conditions of steady state calculation with suction the BRM is stable with a safety factor of 1.17. The safety factor of the BRM decreases slightly with increasing head on the hill side of the geometry. Suction in the unsaturated zone increases the safety factor by only 0.01. This suction decreases when water infiltrates. The calculated small influence of increasing groundwater table corresponds with inclinometer readings.","stability; landslides","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geotechnology","","Geo-Engineering","",""

(mentor)","2010","De toegenomen concurrentie in de Europese luchtvaart heeft ervoor gezorgd dat kostenbesparingen steeds belangrijker worden omdat consumenten vragen om lage ticketprijzen. Er zijn critici die menen dat het mogelijk is dat de veiligheid in de sector zal afnemen omdat het voor private partijen interessanter is om te investeren in private waarden dan in publieke waarden als veiligheid. De afgelopen 25 jaar is de veiligheid in de sector echter alleen maar toegenomen en maar liefst 64% van de reizigers geeft dan ook dat zij vliegen veiliger vinden dat andere transportmodaliteiten. Een rationele gedachte kan dan ook zijn dat mensen bereid zijn veiligheid in te leveren (tot vliegen weer even veilig is als reizen met andere transportmodaliteiten, of gewoon ´veilig genoeg´) in ruil voor een lagere ticketprijs. De hoofdvraag van dit onderzoek luidt dan ook: Zijn Nederlandse passagiers bereid om een minder veilige vlucht te kiezen, in ruil voor een lagere ticketprijs? Middels conjuncte analyse in de vorm van een Stated Choice experiment en een variatie hierop in de vorm van een ruilexperimenten is met behulp van een enquête bovenstaande hoofdvraag onderzocht. Het bleek de meeste mensen de veiligheid van hun vlucht iets belangrijker vinden dan de ticketprijs. De keuzekans voor vluchten nam dan ook af bij afnemende veiligheid gecombineerd met afnemende ticketprijs. Echter toch is er in ruim 30% van de ruilopgaven door een kleine 80% van de respondenten de vlucht geruild tegen een minder veilige maar goedkopere vlucht. Met name duurdere vluchten werden relatief vaak geruild en vluchten waarbij de veiligheidsscore afnam van drie naar twee veiligheidssterren (op een schaal van één tot drie veiligheidssterren, waarbij drie het hoogste veiligheidsniveau symboliseert). De conclusie van dit onderzoek is dan ook dat Nederlandse passagiers veiligheid vaak belangrijker vinden dan prijs, maar dat er wel degelijk ruimte is voor compensatie! Er wordt verwacht dat de groep van 80% die in een aantal gevallen bereid bleek veiligheid in te leveren voor een lagere ticketprijs, wel degelijk een groep van formaat is waar toezicht autoriteiten en luchtvaartorganisaties rekening mee willen houden. Verder bleek dat mensen met een hoge veiligheidsperceptie ten aanzien van vliegen eerder geneigd zijn een afname in de veiligheid van hun vlucht te laten compenseren door een lagere ticketprijs. Ditzelfde geldt voor mensen met een hoge prijssensitiviteit. In ruim 40% van de keuzes van mensen met een hoge veiligheidsperceptie werden vluchten geruild tegen minder veilige maar goedkopere vluchten. Ditzelfde was het geval in ruim 50% van de keuzes van mensen met een hoge prijssensitiviteit. In het licht van de aanhoudende kredietcrisis mag verwacht worden dat de prijssensitiviteit en daarmee de ruilbereidheid van de passagiers zal toenemen. In dit licht lijkt het daarom verstandig om een grootschaliger en uitgebreider onderzoek te doen naar de trade-off van passagiers tussen ticketprijs en veiligheid en naar de gevolgen die deze afweging kan hebben voor de veiligheid in de luchtvaartsector.","veiligheidsperceptie; prijssensitiviteit; ticketprijs; veiligheidsscore; vluchtkeuze; Conjuncte Analyse","nl","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Technology, Policy and Management","Infrastructures, Systems and Services","","Transport, Infrastructuur en Logistiek","",""

(mentor); Jongejan, R.B. (mentor); Pasterkamp, S. (mentor)","2010","Seismic risk in some regions of Greece has increased over the last decades. The reason lies in urban development in earthquake prone regions, combined with a lack of ability or interest to tackle known construction vulnerabilities of buildings. Despite the severity of risk, also confirmed by recent events, homeowners have proven unwilling to mitigate seismic risk, possibly because of their inability to pay and/or unwillingness to invest due to lack of information or awareness. As a result, significant part of the building stock remains unsafe, in comparison with the safety level of the current building code. A way to stimulate seismic risk mitigation is government intervention. Such intervention could consist of a safety plan (retrofit program, mandatory insurance, emergency planning etc.) implemented by government, subsidies, introduction of more stringent building codes, risk communication. Recent developments in Greece regarding seismic safety are mostly aimed at vulnerability and risk evaluation, the publishing of a technical building Code of Interventions, and mapping out a seismic safety plan for Greece. Meanwhile, experts ask for government intervention proposing organisational change and a distribution of roles / liabilities among different clusters. For every scheme of government program, risk estimation is vital to be able to set priorities and decide whether buildings, municipalities, or regions are safe enough. Besides economic risks, risks to life should also be considered. Instruments for quantifying fatality risks are however unavailable at present. A review of the cornerstones of Dutch flood risk management practices, especially in risk estimation and decision-making has shown that fatality risks are considered from a societal perspective and an individual one. The societal risk metric concerns the (exceedance) probabilities of larger numbers of fatalities; the individual risk metric concerns the probability of death of a person at a specific location. In the case of the Netherlands, due to the nature of the flood hazard and protection scheme (public flood defences), the government is strongly involved in flood risk mitigation. Despite differences between the protection schemes for large-scale floods (strengthening dikes rather than protecting buildings) and earthquakes (strengthening buildings), this project proposes the translation (=the act of converting) of aforementioned metrics to the case of seismic risk in Greece. To quantify those metrics for earthquakes requires knowledge of the probabilities of different hazard levels (peak ground accelerations), the extent of damage on buildings given the hazard, and the expected number of fatalities in case of damage given the extent of damage. In this study, societal risk (depicted by FN-curves) and individual risk levels are quantified using exceedance probability function of peak ground acceleration at the site under Seismic Risk Mitigation in Greece Translation of Dutch Flood Risk Management Practices consideration, as well as deterministic transfer functions for damage (vulnerability curves) and losses (mortality curves). Moreover, since economic losses of earthquakes can also be significant, societal economic risk (FL-curve) and individual economic risk are also proposed and quantified. Using recent research results about the vulnerability of buildings, inventory data for social economic characteristics and reasonable assumptions about missing information (like building size); risk can be estimated for existing and retrofitted building stocks of Greek municipalities. After sensitivity analysis of model parameters, two case studies are presented that show the use of the aforementioned risk metrics for different levels of government decision-making. One simulating top level (central government) decision making, setting priorities for retrofit between municipalities, and the second simulating medium level (local government) decision making, setting priorities for a retrofit program between different structural typologies of buildings. The case studies show that the risk metrics and the model to quantify them can be useful tools for deciding which municipality should absorb more resources, whether mitigation is urgent, which mitigation strategy is most efficient, and how alternative retrofit programs influence risk levels. Of course, the model is only a prototype further refinements are advised. There are important benefits from the implementation of the described methodology. Firstly, the decision maker only deals with probabilities and consequences, has a general overview thus he/she may distribute resources and time in a more (cost) effective way. Moreover, human life is distinguished from cost-benefit analysis (no monetization). Events with high numbers of fatalities, which can cause disruption to the whole of the country, as well as disproportional individual exposures, can be targeted directly. Finally, it gives the opportunity to monitor the progress of a safety plan, and is scalable for central and local administration. This study concludes by proposing the application of societal & individual risk metrics (for fatalities and economic loss) to support two levels (central and local) of government decision making concerning seismic risk mitigation in Greece. Furthermore, it provides a prototype model for the quantification of these metrics. Finally, this thesis proposes directions for further research, the most important being research about the costs of alternative retrofit programs, which is necessary for the debate about appropriate (efficient/feasible) societal & individual risk acceptance criteria.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Design and Construction Processes","","","",""

(mentor)","2010","In September and October of the year 2009, three sandgroyne nourishments have been executed at the Delfland Coast near the village of Ter Heijde. The nourishments have been executed to restore the sediment buffer in the upper part of the coastal profile. A sandgroyne is a concentrated amount of sediment (200.000m3) artificially nourished from the beach into the sea, appearing in the formation of peninsulas. It was anticipated that the three sandgroynes would be absorbed into the coastal system by the impact of waves and currents, nourishing the upper shoreface from the shoreline until a depth of about -5m NAP over a coastal stretch of about 2.5km. The construction and evolution of the sandgroynes have been monitored intensively. The following research objectives were proposed: 1) Assess the morphological evolution and practical aspects of the sandgroynes constructed at the Ter Heijde coast and 2) Use the site specific knowledge from the Ter Heijde pilot project to create a future perspective of sandgroyne nourishments as a common applied method to nourish the shoreface. This master thesis describes the process of the monitoring campaign, the results of a morhpological data analysis, the results of an initial model simulation set-up and a practical analysis. The sandgroynes have been absorbed in the coastal system, dominantly between the shoreline and the -5m depth contour. However the spatial scale of longshore sediment redistribution was larger than accounted for, driven by the intense wave climate. It is concluded that the sandgroynes can be an effective method for nourishing the shoreface, under flexible contract requirements that acknowledge the dynamics of the natural system.","Sandgroyne; Delfland Coast; Sediment transport; Nourishment; Sand engine; Bathymetry survey; Ter Heijde","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2010","A cobble sea defence appears to be an easy constructible protection, with relatively low total costs of ownership. Flume tests show that sand under such single layered constructions is stable. However, it is not exactly known how the hydraulic loading of a breaking wave is reducing in the filter. Two datasets containing pressure measurements in a revetment were available for identification of this reduction: 1) A dataset of a test performed in the Großer Wellenkanal (Hannover), for improvement of the understanding of all relevant processes in Elastocoast revetments (obtained from the Braunschweig University of Technology). 2) A dataset of tests in the Delta Flume, for the verification and optimization of the cobble shore design of the ‘Maasvlakte 2’ (obtained from PUMA). The dataset of the Großer Wellenkanal test was analysed to increase the insight in the behaviour of pressures in a filter resulting from (breaking) waves and to explain processes and test results of the Delta Flume model tests. Hydraulic loading at the top of a revetment exist out of two types of loads; impact and non-impact loads. The impact load, resulting from plunging waves, can be distinguished in an impact peak and a quasi-static part. The impact peak is very high (>10 kPa), last for only a fraction of time (<0.2s) and reduces completely in the filter. The non-impact load and the quasi-static part of the impact load reduce less and are responsible for the hydraulic loading at the interface of sand underlying a thick, single filter layer. Although large influence was expected for turbulence generated by breaking waves it does not have an important role in the hydraulic loading that eventually reaches the interface. The parallel gradients at the interface are only the result of pressures in- and decreasing with the wave period. The maximal destabilizing perpendicular gradients are frequently accompanied by a maximal parallel gradient. The main loading mechanism at the interface results from the run-down; during run-down the largest parallel and perpendicular gradients are generated. Predicted gradients acting on the interface between gravel and sand in the Delta Flume models are higher than traditional stability criteria. Therefore, an erosion process of the sandy embankment would be expected for the tested Delta Flume models. However, erosion was not observed. The stable interface in the Delta Flume tests can thus not be explained from the pressure reduction resulting from the analysis of the measurements in the Delta Flume models itself. The damping observed in the Großer Wellenkanal and the non-distorted interface in the Delta Flume models give strong indications that the reduction observed in the gravel material of the Delta Flume models is not representative for the performance of the gravel layer, resulting in a conservative prediction of gradients at the interface of gravel and sand. Several factors could have been influencing the pressures in the revetments of the Delta Flume models and the reduction found in the analysis of the measurements.","cobble beach; cobble sea defence; single filter layer; turbulence","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

Men kan met de bus (reistijd 45 minuten) of met de trein (reistijd 43) minuten. Gezien de hemelsbrede afstand tussen Apeldoorn en Arnhem (slechts 25,4km) is de verplaatsingssnelheid dus erg laag. Aanleiding voor de start van het onderzoek naar een betere verbinding, zijn de uitspraken over de trage verbinding door de voormalige wethouder van Apeldoorn. Allereerst is er door de Provincie Gelderland aan Movares opdracht gegeven om te onderzoeken of de bouw van de zogenaamde Emperbocht haalbaar was. Deze verbindingsbocht maakt een directe treindienst tussen Apeldoorn en Arnhem mogelijk. Reistijd werd hiermee met 10 minuten verminderd. Nadat het onderzoek voltooid was bleek dat de kosten voor de Emperbocht zo’n 50 miljoen euro zouden gaan bedragen. Omdat dit te duur was is opdracht gegeven voor een nieuw onderzoek; de herontwikkeling van de museumlijn tussen Apeldoorn en Dieren. Door op deze lijn weer reizigerstreinen te gaan exploiteren kan er een tijdswinst van 16 minuten geboekt worden. Allereerst is gestart het horizontale en verticale alignement van de museumlijn te bepalen en deze geschikt te maken voor 140 km/h. Daarna is er een exploitatievoorstel gemaakt om te kijken voor wat voor treindiensten de lijn geschikt was. Na de afronding van het voorontwerp is er een investeringsraming gemaakt, waaruit volgde dat de herontwikkeling zo’n 32 miljoen euro zou gaan kosten. Ondanks deze meevaller blijkt er nog een goedkopere oplossing te zijn. De bouw van een enkele Emperbocht zorgt tevens voor een reistijdverkorting van 10 minuten, maar is zo’n 30 miljoen euro goedkoper dan de dubbele Emperbocht. De afweging tussen de verschillende alternatieven is uitgewerkt in een multi criteria evaluatie.

Mine fields can be found in about 90 countries as a result of conflicts which ended a long time ago. Nobody knows exactly were the mines are and how many there are. The current process to detect land mines is slow, dangerous and expensive. It will take decades, if not centuries until all mines are found and destroyed. For the last 15 years development projects to improve the clearance process have had hardly any result. The projects often did not take the implementation of their technology into account. Problems which occurred were: Costs of the technology; Acceptance by the local population; Accessibility to the mine fields; Local accessibility to materials and knowledge for operation and maintenance and the reliability of the technology. The aim of this project is to improve the process of land mine clearance. It is important to release land quicker, so the local population can populate and use the land again. Cooperation with the local community is essential, because they are familiar with the problem and know what could be a good solution for them. The situation in every country is different, so this project will focus on the country with the biggest land mine problem: Cambodia. About 350 people die of land mine annually and the country counts over 45.000 maimed people as a result of land mines. This report will describe the project where desk research and research on the local context of the land mine issue in Cambodia have led to the development of a product which could offer a more efficient method of mine clearance. The result of this project is a prototype of a working principle that gives an answer to the actual desires of the local community","Mineclearance; Land mines","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2011-06-09","Industrial Design Engineering","Integrated Product Design","","","",""

(mentor); Moor, P. (mentor)","2010","Since a couple of years the popularity of microcars amongst young people has increased. A microcar is a small vehicle that looks like a regular car but can be driven with a AM driver’s license, which can be obtained from the age of 16. A new microcar though starts at 10.000,-. The gap between a moped, which are up to 3.000, and the cheapest microcar therefore is 7.000. The increasing popularity of a microcar combined with this large gap in the vehicle market provides an opportunity. This opportunity was the starting point of this graduation project. The Dutch company Trigger Car B.V. produces a three-wheeled vehicle called the Trigger 50. The Trigger officially isn’t a microcar but a moped on three wheels, but it has the same benefits as a microcar; it is safe, comfortable, you don’t have to wear a helmet, but in contradiction to a microcar you can park it on the pavement. The reason why you don’t see many in the Netherlands is the absence of a roof. Their current market consists of companies abroad that rent them out to tourists or use them to give city tours. A new model is in development. One part of this graduation project focused on designing the concept for the new body work. The target group of the new model was set specifically on teenagers and urban professionals. For teenagers the Trigger provides a cheaper but trendier alternative to a microcar and a safer and more comfortable alternative to a moped. For urban professionals the Trigger provides embodied alternative to a moped that can still be parked anywhere outside a parking spot. It was chosen to position the new model as a trendy, modern and above all, unique vehicle, different from any else currently existing. The large front window, the open doors, the flat rear, the protruding rear light-indicators and the matte black finish combined with the red aspects all contribute to this image. The other part involved the design of a production ready design proposal for a matching convertible roof.?Main problem was to make sure that the vehicle would look just as appealing with the top off as with the top on. To accomplish this it was important that the roof would follow the shape of the body work when folded. Consequently the rear part of the roof had to narrow while folding. The result is a unique convertible vehicle suited for the cool teenage boy as well as for the middle aged female real estate agent in urban areas.","microcar; scooter; urban transportation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design","",""

(mentor); Quist, P. (mentor); Soons, F.A.M. (mentor); Verhagen, H.J. (mentor)","2010","Albania has the following major sea ports: Durrës, Vlora, Sarandë and Shëngjin. The port of Durrës has the biggest share in the volume of import/export in Albania, nearly 75%. Due to current development rates, limited possibilities for expansion and pollution in the city because of its vicinity to the port, projects are identified to construct a new port which will better meet increasing needs and demands. This gives a reason to do research on the possibilities of constructing port facilities at an alternative location. This new ‘port’ is designed in the Durrës area. To design a new port, information is needed about future trade and traffic anticipated in the future. An effort was made to make some forecasts in order to render this report more realistic. The produced forecasts are bases on a combination of past data extrapolation, trade and traffic trends as well as insight in the situation of Albania and hinterland connections. The master plan duration, which will be 25 years (2010-2035), is divided into three periods. Three different growth scenarios were taken into account. This report has been based on the medium growth scenario (4.3%, 3.8% and 3.1 % increase in the total trade of Albania in tons for the three time periods respectively). Assuming a medium growth scenario 1,807,000 tons of dry bulk will be handled in Porto Romano in 2035, 774,000 tons liquid bulk, 1,033,000 tons general cargo and 215,111 TEUs. When Romano Port starts functioning, it is immediately able to accommodate container vessels up to 45,000 dwt. For dry bulk it is assumed that the port should be able to accommodate vessels up to 40,000 dwt. The General Cargo vessels which currently enter the port of Durrës have an average size of 4,000 dwt. Although in general the size of General Cargo vessels remains relative small the average ship is expected to increase up to 10,000 dwt in 2035, with a maximum of 15,000 dwt. The maximum ship size for the liquid bulk terminal is assumed at 25,000 dwt. Taking into account the above forecasts, the future needs concerning terminal areas, berths and equipment were depicted. The container terminal will require a storage area of 440,000 m2 and a berth length of 466 meter. Dry bulk needs an area of 62,000 m2 and a berth length of 240 meter. General cargo will require a storage area of 84,000 m2 and a berth length of 543 meter. For the liquid bulk terminal, no additional berth is required. Ten alternatives were generated based on the future needs above. Three of them were discussed in more detail. Several affecting parameters were taken into account like extensibility, tranquillity, manoeuvrability etc. The comparison among these alternatives was conducted with the help of a multi criteria analyses. The objectivity of this method was verified by doing several sensitivity checks. Finally it leads to a final optimum port layout. Two chapters are written about the breakwater and quay wall. After an analysis, where several breakwater types were discussed and a comparison between a caisson type and rubble mound breakwater was made, the rubble mound breakwater appeared to be the preferred solution. The breakwater armour layer is designed using a single layer of Accropode ll elements. A concrete unit is selected because the required weight of the armour units is substantially larger than the available 2 ton rock in the quarry nearby. For the quay wall, an open pile construction has been selected.","port master plan; trade and traffic forecast; breakwater","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); De Boer, E. (mentor); Baggen, J.H. (mentor); Opstal, P.C.H. (mentor)","2010","Eind vorige eeuw is door de landelijke overheid gestat met het aanleggen van een aantal transferia rondom (grote) steden in het land. Doel van deze multimodale overstappunten was om de steden beter te kunnen ontsluiten en om de filedruk te doen afnemen. Rondom diverse grote steden zijn bestemmingstransferia aangebracht, maar dit is nooit gebeurd in de regio Haaglanden. De onderzoeksvraag in dit onderzoek is daarom gesteld als: “Waar liggen in en rondom het stadsgewest Haaglanden geschikte locaties voor ontwikkeling van transferia en onder welke omstandigheden dragen zij succesvol bij aan de doelstellingen van het verkeers- en vervoerbeleid uit het structuurplan?” Allereerst is gekeken wat potentieel succesvolle locaties voor transferia kunnen zijn. Hiervoor wordt gekeken naar de volgende succesfactoren: 1. Ligging aan een grote doorgaande weg, bij voorkeur een (auto)snelweg. 2. Ligging aan een (geplande) spoorverbinding of andere hoogwaardig openbaar vervoer verbinding. 3. De ligging van de locatie ten opzichte van de “dagelijkse” files. De locatie dient met het oog op de eindbestemming Haaglenden gelegen te zijn vóór deze congestiegebieden. Op basis van deze criteria is met een snelle zeefanalyse gekomen tot de volgende zeven potentiële locaties: 1. Halte Randstadrail Forepark (A4, afrit 8 Leidschendam) 2. Loserlaan / Uithof 3. Prins Clausplein (knooppunt A4, A13, A12) 4. Halte Randstadrail Nootdorp (langs A12) 5. Treinstation Zoetermeer-Oost 6. Treinstation Delft-Zuid 7. Treinstation Rotterdam Kleiweg Om het te verwachten transferiumgebruik te kunnen schatten, is gebruik gemaakt van een logitmodel. In eerder uitgevoerd onderzoek naar transferia is dit model een robuuste en redelijk betrouwbare voorspeller voor gebruik gebleken. Ook op basis van een in dit onderzoek uitgevoerde validatie op gebruik van Transferium ’t Schouw bij Leiden is gebleken dat een logitmodel betrouwbare gebruikscijfers kan leveren. Van de zeven voorgenoemde locaties springen er drie uit op basis van het verwachte gebruik, dit zijn: 3-Clausplein, 1-Forepark en 4-Nootdorp. Van deze drie springt het Clausplein er nog weer bovenuit, wat niet vreemd is gezien het grote reizigerspotentieel dat zich dagelijks over de wegen bij het Prins Clausplein begeeft. Echter, ondanks dat het Prins Clausplein de beste locatie zou zijn voor een bestemmingstransferium voor Den Haag / Haaglanden, is het absolute gebruikersaantal te laag om een transferium zonde subsidie rendabel te kunnen exploiteren. Door het kleine aantal bezoekers, is ook het effect van een transferium op de files gering. Flankerend beleid in de vorm van verkeersbuffers, tolheffing en hogere parkeertarieven is noodzakelijk voor een rendabel transferium. Het is echter maar zeer de vraag of dergelijke maatregelen ook wenselijk zijn. Het antwoord op de onderzoeksvraag, en tevens de hoofdconclusie van deze rapportage, is dan ook dat een bestemmingstransferium voor Haaglanden niet haalbaar. Indien de wens van de politiek toch uitgaat naar het plaatsen van een transferium, dient onderzocht te worden welke beleidsmaatregelen kunnen worden ingezet om het transferium van voldoende gebruikers te voorzien. Er dient dan tevens gekeken te worden naar de mogelijkheden om het transferium niet alleen als bestemmingstransferium te gebruiken, maar ook als herkomsttransferium (zie bijvoorbeeld Rotterdam Alexander).","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Transport & Planning","","","",""

Compliant joints do not have these disadvantages, can be made from fewer parts and can increase performance compared to rigid body joints. The goal of this paper is to develop a single degree of freedom gravity balancer where all the rigid joints are replaced with compliant joints. To reach this goal a new method has been developed. The method is based on connecting rigid links with compliant joints. With a constant potential energy as objective, the method allows new gravity balancers to be designed. It can be concluded that for the first time a gravity balancers has been constructed where all the rigid joints are replaced with compliant joints.

Specifically, we are interested in minimizing the power consumption of an LED system, subject to providing uniform illumination at a pre-specified level around occupied zones, by determining the dimming levels of the LEDs. Localized occupancy information (i.e. occupied zones) is determined by an ultrasonic array sensor while providing a natural interface for illumination control. We present algorithms for localizing and tracking an occupant in an indoor environment. We show that the optimization problem for illumination can be solved by linear programming and use the simplex algorithm to determine the dimming levels.

(mentor); Tijssen, T.P.M. (mentor)","2010","The goal of this research is to develop a 3D topological structure with validation functionality and a conversion function. Based on this research question, some sub questions have been defined and a research methodology. The outline of this research is elaborated in chapter 1. The first use of topology has been attributed to Euler in 1736, since then, topology has evolved in mathematics but also in GIS. Since the second half of the 20th century, 2D topological data structures are historically well established, with structures like TIGER and GBF/DIME. Several 3D topological structures have been developed as well. Most of them by researchers (for example 3D FDS and SSS). No commercial geo-DBMS has implemented a 3D topological structure, until recently. 1Spatial has developed a 3D topological structure. This structure has been analyzed among other 2D and 3D structures (chapter 2). It is clear that the existing structures differ a lot. Some structures maintain a 3D primitive while others do not. Orientation is stored in different ways, the same applies for geometry and singularities. Some structures have quite some redundancy, while other structures have only a few relationships stored explicitly, which makes maintaining the structure harder. In spite of the many differences, the characteristics of, both 2D and 3D, topological structures are based on the same aspects: dimension, partition (including the universe), primitives (including their relationships), orientation, singularities and geometrical realization. Based on these main aspects, the requirements for the topological structure are defined in chapter 3 and a conceptual model is designed. The model consist of four primitives, which are related to each other by their (co)boundary relationships. These boundary relationships exact a full space partition, where every primitive involved, is part of a volume primitive. No isolated and dangling primitives are allowed. Next to the boundaries, especially the rings and the shells, orientation plays an important role within a topological structure and the geometrical realization. Single geometries have their dvantages, therefore single geometries and topological structures should be used together. Once the structure has been defined, validation rules need to be set. In order to validate a 3D topological structure, the involved volumes must be valid as well as the whole structure, which means the relationships between the volumes. Since no single definition of a valid 3D primitive is available, the rules are based on a few existing validation functions for 3D single geometries. No 3D topological validation function exists at the moment. Once the rules for a valid structure are set (chapter 4), the structure has been implemented into Oracle Spatial. The validation rules are translated into validation tests and implemented on this structure (chapter 5), as well as the geometry operations. In chapter 6, the structure, validation tests and geometry operations are tested with a test data set and evaluated.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","OTB Research Institute for the Built Environment","GIS Technology","","GIMA","",""

(mentor); Van der Toorn, A. (mentor); Peperkamp, W.J.M. (mentor)","2010","Door de klimaatveranderingen voorziet de Deltacommissie 2008 problemen voor het Rijnmond gebied. De Maeslantkering en andere stormvloedkeringen zullen vaker moeten sluiten. Ook zullen de rivierafvoeren vaker extreme waardes aannemen. De kans dat een stormvloed samenvalt met een extreem hoge rivierafvoer neemt daarom toe. In het geval van een dergelijke combinatie, kan het rivierwater niet afgevoerd worden naar de Noordzee en ontstaan er problemen voor het Rijnmond gebied. In het deltarapport van de Deltacommissie 2008 wordt een ‘Afsluitbaar Open’ Rijnmond geadviseerd. Deze oplossing houdt in dat ten tijde van een combinatie van stormvloed en extreme rivierafvoer, vier nieuw te bouwen keringen het Rijnmond gebied afsluiten en de rivierafvoer leiden naar het Hollands Diep, de Haringvliet en de grote Zeeuwse wateren. In deze wateren zal het rivierwater tijdelijk geborgen worden en als de stormvloed is gaan liggen zal het rivierwater gespuid worden op de Noordzee. Het doel van dit afstudeerrapport is om een duurzaam en innovatief ontwerp te maken voor de kering in de Beneden-Merwede, de Merwedekering. Om dit ontwerp te maken wordt eerst het huidige systeem onderzocht. Er wordt gekeken naar de ontwikkeling van het watersysteem, de huidige keringen, de stromingen in het gebied en de dijkringen met de betreffende normfrequenties. Ook wordt het ‘Afsluitbaar Open’ Rijnmond plan onderzocht en worden de daaruit volgende randvoorwaarden voor de Merwedekering bepaald. Vervolgens is er naar een geschikt type kering gezocht. In totaal zijn elf mogelijke keringen onderzocht en beoordeeld. Door deze keringen te beoordelen op diverse criteria en te kijken naar de kosten, kan de beste kering bepaald worden. Voor de Merwedekering blijkt dat een sectordeurkering het meest geschikt zijn. Wegens een persoonlijke voorkeur is er echter verder gewerkt met een hydraulische kleppenkering. Er wordt voor gekozen om de kleppen uit te voeren in hogesterktebeton. Hogesterktebeton heeft minder onderhoud nodig dan staal en kost op lifecyclebasis een stuk minder. Tevens zijn er door de hogere sterkte van het beton slanke kleppen mogelijk. In het ontwerp van de kering zijn er veel variabelen, onder andere de diepte van de fundering, de aangrijppunten van de cilinders, het aantal cilinders, de manier van inspectie en de bouwmethode. In het uiteindelijke ontwerp is er gekozen om de cilinders aan te laten grijpen op 6,6m van de onderkant van de klep. In dat geval is het moment in de klep relatief klein en treden er relatief kleine trekkrachten op in de kleppen. Er wordt gekozen om twee cilinders per klep toe te passen. Om de kleppen en de cilinders te kunnen inspecteren worden onder de kleppen compartimenten gemaakt die zijn te bereiken via een tunnel die door de fundering loopt. In de ruststand dienen de kleppen als deksels op de compartimenten. De toegangstunnel kan gecombineerd worden met een fiets- en voetgangerstunnel. Door de kering in twee grote delen prefab te bouwen, kan de kwaliteit van het beton gegarandeerd worden, is er minimale hinder voor de scheepvaart en is er geen bouwput nodig. Bij deze bouwmethode worden de twee delen over het water vervoerd en ter plaatse afgezonken. Door de klep voor te spannen is het mogelijk de klep slank uit te voeren zodat het gewicht van de klep beperkt blijft. Tevens is gebleken dat de optredende trillingen in de klep geen problemen veroorzaken. De totale bouwkosten van de Merwedekering zijn 209 miljoen euro met een afwijking van 30%. Het gepresenteerde ontwerp is een duurzaam ontwerp met betrekking tot de levensduur, de milieuvriendelijkheid, het lagere onderhoud en de slijtage. Tevens is het een innovatief ontwerp met betrekking tot de prefab bouwwijze, de mogelijkheid tot eenvoudige inspectie onder water, de materiaalkeuze en de synergie met andere functies.","Merwedekering; Afsluitbaar Open Rijnmond; Hogesterktebeton; Kleppenkering","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2010","In 2000 the Dutch government chose a new point of view for the Dutch rivers: “Room for the River”. This viewpoint is the basis for a new approach of high water protection in the Netherlands. Instead of strengthening and raising the dikes, solutions must be based on space and spatial quality. One of the suggested measures is the addition of secondary channels. The purpose of these channels is enlarging the conveyance area and the ecological role of the river. Maintaining the profile of these channels involves substantial financial consequences. Finding a sustainable solution for undesired erosion or sedimentation is the main focus of this study. The research question is stated as follows: “How can the undesired erosion or sedimentation in secondary channels be corrected with a temporary but sustainable solution in the form of surface screens?”. The main part of this study is an experimental study on the effects of surface screens on a mobile bed. The design of the physical experiments requires choices about the geometry of the flume. The experiments were carried out with a straight flume and with a dividing wall. Preparing the experiments requires information about the flume facility. The experiments have been carried out in the Environmental Fluid Mechanics Laboratory of DUT. The upstream boundary conditions are discharge and velocity distribution. The downstream boundary condition consisted of a fixed water level. The water level was kept constant along the natural slope of the surface. The experiments consist of taking velocity and bed level. The angle of attack and the penetration depth were chosen to be variable. The angle of attack was varied between 15 and 25 degrees. With these relatively small angles the screen acts as guidance for the flow, instead of an obstruction. The penetration depth was varied between 20% and 60% of the water column. The initial test run determined the optimal measurement duration and the initial equilibrium. Four representative cases have been described in detail, giving support to the general conclusions. The flow pattern changes under influence of the surface screen. The main flow direction is guided by the screen, introducing a transverse velocity at the surface. As flow continuity in the flume has to be maintained, the water near the bottom is forced to have a transverse velocity in opposite direction. Redistribution of the suspended transport and the bottom transport was induced. This generated locations were the actual transport did not meet the transport capacity, which gives rise to morphological changes. Next to the spiral motion the screen had an effect on the longitudinal flow velocities. The attacked side of the flume experiences a higher velocity, thereby having a higher transport capacity. This higher capacity gives rise to local erosion of the bed. At the unattacked side, sedimentation occurs, thereby rising the bed level. In the B-series of the experiment a dividing wall was added. The screen in front of the bifurcation gave rise to the same two processes, but the wall introduced an extra effect. The screen influenced the bifurcation relationship. The bed level adapted to the new conditions. The upstream effect of the bifurcation is explained by changes in water level topography, thereby influencing the backwater curve. In general the wall amplified the morphological development of the bed. Finally some suggestions have been made for the practical application of surface screens. In general the screens can be applied in a (secondary) channel or in front of a bifurcation. The use of a screen inside a channel has an advantage not to interfere with the navigation channel. The advantage of a screen in front of a bifurcation is influencing two channels simultaneously. One of the main disadvantages of the latter is the possibility of disturbing the delicate bifurcation relationship. When carefully implemented this effect can simultaneously be the main advantage of this screen layout, as the morphological response increases.","surface screen; surface screens; morphology; river training; spiral flow; river engineering; river morphology; experimental research; morphological response; sediment management; secondary channel; river maintenance; bifurcation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Rudolph, E.S.J. (mentor); Van Muijen, H. (mentor); Vercruijsse, P.M. (mentor)","2010","Natural gas is an important energy source. Recently the world-wide consumption is rapidly increasing due to the growing demand caused by industrial growth and also by shifting to cleaner energy source driven environmental concerns. To satisfy demand also in the future, it is necessary to look for alternatives sources of supply of energy. An alternative could be the gas production from Natural Gas Hydrates (NGH), which are ice-like crystalline compounds that form from water and gas at low temperature and high pressure. NGH are found in subsurface either near the surface in arctic regions or in deep water marine environments. The estimated volume of NGH with respect to energy contains twice the amount of currently recoverable world-wide fossil fuels. IHC Merwede (IHC) is interested in the potential of deep sea mining of NGH. This defines the research question: “Is deep sea mining of gas hydrates from the sea floor and sediments feasible from a technological and economic perspective?” An extensive review of literature on NGH-deposits shows that they exist globally but occur predominantly around the edge of the continents in marginal marine basins and some in permafrost regions. The occurrence of hydrates depends on the temperature, pressure and the kind of gas. Depressurization, thermal- and chemical stimulation are three possible dissociation mechanisms for the production of hydrocarbon gases from NGH. For further research the Atwater Valley in the Gulf of Mexico was chosen based on the high potential and available information about this site. This research was necessary to verify the technological and economic perspective of mining marine natural gas hydrates. The main conclusions concerning the technological perspective were identified: Deep sea mining of gas hydrate bearing sediments (GHBS) is possible from a technological point of view. However, for a reliable feasibility study on potential mining operations of GHBS more research into geological data needs to be done. Nevertheless, this study shows that existing know-how and equipment for deep-sea mining could be used to excavate GHBS. Thereby, future investigations should focus on the intermediate transport of the excavated sediment to a separation unit. Even though several technologies are available to remove liquids and solids from gases there are no operational plants to process GHBS. Compressed Natural Gas seems to be the best way to transport the gas from the mining site to its market. The main conclusions concerning the economic perspective were identified as: The project’s economic viability of the base case is negative. A sensitivity analysis (a relative change of +/- 30% on the input variables) shows that the economic viability remains always negative. This is mainly caused by the high operating- and capital expenditures. Especially the CAPEX on the initial phase of the operation is high. The revenues are not high enough to offset these expenses. To make the mining economically attractive, the required gas price has to be almost ten times the current gas price of 4.2 US$/mmBtu. Nevertheless this thesis provides insight into the various aspects of the recovery of natural gas from GHBS operated from a vessel. Based on the conclusions of this research it is recommended to: Do detailed research into: geotechnical properties of GHBS such as compressive-, tensile- and cohesive strength; the behaviour of NGH during extraction and vertical transportation; the environmental impact of physical mining of marine gas hydrates; the processing of GHBS; the producable reserves from NGH-deposits; and technological innovations to lower OPEX and CAPEX. The developed cash flow model for NGH-operations allows evaluating the financial parameters. Further research and development is recommended to optimise the model for other deep sea mining operations.","hydrates; deep sea mining; natural gas; feasibility study","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-06-03","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Resources Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2010","New Profile for the Amsterdam-Rhinecanal The aim of this thesis is to design a new profile for the Amsterdam-Rhine canal. The new profile needs to be well navigable and requires to have stable bank constructions. Simultaneously several social aspects have to be taken into consideration. The assignment is summarized as follows: Design a new profile of the Amsterdam-Rhine canal with a stable bank protection that takes future developments, durability and recreation into consideration. The history of the Amsterdam-Rhine canal shows that the draft of the vessels that use this canal has increased from 3.30 to 4.00 meters. This four-metre draft has been permitted since 1988 and was based on the dimensions of the push tow units. In the late 90s of the past century, a new generation of inland vessels made its appearance. Around 2002 problems to the bank constructions due to erosion were detected for the first time, possibly caused by the new generation inland vessels. The number of bigger inland vessels, particularly those in the VIa category has strongly increased over the past years together with the engine power and cargo capacity of many vessels (increase in scale). A representative canal section of the Amsterdam-Rhine canal, just north of Breukelen, has been chosen as research site. At this location erosion ranges from 0.20 to 1.70 meters within 15 meters distance of the sheet piles. The possible cause of this erosion has been further investigated in this report. Also research has been done to determine the governing hydraulic load, which is generated by governing vessels overtaking another vessel. The governing situation is defined as follows: a Rijnmaxship (135x17x4.00 m) overtaking a four barge push-towing vessel (198x22.8x4.00 m). In this situation, the return current is governing compared to a situation when loads from the main and bow thrusters are considered. The return current has been calculated with the 1D model DIPRO. DIPRO has also been used to validate the 2D model in Delft3D, to further elaborate the return current in the 2D model. The 2D model in Delft3D has been used to determine the maximum return currents around the two governing vessels. These values have been translated to the bottom of the canal by calculating the erosion. From these results can be concluded that canal profile (2) has twice the amount of erosion compared to canal profile (3). In this report canal profile (3) is recommended as the new normative canal profile for the Amsterdam-Rhine canal. Canal profile (3) is a combination of a box profile with a sloped upper bank and bottom, with in the middle a waterdepth of 7.60 meter. The depth in front of the sheet pile is 6.00 meter. The wet cross section is 751 m2. The bank construction consists of a sheet pile with a slope. The outcome of this thesis is a design for a new representative canal profile in the Amsterdam-Rhine canal. The normative hydraulic load (return current) causes minimum erosion to the canal bottom, which keeps the bank construction stable. Next to this the design proves that environmental and recreational purposes can be well combined in coherence with social developments.","Amsterdam-Rijnkanaal; Hydraulische belastingen; Retourstroom; Schroefstraal; Binnenvaart; Inland navigation; kanaalprofiel; erosie","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Havens en scheepvaartwegen","",""

(mentor)","2010","Happiness is often considered a universal goal of people. In the relatively new field of positive psychology, many studies have been conducted to understand the concept of happiness and its broader counterpart; subjective well-being, leading to a collection of theories that explain their determinants. It has been shown that although there are genetic influences on subjective well-being (SWB), people are not necessarily ‘born’ happy, but can and do change their levels of SWB. On the basis of these theories researchers have introduced and validated a variety of strategies to increase SWB. Although widely available in literature and validated to be useful, not many people seem to pick up on SWB strategies by implementing them into their daily lives. Comprehension is one thing; action is another. Here lies an opportunity for design, and the main design question of this graduation project is therefore: “Can strategies for subjective well-being be translated into or supported by tangible designs that inspire and persuade people to adopt these strategies into their daily lives?” To answer this question, SWB was studied in theory and practice, problems and opportunities for product design were identified, and these insights were translated into an interaction vision. The product should give hope, inspire and reassure the user that it’s OK to try new things (Active experimentation.) The product should allow the user to take some time for contemplation (Reflective observation.) After a diverging and converging stage of ideation, a set of concepts was designed that explored the interaction vision. Theory from behavioral psychology was used to design their persuasive qualities. These concepts were compared to and evaluated with existing companies that produce similar products. One concept was chosen, and further developed into a final design proposal: a system named Tinytask. Tinytask is a system that offers users new experiences. Users subscribe to Tinytask and receive key chains that contain small and concrete assignments related to SWB strategies. Users commit to the assignments and use the key chains as a reminder. They add and confirm assignments to their profile page on www.tinytask.nl, where they can also add comments to reflect on their experiences. Tinytask should inspire and persuade people to break with routine and have new experiences related to SWB strategies, by making a habit of active experimentation and reflective observation. A prototype was built and was tested by fifteen participants over the course of three weeks. Various strengths, weaknesses and recommendations were found as a result of this user test. Tinytask was successful in persuading participants to break with routine. The system inspired and triggered active experimentation. Due to limited functionality of the website prototype, participants could not reflect on their experiences online. However, conversations with others – in some cases elicited by the key chains – caused participants to contemplate their actions. Concluding, Tinytask has inspired and persuaded people to adopt strategies for subjective well-being into their daily lives, which answers the design question. Although the design is still premature, it is a case study that explores the possibilities of design for subjective well-being. There are many opportunities for design within this direction. Even though there is a large gap between abstract theories and concrete products, this study has shown that theory from behavioral psychology can successfully be used to make that translation.","design; subjective; well-being; behavior; persuasion; happiness","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor); Zlatanova, S. (mentor); Van Elzakker, C.P.J.M. (mentor)","2010","Web based multimodal travel planners are able to generate adequate travel advises for the public transport using timetable information. These travel advises are nowadays lacking detailed pedestrian route advises for the walking parts of a journey. This research focuses on developing a 3D geo data model to support pedestrian route finding for access, change and egress public transport in multimodal travel advises. The research studies the suitability of Oracle spatial 11g to find walk routes in such geo data models. It focus on geo data models to support finding an optimal route for the individual public transport traveller taking into account his specific preferences and constrains (e.g. wheelchair) for the pedestrian part of the journey in a travel advise. Travel time and time pressure, physical effort safety and conform personnel characteristics and vicinity are seen as important aspects of an optimal route. A literature study is done on existing standards and models to investigate approaches to develop such a 3D geo data model. Based on this literature study a new conceptual geo data model is developed to support pedestrian routing in multimodal travel advises. It uses, similar as in a navigable space model (Slingsby, Raper 2008) a model representing 3D spaces only by their lower surfaces. A Stop Place Model (IFOPT 2007) is taken for it semantics describing and indentifying these spaces relevant for pedestrian routing related to public transport. To persist the geometrical aspects of these lower surfaces in a spatial database the geo data model uses simple feature (OGC 1999) surfaces. The model supports modelling of multiple layered floors and traffic areas which can be seen by a traveller on which “walking around” is possible. It also supports virtual surfaces “hidden paths” with are predefined logic connecting route areas on these floors and traffic areas. As in existing models (Lee 2004) (Stevens, Choi 2006) adjacency and connectivity of spaces are modelled with networks. The developed pedestrian model is new because attributes and behaviour of networks and surfaces are integrated. Important in this geo data model is that no difference is made between in modelling indoor and outdoor spaces. The lower surfaces representing spaces are modelled as objects inherit attributes and behaviour from nodes in a network and therefore called NodeSurfaces. Every NodeSurface is seen as possible connection for a route choice for an optimal pedestrian route. These possible pedestrian connections are modelled by combining connecting NodeSurfaces and using simple feature multiSurface to model it geometrical aspects. In this geo data model these multi surfaces are describing the potential pedestrian connections with attributes and behaviour from links in networks. Important characteristics of this multiSurface (“LinkSurfaces”) are the direction (including up/down in 3D), the accessibility and pedestrian duration for a specific traveller. A prototype implementing this new geo data model in Oracle 11g was developed. To illustrate and evaluate the new model surfaces relevant in a simple bus stop and a multimodal transport interchange where drawn in Google SketchUp and exported to KML files. These 3D surfaces where used as dataset for optimal route finding in the prototype. This research evaluates this prototype to evaluate the feasibility and suitability of the new geo data model. This prototype was also used to evaluate in suitability of Oracle spatial 11g to find walk routes in such pedestrian models. The results of the conceptual model are promising especially when modelling hidden paths. It was possible to implement the geo data model in Oracle 11g. Oracle 11g network shortest route capabilities for logical network turned out to be suitable for finding the optimal route for individual travellers with specific speed and accessibility properties. Due to the limitation that Oracle 11G does not support 3D distance calculation in geographic 3D all distances in pedestrian speed calculation were done on the geodetic surface. Optimal pedestrian routes where exported to KML files and visualisation was done with Google earth. Limitations were found for visualisation of surfaces below ground level (underpasses). The concepts of LinkSurfaces used to represent 3D pedestrian spaces in the proposed geo data models worked well in the prototype. This concept combing characteristics from links in a network and characteristic from OGC simple feature multi surfaces, is a simple, effective and well structured way to represent complex 3D spaces used by pedestrian routes in a geo data model.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","OTB Research Institute for the Built Environment","GIS technology","","GIMA","",""

(mentor); Quak, B. (mentor)","2010","Large rotating machines in all kinds of applications ages due to operating stresses. Since many years the condition of stator insulation in these motors and generators is investigated using measurement of partial discharge (PD) and dielectric loss factor (tan delta). In particular, off-line and on-line methods of applying PD detection have become common practice. The off-line PD detection technique is based on applying to single phases of the stator insulation an external 50(60) Hz power supply and detecting the partial discharges which inevitably occur in stator insulation. Based on the PD behaviour, the presence and type of discharging defects in the insulation, like slot discharges and end-winding discharges can be identified and evaluated for insulation condition assessment purposes. In contrast to on-line detection, with regard to interpretation rules for off-line PD detection there exist a large amount of experience. Off-line energiz-ing of the stator insulation can also be performed using Damped AC voltages 50-500 Hz (DAC), which has the advantage the test equipment is more mobile than AC test sets. This study describes the measurement technique of off-line PD and dielectric loss detection on stator insulation using damped AC. A test procedure for DAC is proposed based on the applicable AC standards, and results of DAC PD and dielectric loss measurement are presented. Based on laboratory investigation on a full scale stator insulation system as well as during field inspections on large motors, a comparison has been made of dielectric loss behaviour and PD behaviour – like tan delta levels, PD levels and phase resolved PD patterns – at 50 Hz AC stresses and at oscillating voltages. The usefulness of PD detection at oscillating voltage waves, and the usage of AC interpretation rules, has been discussed.","damped AC; DAC; test procedure; data processing; partial discharges; dielectric losses; rotating machines; stator insulation; condition monitoring; tan delta","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-06-01","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Electrical Sustainable Energy","","High Voltage Technology and Management group","",""

This means that the design is becoming interest based, with a direct participation of stakeholders. In order to achieve a balanced design where no interest has become too dominant the SPD has to evaluate the interests and weigh them. This leads to the SPD becoming a mediator among the stakeholders in the process of urban development. The problem with this development is that the SPD is not trained to operate as a mediator which is why this research focuses on the development of a Mediation Strategy which provides the SPD with a theoretical background as well as a practice based methodology to function as a mediator.","future roles of planners and designers; mediation; communicative action; collaborative interests based design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture","Urbanism","","Spatial Planning and Design","",""

The port is located at the mouth of the river Itajai-Acu, about 3 km inland. The Port of Itajai is very important for both the local and national economy because of its role in foreign trade, and due to this prominent role in the community many stakeholders are involved. To allow larger vessels into the harbour of Itajai there has been a constant process of deepening the approach channel and the harbour basin. In order to compete sedimentation process in the harbour basin will change. From a commercial point of view it is very interesting to search for other solutions to keep the river at the required depth besides dredging. There are four main principal solutions to reduce the sedimentation of the harbour basin: reduce the sediment production, reduce the transport capacity of the river, increase the flow velocity and redirect the sediment. All these possibilities have a positive effect on the sedimentation in the harbour. Reducing the transport capacity of the river with the use of a sand trap is expected to have the most effect. with surrounding harbours it is important to allow safe navigation of larger vessels as this results in greater cargo handling at lower cost. Due to recent developments the Port of Itajai is investigating the possibility to receive vessels with a length of 300 m overall, 45 m beam and 14 m draught. The Port of Itajai is facing two different kinds of problems, one concerning the alignment and the other concerning sedimentation. In order to deal with the problems the current situation was mapped. The river, sea and harbour characteristics are given; river discharges, flood events, harbour development, harbour lay out, tide, wind and wave direction. At this moment the approach channel of the harbour deals with some imperfections, which makes it difficult, sometimes even impossible, for the design vessel to sail through the channel. Also the current turning circle is a problem as turning of the new design vessel will be extremely difficult and the safety is questionable. With a cost benefit analysis the best possible location for a larger turning basin is determined and a number of changes for the alignment are given. Without human interventions the estuarine system would be in a dynamic equilibrium. The bathymetry would adjust to varying conditions and oscillate around this dynamic equilibrium depth. This is the depth for which the average annual sedimentation is zero. When the natural dynamic equilibrium is disturbed as a result of deepening the estuary, the system will try to restore itself. This causes sedimentation and maintenance dredging is required to maintain the newly dredged areas. The volume of the required maintenance dredging depends on the extent of the disturbance in relation to the equilibrium situation. A larger deepening will lead to smaller flow velocities and therefore to higher sedimentation rates. The sedimentation that occurs in the Itajai Acu estuary is a complex ensemble of processes, which is influenced by processes at the boundary conditions. The two most important processes are the tidal fluctuations and river discharge. To gain insight in the wet system, hand calculations and a 1D-computer model were made. The effect of a number of human interventions on the Itajai-Acu river are determined with hand calculations. With the 1D-modelling software, SOBEK, the effects of the planned dredging are determined.","port development; river model; scour; quay wall","en","student report","TU Delft - Section Hydraulic Engineering","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""
