(mentor); Guest, S.D. (mentor); Wieringa, P.A. (mentor)","2006","The fields of static balancing and tensegrity structures are combined into statically balanced tensegrity mechanisms. This combination results in a new class of prestressed structures that behave like mechanisms: although member lengths and orientations change, they can be deformed into a wide range of positions, while continuously remaining in equilibrium; in other words, the structures have zero stiffness. The key to these structures is the use of zero-free-length springs as tension members. The tools of structural engineering were used to search for, and understand, zero-stiffness modes in the tangent stiffness matrix of prestressed pin-jointed bar frameworks. To this end the recently uncovered parallels between structural engineering and mathematical rigidity theory were exploited. Mathematical literature described that affine transformations preserve the equilibrium of a tensegrity structure; these findings gained value when translated from a mathematical concept into the engineering terms rigid-body motions, shear and dilation. Not only did these transformations prove to be instrumental for describing zero stiffness, but it also provided new insight in the form-finding methods for tensegrity structures: the minimum nullity requirement for the stress matrix is formed by the affine transformations. In this research it was shown that affine transformations of the structure that preserve the length of conventional members are zero-stiffness modes valid over finite displacements: these are statically balanced zero-stiffness modes. What is more, for prestress stable structures with a positive semi-definite stress matrix of maximal rank -- meaning there are only affine transformations in its nullspace -- those are the only possible zero-stiffness modes. The length-preserving affine transformations exist if and only if the directions of the conventional members lie on a conic at infinity. If all conventional member directions lie on a conic, the number of independent length-preserving affine transformations can then be found with a simple counting rule. A systematic analysis of the zero-stiffness modes in the tangent stiffness matrix of a prestressed pin-jointed bar framework yielded several interesting scenarios that warrant further attention, as they cannot be fully described within the currently developed framework. Finally, a demonstration prototype was designed and constructed to illustrate the properties of statically balanced tensegrity mechanisms; the prototype serves as a proof of concept, not as a practically applicable design. Prior to construction, the range of motion of the tensegrity used for the prototype was extensively analysed using the analytic equilibrium conditions. The results were instrumental in dimensioning the prototype.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Heijligers, M. (mentor); Hulsbergen, E.D. (mentor)","2006","Een moderne stad van de 21e eeuw vraagt om nieuwe bestemmingen voor strategisch gelegen locaties in bestaand stedelijk gebied. Voor een aantal locaties rond de historische binnenstad van Zwolle zijn ruimtelijke veranderingsmogelijkheden, maar nog geen uitgekristalliseerde plannen. Nieuw bij de inbreiding is het 'krans'-denken. De stadskrans is de zone om de binnenstad, deze functioneert als overgang tussen de binnenstad en de omliggende wijken. Daarbij is het uitgangspunt dat de krans als geheel gezien wordt: een kralensnoer dat bestaat uit verschillende kralen met elk hun eigen thema, karakter en verschijningsvorm. De invulling van de gebieden is het resultaat van twee factoren: het huidige/beoogde karakter van het gebied en het schaalniveau waaraan het gebied gekoppeld is. Het karakter heeft alles te maken met het gebruik en de functionaliteit, zoals onderwijs, cultuur en bedrijvigheid e.d. Het schaalniveau is gekoppeld aan het infrastructurele netwerk, zoals de rijksweg A28, het spoor en de regionale wegen. Het centrum blijft het belangrijkste gebied van de stad, maar kan niet groeien door de fysieke barri van de singel. Aan de andere kant van de singel, op steenworp afstand van de binnenstad, liggen gebieden die door middel van herstructurering het centrum kunnen ondersteunen. Deze gebieden kunnen ruimte bieden aan centrumstedelijke woonmilieus nabij de binnenstad mogelijk gecombineerd met representatieve bedrijvigheid, detailhandel, dienstverlening, horeca, leisure, kantoren en (centrum-)parkeervoorzieningen.","stedelijke inbreidig; herstructurering; multifunctioneel ruimtegebruik; Zwolle","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture","","","","",""

(mentor)","2006","The floods of the River Rhine and the River Meuse in 1993 and 1995 pointed out the importance of river intervention works to maintain safety for surrounding inhabitants. To predict the consequences of such engineering measures on river morphology, numerical computer models are used. Due to the high socio-economic value of the Dutch river system and the importance of continuous navigability, possible disturbances in this system have to be carefully analysed. To gain a higher accuracy, the gradation of sediment has recently been implemented in these models. An important factor in river bed morphology is the gravitational influence on the direction of sediment transport e.g. in river bends and on side banks. This influence is modelled using deterministic formulae for uniform sediment. The main objective of this study is to review the applicability to widely graded sediment of the present formulae for transverse slope effects. This is done by comparing the measurements of a laboratory experiment to an analytical model and to the output of numerical simulations. The laboratory research that was conducted at the Fluid Mechanics Laboratory of Delft University of Technology, consisted of four levelling experiments at different flow velocities and with different sediment compositions. Three experiments were done using a tri-modal sediment mixture and one experiment with a uniform mixture. A transversely sloping profile that is derived from the analytical model, was constructed from the sand mixture in a laboratory flume. A uniform flow was then created and the movement of the bed was measured as it slowly levelled towards a cross-sectional horizontal equilibrium. The analytical model is a first order approximation of a small transverse distortion, derived from the continuity and transport equations using the deterministic formula of Talmon for the transverse slope effect. As this model is representing only uniform sediment, a numerical simulation in Delft3D, using graded sediment calculations, is added using the formulae of Koch and Flokstra and of Parker and Andrews for transverse slope effects. When comparing the development of the measured transverse profiles to the models, a good agreement is found for the experiment with uniform sediment, but a constant underestimation of the involved timescales is found for the tri-modal mixture. In order to find a better agreement of the numerical model, the parameters of the Koch and Flokstra formula for transverse slope effect were varied to fit the timescales of the simulations for the tri-modal mixture to that of the experiments. Considering the design and the execution of the levelling experiments it can be concluded from this study that the method used is adequate. Considering the morphological modelling of transverse slope effects it can be concluded that none of the tested formulae for transverse slope effect can accurately predict the transverse deviation of sediment transport within their default parameter range.","graded sediment; river; Rhine; Meuse; transverse profiles","en","master thesis","TU Delft, Civil Engineering and Geosciences, Hydraulic Engineering","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","","","","",""
