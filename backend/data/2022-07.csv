Nevertheless, it is still uncertain how these systems could compromise the users’ physical state and how they should react a posteriori.<br/><br/>This Graduation project begins with the exploration of the bodily injury risks associated with the Ethereal Engine, an ultimate VR-based equipment that seeks a revolution in the fitness industry. Resulting in four different clusters -collision, posture, balance loss and long-term exposure-related risks-, a study on the current market-ready technologies that could minimize these risks is performed together with an assessment on how safety can be boosted while keeping the experience’s engagement.<br/><br/>Thanks to the research, posture evaluation is selected as the challenge with a differential potential over the rest to bring Ethereal Engine to the next level, providing an experience in which bodily injury risks could be reduced, motivating users to adopt better postural habits when working out. Right after, a design vision is formulated, emphasizing the need for inspiring users to self-correct their posture instead of imposing rules in order to avoid possible immersion breakages.<br/><br/>In this context, three concepts are proposed, which present different feedback alternatives that vary in terms of explicitness, immediacy, and strictness. However, a priori there is no clear answer on which of these alternatives could most positively affect the experience. To overcome the knowledge gap an experiment that not only assesses the performance of the 16 participants but also their perception of the understandability, usefulness, performance, posture correction, general engagement, confusion and criticism of the feedback is conducted. During three different experiments where different feedback alternatives are assessed -immediate visual clues, statistics after certain repetitions, and immediate pop-up messages- participants are asked to perform 10 squats while lifting a water jug and receiving different scores depending on its displacement.<br/><br/>In order to do so, a partial prototype that allows for the first time to experience certain functionalities of the Ethereal Engine is developed. These functions are: a) a hybrid MoCap system that merges a Oculus Quest headset with a multi-camera-based skeletal tracking system -named MoCapForAll-. ; b) a calibration process that adjusts the range of motion according to the participant’s height; and, c) a demo game that enables a more intense workout while keeping track of your posture while squatting.<br/><br/>After discussing the results, including a calibration process that enables fair competitiveness and feedback at three different levels to communicate diverse information are spotted as desired features to include in the Ethereal Engine. Through these recommendations a virtual trainer that inspires users to self-correct their posture will be possible, and, subsequently, enabling a bodily injury-free experience.","VR; Virtual Reality; Motion Capture; Virtual trainer; Robotics; Fitness 2.0","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

A four-day workweek is assumed by some to have an improved effect on well-being and reducing emissions, however, the consumption from additional leisure time could counteract the benefits. Therefore, this research looks at the impact of a four-day workweek on well-being and climate change for The Netherlands. Time-use survey data and Environmentally Extended Multi-Regional Input-Output (EE MRIO) consumption data for full-timers are linked to create carbon footprints per activity. Well-being data is added to also see what the effects of a change in time-use on consumption, its emissions, and happiness are. Five leisure time scenarios are picked to predict the consequences of a four-day workweek, with a sixth control scenario, being working one day from home.<br/>The findings of this research are that changing towards a four-day workweek could increase well-being in all investigated scenarios. Household emissions are also increasing for all scenarios, however, if the intermediate emissions for commuting are taken into account, ‘Relaxing’, ‘Media’, and ‘Working from home’ show positive monetary results, while only the latter shows positive environmental results. The higher emitting scenarios of ‘Social contact’, ‘Sports’, and ‘Holiday’ are also intertwined with high costs, making it difficult to pursue continuously with average budgets. Reducing wages could be a consequence of decreasing work hours, which will lead to a decrease in consumption and their emissions already at a few percent. Whether a reduction in work hours is favourable for the competitive position on the global market is up for debate.<br/>A mix of multiple scenarios is likely to be the real-world result, but this research has the potential to aim individuals toward a less costly, higher well-being, and more sustainable mix. Policymakers could use this consumption/time-use matrix to calculate their predicted scenarios to see whether to pursue the four-day workweek. The results of their input can in addition be used to steer society towards higher well-being and fewer emissions by promoting low carbon-intensive activities and demoting high carbon activities, which are usually involved with large travel distances. Lowering wages seems to be the most effective in reducing emissions, however, the effect on well-being of this sanction is not known. ‘Working from home’ is found to have both positive impacts on climate change and well-being.","Four-day workweek; Time-use; Consumption; Well-being; Sustainability","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Industrial Ecology","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution); Wageningen University & Research (degree granting institution)","2022","Dry adhesives can reattach to surfaces due to the reversible bond made by Van der Waals forces. These adhesives can therefore be used as gripping surface that has a high frictional load capacity, independent of the grasping force. In many grippers, the adhesive surface is often pressed into contact with another surface (’substrate’) in an open and closing motion. Since, generally, substrates have non-flat shapes, the adhesive has to be pressed into more directions at once to make full contact. An additional part to the adhesive system is needed here to transform the closing motion to a multi-directional preload on the adhesive surface. To realize this, a passive soft material behind the adhesive is added in this study. <br/>Design objectives for such a material (’backing’) were formulated and different types of bio-inspired backing concepts (solid, sponge, and inflatable) were fabricated. To gain insight in the suitability of these backing concepts with regard to some of the objectives, minimal required preload and minimal residual stresses to avoid detaching forces, two things are measured. Firstly, backing softness was measured as the compression stress-strain characteristic of the backing. Secondly, the preload contact stress distribution of backings was qualitatively measured.<br/>The adhesive was a thin planar adhesive material reinforced with a planar mesh. One sponge backing type and one inflatable backing type were selected as practical backings to fabricate an adhesive system with. An experiment to measure frictional performance was done with these systems whereby backing softness was varied. These cuboid adhesive systems were pressed onto a cylindrical substrate and, after removal of the preload, loaded in the direction of the reinforcement while measuring frictional load capacity and contact area.<br/>For both these two adhesive systems types, experiments showed that an increased backing softness caused an even or greater contact area throughout the whole loading cycle. The linear correlation coefficient, between rest phase contact area and maximum load capacity was 0.96, and at the end of the load phase, between the ’slide’ contact area and ’slide’ load capacity was 0.99.<br/>With an inflatable or sponge backing design it is possible to make a softer backing compared to a solid design made by the same material. Only the sponge backing type distributed the preload relatively even at low and high compression, owing it to its stress plateau in its compression stress-strain characteristic. Although the inflatable has an equal pressure internally and also shows such a plateau, it was found that its contact stress is not even, due to the effect of its outer hull.<br/>Concluding, the addition of a soft backing to help make and keep contact with a general shaped substrate, and thereby increasing load capacity, promises a new design paradigm in synthetic dry adhesives. Furthermore, the results indicates functional relevance of the presence of a relatively large and soft volume between the bones and the adhesive surface of the fingers/toe pads of geckos, tree frogs and humans.","Versatile attachment; Reinforced dry adhesive; Curved substrate; FTIR; Pressure distribution; Contact area; Bio-inspired; Fabrication; Silicone sponge; Inflatable","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | BioMechanical Design","",""

It alters the vision of the patient, hence requiring surgery to be corrected. In some cases, retinal detachment can occur after the retina has been treated for other pathologies. <br/>Indeed, more than 20% of highly myopic patients who have been treated for retinal diseases are subject to retinal detachment a few months after the surgery and are required to undergo a second surgery. It is believed that a membrane, also called Vitreous Cortex Remnants (VCR), that arises due to vitreoschisis,<br/>a retinal disease, is the reason for the re-detachment. VCR is often not dealt with during surgery because its removal is time-costly, the VCR is not well visible and instruments are not optimally adapted for removing VCR. The work aims to develop and experimentally evaluate new methods of removing VCR. For that purpose, a series of test prototypes were manufactured, and three surgeons assessed the efficiency of the prototypes for removing VCR from dissected pig’s eyes. Each eye was treated pre-experimentally according to a new model that tries to recreate vitreoschisis in a young porcine eye. The efficiency of each test prototype was assessed based on the force that the instrument tip exerted on<br/>the pig’s retina, the number of strokes taken to remove the VCR completely, the tissue damage and the time used. Furthermore, the optimal tip length was determined based on the surgeons’ feedback. The results show that the force greatly depended on the stiffness of the instrument tip and that the most efficient prototype consisted of a PVA wipe cut to size 6x1x1 mm and a 0.1 mm diameter Nitinol wire. The prototype exerted a maximum force of 0.68 gr. The number of strokes was around 40, and the optimal tip length was just under 4.5 mm. While the experiments showed that it is a promising design, the tip needs to be remodeled to comply with the low stiffness needed and to be able to fit within a 23 gauge tube.","Retina; Vitreoschisis; Test prototype; Wiping; Eye","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(mentor); Collas, Frank (mentor); Schoor, Margriet (mentor); van Emmerik, Tim (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Plastic pollution and accumulation in the riverine environment is of increasing concern. While most research focuses on microplastic contamination, the dynamics of macrolitter remain largely unknown. Large scale riverbank monitoring initiatives in the Netherlands reveal that macrolitter hotspots occur at several locations. Unfortunately, current knowledge on how these hotspots emerge and how this is influenced by hydrology and meteorology remains limited. As most studies are based on data from seasonal monitoring activities, short term variability remains unknown. This study is the first attempt to monitor and analyse the variability of riverbank macrolitter within a single location for over a period of three months. Behaviour of individual items is tracked and macrolitter exchange between water and riverbank is studied with regards to hydrology and wind. Finally, a conceptual model on riverbank macrolitter dynamics is presented in favour of supporting future research design. <br/>A remote groyne field in the Waal has been monitored 21 times within the period of November 2021 until January 2022. The location of macrolitter items was recorded using Real Time Kinematic positioning. This allowed for analysing spatial patterns throughout time. Additionally, photographs of items were made in order to categorise the items without removing them from the riverbank. The river OSPAR protocol was used for item categorisation.The data shows that macrolitter primarily accumulates in the floodmarks. Rising water pushed items higher on the riverbank. Wind had a limited effect on item mobilisation as most items are wet and sandy. Analysis of item exchange between riverbank and water revealed that macrolitter deposition was observed at a relatively constant rate with minor deviations. Item uptake was heavily dependant on changes in water level. Uptake was initiated when the water level rises (dH &gt; 0). The rate of uptake was higher with a larger water level increase. However, correlation was not statistically significant as riverbank morphology, substrate and vegetation may also influence uptake. After three months and two moderate discharge peaks, almost all items found on day 1 (estimated 99.6%) had been taken up. This indicates that under normal hydrologic conditions, the retention time of items within groyne fields is defined by the timing and magnitude of moderate water level fluctuations (assuming no accumulation under water within the groyne fields).<br/>A conceptual model of riverbank macrolitter dynamics under natural processes is presented. Macrolitter can be stored in three domains: water, sediment and riverbank surface. Exchange within these domains occurs in four directions: in/out of sediment (storage/mobilisation) and in/out of water (uptake/depositions). Exchange is promoted by an interplay between item attributes, environmental processes and riverbank morphology. Future research on the interaction between these variables is needed in order to fully understand macrolitter dynamics.","plastic; macroplastic; waal; river; pollution; riverbank; groyne field; ecology; variability; uptake; deposition; short term","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

It is done in the coastal areas around the globe. Each surf spot has its own wave quality depending on the wave climate and the type of coast. Some spots have year-round perfect waves and other surf spots only work ’when the stars are aligned.’ The search for the perfect spot and conditions makes the sport unique and interesting. On the other hand, it makes the sport exclusive. Only people that are able to access surf spots during the right conditions have the chance to surf. <br/><br/>Wave surfing is becoming an increasingly popular sport. Therefore, the demand for year-round good quality waves increases as well. Since a few decades, the sport has found itself a new opportunity: the wavepool. In a wavepool the surfer rides a man-made wave. These artificial waves can be adjusted to ones preferences, can be generated whenever you want and are independent of natural circumstances. Various types of wavepools exist, each with their own technology. Engineers have the ambition to continuously improve technology and efficiency.<br/><br/>Area X is a water recreation area in the Weerd near Roermond. Area X is planning to construct a wavepool in the lake environment of the Noorderplas. To realize the wavepool, Area X has consulted 24/7Waves. 24/7Waves is a company that is researching, developing and operating scalable wavepool concepts. The project ambition is to create waves for beginner, intermediate and advanced surfers.<br/>The wavemaker should generate 150 waves per hour with a ride of 11 to 15 seconds per wave with a wave height up to 2 meters.<br/><br/>So far, no wavepools exist in open water environments. It is unclear in what way the wavepool system and the lake system will interact. On the one hand, it is unknown what the hydrodynamic and morphodynamic impact will be from the wavepool on the lake system. Wave induced bed bank and shore erosion or deteriorated water quality are for example undesired. On the other hand, it is unknown in what way the natural varying conditions of the lake system will affect the performance of the wave. Water level differences or local generated wind waves may not influence the quality of the generated wave.<br/><br/>The design of the wavepool in the Binkhorst should be adjusted such that it can perform in harmony with the natural lake environment of the Noorderplas. Figure 1.1 gives an impression of the generated wave that propagates along the natural lake banks of the Noorderplas. Lake bed and banks that are subject to frequent wave impact are likely to erode (Duró et al., 2020). The most important element of the wavepool to prevent lake bed and bank erosion is the edge of the reef and the gutter. The reef edge eliminates the wave from the wavepool basin and the gutter facilitates the discharge of the water that is washed over the edge.","Surfing; Artificial waves; Wavepool; Wave Attenuation; Bed, bank and shore erosion","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering | Coastal Engineering","CIE5050-09",""

A popular technique is to vibrate the pile into the sediment. However, since building sites are increasingly being located in metropolitan areas, there is a growing concern about the environmental impact that vibrations may cause during driving. Therefore, pile driving assessment and prediction have become important for several reasons, including reducing the risk of damage to nearby structures and limiting disturbance to adjacent properties. In particular, pile driveability (i.e., the penetration rate) assessment is immensely useful prior to installation as it increases the construction performance and subsequently reduces costs and environmental impact.<br/><br/>The important factors influencing the penetration rate include vibrator characteristics, pile properties, and soil conditions. However, due to assumptions and the lack of methods that accurately represent the complex phenomena at play during vibratory driving, a disparity is obtained between the predictions of modern pile behavior programs and the observed penetration rate. <br/><br/>Recently, the registration of pile driving data has increased significantly. This extended amount of measurement data can potentially be leveraged for an improvement of the prediction of the penetration rate in future projects. Literature review on the application of machine learning (ML) within pile driving, geotechnical engineering and drilling revealed that the artificial neural network (ANN) is a promising alternative method for the prediction of the driveability of vibratory driven piles (i.e., vibro-driveability). <br/><br/>In this work, machine learning methods and the traditional model were utilized to predict vibro-driveability. Promising ML techniques include the multilayer perceptron neural network (MLPNN) and radial basis function neural network (RBFNN). These neural networks were trained with the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. The backpropagation (BP) algorithm was also incorporated to train the MLPNN and RBFNN models as a conventional method. Based on results obtained with the aforementioned methods, we propose a new model, the Vibratory Driveability (VD) model, that combines the fruitful characteristics of the MLPNN and RBFNN.<br/><br/>The performance of the five different models was compared with the performance of contemporary vibro-driveability prediction software for three test sets. This was done using different performance indices including the mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE) and the weighted average percentage error (WAPE). Additionally, the desired characteristics of the predictions based on the geo-engineer's input were examined and compared with the obtained predictions. It was demonstrated that the ANN-based methods achieved drastic improvements in prediction performance and consequently outperformed the traditional model, making ANN-based methods the preferred alternative for the prediction of vibro-driveability. Among the ANN models, the VD model produced the highest performance, as it reflected the desired prediction behavior for all three test cases and showed competitive prediction performance in terms of the performance metrics. <br/><br/>This work leads to the first-ever published research on the application of artificial neural networks for the prediction of vibro-driveability. As such, it could form the foundation for the development of new (vibratory) pile driving behavior assessment and prediction software. The development of these commercial applications could lead to a considerable reduction in costs and environmental impact.","Machine learning; pile driving; deep learning; regression problem","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-07-21","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Vehicle Engineering | Cognitive Robotics","",""

The proposition was investigated on three levels and posed the following research questions: <br/><br/>1.Can 3D printing produce spare parts for the pump at an acceptable cost and quality level compared to the existing manufacturing methods? (Feasibility)<br/>2.Does spare part 3D printing make business sense for the Automotive Aftermarket Division of Bosch to pursue as a remanufacturing strategy? (Viability)<br/>3.Is 3D printing for spare parts more environmentally friendly compared to the existing manufacturing methods? (Sustainability)<br/><br/>To answer these questions for the entire VP30 pump and fuel injection pumps in general would have been difficult. Thus, tools such as the Disassembly Map and the Hotspot Mapping tool were used to identify potential parts within the pump for which this initial investigation could take place. Using functional importance and environmental impact as criteria, the selection of two parts, an aluminium Locking Cover and an alloy steel Cam Plate were made. <br/><br/>Visits to the remanufacturing facility and Bosch’s 3D Competence Centre opened doors to investigate the technology, its limitations, organisational barriers, and future potential. The metal printed parts arrived and were analysed on the three pillars mentioned. <br/><br/>The investigation found that metal 3D printed parts can meet the desired performance specifications. However, post-processing treatment such as annealing, case hardening and some machining might be required for specialised functions. The costs of metal 3D printing are not yet competitive with conventional manufacturing and are viable only for specific scenarios. These scenarios take the shape of lack of suppliers, urgent part demand, high tooling costs, and so on. Moreover, the non-competitive cost also brings to fore the organisational barriers within Bosch. Primarily, the automotive release procedure which requires significant investment of time and money to make a change. Lastly, on the sustainability front, middle volume production (~200-1000 units) was shown to be more sustainable than conventional manufacturing for the same volume. <br/><br/>The investigation shows that in 2022, 3D printing metal spare parts is feasible but needs specific scenarios to be viable and sustainable. However, with improvements in technology and greater acceptance of 3D printing as a core industry technology, these pains can be resolved and allow for better and long-lasting products with lesser environmental impact.

Continuous research to develop improved monitoring techniques is performed to increase the safety and reliability of these structures. However, inspection techniques that can accurately and quantitatively diagnose these damage mechanisms in the submerged steel parts are yet insufficient.<br/><br/>Acoustic emission (AE) monitoring is a non-destructive evaluation technique that can identify structural degradation in solid materials. The technique consists of recording and processing the ultrasonic waves generated by irreversible changes in the material matrix due to damage growth. This research is focused on the global parametric analysis of the primary features of AE signals recorded during corrosion-fatigue experiments performed with submerged steel and non-contact sensors. Three experiments have been analysed to assess which of the AE primary features can most accurately correlate to the fatigue damage evolution.<br/><br/>Signal characterization based on their energy and duration was performed to distinguish three levels of severity. Based on a global parametric analysis the hit-rate and energy-rate have the highest potential and show good correlation to the corrosion-fatigue damage evolution. However, the global features seem to differ notably between different samples and several moments with absence of recorded activity precede final failure. Performing assessment only based on the global features is not considered sufficient. Thus, local analysis methods for AE signals is suggested to extract further information on the source of the emitting damage mechanisms.<br","Acoustic Emission; Corrosion; Fatigue; mooring chains","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-07-28","","","","Offshore Engineering","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are an emerging and promising photovoltaic technology that have demonstrated impressive power conversion efficiencies exceeding 25% after only fourteen years of development. This rapid progress can mostly be attributed to the development and optimisation of PSCs fabricated by solution-based methods, because of their easy processing and inexpensive equipment. However, to commercialise PSCs, alternative methods are required. Among these methods, the vacuum-based technique thermal evaporation is a suitable candidate. In thermal evaporation, solid precursors are evaporated and deposited onto a substrate in a high vacuum chamber. Thermal evaporation is a mature technique in the semiconductor industry to fabricate pinhole-free and highly uniform thin films at a large scale on different types of substrates. To date, the efficiency of PSCs by thermal evaporation is lagging behind their solution-based counterpart, partly due to limited research on vacuum deposited PVK films and several challenges unique to thermal evaporation.<br/>In this MSc thesis project, organic-inorganic metal halide perovskite absorbers based on thermally evaporated FAxCs1-xPb(IyBr1-y)3 and spin-coated MAPbI3 have been developed together with the additional supporting layers for device fabrication. Several PSCs with different p-i-n architectures have been fabricated and characterised. The device comprises of: ITO as front electrode, spiro-TTB, spiro-OMeTAD and/or MoOx as hole transport layer, PVK absorber layer, C60 as electron transport layer, BCP as buffer layer, and silver and aluminium as metallic back electrode. The goal of this work is to develop and optimise the structural and opto-electronic properties of different device layers and demonstrate a working perovskite solar cell.<br/>PVK engineering is carried out on both thermally evaporated and spin-coated PVK thin films with the aim at obtaining perovskite that possesses desirable opto-electronic properties. For FAxCs1-xPb(IyBr1-y )3 fabricated by sequential layer thermal evaporation, the uniformity and tooling factors were optimised to grow layers with a correct precursor ratio showing a high crystallinity and absorptance. No clear effect of post annealing could be detected for the temperatures and times tested in this work. Achieving the target thickness and obtaining a satisfactory reproducibility were not fully reached. For spin-coated MAPbI3, it was found that increasing the precursor solution concentration helped to achieve a desirable thickness for PSCs. Moreover, an adequate bandgap, diffractogram and absorptance were measured. However, based on the small crystal size determined with SEM, and poor device performance, further improvement is needed.<br/>Transport, contact, and buffer layers were successfully fabricated by developing new deposition recipes for silver, BCP, and spiro-TTB. Furthermore, spectrophotometry measurements show that thermally evaporated HTLs (MoOx and spiro-TTB) exhibit much lower parasitical absorption losses compared to spin-coated spiro-OMeTAD. An optical model to fit spectroscopic ellipsometry data measured on spiro-TTB thin films is created to determine its thickness and optical properties. Moreover, time resolved microwave conductivity results indicate that C60 effectively extracts electrons from MAPbI3. In contrast, spiro-TTB films did not appear to possess any hole extracting abilities. Strong quenching of the steady-state PL signal is observed for bi-layers of MAPbI3 with either C60, spiro-OMeTAD and MoOx . This quenching is possibly caused by extraction of either electrons or holes and/or enhanced non-radiative recombination at the interface.<br/>The optimised films were combined in complete PSCs with most layers fabricated by thermal evaporation through metal masks structuring cells with active areas of 0.16 and 0.36 cm2. Solar cells were characterised in the dark and under illumination using a solar simulator integrated with a glove box to prevent degradation. A wide range of J-V characteristics are identified and classified: (1) ohmic responses, possibly caused by poor quality PVK absorber layers with pinholes filled with thermally evaporated metal, (2) S-shaped curves under illumination, possibly caused by a mismatch in energy band alignment or increased non-radiative recombination at the MoOx/MAPbI3 interface, (3) diode behaviour in the dark, and (4) a high series resistance and low shunt resistance, possibly caused by low mobility, non-optimal thicknesses, internal currents, and a mismatches in band alignment. The most promising PSC featuring the ITO (200 nm)/Spiro-OMeTAD/MoOx (5 nm)/MAPbI3/C60 (20 nm)/BCP (4 nm)/Ag (150 nm) architecture, had a short circuit current of 10.0 mA/cm2 and an open circuit voltage of 0.67 V.<br/>The experiments carried out in this MSc thesis project supported the development of several steps of PSC fabrication process. This work contributes towards understanding thermal evaporation processes of perovskite films and fabricating fully evaporated devices with high efficiency and a large area.<br","Perovskite solar cells; Thermal evaporation; Spin-coating; S-shaped J-V curves","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Physics","",""

The introduction of shared mobility is seen as a critical component in facilitating a mobility transition in large cities, as shared mobility can promote multimodal travel behavior, leading to reduced ownership and usage of the private car. <br/>Shared mobility requires charging solutions and parking space within the existing urban fabric. Additionally, it must have digital and physical integration into existing transportation systems. These requirements should be jointly addressed within the concept of shared mobility hubs. Recently, cities have moved from pilot testing standalone hubs to the scaling of city-wide hub networks. Planning the locations of these hubs remains a challenge for cities trying to optimize their distribution. <br/>This research suggests an improved location planning method for shared mobility hubs, combining Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) and Network Analysis. Different prioritizations at the municipal decision-making level can be translated into placement strategies through MCDA. If necessary, multiple stakeholders can also be involved through a Multi-actor Multi-criteria Analysis (MAMCA). The resulting MCDA score for each spatial unit converts a multivariate problem into a single variable location-optimization problem. Utilizing single variable location-optimization tools, such as ArcGIS location allocation, specific location suggestions can be computed along with their respective catchment areas. This also allows a comparison of different placement strategies based on city-wide Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). In turn, decision-makers are enabled to compare different placement strategies in terms of their potential impacts on their objectives. This method holds the potential to accelerate micro-planning processes with defined target scenarios and data-based insights per hub location. <br/>The improved method is developed upon the case study of Munich, considering various location planning objectives. 600 locations composed of 3 hub types are suggested in order to achieve citywide accessibility within 5 minutes of walking time. 1000 locations of an additional hub type are suggested to achieve city-wide accessibility within 3 minutes of walking time.<br","Shared mobility; Shared mobility hubs; Multimodal integration; Intermodal integration; Location planning; Spatial MCDA; Network analysis; Location Optimization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Metropolitan Analysis, Design and Engineering (MADE)","",""

In terms of mobility, many nations around the globe envisage a zero-emission fleet resulting in a massive deployment of Electric Vehicles (EV). Nevertheless, this goes hand-in-hand with some challenges related to congestion and voltage problems in power grids caused by inadequate grid capacity. When grid reinforcement cannot keep up with the increasing demand for electricity, both in terms of planning and excessive financial means, smarter, more efficient solutions should solve the problem.<br/><br/>This thesis aims at providing an optimal strategy for consumers’ flexibility distribution by smartly charging EVs in Low Voltage (LV) grids. In that way, grid reinforcement should be reduced to a minimum. In order to do so, the main contribution of this work is covered by the development of a smart, optimal charging model that tries to comply with grid constraints including voltage and congestion boundaries. Mathematical (near) real-time optimisation is used together with the receding horizon optimisation principle. The work of this thesis relates to a typical urban LV grid in the Netherlands.<br/><br/>First, the required level of grid reinforcement was investigated by means of quantifying the voltage and congestion problems in the LV grid. This was done by applying uncontrolled charging scenarios up to 2050 for both winter and summer. <br/><br/>After investigating the uncontrolled scenarios, the need for an optimal smart charging strategy became apparent. This was developed afterwards. The results showed that in 2050, 94.5% of line congestion and 100% of transformer congestion and voltage problems could be bypassed with smart charging only. This was achieved by implementing grid constraints at the most vulnerable locations in the power grid.<br/>Consequently, the need for grid reinforcement could be almost completely avoided till at least 2050.<br/><br/>Lastly, this work distinguishes itself from others by extensively reflecting on the integration of three concepts: a novel recently developed tariff structure, the effect of bidirectional charging, as well as the necessity for grid constraints. This allows summarising the benefits for all stakeholders including the distribution system operator, the charge point operator and EV owners. The final conclusion can be made that including these three concepts results in one of the most favourable investigated strategies for all three parties together.","Electric vehicles; Smart charging; Receding horizon optimisation; Low voltage grid; V2G; Stacked tariffs; Flexibility assessment; Grid constraints; Grid impact assessment","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-08-28","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

While most state-of-the-art VLP systems work with active modulation of light (switching lights on/off rapidly), this poses issues such as the flickering problem and excessive power consumption. In contrast, passive modulation of light (twisting/bending of light), with the properties of polarizers and birefringent materials, allows cost-effective modulation. This paper analyzes two birefringent materials - plastic (cling-wrap) and transparent adhesive tape - to test them for their usability in a visible light positioning system, in particular, the visibility range, hue-orientation mapping, and ambient light interference. These materials allow to create color patterns visible only to a camera. The patterns can encode data about identifiers of light anchors, while the color detected can be used to find the orientation of the receiver. It was observed that transparent adhesive tape gave much more reliable results, with a step-pattern-like hue-orientation mapping, and low errors ($\pm$ 5) on the hue value detected in the range of 30-250 cm from the light anchor, making it ideal for VLP.","","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science and Engineering","CSE3000 Research Project",""

For our society the material is essential but can be depleted. The search for circular solutions for rubber is urgent. <br/><br/>In 2020 27.4 million metric tons of rubber has been produced globally (Tiseo, 2021). Around 70% of all produced rubber is used to create tyres (About rubber, z.d.). creating one of the biggest single product waste streams in the world.<br/><br/>Rubber granulate is a material made by recycling tyres. Stockz is a company which creates rubber sports flooring solutions for fitness gyms and sport clubs from these rubber granules. Delivering a safe space for athletes, reducing sound and protecting the base floor from the impact of falling weights. The life of the rubber material is extended but still after this 2nd life cycle the product ends like waste. <br/><br/>In this project circular strategies are examined to prolong product and material life as long as possible. The 3 most promising circular strategies, Reusing, Remanufacturing and Recycling were chosen to evaluate on feasibility, viability and desirability. Based on tests to create 2nd cycle granules and rubber sports flooring solutions the feasibility is proven for the recycling strategy. Reusing flooring is also possible. Remanufacturing is based on interesting ideas and therefor is plausible but not proven feasible.<br/><br/>Interviews with clients, end-users and production partners gave valuable information on their view on the strategies. An idea generation session to redesign for remanufacturing gave new ideas how to create a more circular product. Life Cycle Analysis were made for the current situation and the 3 strategies. Resulting in a decrease of CO2 with the use of the strategy reusing by 11%, remanufacturing by 15.5% and with recycling by 17%. <br/><br/>Next to this circular business models were examined which led to 2 different retrieval services for indirect sales clients and a rent/hire business with direct sales clients. Cost calculations were made and discussed with clients and end-users. The viability of the reuse strategy is proven. The viability of the remanufacture strategy is because of the new idea not certain but plausible after some investments.

Despite its prevalence, fidgeting has no consensus cause or effect in existing scientific literature. This graduation project seeks to operationalize fidgeting through and with design to enable affect self-regulation, or the recognition and modification of emotions and mood states. In particular, the Fidget Spheres concept and prototype aim to move users towards a “productive” mood state. Further, we consider the use context as traditional offices and higher education, in situations such as a lecture, conference meeting, quiet desk work, or a video call. Key project outcomes are “constructed” – both a physical prototype and future concept, but also a theoretical landscape of fidgeting.<br/><br/>The project began with a literature review, launching from the topics of “somaesthetics,” emotion, and interaction design. While somaesthetics is not the guiding principle for the final design concept and generated knowledge, it served as a vehicle to introduce many relevant topics, such as embodied interaction, extended cognition, implicit and explicit interaction, affective loops, and mind wandering. Research into these disparate domains, once synthesized, yielded key takeaways that informed concept directions and desired interaction characteristics for later development.<br/><br/>After acquiring a theoretical background, three research activities were conducted to better understand both fidgeting and affect. A three-person introspective experience scanning exercise yielded early insights about the intent of fidgeting. Next, analysis of a short-response survey on stress coping mechanisms revealed common mechanisms and strategies for affect self-regulation. Third, an intensive Reflexive Thematic Analysis (RTA) was conducted on a large public data set of ‘Fidget Widgets’ and use descriptions. These study results, taken alongside the literature review, drive our theory of “Reflexive Focus Bounding” and the embodiment of the Fidget Spheres prototype and concept.<br/><br/>Concept directions were loosely explored before settling on “Fidget Spheres,” a set of handheld spherical fidget objects inspired by Chinese Baoding meditation balls. This simple and adaptable platform allows for future iteration and development of interaction and haptic feedback modes. The prototype was used to embody specific interactions with responsive vibration feedback and was evaluated by six participants in a focus group session. While prototype development was not finished during the project term, rich insights from literature, data analysis, and prototype testing were still sufficient to create the final concept vision for Fidget Spheres. The concept video details the use case, effects, and interaction characteristics for the envisioned and optimized Fidget Spheres.<br/><br/>This graduation project constructs both a fidgeting design space through synthesis of cross-disciplinary knowledge, and an embodied prototype to enable affect regulation through established ‘mindless’ or implicit fidgeting behavior. Future work can conduct more detailed analyses of the perception of varied feedback modalities in-situ, as well as prove (or disprove) the proposed Reflexive Focus Bounding theory. The prototype could be evolved with “personalization” protocols and the implementation of other haptic feedback modes.","Fidgeting; Mind wandering; Haptics; Positive design; Productivity; Embodied interaction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

The main drawback of using a TNKF is the computational speed, which needs to be improved to compete with other existing methods and to be carried out in real-time by a regular computer. This work discusses three methods that reduce the computational load of the algorithm, which speeds up computations. The first method is replacing the existing algorithm with a Block Update TNKF. Secondly, the use of randomized rounding instead of deterministic rounding is investigated. The last method is the simplification of the TNKF update. Results that are presented in this report show that significant speedups of up to +132% can be achieved. In most situations, the considered speedup methods compromise the reconstruction’s accuracy.

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Over time Linked Data collections are continuously subject to change because of numerous reasons. Users could insert new observations, or they could rectify erroneous statements in these knowledge graphs. In order not to lose historically import information, this trend of evolving Linked Data collections increases the need to version these collections. Furthermore, retrieving prior versions and their in-between changes could provide Linked Data users relevant information. However, for some changes to these collections we should record both their transaction time and their valid time. To address these two problems of versioning Linked Data collections and having bi-temporal changes, we introduce the Bi-Temporal Versioning Approach for Knowledge graphs (Bi-VAKs): a prototypical bi-temporal change-based Version Control System for an arbitrary RDF dataset. Bi-VAKs registers both the transaction time and the valid time of a set of modified quads, and therefore, it allows for coupled historical and retrospective SPARQL queries. In addition, in order to enhance collaboration between its users Bi-VAKs also keeps track on provenance data; it supports diverged states; and provide a standard data access interface. However, since the standard RDF data model is atemporal, defining such a set of modifications (update) in RDF poses difficult challenges. Firstly, to indicate this transaction time and the valid time of an update Bi-VAKs divides a revision or version into a transaction revision and a valid revision. And hence it directly separates the metadata from the actual data. Secondly, to denote and retrieve the modified triples/quads within a update Bi-VAKs uses RDF-star and SPARQL-star. In order to connect these revisions we develop three reference strategies: the explicit, the implicit, and the combined reference strategy. These strategies let a transaction revision either refer explicitly to its corresponding valid revision(s) or implicitly by the same revision number and branch index. Based on these strategies we initiate some different approaches to query the updates from the revision-store. And, we propose some different methods to construct a (prior) version. However, to evaluate these different design decision we cannot use the existing uni-temporal benchmarks for our bi-temporal versioning approach. Therefore, we expand the BEAR benchmark to a bi-temporal benchmark (Bi-BEAR). By means of this benchmark we demonstrate that all three reference strategies have about the same storage size. We notice that the usage of a snapshot and retrieval of all updates worsen the version materialisation (VM), delta materialisation (DM), and version (VQ) query performance. In addition, the VM query look up time considerably decreases if only the matching updates are queried. And modified updates, branches, and more updates in the revision-store slightly lower the VM, DM, and VQ query performance. In addition, for the implicit and combined reference strategy the query time is rather the same, and sometimes even better if we sort the updates instead of aggregating them directly. Overall, the implicit reference strategy is performing best, and is quickly followed by the combined reference strategy.","Linked Data; Version Control System; bi-temporal modeling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science | Data Science and Technology","",""

To reach the study's conclusions, primary and secondary quantitative data were collected, analyzed, and integrated into a parametric model developed to assess the ferry's technical feasibility. Moreover, this data were used to perform an economic assessment. Results showed that a 200-passenger, 30- to 40-knot, emission-free ferry is technically feasible and may or may not be economically feasible when implementing a battery-, compressed hydrogen-, or liquid hydrogen energy carrier system, hydrofoils, and all identified weight-saving measures. It was concluded that for these configurations, the 30-knot, battery-powered hydrofoil ferry has the highest likelihood of being both technically and economically feasible.","Zero-emission; Ferry; Ship design; Feasibility; High-speed; Economic assessment; Hydrofoil","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Marine Technology | Ship Design","",""

Due to a growing amount of accessible computational power, neural networks have become a feasible numerical method for approximating solutions to these pricing models. This work concentrates on analysing various neural network architectures on option pricing optimisation problems in a supervised and semi-supervised learning setting. We compare the mean-squared error (MSE) and computational training time of a multilayer perceptron (MLP), highway architecture and a recently developed DGM network (Sirignano et al., 2018) along with slight variations on the Black-Scholes and Heston European call option pricing problem as well as the implied volatility problem. We find that on nearly all the supervised learning problems, the generalised highway architecture outperforms its counterparts in terms of MSE relative to computation time. On the Black-Scholes problem, we noticed a reduction of 9.8% in MSE for the generalised highway network while containing 96.2% fewer parameters compared to the MLP considered in (Liu et al., 2019).<br/><br/>On the semi-supervised learning problem, where we directly optimise the neural network to fit the partial differential equation (PDE) and boundary/initial conditions, we concluded that the network architecture of the DGM allows for optimisation of both the interior condition as well as the non-smooth terminal condition. As this was not the case for the MLP and highway networks, the DGM network turned out to be the best performing network architecture on the semi-supervised learning problems. Additionally, we found indications that on the semi-supervised learning problem the performance of the DGM network remained consistent when increasing the dimensionality of the problem.","option pricing; neural networks; black-scholes; Heston","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this context, a novel sustainable design strategy for the reuse of timber was developed in this Master thesis. The design strategy focuses on the utilization of the material “reclaimed timber” (RT) in the structural system “reciprocal frame” (RF). RT is timber which is harvested from the load bearing structure of dismantled buildings. Large quantities of RT are currently fixed in the building stock. RFs are a family of structures that boast with a rich variety of forms and diverse functions. The utilization of RT in RFs is favorable because RT items which are relatively short can span distances longer than their length when combined with RFs.<br/><br/>To inform the development of the design strategy a literature review on both RT and RFs was conducted. These theoretical studies were supplemented with more practical methods of investigation: RT was inspected first-hand during a visit of a salvage yard that stores RT. Throughout the project physical modeling was used as tool to explore and illustrate the characteristics of RFs. Moreover, during a three-day workshop in which a RF canopy structure from RT was built, important design aspects of RFs were investigated. This first part of the research concluded with describing the state-of-the art of the structural utilization of RT and providing a comprehensive overview of the structural design with RFs.<br/><br/>Key findings of the theoretical and practical studies on both RT and RFs were that the limited stock of available RT items and the geometric complexity of RFs are the two major problems when designing a RF with RT. To solve the two problems a novel RT database configuration that archives the properties of specific RT items was developed. This RT database was applied in conjunction with a novel bottom-up geometry generation model for Rainbow RFs. The Rainbow RF was identified as advantageous for the combination with RT. It can be used to generate expressive spatial assemblies with a relatively low geometric complexity and a high degree of regularity. From a structural perspective the Rainbow RF has the benefit of efficiently transferring axial forces, which reduces the bending action that is typical for RF. Moreover, it achieves flexural rigidity without using expensive moment resistant joints.<br/><br/>The key findings were integrated to form a preliminary design strategy. In a case study the preliminary strategy was used to design a RT RF for a railway station canopy that spans an area of 14.0 m x 27.0 m. The RT stock of the case study was defined by a database that is comprised of 30 stacks of RT items. Based on the material stock 118 geometric design proposals were generated using the bottom-up model. Three of the proposals were developed into safe structural designs. The three safe structural designs demonstrate that the RT items compensate their low strength grade with their relatively large cross-sections.<br/><br/>Based on a discussion of the case study’s design process, a complete design strategy for the structural utilization of RT in RF structures is derived. In the first design phase the shape of the building and the flow of forces through the structure are established. The material stock is defined using the novel RT database configuration. For each RT stack multiple geometric design proposals are developed with the bottom-up model in design phase 3. The bottom-up model is set up in “Grasshopper 3D” and “Python”. For the fourth phase, a versatile algorithm is programmed that automates the structural design to a large degree. This enables to assess many geometric design proposals with considerable accuracy in a short time. The Structural Design concludes with a complete design of the RF structure. The structural design algorithm is also programmed in Grasshopper 3D and Python, the plug-in “Karamba3D” is used for finite-element analyses. The Detail Design rounds the design strategy off by detailing the structure’s joints.<br","Reciprocal Frame; Reclaimed Timber; Design Strategy; Barrel Vault; Parametric Design; Reuse; Sustainable; Building Engineering; Structural Design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Building Engineering - Structural Design","",""

(mentor); Boon, M.M. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","This project is part of the larger REX-CO2 project, which assesses the re-usability of abandoned wells in reservoirs targeted for CCS operations. It comes as a necessity to also assess the abandoned wells that will not be re-purposed, by assessing the risk they pose in terms of allowing the stored CO2 to resurface across them, which is the focus of this work.<br/><br/>In order to assess these wells, a decision making framework was developed that will consider the main mechanisms that can lead to leakage across an abandoned wellbore. The objective is that this framework could be used by an operator of a prospective reservoir for a CCS project, prior to the start of the operations, in order to understand the risk associated with the abandoned wells present, and take decisions for remediation if necessary and possible. This framework considers three main aspects relevant for the formation of leakage paths. These are the effectiveness of the abandonment process itself, the chemical processes that can lead to the degradation of the isolation elements, and the mechanical processes that can lead to loss of integrity.<br/><br/>The framework consists of two main parts. The first is a qualitative analysis, based on a thorough literature review, assessment of experts and testing with case studies. This qualitative assessment consist of decision trees, formed by a series of questions which answers will dictate the final outcome that will reflect the state of the abandonment. The second part is a quantitative risk analysis. For this purpose ""Bayesian Belief Networks"" are used which is a probabilistic tool used for calculating the relative probability of a combination of factors. The BBNs are constructed and populated based on a thorough literature review including data on experimental results. In addition, geomechanical simulations were carried to populate these models. All this data was processed and converted into normal random distribution functions, which were used to infer the probabilities that would be included in the BBNs. The final outcome of the BBNs reflect the probability for leakage to occur.<br/><br/>Both the qualitative and quantitative parts of the framework are integrated together in order to obtain a complete analysis. The complete framework was tested with case studies based on real wells for which the abandonment states are known and reported by the operator, to observe how the outcome of the framework analysis matched the outcomes of the analysis performed by the operator.<br/><br/>With this study, a complete and systematic framework was developed that can be used to aid decision making for prospective CCS projects in the future. The framework is constructed such that it has the capacity to be improved and expanded in the future, to increase its consistency and broaden its applications. A series of potential improvements are also explained at the end of this report. Furthermore, the framework can be used to challenge the current abandonment standards and assess what will have to be changed to adapt the current abandonment techniques so that they include CCS projects.<br","CCS; Risk Analysis; Probabilistic Safety Analysis; Reservoir operations; well technology","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Earth Sciences","Rex-CO2",""

In the literature, deposition of conductive inks on substrates has primarily been researched using inkjet printing or direct ink writing. Despite its advantageous features, airbrushing is seldom used, and when so, it is commonly in combination with stencils or dissolvable structures.<br/>The aim of the research was to combine airbrushing with fused filament fabrication to enable integrated fabrication of functional materials. For this study, a carbon paste was chosen as the active material to be sprayed on 3D printed polylactic acid (PLA) substrates. Beginning with the characterization of an airbrush-compatible acrylic paint, a carbon ink solution was formulated to match the paint viscosity characteristics. This solution was airbrushed on dedicated microporous substrates for characterization, using different positions of the airbrush needle and varying spray distance. In parallel, simulation of the multi-phase airbrushing process was approached using separate air and liquid COMSOL models. Based on the characterization results, the second phase was to study the deposition of carbon ink on 3D printed PLA. Following deposition challenges with the ink, improvement of the PLA surface characteristics using acetone was investigated. While contact angle measurements indicate no wetting improvement, experimental sprays demonstrated an improved deposition. This research has shown the possibility to airbrush conductive lines down to millimeter resolution on dedicated substrates and the possibility of combining airbrushing with acetone-treated 3D printed PLA substrates to realize initial multi-material prints. Although the resistance of the sprayed lines on the prints is between the high kΩ and low MΩ range, it shows potential for further research.","Manufacturing; Fused filament fabrication; Airbrush","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-07-26","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Mechatronic System Design (MSD)","",""

(mentor); Gielen, M.A. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","In Turkey, roughly 3000 children and adolescents are diagnosed with cancer every year (Kebudi, 2012). Although there are different types of pediatric cancers, their trajectory is similar and filled with various physical and psychosocial challenges for the patients and their families. Moreover, cancer usually causes a drastic life change for the whole family. To adjust to the changes and cope better with the challenges, it is crucial that children understand cancer, its course, and the treatment (Eiser &amp; Havermans, 1992; Scott, Prictor &amp; Watt, 2003 as cited in Mant et al., 2018). However, in Turkey, parents often avoid sharing cancer-related information with their children, which hinders children’s understanding, adjustment, and coping (Dr. N. Yıldız Silahlı (MD), personal communication, 2022). Therefore, this thesis aims to improve children’s understanding, adjustment, and coping by nudging parents into changing their attitudes and encouraging children to express themselves. To do so, the project utilises the power of play.<br/><br/>The project starts by exploring the context of pediatric cancers, the factors that affect children’s understanding, adjustment, and coping, and the strategies to utilise play in the pediatric cancer context through a literature review. Then, the project analyses families’ current experiences, needs and wishes, and the barriers and opportunities in the context through generative interviews with the families and interviews with healthcare professionals, which reveal the reasons behind parents’ attitudes and another key problem: limited emotional sharing between children and parents. Based on the interview results, the project visualises the users’ experiences, needs, and challenges through personas and a user journey map, which shows the need of focusing on the hospitalisation stage.<br/><br/>In the light of new findings, the project analyses and reframes the initial design problem and envisions the solution space by defining the design goal, vision and requirements. After generating various solutions that fit within the envisioned space through ideation and conceptualisation, the project introduces the final design: AstroMission, a space-themed role-playing game that aims to facilitate the emotional connection between children and parents. <br/><br/>AstroMission consists of several elements with different functions:<br/>1. Storyline: It is a metaphorical representation of cancer, treatments, and psychosocial challenges. Parents can use this storyline to give children cancer-related information.<br/>2. Missions: They are play opportunities that require the collaboration of children and parents. Their content nudges families into talking about cancer and sharing their emotions with each other in a fun way. <br/>3. Emotion puppets: They are a set of toys that represent four basic emotions of joy, anger, sadness, and fear. They help children to express their feelings. Also, some missions require the family to play with them.<br/>4. Hospital room decorations and objects: They reframe the hospital room into a less scary, even fun environment for children. Also, some missions require the family use the objects in the room.<br/>5. Mobile app: It presents the missions and the story of the game to the family. Also, it has a social function of connecting the families going through the same experience. <br/><br/>Due to the project duration, the project iterates on and validates only the first three elements of the game with the users. However, user evaluations show that AstroMission is desirable and holds great potential to facilitate cancer-related conversations and emotional sharing between parents and children throughout the cancer trajectory. <br/><br/>Lastly, the project shows how to put AstroMission into practice by proposing a material and production method and estimating implementation costs. Also, the project presents the recommendations for further development of AstroMission. <br/><br/>To conclude, the outcome of this project creates value for the users by improving children’s understanding, adjustment, and coping, and alleviating parents’ psycho-emotional burden. It also creates value for the hospitals by improving the user experience.","cancer; children; play; parent-child interaction; emotional connection; hospital; reframing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

(graduation committee); van de Ridder, Jelle (mentor); van Engeland, Martijn (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","The probabilistic damage stability method offers great design freedom when used as a base of design. However, due to the complexity of the calculation and amount of parameters that influence the attained index, much of this freedom is not being harnessed by designers. This research tries to give the designer more insight in where to look when trying to comply with the regulations, by providing an initial subdivision design and create an overview of the influence of the parameters on the attained index. Many parameters have been found that either direct or indirect influence the damage stability calculation. A selection of parameters is chosen from this list as a starting point that are commonly used in the subdivision of large single hold vessels. A parameterised base ship has been made in the DELFTship program that is used for the execution of the optimisation and sensitivity analysis. The exploration for a suitable optimisation method and sensitivity analysis is based on the properties of these methods and method requirements that apply to this specific research. The most important requirement for both methods is the number of iterations needed to obtain a reasonable result, as the damage stability calculation can take up to 15 minutes. This resulted in the choice for the SACOBRA optimisation algorithm. To guarantee the effectiveness of the design, a second level to the optimisation is added where, the number of bulkheads is optimised, while simultaneously optimising the steel weight. During the research, the cargo hold volume was added as this proved to be an effective objective to ensure the efficiency of the design. This resulted in the change to the SAMO-COBRA algorithm, where the single objective SACOBRA algorithm was still used as a verification method and to investigate if it could be used for experimenting with certain design choices. For the sensitivity analysis the Morris method was chosen, mainly for its low number of sample points needed to converge. This method can be applied to a broad range of models and is characterised by its simplicity. However, this simplicity resulted in a relatively low amount of insight generated regarding the influence of the parameters on both the objectives as well as each other. A correlation matrix was added to further provide knowledge and insight. A sensitivity analysis by hand was performed to verify the results of both analysis methods.<br/><br/>The first optimisation stage showed to be a relatively fast way to determine the amount of bulkheads compared to the attained index that can be expected. However, a relatively large margin of error is observed in this stage and more information is needed to be able to make a decision on how many bulkheads is used to further optimise. The use of the SAMO-COBRA method in the second optimisation stage proved to be effective at providing the naval architect with a range of design proposals, where the probabilistic damage stability regulations were used as a base of design. Furthermore, it is shown that for single hold ships in general, the priority of the algorithm followed the influence of the parameters on the distance they were able to create between the cargo hold and the outer hull. The influence of the parameters, resulting from the sensitivity analyses endorse these claims. The Morris method showed the high non-linear and non-monotonic behaviour of the parameters that were investigated. This made it difficult to distinguish the level of influence between the parameters. The combination of the Morris method, Pearson correlation matrix and the sensitivity by hand proved to be sufficient for determining the behaviour of the probabilistic damage stability calculation. In the end, this research proposes a new foundation of designing a ship with the probabilistic damage stability regulations as a base of design. After the initial design from the two stage optimisation all other design requirements are implemented in the design. If the ship then fails to comply with the regulations, the knowledge and insight from this research can be used to increase the survivability of the ship in order for it to comply again.","Probabilistic Damage Stability; Parametric Modelling; Multi-Objective Constrained Optimisation; Global Sensitivity Analysis; Ship Design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Marine Technology","",""

In the EU-27, the REPowerEU strategy, initiated in March 2022, is pursuing this target even more ambitiously. However, in order to achieve the aforementioned goals, the increasing demand for green hydrogen will cause an increase of the renewable energy needs as early as 2030. In this way, offshore wind can be a solid supplier of the renewable energy for green hydrogen production. However, since nearly 80% of the worldwide wind energy potential is situated in deep waters, floating offshore wind turbines (FOWT) can be used to cover those energy needs. In addition, the literature review showed that when green hydrogen production via FOWT is considered, the most economically and energy efficient layout is the in situ topology, where hydrogen is locally produced on the FOWT. Although FOWT and green hydrogen production via FOWT have been lately examined in literature, a literature gap was found. More specifically, no attention was given on the performance change of a turbine when it is adapted from a bottom fixed (BF) application to a FOWT. Also, the effect of the in situ hydrogen plant to the FOWT performance was not considered. Thus, the aim of this project is to highlight if FOWT for in situ hydrogen production should be aerodynamically redesigned to improve their performance or to tackle possible energy losses. In this direction, several sub-questions should be answered, including the selection of turbine, floater type and site to be investigated, the effect of the floater design on the FOWT performance, the performance change of a turbine due to its adaptation as FOWT and the effect of the added mass of the hydrogen plant on the FOWT performance. Lastly, in case of a proven FOWT performance deterioration, solutions should be provided so as to regain performance.  Aligned with the previous goals, the IEA 15MW reference wind turbine on top on the UMaine Volturn US-S semi-submersible floater is simulated in OpenFAST under steady and turbulent wind fields, according to wind &amp; wave conditions of a typical US East Coast site. In addition, the in situ hydrogen plant is incorporated in the model using a simplified approach. The results suggest that in the whole partial load region, the FOWT experiences power losses due to the static floater pitch angle, which reduces the inflow wind speed seen by the rotor. However, between 9 and 12 m/s, a peak shaving routine is incorporated in the FOWT controller, which results in early power shedding and contributes, together with the static floater pitch, to considerable power losses. Furthermore, the simulations conducted using the OpenFAST FOWT model, which incorporated the hydrogen plant, suggest that it has a negligible effect on the FOWT performance and can be omitted from the model.  Finally, the comparison of the FOWT and of the BF turbine under turbulence, highlights the fact that the FOWT exhibits a spanwise aerodynamic torque reduction and a spanwise airfoil aerodynamic inefficiency in terms of angle of attack, that can be solved via an aerodynamic redesign. As a result, a variety of blade twist angle and airfoil chord length profiles are developed, tested and evaluated using the FOWT annual energy production (AEP) as an indicator. The results point out that all solutions result in a slight FOWT AEP gain, compared to the original FOWT design, at the expense of increased rotor loading, which effectively increases the static floater pitch. Thus, the aerodynamic redesign approach requires a more cautious approach.","Floating Wind Turbines; Floating Wind Energy; Hydrogen production; Electrolysis; OpenFAST; Numerical Simulation; Wind turbine design; Semi-submersible; FOWT; Offshore Wind Energy; Wind Turbine Blade; Turbulence; IEA 15-MW RWT; ROSCO controller","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","","42.233549, -68.386712"

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","With the increase in development of self-driving cars, research has been conducted to retain humanized interaction between cars and other road users, such as pedestrians. One way to retain this type of interaction is through the use of external Human-Machine Interfaces (eHMIs). This project aims to contribute to this field of research by exploring the case of eHMI-equipped, self-driving cars yielding for a crossing pedestrian. From literature it is known that light- and text-based signals are both promising ways of utilizing an eHMI. Due to the often simplified nature of these models, the goal of this project was to investigate if their findings hold up when increasing the cognitive load of the pedestrian. An eye-tracking experiment was conducted where two promising eHMI signal types (i.e., flashing lights and message) were tested in a realistic scenario, where the participant took the role of pedestrian. In the experiment, the cognitive load of the participants was varied, by applying different sizes of gaze contingent windows to the stimuli.<br/><br/>A range of 63 different trials of 10s each were shown to 23 participants. This set of trials included 7 different presets, aimed to test the effect of the signal type and the gaze window size independently. The participants' task during the experiment was to indicate when they deemed it safe to cross the road, by pressing the space bar. Their gaze was measured with an eye-tracker, after which it was transformed into three different metrics: saccade count, saccade amplitude and fixation duration. Additionally, a novel metric, the dispersion of the grouped gaze data, was introduced and explored. Finally, a questionnaire was conducted, investigating the self-reported clarity of the different signal types. Together with the reaction time, these metrics aimed to answer the following research question: <i>What influence does raising the cognitive load for crossing pedestrians have on the effectiveness of text-based eHMIs as opposed to light-based eHMIs and no eHMI?</i><br/><br/>The results show that, as has been previously established, light- and text-based signals showed very similar response times and feature similar gaze characteristics when compared to each other. Both outperformed the condition where no signal was shown. Raising the cognitive load shows a decrease in saccade count and saccade amplitude, paired with a higher fixation duration. However, no proof could be found that raising the cognitive load has an influence on the effectiveness on any of the different signal types, meaning that either, the cognitive load was not raised by enough, or there is no actual effect. The dispersion showed that for the light-based signal, the focus on the stopping car is lost the quickest after the signal was shown.<br/><br/>The results of this study may help in explaining how pedestrians base their traffic decision on the type of signals being shown. This may also serve as a basis to further explore the possible effects of cognitive load on the effectiveness of these types of signals.","automated driving; external human-machine interface; gaze contingent window; cognitive load; pedestrian","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

Two non-linear analytical models simulate the situation and investigate the parameters exposed to the system. These models predict the relative lateral displacement of the chip and its tilt, which can predict when failure should occur. Results from Surface Evolver, a computational software, and experimental data from a laboratory setup validate these models.

The validated model was then used to investigate the effects of variables such as lubricant height, chip dimensions and acceleration magnitudes.<br/><br/>This project gives an insight into how a chip behaves dynamically on a liquid meniscus and was the first to investigate the tilt of the component during accelerations. The key finding is a stable region showing what amount of liquid results in reaching the highest possible acceleration without failure. Secondly, the models and experiments showed that smaller liquid volumes and chip sizes increase the attainable acceleration. Chips of L = 2mm were able to be accelerated up to a = 27g without failure, parts of L = 1mm even reached an acceleration of a = 35g at which the RDC configuration remained intact. Moreover, possible eigenfrequencies were observed, and the system could re-align at specific frequencies from a tilted pose.

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Background: Merging on a highway is a complex driving task that requires a lot of interaction with other road users. During these tasks, a driver is required to evaluate gaps in space and time between the themselves and other road users and obstacles in order to arrive at the right moment to merge onto the highway. To improve safety and increase road efficiency, it is necessary to understand the decision process during merging decisions. A way of achieving this, is to understand what visual information humans use during this decision process. This study investigated the relation between gaze location and gap acceptance decisions during highway merges.<br/>Methods: An experiment was performed in which 26 participants monitored an automated vehicle (AV) that was driving on a highway on-ramp. The participants were given the task to train the AV in whether or not to merge in front of an upcoming vehicle that was already driving on the highway. An eye tracker was used to measure gaze data, which was used to find the relation between gaze behaviour and decision outcomes and response times. A mixed-effects logistic model was used for a statistical analysis with decision outcomes as a dependent variable and different gap sizes as predictor variables. A mixed-effects linear model was used to find the relation between response times and dwell times and the different gap sizes and decision outcomes as predictor variables. For both the decision outcome and response time model, dwell time was later included to find the effect on the predictive validity.<br/>Results: The results show that a larger time and distance gap to the upcoming vehicle relate to a higher merging probability. For larger time gaps to the on-ramp, the probability of merging was found to be smaller. It was also found that time gaps to the end of the on-ramp significantly relate to response times, with an increase of 55ms per 1s. Larger time gaps to the upcoming vehicle significantly relates to larger response times, with an increase of 64ms per 1s. No significant relation was found between response time and distance gaps to the upcoming vehicle. The response time was found to be 0.60s longer for rejected gap decisions. The time gap to the end of the on-ramp significantly relates to dwell time, with an increase of 0.56% per 1s. The distance gap to the upcoming vehicle significantly relates to dwell time, with an increase of 0.60% per 10m. The time gap to the upcoming vehicle significantly relates to dwell time, with an increase of 0.52% per 1s. The presented results show as well that a significant relation exists between gaze behaviour and decision outcomes and response times. When analysing decision outcomes and response times, the interaction between dwell time and gap sizes should be taken into account. This improved the predictive validity of the used regression models.<br/>Conclusion: Several pieces of evidence suggest that gaze behaviour assist in understanding the human decision making process during merging. This study can serve as a basis for cognitive models that can investigate how the relation between gaze behaviour and gap sizes, decision outcomes and response times can help to understand and potentially predict gap acceptance decisions.<br","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Vehicle Engineering | Dynamics and Controls","",""

Then, the performances of iFEM using shell<br/>elements will be enhanced pre-extrapolating the strain field and the results will be compared with another shape sensing method, the so-called Modal Method (MM).

Both static and dynamic analyses will be carried out, so recovering the load both in space and in time.<br/>The results obtained show that the beam model developed allows to obtain a satisfactory bending reconstruction of the structure, while the twist is not always accurate. Computing the full displacement field with iFEM brings to a relatively good representation, even though not as satisfactory as the one delivered by the Modal Method. Finally, recovering the static external loads directly from the strain measurements seems to perform better compared to the reconstruction from the full displacement field, but it is significantly affected by noise and uncertainties.

We mount five cameras from different angles in the Cath Lab, where surgeons and assistants are in similar clothes while doing surgery. Accurate 3D human pose estimation is the cornerstone of our method. Most previous 3D pose estimation methods train their models directly on a 3D pose dataset. However, these methods are not suitable for our task: 1) We do not have enough 3D pose data for training because of privacy issues and specificity 2) The model needs to be retrained in different operating rooms or the camera calibration changed. To solve these problems, we decompose the 3D human pose estimation task into two stages, avoiding the need for large amounts of 3D pose data and retraining. In the first stage, we apply YOLOX and HRNet for 2D human detection and 2D pose estimation. Simultaneously, the 2D object tracking network Bytetrack tracks person identities based on detection results. Then we use a matching algorithm to match the corresponding 2D poses from multiple views and reconstruct 3D poses. Given 3D poses and tracking identities, we at last introduce a hybrid method tracking algorithm. By feeding 2D tracking results into the matching and tracking algorithm, we increase the accuracy of the result in a scene where people are wearing similar clothes.

The mechanical properties of glass, in particular the high compressive strength, offer today a competitive solution that can be used for the purpose of restoration, allied to its transparency and aesthetics. The use of glass as a material is also aligned with the recommendations laid down by the international agreements for restoration.

To minimize fuel consumption, sharp acceleration/deceleration maneuvers and idling events at signalized intersections should be prevented. By taking advantage of the technological developments in infrastructure-to-vehicle communication, the possibility of receiving traffic signal phase and timing information in advance is enabled. Although a vast amount of research has been dedicated to optimal speed trajectory planning, existing methods may not be adequate in identifying the optimal solution for vehicles driving on signalized roads. Most studies do not involve queue estimation in the algorithm, which makes it challenging to deploy these methods in practice. Moreover, research efforts focus on undersaturated traffic conditions where queues can completely dissolve in a single cycle. Once the network is oversaturated, residual queues are formed generating traffic fluctuations and complete stops, significantly reducing the effectiveness of the application.<br/><br/>In this thesis, an optimal control problem is formulated to obtain the optimal speed trajectory, where traffic induced constraints are taken into account and queue estimation is explicitly integrated into the control framework. Based on kinematic wave theory, an efficient and accurate procedure to formulate the queue constraints in various traffic conditions is developed. To facilitate real-time control actions, the constrained optimization problem is solved using model predictive control. The simulation case studies show the proposed algorithm achieves vehicular fuel consumption savings as high as 29.15% compared to an existing approach in the literature. However, the fuel consumption savings are at the expense of an increase in travel time up to 1.65% compared to the literature approach. The results also indicate the benefits grow with increasing market penetration rates (MPRs) of controlled vehicles until it levels off at about 80% MPR. Furthermore, the results demonstrate the proposed algorithm can deal with stochasticity in traffic behavior. Finally, the thesis highlights the need for future research to further improve the proposed algorithm.","Model predictive control; Optimal control; Eco-driving; Queuing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

(mentor); van Hoof, C.A. (graduation committee); Caesar, H.C. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","This thesis is inspired by Active Inference to contribute to its improvement in the Robotics work field. However, the results and applications of this thesis are useful in a broader perspective, namely in any field that makes use of derivatives and the forecasting of a time-series signal. The goal of this study is to determine a new approach for calculating the derivatives using the finite difference technique and forecasting. The finite-difference technique is based on the Taylor expansion. The Taylor expansion uses derivatives to calculate a future signal sample, while the finite difference technique uses signal samples to estimate derivatives. The accuracy of the estimation can theoretically be increased using more signal samples and choosing signal samples that are closer to the signal sample of interest. For these reasons, the central method is interesting as it maximizes both of these properties. The central method uses future signal samples for the sample of interest which are not available in an online setting. Future values can be forecast through for example statistical models and predictive coding. Statistical models such as the auto regression method are the golden standard but cannot learn in an online fashion. Predictive coding can learn in an online fashion and research found a promising branch utilizing neural network frameworks. PredNet came out as an interesting model due to its state-of-the-art results and flexibility. The research question in this thesis is as follows: can predicting future data points by use of PredNet help improve the accuracy of the generalized coordinates? <br/>Two models of PredNet are trained on data obtained from random commands from a simulated Jackal robot. One is trained in an online fashion and one in an offline fashion. Its predictions are compared against two other forecasting methods: copying the input and the auto regression method. The predictions are then used with the finite difference method to estimate derivatives. Four methods are used: a method using as little past data as possible, a method using as much past data as possible, a method using as little centralized data as possible and a method using as much centralized data as possible. Derivatives are determined on the same simulated Jackal data and are compared against a derivative obtained from a central method using as much data as possible that all come from the true signal.<br/><br/>Results show no forecasting difference between the two types of PredNet models, but there are differences in training speed: training in an online fashion is not fast enough to keep up with the data stream. This suggests that the quality of neural networks is good enough for online applications, but that more work needs to be done on optimizing neural networks for online learning to make it a practical solution. However, the PredNet predictions are not as accurate as the auto regression method. This means that neural networks can still learn from the auto regression method when used for forecasting time series. An example of improving neural networks is making hybrid models.<br/>Using the PredNet forecasts for estimating derivatives did not increase the accuracy of the derivatives meaning the predictions are not accurate enough. Besides that, using more samples, either from the past or the future, did not increase the derivative estimate either. Most of this outcome can be attributed to the choice of data set which contained many transitions between commands which could not be predicted by the PredNet models or be seen by the finite difference method.<br/>Suggestions for improvements are to focus the training of a model on either the transition period or the period in between, using more modern models and/or using different methods for estimating derivatives.<br/><br/>This work concludes that neural networks show promise for online applications, that training a model requires a specific data set or a complex enough model to utilize a more general data set, and that using more samples with the finite difference method is not guaranteed to provide more accurate estimates of derivatives.<br","Neural network; Finite Difference; generalized coordinates; Active Inference","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

(mentor); Jamali-Rad, H. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Typically, people search images by text: users enter keywords and a search engine returns relevant results. However, this pattern has limitations. An obvious drawback is that when searching in one language, users may miss results labelled in other languages. Moreover, sometimes people know little about the object in the image and thus would not know what keywords could be used to search for more information. Driven by this use case with many applications, content-based image retrieval (CBIR) has recently been put under the spotlight, which aims to retrieve similar images in the database solely by the content of the query image without relying on textual information.<br/>To achieve this objective, an essential part is that the search engine should be able to interpret images at a higher level instead of treating them simply as arrays of pixel values. In practice, this is done by extracting distinguishable features. Many effective algorithms have been proposed, from traditional handcrafted features to more recent deep learning methods. Good features may lead to good retrieval performance, but the problem is still not fully solved. To make the engine useful in real-world applications, retrieval efficiency is also an important factor to consider while has not received as much attention as feature extraction.<br/>In this work, we focus on retrieval efficiency and provide a solution for real-time CBIR in million-scale databases. The feature vectors of database images are extracted and stored offline. During the online procedure, such feature vectors of query images are also extracted and then compared with database vectors, finding the nearest neighbours and returning the corresponding images as results. Since feature extraction only performs once for each query, the main limiting factor of retrieval efficiency in large-scale database is the time of finding nearest neighbours. Exact search has been shown to be far from adequate, and thus approximate nearest neighbour (ANN) search methods have been proposed, which mainly fall into two categories: compression-based and tree/graph-based. However, these two types of approaches are usually not discussed and compared together. Also, the possibility of combining them has not been fully studied. Our study (1) applies and compares methods in both categories, (2) reveals the gap between toy examples and real applications, and (3) explores how to get the best of both worlds.

It consists of two overlapping conical sections that together form a connection. There are several challenges left to be solved before the slip joint can be applied on a commercial scale. One of those challenges lies in the decommissioning process of the slip joint connection. It is proven that build-up settlement can increase the friction force within the joint over its lifetime and complicate its disconnection. One potential method for reducing the friction force in the slip joint is the excitation of one of the structures shell modes localized around the slip joint. Good estimations of the shell modes of the structure are therefore essential. Models for precise estimation of the shell modes of a wind turbine with a slip joint are difficult and expensive to develop due to the complexity of the joint. This thesis is a study into the possibility of using simplified finite element models to estimate the shell modes of a wind turbine connected with a slip joint. This is done by estimating the shell modes of the structure using a reference model and seven simplified models in a modal analysis. The estimated shell modes are compared based on their eigenfrequency and mode shape. Based on this comparison, conclusions about the applicability of simplified models are drawn. The first 300 eigenmodes of the structure are estimated with both the reference model and simplified models. Of these eigenmodes, ten shell modes of interest are selected based on their eigenfrequency and location at which the modes are localized. The modes of interest are than compared for their eigenfrequency and mode shape. The mode shapes are compared based on the Modal Assurance Criterion (MAC), which is calculated at a specific location of interest. In addition to this, the angle in which the modes are orientated is measured and compared, as this can be useful information for the decommissioning process. Results showed that three out of seven simplified models studied resulted in a estimation of the shell modes which was sufficiently accurate. The simplifications used for these models consist of the averaging of wall thickness for the upper and lower slip joint and a simple model for the upper slip joint. From these results it can be concluded that some of the simplifications can be applied when estimating shell modes of a wind turbine tower connected with a slip joint, as they lead to only a small decrease in accuracy of the shell mode estimation. However, using these results to make predictions about other potential simplifications is challenging as each different simplification has a unique influence on the estimation of the shell modes.","Slip Joint; Eigenmode analysis; Wind Turbine; Vibration; Decommissioning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Offshore Engineering","",""

(graduation committee); van der Stap, A.C.M.

Reducing costs and increased environmental awareness resulted in renewable energy sources being the fastest-growing sources in the last decade. Due to its high potential, many offshore wind turbines will be installed in the coming years. These turbines will be installed in deeper waters, usingmainly monopiles as support structures.<br/><br/>In the variety of monopile (MP) installation methods, a distinction exists between installation over the side of a vessel and a novel method where the procedure is repositioned to the vessel’s stern. Experts in the field were convinced that stern installation would be necessary for growing MPs and extended installation timeslots. This thesis aims to create an objective distinction between the installation directions by looking at the following two installation steps.<br/>First, the storage of MPs on the deck of an installation vessel is investigated. For side installation, the MPs are positioned transversely on the deck. This method uses little deck space per MP but includes an overhang which might badly influence the vessel’s behaviour. The latter has been investigated<br/>using the Moment of Inertia (MoI) of the vessel as an indicator of this behaviour. It has been found that transverse storage affects the MoI significantly more than longitudinal storage. However, this longitudinal storage is limited to 4 MPs per transit due to stability, whereas the transverse method can take 6 MPs. The stresses in the MP itself have also been evaluated for these storage methods, as the support locations were different. It has been concluded that there is indeed a difference, but the stress level has been found not governing for this choice.<br/><br/>Second, the upending procedure is investigated, as this is a step in the procedure which is highly influenced by motions and external wave impact. A model is developed that uses tugger line connections from the vessel to the MP to define forces in equipment objectively. It has been found that loads in the tugger lines were significantly lower for stern installation compared to side installation, which leads to a workability comparison. This comparison is based on a specific tugger cable, limited to a 300&#x1d45a;&#x1d461; tugger load. A range of sea states has been analysed and checked on this maximal tugger load. The workability difference for full-year performance is found to go from 64% for side installation to 96% for stern installation. It is realised that these numbers are high compared to the actual installation, but as the assumptions made for this model are equal for side and stern, these percentages are a good comparison between the two methods. The assumptions on which this model is based are checked on<br/>sensitivity, which results in reasonable trend lines and an interesting prospect into the future.<br/><br/>The model presented in this thesis could pose as a hypothetical concept for future installation, and therefore a determination of the natural frequency is added in this thesis. With this natural frequency, the feasibility of a concept can be quickly assessed even though no time-domain simulations have been<br/>executed. The model stays clear from natural periods of the control system and periods of the waves for a large range of upending angles. However, in a nearly vertical position, the control frequency is crossed and later, the regime of wave frequencies is encountered. Adjusting the model slightly in terms of geometry shows that these issues can be solved. However, future research is highly recommended into a time simulation of the model.<br/><br/>Finally, some practical applications of the installation over the side and stern are discussed. Concluding this thesis, the main research question can be answered positively by stating that stern installation can be used to improve the all-year MP installation performance of a floating installation vessel.","Monopiles; Wind; Installation; Floating vessel; Equipment","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

To reach this goal, greenhouse gas emissions must be at least 40% below 1990 levels by 2030 and the temperature rise must be kept below 2 degrees Celsius this century. Moreover, the recent fossil fuel price increases, are pressing eye-openers to the geopolitical dependency on a small number of nations and mark the urgency of the energy transition.<br/><br/>Hydrogen generation as a means of energy distribution and storage is argued to be a viable solution to this challenge because this flexible energy carrier can be produced by any energy source and can be converted into various energy forms. The energy carrier is believed to be critical for decarbonising heavy industries, heating, and transportation.<br/><br/>Although hydrogen can be produced from a variety of energy sources, the only long-term key to facilitating the energy transition and establishing a new green economy would be through the electrolysis of water, fueled by renewable energy. To be economically viable, the energy would have to be provided at a large scale and at a competitive price. This makes it a global endeavour, requiring cross-border collaboration to create international supply chains.<br/><br/>With its potential to generate an abundance of wind energy, geothermal energy, and hydropower, Iceland is exploring its opportunity to produce hydrogen for its domestic markets and export markets. Therefore, this research is taking the Icelandic situation as a case study.<br/><br/>A lack of infrastructure to create, store, and transport hydrogen in significant amounts is one of the obstacles to developing the hydrogen economy. Infrastructure development needs effective coordination and substantial expenditures. In this sense, port authorities play a crucial role in bringing together all the relevant parties in the supply chain. However, creating a long-term plan to convince investors and other decision-makers presents a hurdle. The creation of a port master plan is constrained by numerous uncertainties, limited technological knowledge, and unknown social needs. There is a need for strategically roadmapping the port development process and thus structuring the decision-making process. So far, no hydrogen industrial port complex has been built and no studies have been performed about systematic thinking for the purpose of generating the possible pathways to develop such a system.<br/><br/>Through a single-case and practice-oriented design research methods, this research performs a SWOT analysis to determine influencing factors in developing a hydrogen industrial port complex in Iceland. This leads to the creation of an eight-phase Integrated Hydrogen Port Development-framework to narrow the knowledge gap as described above.

Nowadays, offshore wind farm projects move into deeper waters and require larger individual Offshore Wind Turbines<br/>(OWT’s), which results in larger monopiles. As a result, heavy lift vessels shipping and installing the monopiles can transport fewer monopiles at a time, as they have outgrown the cargo hold and can only be shipped on the top deck. Considering the stiff nature of the monopile and that it spans almost the entire length of a ship nowadays, companies involved in such projects, such as Jumbo Maritime, have concerns this might heavily affect the ships dynamic behaviour. Therefore, the research presented in this thesis is focused on investigating what effects a lashed monopile on the deck of a heavy lift vessel causes and if friction contact between ship and monopile plays a role. To answer these questions the ship and monopiles are modelled as a coupled system with appropriate boundary conditions. The research is focused on finding lashing &amp; friction contact effects, but also what effects of the number of monopiles introduces onto the system.","Monopile; Wind; Offshore wind; Hydromechanics; Ship; Heavy Lift Shipping; Friction; Timoshenko beam theory; Ansys workbench; ANSYS","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-07-16","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","","52.00929921710273, 4.745073492283292"

Shor showed in his breakthrough paper on the equivalence of additivity conjectures that this superadditivity is equivalent to the subadditivity of the minimum output entropy of quantum channels, and Hastings gave a high-dimensional and probabilistic counterexample to the minimum output entropy additivity conjecture. Since then, researchers have endeavored to classify which quantum channels have subadditive minimum output entropy and to find deterministically constructed quantum channels with subadditive minimum output entropy. It is well-known that determining the minimum output entropy of an arbitrary quantum channel is a hard problem (in fact, it has been shown to be NP-complete), which in turn makes it difficult to determine whether a quantum channel has subadditive minimum output entropy. <br/><br/>In this thesis, we utilize the representation theory of compact (partition) quantum groups to construct so-called covariant Clebsch-Gordan quantum channels and analyze their minimum output entropy. We review the work of Brannan and Collins in the case of the free orthogonal quantum groups $O_N^+$, and introduce a similar analysis for the quantum permutation group $S_N^+$. Afterwards, we specialize to the subfamily of lowest-weight Clebsch-Gordan channels, and we show that, in the case where one embeds the fundamental representation of $O_N^+$ in the tensor product of two irreducible representations of $O_N^+$, the associated lowest-weight quantum channels have sufficient additional structure to analytically compute their minimum output entropy in terms of a recurrence relation. <br/><br/>Lastly, we present an analysis of certain numerical methods that can be utilized to bound the minimum output entropy from below and from above in low dimensions: we use epsilon-covers for lower bounds, and we use a modified version of the derivative-free optimization method called Particle Swarm Optimization over the unit sphere, hybridized with gradient descent, to find upper bounds. We show a proof-of-concept by applying the epsilon-cover to three $S_N^+$ channels with small input dimensions, but also note that the exponential scaling of epsilon-covers with the input dimension makes them intractable with higher input dimensions. We benchmark the Particle Swarm Optimization enriched with gradient-descent on the highest-weight Clebsch-Gordan channels for which it can be shown that the minimum output entropy is zero, and we see that the optimization technique performs adequately. We also apply the optimization scheme to the tensor product of two $S_N^+$-channels, but do not find any violation of the minimum output entropy additivity conjecture.","quantum channels; partition quantum groups; compact matrix quantum groups; quantum information theory; minimum output entropy; additivity violations; covariant quantum channels","en","master thesis","","","","","","https://github.com/SamvPoelgeest/qittoolbox GitHub public repository for qittoolbox, a small quantum information theory toolbox with tools to numerically approximate the minimum output entropy of a quantum channel.","","","","","","Applied Mathematics | Applied Physics","",""

The findings indicate that there is a clear misalignment on the economic side when companies that manufacture sustainable textile crafts embed sustainability and circularity in their businesses. This is because they often apply monetization strategies based on linear economy models, where more consumption is equal to more profit and thus prosperity.

The natural landscape was that of a forest to estuarine topographical gradient. This transformation of the land has had a major impact on the city’s resiliency, impacting water systems, green cover and communities. The natural systems have been built over with sea walls, causeways, railways and other such infrastructure elements that have become barriers, hampering the natural processes and flows. With urbanization, the local fishing communities that were initial inhibitors of Mumbai have been pushed to the fringes, now residing in the most vulnerable parts of the city.

Exponential advancements in hardware and software are kept in check by a quickly rising demand for data-driven products and services. With a climate and energy crisis on our hands, now is the time to ask ourselves whether this superfluous consumption of data is really necessary. By investigating the workings of the physical network and the interaction between humans and digital products, an inquiry is made into changing consumer behaviour to benefit sustainability. The resulting design demonstrates how a different approach to the way we interact with the digital world can facilitate new practices that are sustainable in the broadest sense of the word. By actively reflecting on their online behaviour, internet users are enabled to fulfil personal values that benefit people and climate.<br/><br/><b>Research</b><br/>The inquiry into the various stakeholders related to data consumption depicts an infinitely complex network with various players. Together they share a responsibility to for the social impact that the internet has on our society but in the current situation these individual parties mainly act out of self-interest. Digital services providers and their users behave in immoral and unethical ways to satisfy immediate cravings which stands in the way of fulfilling social values. All stakeholders are put under enormous stress by this fast consumption pattern which the project categorises as somewhat uncivilized. This uncivilized behaviour is further defined in three ‘pillars’ that lie at the root of the current value conflicts.<br/>Norms &amp; regulation<br/>Perverse pleasure seeking, deceptive technologies and social misbehavior threaten the individual on the web.  <br/>Moderation &amp; modestyConstant distractions and the acceleration at which we increase productivity lead to an overload of information that humans are not capable of handling.<br/>Active involvementThe lack of physicality of data infrastructure combined with a generally apathetic mindset leads to a loss of autonomy and control.<br/><br/><b>Design</b><br/>From experiments with possible interventions it is concluded that to start making a change towards a more civilized behaviour, data consumption needs to be made more concrete in a way that facilitates debate about the topic. A final concept is proposed that embodies this philosophy by encouraging KPN customers to start caring about the impact of data consumption on themselves, their close peers and the environment. It does so through the following set of criteria:<br/>1.Installing awareness about data usage by educating and framing<br/>2.Eliciting a social frame of reference for internet users to adhere to<br/>3.Helping consumers commit to purposeful decisions<br/>4.Affording inconvenience when users want to engage in meaningless behaviour<br/>5.Materialising the benefits of data reduction<br/>6.Making low data use standard in daily practices<br/>Besides this intervention targeted at consumers, the design and research also hold various implications for the other stakeholders within the project context.<br","Human Computer Interaction; Design for behaviour change; sustainable consumption; Research through Design; critical design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

The first part of the report focuses on the calculation of the uplift forces in the bolted connections caused by the moving loads. For this, first a detailed numerical model is made in Abaqus. Based on this most detailed numerical model, different simplifications are made to make the calculations easier and less time-consuming. Numerical models with linear bolts instead of non-linear bolts and with load superposition using a one-wheel load instead of a complete vehicle are considered. Next to this, equivalent material properties are calculated to make a model with an orthotropic deck plate instead of modeled geometry of skins and webs. For the numerical model with this orthotropic deck, the same simplifications are applied. Next to the numerical models, different analytical beam and plate models are considered. All different numerical and analytical models made, are compared on possibilities, calculation and modeling time and accuracy. Based on the comparison between the models and the capacity of the connections, it is concluded that the uplift design of the bolted connections does not need to be taken into account in the optimization of the slabs. <br/><br/>The second part of the graduation work is about the optimization of the FRP slabs considering the global behavior of the deck, for which a genetic algorithm is used to detect the most optimal geometry. The most important parameters for the design are the height of the deck, the spacing of the webs and the layup of the topskin, bottomskin and webs. The layup of the different elements is dependent on the number of plies, the ply orientation and the overlapping length. During the optimization process, design and initial (global) strength, stability and stiffness checks are performed. First, optimization is done for the same deck that is considered in part one of the research. Next to this case, different cases for the distance between the supports are considered for which standardization is done with respect to engineering and production of the slabs.<br/> <br/>Based on the performed research it is concluded that the uplift bolt forces are in a range of 0.5 to 21.5 kN. Simplifications can be done by the use of an orthotropic deck with equivalent material properties. The maximum difference using this simplification is 2.9 kN, while the calculation time needed is reduced by a factor of 4-5. Other simplifications that can be done are the use of linear bolts and/or load superposition. Using linear bolts gives a maximum difference of 0.5 kN and load superposition a maximum difference of 0.3 kN, both without an improvement of the calculation time. The optimal geometry for different boundary conditions is given as a standard design with a variable number of plies for the topskin and a variable height based on intervals for the distance between the supports. <br","Fiber Reinforced Polymers - FRP; Uplift bolt forces; Numerical methods; Analytical methods; Optimization; Genetic algorithm; Standardization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering","",""

Such interactions aim to reach agreements through an iterative process of making offers. With the growth of Peer-to-Peer (P2P) energy markets due to the development and deployment of a variety of small-scale electricity generation and storage devices (DERs), automated negotiation is seen as one of the advanced techniques that can improve the efficiency of energy distribution with the consideration of preferences of different entities. Opponent modeling is one of the essential abilities of automated negotiation agents that can further benefit automated negotiation. This project introduces a new opponent modeling technique considering the specific characteristics of P2P energy markets. These particular characteristics are a) Two automated negotiation agents can negotiate with each other many times, and b) The preferences of the users of agents are decided mainly by their energy consumption patterns, which usually do not have massive fluctuation across the year. The proposed opponent modeling method is developed from the idea of modeling the policy of a Reinforcement Learning agent. It uses a neural network to approximate the bidding strategy of the opposite automated negotiation agent. The network is learned based on the observations of offers exchanged in negotiations. With the learned network, the negotiation agent can predict the future actions of its opponent and make better decisions. We evaluated our opponent modeling with an existing automated negotiation system designed for off-grid energy trading. In experiments, the introduced opponent modeling always performs better than a random-guess model while modeling basic bidding strategies. Its performance is stable in dynamic environments where its opponent’s preference and bidding strategy may change randomly. It is also proved that the introduced method has potential for further improvement with the help of advanced opponent modeling techniques, which model the preference profile of the opponent. With our new opponent modeling method, the automated negotiators who take part in the P2P energy markets should be able to find better joint agreements that are preferred by both itself and its opponents. And in this case, a better joint agreement means a more efficient way of distributing energy.<br","P2P energy market; Automated negotiation; Opponent modeling; Machine learning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science","",""

From the literature research preceding this thesis, some of the major obstacles in robotic surgery are the high costs and limited reusability of the instruments. In order to have more affordable robotic surgery, there is a need for low cost robotics and easily cleanable instruments. The design project presented in this thesis represents a driver interface for robotic control of the SATA instrument and is divided into three detachable subassemblies: a motor unit, a cup interface and a gearbox with angular position feedback. This project also represents an upgrade to an existing design that contains the motors and the gearbox inside a single unit, without any sensorics. Design requirements and goals were establish at the start of the project. Possible solutions were designed in CAD and mapped into a morphological table. Each design obstacle had many possible solutions that were considered before choosing the best suited ones. Two prototypes were build out of aluminium and steel with PEEK bushings and 3D printed outer cases. The range of motion and lateral pulling force of the SATA instrument controlled by these prototypes were tested, together with the assembly-disassembly times and shaft coupling times between the gearbox and motor unit shafts. The experimental results showed very low gearbox exchange times and low coupling times with learning curves that prove the ease of use for new users, all translating into a design that allows fast instrument exchange during surgery. The design requirements were met and physical prototypes built and tested, proving the concept works and is suited for the operating room, heading towards affordable robotic surgery.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-07-21","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

Decompilers can transform the largely unreadable binaries into a more readable source code-like representation. However, many aspects of source code, such as variable names and comments, are lost during the compilation and decompilation processes. Furthermore, by stripping the binaries, more informative symbols/tokens, including the function names, are also removed from the binary.<br/> <br/>Reverse engineering is time-consuming, much of which is taken up by labelling the functions with semantic information. Therefore, we propose a novel code summarisation method for decompiled and stripped decompiled code. First, we leverage the existing BinSwarm dataset and extend it with aligned source code summaries. Next, we create an artificial demi-stripped dataset by removing the identifiers from unstripped decompiled code. To train our model for summarising code using this dataset, we fine-tune a pre-trained CodeT5 model for the code summarisation task on the given dataset. Furthermore, we investigate the performance of the input types, the impact of data duplication and the importance of each aspect present in the source code on the model performance. Moreover, we design and present some intermediate-training objectives to increase the model performance.<br/> <br/>We present the following findings: <br/>Firstly, we find that the model generates good summaries for decompiled code, with similar performance to source C code. Compared to summarising decompiled code, the quality of the demi-stripped model is significantly lower but still usable.

Thirdly, we found that the loss of identifiers causes a drop in the BLEU-4 score of 35\%, with another 25\% decrease attributable to the increase of decompilation faults caused by stripping. Lastly, we show that our proposed deobfuscation intermediate-training objective improves the model's performance by 0.54 and 1.54 BLEU-4 on stripped and demi-stripped code, respectively.","Machine Learning; Cyber Security; Reverse engineering; Natural Language Processing; Transformers; Deep Learning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","The financial domain is losing ground to rapid-developing fraud schemes. It puts intense pressure on organizations such as banks to find new approaches to tackle financial misconduct. This financial crime has always existed and is present in the financial industry. However, the rise of technology and the use of online transactions has enhanced the presence of the impact of fraud in this industry. The increase in financial fraud cases in a technological era result from a lack of inter-organizational synergy and the privacy concerns that entail by making data available. On top of the increasing fraud cases, organizations are exposed to increasing regulatory, financial, reputational, and legal risks. Hence, the financial crime industry and fraud prevention organizations must act on this threat. Therefore, these actors need to improve their current workflow continuously to keep up with the new developments. Different studies propose that it is a potential opportunity to take the chance and bundle data together to learn from the existing environment and improve their workflows and prediction models. However, the main concern is that parties are reluctant to share data as it involves confidential and sensitive data, which malicious parties can leverage and abuse. Also, the increasing focus on privacy protection regulations makes it complex and challenging to exchange data easily. The dataset that actors are providing will contain personally identifiable information, which in fact cannot be shared and proposed without any legitimate reason and is subjected to the data privacy regulations.<br/>The existing set of techniques for sharing and analysing data securely, such as differential privacy, homomorphic encryption and federated learning have been proposed in studies and use cases are built in the real world. However, these techniques are insufficient and capable enough to facilitate multi-actor (data owners) data exchange and analysis. Secure Multiparty Computation, however, is capable of having multiple data owners securely perform a joint analysis. For this reason, this study has been focused on SMPC. In the case of the financial crime industry, it requires the involvement of multiple stakeholders sharing data simultaneously. Especially in the case of banks, it is essential to have bundled data for all transactions as these are connected.<br/>To understand the purpose and the concept of the study, it is essential to have a basic understanding of SMPC. Secure Multiparty Computation is a cryptographic method for parties to mutually compute a function over all parties' acquired inputs while keeping the intake private throughout the entire process. Independent computation nodes will perform and provide analysis outcomes to designated parties. The concept of Secure Multiparty Computation has been studied by academia since the 1980s (Yao, 1982). However, the applications and introduction of SMPC are relativity novel to organizations and will not be immediately accepted. A technique such as SMPC will require participating parties to share a mutual interest and willingness to contribute continuously. It is uncertain if organizations will accept and adopt SMPC as mentioned before. Therefore, the study will also incorporate the concept and theory of collective action to understand the motives and the common goal for stakeholders in the anti-fraud industry to accept the technique and collaborate. A common goal, also known as a collective goal or interest, would create acceptance among the group. In this case, it will help to identify the factors and interests that influence an organization's decision to engage in collective action for developing MPC for fraud detection in the financial industry...<br","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-12-31","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

The technologies that airlines use to operate have been outdated to cope with today's massive challenges. All of these changes forced airlines to innovate to maintain their services. During the era of technology, these innovations can be better nurtured within an innovation-conducive environment, which might be seen as an ecosystem designed for the co-creation of value through collaboration. In the last decade, both managers and scholars showed an increasing interest in the concept of innovation ecosystems, which provides a holistic perspective for value creation. However, despite its potential, the implementation of the innovation ecosystems in the airline industry and how it can support an airline to implement its innovation strategy has not been investigated. By conducting literature research and qualitative embedded case study, this research concludes that implementation of innovation ecosystems and innovation ecosystem strategies can help an airline to achieve its objectives on innovation and implement its innovation strategy by aligning its innovation processes, overcoming the barriers to innovation that hampers its innovation processes and finally facilitating the collaboration within and beyond the value chain to develop radical innovations that are required to cope with today’s complex challenges.","Innovation Ecosystems; Airlines; Innovation Strategy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

These multi-agent networks comprise multiple agents, which cooperate to solve a problem collectively, beyond the individual knowledge of a single agent. Multi-agent networks are also known for improving overall system performance, especially in terms of scalability, robustness, and flexibility. <br/><br/>Multi-agent networks are tasked with a variety of tasks e.g., target tracking, surveillance, traffic control, and environmental monitoring. Traditionally these tasks are solved using distributed state-space filtering methods, however under the assumptions of linear models with underlying Gaussian noise. However, in general, the models could be Non-linear, and the underlying stochastic noise is not necessarily Gaussian in nature. To address this limitation, Distributed particle filters (DPF) have been investigated in recent years. Depending on the quantities exchanged in the network, DPFs can be categorized as weight-based, likelihood-based, or posterior-based.<br/><br/>One of the key challenges for effective implementation of the DPF is the need for approximation strategies to reduce the burden on communication and computation resources to suit engineering applications. To this end, we review two state-of-the-art DPF, (a) one based on applying the Graph Laplacian (GL) approximation to weights, and (b) the other using the Gaussian mixture model (GMM) to represent the local posteriors. These two algorithms significantly reduce the communication burden; however, the main limitation is the synchronization and heavy computational burden, which places high demands on hardware and software implementation of agents.<br/><br/>To improve on these existing methods, we propose the use of Gaussian process (GP) enhanced resampling algorithm, which reduces the particle set size, while ensuring an acceptable filter performance. Based on this GP-enhanced resampling scheme, we propose a novel Distributed particle filtering algorithm. Secondly, based on the proposed GP-enhanced sampling, we propose several metaheuristic optimization algorithms (i.e., genetic algorithm and firefly algorithm) to fuse the information across the whole network to improve the estimation performance (i.e., to seek the global optimal particle set as we can treat particles as “parents” or “fireflies”). <br/><br/>We compare our proposed algorithms and study their performance against the state-of-the-art DPFs in terms of time, space, and communication complexity, for a target tracking application. We use time-averaged root mean square error (ARMSE), which is used to quantify the performance of each DPF. Our numerical results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed algorithms under the condition of limited communication and computational resources, and still maintaining the optimality of particle filter. <br/><br/>For example, to achieve a certain ARMSE for a target tracking application, the traffic for existing GL and GMM based DPFs, is 12000 scalars/second/agent and 600 scalars/second/agent respectively, while our proposed GP-enhanced resampling and firefly algorithm uses only 900scalars/second/agent. In terms of the computation runtime, the GL and GMM based approaches take 40 and 300 seconds (about 5 minutes) respectively, while our proposed algorithm takes just 1.5 seconds, and thus shows significant improvement. Finally, we propose research directions to further improve our proposed algorithms in the future.","Distributed optimization; Particle Filtering; Target tracking","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Circuits and Systems","",""

To combat these shortcomings of existing policy analysis methods and provide an insightful way of informing policy evaluation and development, this project proposes a novel five-step policy analysis method that can semi-automatically derive and aggregate causal relations from policy literature into a causal map of policy effects. The method has been applied to a collection of 28 emissions trading scheme (ETS) policy analysis literature sources, producing a causal map consisting of 159 causal links with a recall of 38% and precision of 84%. The results demonstrate that applying this approach produces an aggregated system perspective of the analysed policy’s effects, and garners relevant insights for policy evaluation and development that would otherwise be difficult to obtain. This approach can therefore provide analysts from across different policy domains with a more comprehensive understanding of the factors and relations affecting policy and so provide a more comprehensive evidence base from which to inform policy development.","Policy analysis; Emissions trading schemes; Natural language processing; Relation extraction; Causal relations; Causal maps","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","",""

However, running automated log analysis pipelines is far from straightforward, due to the changing nature of software ecosystems caused by the constant need to adapt to user requirements. In practice, these are comprised of a series of steps that collectively aim at turning raw logs into actionable insights. The first step is log parsing which aims to abstract away from raw logs toward structured information. Log parsing is paramount, as it influences the performance of all subsequent downstream tasks that rely on its output. Although previous works have investigated the performance of log parsing, given the increase in data heterogeneity witnessed over the past decades, the validity of current estimates is questionable, as there is a lack of understanding of how log parsing methods perform in modern contexts. Consequently, we investigate the field and, in the process, we discover that misleading metrics are adopted, which produce incomplete performance estimates. Furthermore, motivated by an industry use case within the infrastructure of a large international financial institution, we discover that the current log parsing paradigm is not aligned with what is required in practice. Consequently, to address these current limitations, in this work we contribute with the following. We (1) evaluate the field of log parsing, (2) propose a new log parsing paradigm and create a benchmark dataset to facilitate future research, and (3) propose and evaluate a machine learning model that solves log parsing within the new paradigm.","Log parsing; Log Analysis; Named Entity Recognition","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

LCPs in their additively manufactured form are tested for hydrogen permeability, in order to asses the effect of AM on the bulk permeability properties of this material. Furthermore the 5-axis AM process is developed for LCP pressure vessels, culminating in a series of pressure tests on additively manufactured specimens.

Six perceptive loss functions, which should better represent how an image is perceived, are thoroughly analysed to understand the reasons behind their functioning in the context of precipitation nowcasting. It was shown that these perceptive losses can lead to an improvement in sharpness for the first lead time, but that the blurriness for longer lead times arises due to the imbalance in the dataset and the uncertainty of the model with respect to the location of the rain.

Most people see motorcycles as a solution to escape the growing traffic congestion and poor public transport. This study thus aimed to determine the traffic efficiency and safety effectiveness of introducing motorcycle dedicated lanes in non–lane based and mixed traffic. These effects were studied by microsimulation of unsignalized intersections without priority markings in urban areas of developing countries. The study centered on an intersection commonly known as “Spear Motors” in Kampala. In addition, off-peak traffic was simulated since traffic police controls the intersection during peak time and microsimulation model cannot simulate traffic while a policeman (or two) is on duty.<br/>Video images of the intersection were officially obtained from Uganda Police and processed to traffic data such as traffic volume, trajectories, composition, and conflicts. In addition, geometric data (lane width, slope, intersection dimensions, coordinates, and aerial pictures) about the intersection was physically collected during a daytime site visit.<br/>A representation of the current traffic conditions at the intersection, referred to as the base model, was developed in VISSIM 21. The base model was calibrated using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). Thereafter, the model was microscopically and macroscopically validated. <br/>Three scenarios were considered in this study, which are: scenario 1 with straight crossings of motorcycles in the intersection, scenario 2 with deflected crossings and scenario 3 with a roundabout separated for the main road traffic and motorcycles.<br/>Simulations with driver behavior parameters set to optimum values were performed to replicate the actual behavior. Consequently, traffic conflicts were generated from vehicle trajectories per scenario. Post Encroachment Time (PET) and Time to Collision (TTC) were calculated for the conflicts. The use of conflicts is proactive compared to reactive approaches that use crashes.<br/>The use of deflected crossings for motorcycles and then a roundabout separated for main traffic and motorcycles increased the flow of the intersection by 31% and 20%, respectively. Additionally, the implementation of deflected motorcycle crossings and roundabout reduced critical density by 38.6% and 63.7%, respectively.<br/>Regarding safety, more benefits are expected by using either deflected crossings or roundabout than straight crossings. The number of severe critical conflicts reduced by 87.9% with the application of a roundabout separated for main road traffic and motorcycles. This is higher than the decrease of 48.5% after the application of dedicated motorcycle lanes with deflected crossings. To determine the conflict rates per scenario, the number of severe critical conflicts was divided by total traffic simulated. Deflected crossings for motorcycles reduced severe critical conflict rate by 40% whilst it decreased by 75% with intersection improvement to a roundabout separated for main traffic and motorcycles.<br/>With the high motorcycle demand of over 50% of traffic, implementation of dedicated motorcycle lanes at unsignalized intersections as well as urban roads in general will result into better flow of traffic. In addition, the motorcycle lanes will contribute to the general road safety in Kampala.<br/><br/><br","Traffic flow; Safety; Motorcycle; Microsimulation; Unsignalised intersections; dedicated motorcycle lane; Post Encroachment Time (PET); Time to Collision (TTC)","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Transport and Planning","","0.33371,32.61792"

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Contrasting experience with Reusable Launch vehicles—Space Shuttle and Falcon 9— has established that potential of reusable launch vehicles to achieve low launch costs is driven by the design choices made. Methalox propellant is one such design choice that has been touted to power future missions and potentially replace traditional propellants — Hydrolox and Kerolox. The high density of methalox compared to hydrolox and improved specific impulse compared to kerolox, potentially make methalox an ideal propellant choice. To justify any new design choice, cost-based analysis is essential, especially given the persisting issue of high launch cost. Additionally, it is essential to benchmark the performance of any new design choice with existing practices, especially when they are expected to replace current practices. For this, a cost based comparative analysis of methalox based launchers with hydrolox and kerolox launchers is performed using a tool capable of launch vehicle design and cost analysis. Rather than designing a tool from scratch, existing First Stage Recovery Tool (FRT), which was developed by M. Rozemeijer to modify and cost existing expendable launchers to include reusability, was extended to include a launch vehicle design module, which was previously lacking. A Multidisciplinary Design Analysis and Optimization (MDAO) methodology was applied for the design module. The design module was developed by verified and validated models implemented from literature for hydrolox, kerolox and methalox propellants and an optimization scheme to minimize for Gross Lift-Off Mass (GLOM). This design module in conjunction with the FRT enables design and costing of expendable and reusable launcher configurations. For the current study, two missions were considered—15600 kg payload to Low Earth Orbit (LEO) and a 5000 kg payload to Geostationary Transfer Orbit (GTO)—for different propellant combination-based launchers. Additionally, different launcher configurations— expendable, reusable via non-propulsive recovery and reusable via propulsive recovery—were considered, enabling cost comparison of propellants for different scenarios. Results indicate that methalox based launchers are cost-effective solution when compared to hydrolox, regardless of mission type or launcher configuration considered in the current study. Compared to kerolox, only a marginal cost benefit can be achieved, for the case of expendable configuration and in combination with kerolox. For reusable configurations, purely methalox shows potential to achieve costs within 10% of kerolox. Sensitivity analysis showed the potential to reduce this gap by including the lower refurbishment requirement of methalox, given low soot formation possibility. Furthermore, it showed the need for a better engine model for methalox, to refine comparison between methalox and kerolox. The tool, however, is not complete and should be extended to include reliability assessment, especially for methalox systems, which are not flight proven unlike hydrolox and kerolox. There also remains issues with the accuracy and uncertainty in certain models, which make the current version suitable only for comparative studies.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Automation of the labour-intensive task of crop harvesting could help fill in this gap between supply and demand. However, picking soft fruits is challenging, as they can be easily damaged if not carefully handled. This paper focuses on designing and evaluating a novel robotic gripper for gently harvesting blackberries, which is nicknamed the Twisting-Tube gripper. The gripper consists of a fabric tube which closes in an enveloping manner due to a motorized twisting action of the ends of the tube. A custom tensile-testing bench was used to test blackberry detachment, release, and damage rates for three types of tubes: radially elastic, fully elastic, and compressible. These tubes were manufactured out of different combinations of foam padding, spandex and food-safe cotton cheesecloth and compared to a handpicked control. The results showed that compressible, thicker cheesecloth outperformed radially elastic or fully elastic or extremely compressible tubes with 82% successful detachment and 95% successful release rates. Furthermore, the Twisting-Tube gripper with thick cheesecloth discoloured at least one drupelet of 19% of the blackberries after 48 hours, which is less than the 33% measured in the handpicked control group, but still more than the 10% of the unhandled berries with discolouration. Moreover, the gripper with thick cheesecloth caused leakage to at least one drupelet for 29% of the successfully harvested blackberries compared to 13% of the hand-harvested control. It can be concluded that the presented Twisting-Tube gripper prototype shows promising results for harvesting small soft fruits.","Soft grippers; End-effectors; Soft Robotics; Blackberry; Fruits; Vegetables; Harvesting; Handling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

Although the models can describe the crush forces and resulting accelerations, their predictive capabilities are poor, and several iterations are usually required to arrive at a satisfactory design, causing the teams money and resources. Reductions in costs could be possible by reducing the number of full-scale experiments and increasing the amount of analysis.<br/><br/>This thesis aims to evaluate the capabilities of a commercially available material model at two distinct modelling scales by conducting physical and virtual experiments on two different specimen geometries; tubular coupons and a new open-section channel specimen. Firstly, the new open-section specimen with a geometry representing the typical F1 crash structures was designed, manufactured and tested. The newly proposed specimen showed controlled failure modes, and displayed typical characteristics of composite structures under crushing loading. Secondly, the two specimen geometries were numerically analyzed on the macro-scale (laminate-level) and meso-scale (ply-level) using a commercially available material model implemented in the Abaqus finite element software. Mesh-dependency of the macro-scale approach was discussed and numerical aspects required to perform crush simulations on the meso-scale were identified and discussed. Lastly, calibration of the numerical models was performed to understand the effects of model inputs on the output responses, to evaluate the validity of the input parameters, and to assess two different calibration approaches; the first method is based on macro-scale modeling, while the second method is based on surrogate-based inverse parameter identification at the meso-scale.<br/><br/>The numerical models could not reproduce the experimental crush responses of either geometry when using experimentally characterized material data. Following the second calibration approach, the qualitative and quantitative crush responses of the tubular specimen could be accurately described, but the channel specimen showed no improvements in their response.

Monopiles are hollow steel tubular piles with a diameter of up to 10m. The first phase of the monopile installation consists of the self-weight penetration into the seabed due to the mass of the monopile. Followed by the placement of the hammer, which installs the piles to the designated depth. A scour protection is deposited near the piles to avoid erosion (scour holes) around the monopiles. The scour protection consists of rock material with different size gradations and densities. Generally, the scour protection is installed in two campaigns. The first campaign consists of the installation of smaller rocks (filter layer), followed by the installation of bigger rocks (armour layer). Between these two campaigns, the monopile is installed through the filter layer. To achieve a more time-efficient installation sequence, in some projects a full scour protection (single layer) is deposited prior to the installation of the monopile. However, the technical feasibility of monopile installation through a scour protection has not been researched. Within practice, difficulties arise during the installation of monopiles through a single layer of scour protection. This leads to timely and costly delays.<br/>This thesis contributes by use of simulations, to study the technical feasibility of monopile installation through scour protection. With a focus on the scour protection behavior in the first phase of the installation, where the monopile penetrates the seabed due to its mass, so-called self-weight penetration. <br/>During monopile self-weight penetration, physical processes within the subsoil, scour protection, and monopile wall create penetration resistance. The most important physical processes during monopile self-weight penetration are identified using literature:<br/>• The development of tip resistance due to the scour protection layer.<br/>• The development of shaft resistance due to the scour protection layer.<br/>• The self-weight penetration due to the weight and dimensions of the monopile.<br/>• The interaction between the monopile wall and the scour protection rock and inter-rock interaction (interlocking, rotation, breaking, and protrusion of the subsoil).<br/>The Discrete Element Method (DEM) is considered most suitable for the representation of the scour protection behavior and is an effective method for addressing engineering problems in granular materials. The most important reason for using DEM is due to the discontinuous behavior of the scour protection material. <br/>The Discrete Element Method (DEM) is considered most suitable for the representation of the scour protection behavior. DEM is an effective method for addressing engineering problems in granular materials. The most important reason for using DEM is due to the discontinuous behavior the scour protection materials. <br/>To set up the simulation, calibrated DEM input parameter sets are required to recreate reliable bulk behavior. These parameter input sets are found with the use of two Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) of the bulk material: the porosity and the angle of repose. These KPIs are included because they represent the inter particle frictional resistance to movement. With the calibrated input sets combined with data from a case study, the Full-Scale Monopile Simulation is set up. Consistent with the case study, the simulation is designed using a monopile with a tip diameter of 8m and a wall thickness of 0.08m. The seabed consists of a sandy subsoil and a scour protection on top. <br/>To achieve a realistic stable simulation with a reasonable computational time, experiments are executed. Within an experimental design, a reference simulation is developed, followed by a parameter sensitivity analysis. The most important conclusions of the parameter sensitivity analysis are:<br/>• When using an 8m diameter monopile, a minimum simulation domain of 12*12m2 is recommended. Resulting in a minimum of 2m space around the monopile.<br/>• A subsoil is required for successful penetration through the scour protection layer.<br/>• The subsoil input parameters are of significant influence on the penetration behavior of the monopile, due to the rock penetration into the subsoil.<br/>• The scour protection thickness can be included as a variable parameter.<br/>To verify whether the reference simulation properly represents practice, a qualitative validation is executed using the case study. Successful penetration is achieved within both the reference simulation and the case study. However, the current simulation does not present a comparable depth over time correlation. An underestimation of the penetration resistance is observed. Increasing the rolling resistance and therefore limiting the angular velocity of the particles results in higher penetration resistance. Restricting the angular velocity of the scour protection completely, results in an unsuccessful penetration. <br/>Further research should focus on representative penetration resistance of the scour protection, combined with an alternative and more representative inclusion of the subsoil. Furthermore, the validation should be elaborated using adequate data from practice.<br","Scour protection; Monopile Installation; Discrete Element Method; DEM simulation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2025-07-18","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

Bone healing includes pro- and anti-inflammatory phases, which proved crucial for successful healing. Being able to modulate these inflammatory responses could potentially promote bone fracture healing. Dendritic cells play important roles in the immune response after bone fracture, due to their immune regulating abilities via cytokine secretion and antigen presentation. Therefore, DCs are a target for immunomodulatory therapies. One way of modulating cell behaviour can be altering osmolality in cell microenvironments. This thesis investigates in vitro if environmental osmolality can modulate the inflammatory phenotype of monocyte-derived dendritic cells (moDCs) in 2D and 3D microenvironments.<br/>To exclude adverse effects such as cell death by hypo- or hyper-osmotic conditions, a range was established where moDCs maintain high viability and metabolic activity. Hypo-osmotic medium was established by diluting iso-osmotic cell medium with deionized water. Hyper-osmotic medium was established in two ways, by supplementing iso-osmotic cell medium with either ionic sodium chloride (NaCl) or inert polyethylene glycol (PEG). moDCs maintained high viability and metabolic activity between 210-385 mOsm/kg for NaCl and PEG. The conditions for the hypo- iso- and hyper-osmotic media for all cell culture experiments were defined as 220, 281 and 381 mOsm/kg, respectively.<br/>In 2D cell culture, hypo- or hyper-osmolality did not stimulate a significant change in surface marker expression of activation markers CD40, CD80, CD83, CD86, CD197 and HLA-DR compared to the non-activated control. This suggests that osmolality alone was not sufficient to modulate the inflammatory phenotype. Hereafter, the effect of osmolality on maturation with Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was investigated. Exposure to hypo- or hyper-osmolality in 2D moDC culture with LPS as maturation factor, showed no significant difference in expression of CD40, CD80, CD83, CD86, CD197 and HLA-DR compared to the activated control. However, a trend was observed in hyper-osmotic medium with PEG and NaCl, where moDCs showed a decrease of CD40 and HLA-DR expression in the PEG condition and a decrease of CD197 in the NaCl condition. This suggests that hyper-osmolality could attenuate the activating capacity of LPS and depending on the osmolyte, can potentially decrease T cell activation or migration of moDCs. Functional analyses such as mixed lymphocyte reaction and migration assays may elucidate if hyper-osmolality can affect moDC T cell activation and migration. For cell culture in 3D microenvironment, the mechanical properties of fracture hematoma were modelled using alginate hydrogels to gain an understanding of the behaviour of DCs during bone healing. Low molecular weight alginate was used to mimic the stress relaxation behaviour. Stiffness was tuned trough ionic crosslinking concentration. The resulting gels had a stiffness of 8±0.3 kPa and stress-relaxation half-time of 199.7±10.8 s. In these 3D microenvironments during LPS maturation, hypo- or hyper-osmolality did not show a significant change in expression of CD40, CD80, CD83, CD86, CD197 and HLA-DR compared to the activated control. This suggests that moDCs were not sensitive to osmolality during maturation with LPS in 3D microenvironments. Comparing the outcomes of 3D to 2D cell culture, moDCs appeared less sensitive to changes in environmental osmolality during LPS maturation in 3D than on 2D substrates.<br/><br/>Overall, for both the 2D and 3D studies, a larger cohort of donors is needed to improve confidence in the results. Based on the trends observed, the outcome of the study does not indicate that osmolality could be used in 3D microenvironments to modulate the inflammatory phenotype of moDCs, as activation markers remained largely unaffected. In 2D cell culture, hyper-osmolality could modulate the inflammatory phenotype of moDCs during maturation with LPS through downregulation of activation markers. Osmolality should be considered when designing immunomodulatory treatments, as osmolality might affect DC maturation in 2D cell culture.","monocyte-derived dendritic cells; 3D microenvironments; surface markers; inflammation; osteoimmunology; bone regeneration; dendritic cells; osmolality; immunomodulation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","The mass production of lithium-ion batteries used in, for instance, electric vehicles led to significant cost reductions. However, concerns are emerging about the availability of resources and the environmental impact of the production. Metal-air batteries use more resource-efficient materials and potentially have higher energy densities than lithium-ion batteries. A little over a decade ago, a promising new type of metal-air battery was discovered, the silicon-air (Si-air) battery. <br/>The Si-air battery uses a c-Si anode and a porous air cathode, combined with a liquid electrolyte. Si-air batteries have a theoretical cell potential up to 2.2 V and a very high theoretical energy density of 8,470 Wh/kg. However, Si-air batteries that use alkaline electrolytes, such as potassium hydroxide (KOH), are not rechargeable and the Si anode suffers from passivation and corrosion. Currently, corrosion is considered as the dominant factor that limits the conversion efficiency of alkaline Si-air batteries. In this work, the role of the electrons participating in the corrosion reaction is further investigated. This is based on a model where electron transfer is considered as a rate-limiting step. The research objective of this work is the mitigation of the corrosion reaction in alkaline Si-air batteries through nonuniform doping of the Si anode.<br/><br/>The corrosion in the Si-air battery setup was first quantified for uniformly doped c-Si. These results function as reference to nonuniformly doped Si. The corrosion rates for uniformly doped n-type and p-type Si using 6.6M KOH were found to be constant at 1.25 µm/h and lower than the 2.2 µm/h measured in previous research. This lower corrosion rate increased the conversion efficiency from 2.0% to 3.4%, corresponding to a specific capacity of 130 mAh/gSi. Based on these results, corrosion in Si-air batteries is still significant.<br/>Nonuniformly doped wafers were made by depositing thin impurity layers on c-Si through PECVD or epitaxial growth. Subsequently, drive-in of the impurity atoms into the c-Si was performed at a temperature of 1250°C for 36 hours. The shape and junction depth of the dopant profiles were verified by the four-point probe and spreading resistance profiling. These results show the presence of doping profiles with junction depths up to 36 µm.<br/>In the samples made with PECVD, corrosion slightly increased in nonuniformly doped p-type and n-type Si with respect to uniformly doped Si. However, the corrosion is not clearly affected by the implemented doping profiles. For nonuniformly doped p-type Si samples made with epitaxial growth, corrosion clearly decreased to 0.82 µm/h compared to 1.25 µm/h with uniformly doped Si. Corrosion decreases by having a high boron concentration above 2·10^19 atoms/cm^3 in the Si and not through the implementation of a dopant profile. <br/>It is concluded that nonuniform doping does not affect the corrosion in alkaline Si-air batteries and, therefore, does not mitigate the corrosion reaction.<br","Silicon-air; Battery; Alkaline battery; Nonuniform doping","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-07-18","","","","","",""

However, the nutrition-health assessment in the CONE-LCA framework quantifies the health impacts of food at the level of food items with the use of an indicator that is based on only few nutrients and otherwise broad food groups. Given that food items within food groups can have different impacts on health, disaggregating health impacts can be of added value and was explored here. An extended version of the Nutrients Rich Food index is used for both downscaling and cluster analysis.<br/><br/>The correlation coefficient at the aggregated levels with the NRF index (-0.93) was substantially higher than the original health impact indicator of food items with the NRF index (0.36). These results illustrate that the use of a downscaled indicator improves the health impact assessment of food items. The downscaling analysis showed that downscaled health impacts can differ substantially between food items within food groups. Furthermore, the cluster analysis showed that some food groups (e.g. fruits, vegetables and red meat) are highly variable in nutrient density and therefore prioritizing these food groups for clustering can be of added value in future epidemiological studies. <br/><br/>The improved nutrition health assessment model is not only relevant within the CONE-LCA framework but can be used on its own to assess health impacts of food items. The model may be very useful in policy applications as it enables comparison of food items on impact on human health and the environment, which can be the basis for sustainable dietary guidelines.

The research for geological disposal of radioactive waste focuses on the construction and durability of a geologic disposal facility in Dutch clays or salts. One of the challenges is assessing these host rocks’ capability to retard radionuclides and prevent them from entering the biosphere. This research focuses on disposal in clay. Because of clay’s low permeability, water movements are slow, and radionuclides transport is expected to occur predominantly by diffusion. The Peize and Waalre formations, situated on the interface between brackish and salt groundwater, serve as a natural analogue for targeted deeper, poorly indurated host rocks. The known disparity in chlorine levels between the aquifers adjacent to these clays qualify these formations for NaCl-tracer research. A cutting sampling study determined the conductivity of these clays’ porewater. Combining this with a one-dimensional modelling study, the saline history of this formation has been simulated. NaCl gradients were demonstrated at different drilling locations. The most manifested gradient is attempted to fit in the one-dimensional model. The model results suggest that this gradient originates from adjacent aquifer salinity, the clays’ physical properties and the difference in hydraulic head. The observed salinity discrepancy between aquifers and ion concentration gradient in the firstWaalre Clay confirm the assumption that the member can be a natural analogue. Uncertainty on the continuity of the total system prohibits concluding that diffusion-dominated transport in Dutch poorly indurated clays can be assumed. The best fitting scenario this research found fitting the empirical Waalre clay salinity curve is combined transport by diffusion and advection. The finding of diffusion-advection transport implies that the Waalre clay shows more complexity than initially expected.","Nuclear waste disposal; Natural analogue; Diffusion; Clay; Salt","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Earth Sciences","",""

The increase in temperature of the cells leads to lower open circuit voltage and higher short circuit current ultimately leading to a lower power output due to a negative thermal coefficient. Hence, lowering the temperature of commercial crystalline silicon modules during their operation becomes desirable, as it increases the system's energy yield and prolongs the module's lifespan. Throughout the years several attempts have been made to decrease the temperature of PV modules, characterized my two main groups of cooling techniques, active and passive cooling techniques. Active cooling techniques require additional power to cool the panels whereas passive cooling techniques rely on natural convection and require no additional power input. In this thesis, we experimentally investigate the cooling potential of a novel passive cooling method that integrates an internal heat sink into PV modules. The basic idea of the technology is to create a thermal circuit beneath the solar cell that allows for the extraction of the heat directly from the solar cell to the outside environment. The experiments started on a single solar cell, to find the best configuration. We adapted the optimized design onto a 2x2 PV and a 3x3 PV module. Finally, the internal heat sinks were connected to a frame. We observed a temperature reduction of around 4-5°C on the module with the internal heat sink compared to a Standard module under the same environmental conditions.","Internal; Heatsink; Temperature reduction; Heat extraction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-07-15","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

The proposed approach integrates a complex offline biomechanical model with a collaborative, industrial robot arm and an impedance controller. The model is used for computing rotator-cuff tendon strain as a function of human shoulder configuration, muscle activation and external forces. This subject- and injury-specific data is stored in \textit{strain maps}, which represent the relationship between the strains and shoulder DoFs. In our previous work, we implemented strain maps to preplan minimal strain, safe trajectories using two shoulder DoFs, and used the corresponding robot-mediated movement for passive trajectory following for healthy subjects. This work expands on that by implementing two novel functionalities: 1) patient-led movement, and 2) adding the third shoulder DoF and the corresponding control complexities, while still controlling for safe rotator-cuff tendon strains. For patient-led movement, we precomputed unsafe zones for each strain map by clustering and fitting ellipses to the clusters. These unsafe areas with increased risk of (re-)injury are then used to set the impedance control parameters and reference pose for real-time biomechanical safety control. By linearly interpolating between strain maps, smooth and safe movement of the third shoulder DoF is added. The resulting robot control torques guide the patient away from unsafe, high strain shoulder poses in real-time during patient-led movement. The proposed method has the potential to improve the safety, Range of Motion, and muscle activity that the patients receive through robot-mediated physical therapy. The main advantage of this approach is that the patient is free to use and explore their full shoulder RoM, while the robot controls and manages biomechanical safety in real-time. To validate the proposed method, we performed two experiments showcasing two novel functionalities, and a third experiment as proof-of-concept displaying the full method.","Impedance control; Biomechanical Model; shoulder rehabilitation; collaborative robot; rotator-cuff rehabilitation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

The research was conducted in collaboration with Signify, a company that creates smart home luminaires for the brand Philips Hue. The goal of the project was to create design guidelines which the designers of Signify can use to create textile building blocks for their luminaires. <br/><br/>The project explores suitable textiles, shaping possibilities and fastening methods. The most relevant insights are summarized on “Design Guidelines” pages. A “Design Decision Tree” (DDT) was created to navigate through the Design Guidelines. The DDT can be used by designers who have a housing shape in mind to learn about the relevant insights for applying textile to their specific surface.<br/><br/>Suitable textiles for surface application are researched. It was determined that knitted and woven fabrics are suitable for surface coverage. Non-woven fabrics are not because of their undesired appearance and minimal required thickness which impedes mechanical fastening.<br/><br/>Shaping possibilities were explored for covering surfaces with flat sheets of fabric as well as covering continuous surfaces with tubular textiles. Depending on the properties of a surface, certain fabrics and fastening methods can or cannot be used. The design limitations per surface category are summarized in the Design Guidelines.<br/><br/>Most current textile housings are fabricated by gluing or welding the textiles to the outer surface and inner edges of the part. This method obstructs easy disassembly. An alternative method was created. This “clamping” fastening method is considered more sustainable because it allows the housing to be disassembled with ease and therefor repaired or recycled more efficiently. A clear use cue was added to the inside of the clamping mechanism to inform the user about its disassembly potential. <br/><br/>In addition to the gluing and clamping method, creating a separate sleeve was explored. To fabricate such a sleeve, 3D-knitting can be used. Literature research was conducted to explore the possibilities of knitting three-dimensional shapes on flatbed and circular knitting machines to cover product housings. <br/><br/>A novel product concept for Philips Hue was created. A prototype of the concept was made to demonstrate textile building blocks in the context of a luminaire. This product concept is called the “Rotation Lamp” and it is used as a tool throughout the report for experimenting and validating. The Rotation Lamp is inviting to touch because of its textile parts. It is intended to be kept close to the user and to enhance their well-being by providing them with a lamp that suits their need for ambience and functional light.

Currently, T-Minus Engineering B.V. aims to develop a custom flight termination system for the Dart payload stage of their DART XL sounding rocket. A sounding rocket is by definition sub-orbital, so an important safety constraint is its impact location. Based on this impact location, an advice can be formed for a range safety officer (RSO) to base flight termination decisions on. Therefore, the objective of this thesis is creating an algorithm to predict the instantaneous impact point (IIP) of the DART XL's ballistic payload stage in near real-time during a launch, considering impact probability area boundaries and requirements for the accuracy and update rate.<br/><br/>To meet this objective, two separate models were created. The first was a pre-flight nominal trajectory model aimed at evaluating the nominal vehicle trajectory and thereby producing inputs and verification tools to assist the development of the second model. The second model, the in-flight IIP prediction model, is intended to run during a DART XL launch to continuously predict the ballistic trajectory and IIP of the Dart stage in the post-separation phase. An important element of developing both models is determining the model definitions. The final environment model selection consists of a US76 atmospheric model, a central gravity model including the J2 effect, a local wind model and a rotating, ellipsoidal Earth model. Furthermore, using 3-degrees of freedom (3-DoF) for the IIP prediction model resulted in IIP predictions close to those predicted using a nominal trajectory model of more degrees of freedom.<br/>Additionally, an Euler integrator with a step-size of 0.1 s was used for the IIP prediction model. With this step-size, the IIP prediction model successfully met the computation time requirement of an update rate below 1 s. For the accuracy requirement, the IIP prediction model shall only include parameters that influence the prediction in the order of 1 km. This requirement was successfully met using the step-size of 0.1 s, with a distance to a verification IIP of less than 600 m.<br/>Lastly, the nominal impact point distribution was determined by performing Monte Carlo simulations of the pre-flight nominal trajectory model. The resulting IIP distribution was used to determine the 3-σ impact probability area, which serves as a measure of the uncertainty of the nominal impact point.<br/><br/>It should be noted that uncertainties remain in this nominal prediction larger than the desired 1 km accuracy radius. However, it is unlikely that the uncertainty of the nominal IIP prediction can be decreased below a radius of 1 km due to the inherent unpredictability of launch conditions. The overall conclusion is therefore that the thesis work has successfully developed a model for the near real-time instantaneous impact point prediction of the DART XL sounding rocket's Dart payload stage.","Flight Termination System; Trajectory simulation; Impact point prediction; Sounding rocket; Trajectory Prediction; Monte Carlo","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-07-15","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

However, long-distance entanglement generation is challenging because of two reasons: photon loss occurs as an exponential function of distance through an optical fiber and the no-cloning theorem prevent us from directly amplifying the photons. Therefore, quantum repeaters that enable long-distance communication to realize quantum information-based protocols are desired. One way to achieve a higher entanglement generation rate is to make many attempts of generating entangled states in parallel, a process known as time-multiplexing. There has been previous work investigating the performance of time-multiplexed entanglement generation using processing nodes, but only at the elementary link level. Furthermore, this analysis was restricted to the rate of entanglement generation, with no concern for the fidelity. In this work, we go further by investigating both the fidelity and the rate of entanglement generation of time-multiplexed protocols by analyzing the secret key rate (SKR) of quantum key distribution. Moreover, we also study setups with one and two repeaters. Specifically, we investigate the impact of different hardware parameters on the SKR. Among other results, we conclude that swap gate time is a key factor for achieving higher SKR. We also examine what effect different repeater-chain protocols have on the performance of repeater chains with limited hardware resources. We find that having the repeater send photons in alternating fashion towards both end nodes results in a higher SKR than generating entanglement sequentially. Besides, we investigate what is the most efficient distribution of communication qubit (CQ) in a protocol with multiple repeaters. We ascertain that the repeater chain setup in which the number of CQs in a node is equal to that node's number of neighbors makes best use of its resources.","quantum internet; Time-multiplexed protocol; Entanglement generation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Engineering","",""

When an external magnetic field is applied, these magnetized particles will align themselves to this magnetic field, straining the elastomer in a specific shape. Once the magnetic field is removed, the elastic properties of the elastomer pull the object back to its original shape. <br/>This report describes the work done on the development of a 4D printer, in which the shape change of the MSM objects is programmed during manufacturing by controlling the orientation of the pre-magnetized particles in the still uncured silicone. An external dual extrusion system is used to mix a two component silicone during 4D printing, so that the material cures upon hitting the build plate, while staying liquid during printing. The goal of developing a reliable system capable of extruding and printing the highly viscose magnetic material was however not achieved, as the extrusion motors lacked the needed force and the system was not rigid enough to deal with the high pressures involved. Adoption of a new printer design in which the path from extruder to build plate is severely limited is recommended. <br/>In addition, a literature review has been conducted into applications of generic shape memory materials (SMM), metamaterials and magnetic soft materials with the purpose to draw inspiration from proposed applications of these materials for a novel MSM application design. It was found that MSM applications showed many overlaps with SMM and metamaterials, but that there were also some gaps in the reported application proposals of MSM where SMM and metamaterials are currently used for. MSM could be a valuable material used for (haptic) communication and texture change. More (indirect) relations with MSM, SMM and metamaterials have been identified which could serve as inspiration for future projects. <br/>Lastly, a novel demonstrator concept design has been developed that shows the unique fast and multi-directional characteristics of MSM, using the findings of the literature review and the use of the Material Driven Design method. With additional input from peer students in a workshop, the idea of a 3-way changing texture is proposed. This texture utilizes specific magnetization patterns in an array of MSM actuators to generate two texture variations depending on the direction of the applied magnetic field, in addition to a neutral state when the field is removed. Its feasibility is proven by small scale prototypes.<br/>This project has been the second time this material has been researched at the Faculty of Industrial Design Engineering at the Delft University of Technology, building upon previously delivered work and paves a path for further iterations on manufacturing and design of applications of the magnetic soft material. <br","Shape memory materials; Magnetic Soft Materials; shape morphing; Composite Material; 4D Printing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

(mentor); Smaragdakis, G. (graduation committee); Iosifidis, G. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Research has shown that the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is vulnerable to a new attack that exploits the community attribute. These community attacks can influence BGP routing in unintended ways. Currently, there are no effective mitigations against these attacks which do not limit the normal usage of BGP communities or offer cryptographic authorization of community values. In this thesis, we are the first to design and evaluate a new Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) object that provides these properties, called a Route Community Authorization (RCA). Autonomous Systems (ASes) can sign and upload an RCA that includes which communities are authorized to be used and under which conditions to reduce the attack surface. The approach does not alter BGP itself and ASes that deploy the security solution can verify if route announcements with community values are allowed to use those communities. With the RPKI construction of our solution, cryptographic operations are offloaded from the router to a separate server. This is because most BGP routers deployed on the internet are not capable yet of performing cryptographic operations on every announcement.<br/><br/>We simulate attack scenarios and evaluate the developed solution to see if it is a viable option to be deployed on the internet. The results show that the developed solution can block the community attacks, on the condition that ASes have properly configured the RCA and at least the target, or an AS between the attacker and the target, deploys the solution. If ASes configure the RCAs too broad, then there is still room for an attacker to abuse the community values. We show that the performance of the solution using properly configured RCAs can keep up with the rate of announcements seen on the internet. Since experiments were performed in simulations, additional experiments are needed in the future on hardware routers and by ASes on the internet to see if the results are the same. The biggest issue for the developed solution is the initial adoption by ASes since security benefits are low in the beginning, but increase once more ASes participate.<br/><br/>Once deployed BGP routers can handle cryptographic operations on every announcement, we suggest using BGPsec and extending it to include the community attribute. Using a BGPsec approach will improve security and provide integrity of the community attribute, which RCA does not provide.","BGP; Security; Communities; RPKI; Exploits","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science | Cyber Security","",""

The goal of this research is to better define diversity, its dimensions and effects, and the ways in which projects are affected by it. This investigation assists in the creation of a set of guidelines, which can be used to assess the current levels of diversity, and which also lead to suggestions that minimize the negative and maximize its positive influence. To accomplish this, the research question is formulated as follows: “How are projects affected by diversity in the project teams?” The design of the research is divided in three phases. Firstly, an extensive literature review revealed the dimensions that are considered and the effects that are generated. Secondly, the development of a questionnaire explored the view of diversity and its effects in practice. A statistical analysis discovered the statistically significant relationships and patterns. Finally, an evaluation process aimed to better explain the findings and provide some insights in how certain conditions are managed. The diversity dimensions’ matrix that was developed through the literature review assisted in the formation of the first, broad definition of diversity in literature. Through the statistical analysis, the number of dimensions was decreased by removing the ones that were considered either irrelative or not even present in the project teams. The investigation of the effects of diversity followed, along with their connection to the dimensions that mainly trigger them. As proved, effects are triggered by either the most present dimensions or by dimensions of special significance. Most of the effects recorded do have a positive influence on the atmosphere of the team and the performance of the project, by achieving for instance better team cohesion and coordination, cooperation, decision-making and creativity. As indicated in the findings, diversity should be further explored. The proposed guidelines can be used to recognize the levels of diversity in the project team and the effects that might be triggered. In this way, the ones that cause negative influence can be managed to boost the atmosphere of the project team and the project performance. The process followed could be repeated by applying some alterations that will assist in the deeper investigation of the variables. For example, the implementation of the guidelines in real projects would verify or reject the findings, leading to the creation of a more extensive guidelines or even a framework. Similar research can also be designed, by changing the way the effects are defined. Professionals could also start applying the guidelines, aiming to recognize the mechanism and control the triggered effects efficiently. Furthermore, the onboarding process followed by new employees and the team bonding are some aspects that should be handled carefully. Investing time and other resources related to these aspects should be among the priorities, since the influence on the team and project aspects is significant.<br","Diversity; Workplace; Projects","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2025-07-15","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

(mentor); Root, B.C. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Crater counting is the main method used to determine the age of a planetary surface. This method relies on knowing the cratering rate to estimate the absolute age of a surface. However, two theories currently exist for impact cratering of the moons in the Saturnian system, one suggesting that the majority of the impactors are of heliocentric origin (i.e. they come from orbits around the Sun), and the other suggesting that the majority of impactors are of planetocentric origin (i.e. they originate from orbits around Saturn). The different theories result in very different surface ages of the icy moons. According to the heliocentric model, the surface of Titan would date to ~3 Ga, while according to the planetocentric model the surface of Titan could be dated between ~15 Ma and ~4 Ga, allowing for much more erosion of the surface according to Bell (2020). Given that these two orbits result in different impact velocities, this work attempts to discover if the impact velocity can be determined for impactors on icy moons based on crater characteristics, such as crater depth and diameter, by recreating impacts in the lab.<br/><br/>Previous impact experiments have been performed with different impactors and target materials. This study aims at expanding previous research by performing tests on icy particles, something not done before. The data obtained from experiments are then used to obtain the estimated impactor diameter that created craters on the surface of these icy moons based on the expected impact velocities. This data can then be used to predict the likelihood of an impactor originating from either a heliocentric or planetocentric orbit.<br/><br/>This work developed several methods to produce impact craters using different instruments and different surfaces. The best results were obtained either with the gas gun and ice blocks or with the drop tower and icy particles. Using the scaling relationships found in this work, it was shown that the required impactor diameter can be obtained from craters on icy moons and that a distinction can be made between planetocentric and heliocentric impactors. However, more work is needed to narrow down the scaling relationship to obtain a reasonable impactor diameter given a certain impact crater. More information about the crater, such as the transition of ice type during an impact, should be used in the future to further constrain the velocity ranges.","impact craters; icy moons; moon formation; ices","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

To make sure predictions are done well, it is necessary to make sure they are not influenced by effects of the field on which they are planted. These field effects or spatial effects are in practice often quite complicated and can be due to a wide variety of reasons. To get a better view of these field effects a good mathematical model is desired. In this paper a model is presented which helps to find these field effects. This model tries to estimate the field effect by comparing data of the same plant on different positions of the field. Data is obtained in a finite amount of positions, which means that the model finds the field effect in a finite amount of positions as well. This field effect is found using a cross-validation technique obtained from Tikhonov regularization. The field effect in a finite amount of positions is extended to a field effect in every position of the field. To do this in a good way a kernel method is used, the advantage of which is that it does not depend on a mesh. This kernel method is here applied with a kernel function that is based on Gaussian distribution. This model is applied to several fields of crops to get a view of the performance of the model on real data.","Kernel method; Regularization; Field effect; Field effect removal","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics","",""

We prove existence and uniqueness of solutions to the smooth problem related to the Stokes equation which is given by -PΔu = f, where P is the Helmholtz projection. By means of the Lax-Milgram theorem it is found that this problem has a unique strong solution in a certain class of weighted Sobolev spaces if the opening angle θ is small enough. Direct application of the Lax-Milgram theorem would normally only yield a weak solution. However, by introducing additional bilinear forms we gain control on all second order derivatives and therewith obtain a strong solution.

Putting an end to the use of fossil fuel-powered cars is broadly considered critical to reduce transport impacts on climate change. Using sustainable transport modalities will have an important role in meeting the international agreements created to fight climate change and improve air quality. Sustainable transport modalities can be used to replace private cars. Hence, it is important to consider widely implementing sustainable transport modality policies. The sustainable transport modalities considered in this study are walking, cycling, public transport, and shared mobility. Lowering the parking norms is desirable because oversupply of parking spaces attracts more car use and ownership. Parking norms are currently used during area development to determine the number of parking spaces that will need to be built for a particular function in a specific area. Offering sustainable transport modalities instead of car parking spaces will result in using the available area more efficiently, and contribute to a more sustainable living environment. Currently, integration of sustainable transport modality policies in parking challenges is not studied and not applied very often, and if it is applied, it is based on customization in a specific municipality. This research was conducted to address why the integration is not yet widely adopted in a standardized manner, and because currently, the starting point for area development remains the private car....","Decision-making; Policy; Parking norm; Sustainable transport modality; framework","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

However, the non-propulsive loss of cryogenic propellants sustained in missions that feature multiple boost phases can quickly become prohibitive. These losses limit the efficacy of cryogenic stages for a wide array of mission profiles.<br/>A cryogenic stage is typically optimized for the characteristic challenges imposed by the most prominent mission in the portfolio offered by the launch service provider. The payload performance of this stage is then inevitably suboptimal for the other missions in the portfolio. This performance penalty can be addressed by introducing complementary or supplementary hardware elements into the stage architecture. A new configuration of the stage is then created using a combination of such elements, known as a kit. KOTUS addresses a need to determine the optimal kit for every mission profile at a conceptual level in an expedient manner. This can help to steer the design in the optimal direction from the onset. The tool is capable of performing this analysis for an arbitrarily defined mission, stage, and liquid bi-propellant combination.<br/>In this work, the processes that are relevant to the payload performance analysis are discussed, along with the methods used in the modeling efforts of these processes. This includes the absorbed heat fluxes through insulation, attitude control and propellant orientation, propellant conditioning and pressurization, and feed line management. The agglomeration of these processes allow the modeling of the performance of a baseline stage when embarking on any mission. A set of elements was subsequently curated that can be equipped either individually or in combination with others to this baseline stage. The elements chosen are primarily focused on enhancing the operational performance of the stage by reducing non-propulsive losses. The integrated element set includes various insulation options, boost pumps, feed line heat exchangers, vapor-cooled shields, and thermodynamic venting systems. The modeling efforts for each of these elements and their individual impact on the upper stage relative to the baseline configuration is discussed at length. Sensitivity studies of uncertain input parameters and correction factors were conducted, as well as sub-model validations, to provide an indication of the tool’s credibility.<br/>Results showed that for medium duration missions with one or more restarts, payload performance enhancements upwards of 100 kg are possible when a deployable sun shield is added to the baseline configuration. The degree to which the sun shield is able to limit absorbed heat flows allowed it to drastically reduce non-propulsive losses. For single boost missions, only the limiting of thermal residuals was demonstrated to be relevant to enhancing the payload performance of the stage. This was shown to be best accomplished through the use of a feed line heat exchanger in the LH2 feed line and a turbine-driven boost pump in the LOX feed line, the combination of which is estimated to enable an extra payload mass of 103 kg. In addition, it was shown that the default pressurization setup of the reference stage (i.e., the heterogeneous pressurization of the LOX tank and autogenous pressurization of the LH2 tank) was already optimal, and that no tank or feed line sizing changes would be beneficial.<br/>The potential for the deployment of hardware kits has been demonstrated. Even short duration, single boost missions were shown to be able to benefit from tailor-made kit configurations, though the potential for payload performance enhancement is significantly larger for medium to long duration missions, particularly those featuring multiple engine restarts. A number of future work recommendations are listed in the conclusion, chief among them to verify the assumptions made in this work and to improve the determination of thermal residuals through enhanced knowledge of incident heat fluxes and spatial energy distributions in the propellant.","propellant; cryogenic; management; kit; optimization; payload performance; upper stage","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-07-14","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Benchmark tests were conducted for different propellers under different lighting and background conditions, varying the observation distance and spinning frequency. The different tests were evaluated on event count, frequency, and clustering, as these are the most characteristic properties of the propeller-generated signal. A propeller detection metric was derived as a fuzzy classifier to assess detectability. It was observed that the sensor employed is limiting the detection range due to low resolution, with a maximum detection range of 75 cm. While at low spinning frequencies it is possible to detect the propeller at such distance, for higher frequences (6000 to 8000 RPMs) the range decreases to 45 cm for the tests with highest blade to background contrast and two-blade propellers. It was observed that lower contrasts reduce the successful detections only to low frequencies, and three-blade propellers become completely indetectable due to the static overlap between the blades. Therefore, it is concluded that, at this stage of the technology, the use case of event cameras for relative sensing is constrained to close distances with high contrast.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

(mentor); Kamp, Linda (graduation committee); Khodaei, H. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","In 2021, China is already the largest electric vehicle (EV) market with more than half of global sales. Compared to the situation ten years ago, EV development in China has experienced a huge growth almost from nothing. This development is a complex socio-technical transition process, which cannot be simplified as technology progress or business success. Therefore, based on the framework of multi-level perspective (MLP), this thesis aims to study how the socio-technical transition for EVs in China take place from the perspective of interactions and dynamics. The literature, reports, news and policy documents related to EV development and vehicle industry in China are collected, and the collected data and information are sorted and categorized into different elements for analyzing and proposing the interrelationships of these elements and how they change. The typical and significant findings and insights of the analysis are validated by semi-structured interviews with experts. A set of interaction mechanisms based on the MLP framework is proposed to explain how dynamics emerge and affect the socio-technical transition, and the effect of interactions on the transition is also conceptualized. The main findings of this thesis show how the socio-technical transition take place: Energy security and oil price are secondary landscape factors to drive the transition, and the smog issue and climate change emerge in succession as dominant landscape factors. The former opens a window of opportunity for early commercialization of EVs in China, the latter directly initiates the boom in EVs. The pressure from landscape developments makes the government, car manufacturers, consumers and the public have to make responses, which are or lead to element dynamics, such as the transformation of public perception and opinion on carbon emissions. Due to that there are interactions among these elements, more element dynamics are generated, such as intelligent and networking development of EVs. These element dynamics participate in the process of industry environment reshaping, industry layout adjustments and industry resource reallocation to further prompt the transition process, which helps EVs gradually gain socio-technical advantages and quickly penetrate the vehicle market.","electric vehicles; socio-technical transition; multi-level perspective; interactions; dynamics; interviews","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

(mentor); Bodewes, H.H. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","This thesis is initiated by the Reinier Haga Orthopaedic Centre (RHOC) and shows the creation of a patient-centred healthcare network for orthopaedic hand and wrist care. A healthcare network can be defined as a group of interconnected stakeholders that directly or indirectly influence the patient’s care. In this project, the involved stakeholders are people undergoing treatment for their hand and wrist and healthcare providers from seven disciplines; orthopaedic surgeons, hand therapists, general practitioners, plaster technicians, orthopaedic instrument makers, rheumatologists and rehabilitation physicians. A literature review and a user research study sketch the context and underlying problem. The context is shaped by ongoing developments that cause an increase in the care demand, an increase in healthcare costs, empowered patients and digitalisation. This asks for care that is efficient and gives patients more control. Currently, both are lacking in orthopaedic hand and wrist care. The user research, which consists of interviews with the stakeholders, shows that patients are not feeling involved, and inefficient guidelines and lack of cooperation prevent an efficient treatment process. The hand and wrist is a speciality within the medical field of orthopaedics. It entails a wide range of care disciplines that could benefit a well-connected network, which is currently missing. This prevents effective cooperation, which research showed would lead to more efficient and improved care, fewer treatment sessions and a reduction in costs (Ypinga, 2018). The developed design aims to create more involvement of the stakeholders in the orthopaedic hand and wrist care and active participation of the patient. This design is developed through ideation using the “How-Tos” method, which resulted in three ideas that three healthcare providers reviewed. This approach gave insight into the aspects that were perceived as most relevant by them. These were: an overview of the whole treatment, which helps in contacting other healthcare providers, holistic treatment and patient involvement. In addition, allowing patients to set a goal for their treatment allows for more control and better treatment. With this input, the concept of WegWijs is developed and evaluated with patients. WegWijs means to be wise, informed and in control in healthcare. It provides all the stakeholders with the knowledge needed to create a holistic and patient-centred care process by providing an overview of the treatment process and the involved parties. The patient actively shapes their treatment by formulating a treatment goal and cocreating their treatment plan with the doctor. The care providers remain actively involved throughout the process and in close contact with each other, creating a well-connected healthcare network. Two patients and two healthcare providers validated these aspects. The established implementation strategy outlines the required steps that include the co-creation of new protocols and the execution of a pilot. However, further research is needed to develop this concept and implement it in the RHOC, and eventually in the wider healthcare system.","Patient-centred; Healthcare; Networked care; Collaboration; Orthopaedic; Patient participation; Reinier Haga Orthopedisch Centrum","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Every human being and every conscious life form on this planet aims to be happy. Happiness is something everyone is after - consciously or unconsciously. People try to ‘achieve’ it through various actions that are meaningful to them. There are many definitions and interpretations of happiness. Gautam Buddha wisely once said- “There is no path to happiness, happiness is the path.” One tends to naturally wonder whether happiness is a journey, a state, a ‘thing’ to be achieved or is it an object of value? It can best be defined as a state for which certain preconditions are necessary. Many scholars have studied how Architecture and Urban spaces influence our state of happiness.<br/>This project aimed to create positive design interventions in the transition space of the Faculty of Industrial Design Engineering, TU Delft. These interventions will provide moments of happiness and support a positive state of mind during the daily journey of users across the transition space. The project aimed to find out how best to apply the 20 Urban Happiness Ingredients tool set by Samavati and<br/>Desmet (2021)4 to design a transition experience. Insights from Generative Research were used to conduct Research through Design that used a Positive Design Approach. The main insights found were that the users of the IDE transition space needed to feel the fundamental human needs of security, autonomy and stimulation while in transition. A number of ideation iterations led to the conception of an arch that supported those three needs. The arch was chosen as the embodiment of those needs because historically, it has always been a powerful metaphor for communicating and aiding transition. It allows the bi-directional nature of a transition to be a function, it has deep cultural meanings and it has the ability to frame a great view.<br/>The result of this graduation project is a spatial installation (or spatial product) called ‘Waves of Happiness’. It creates several moments of joy through the interactions that have been designed. The meaning created by the design is that the users must choose to take a meaningful pause while in transition to momentarily forget their worries by experiencing pleasure. These moments of pleasure remind one of pleasant memories such as childhood. The design also builds upon the need for users to practice self reflection and fulfil the virtue of self-care. The form and aesthetics of the design played an important role in satisfying the universal need for beauty. Computational Design techniques were used to design the structure depicting the ‘Waves of Happiness’. User feedback indicated that the users would exit the designed transition experience with a positive state of mind after having experienced moments of joy. <br/>‘Compatibility with needs and desires of users’, Interactive and fascinating design’, ‘Multisensory richness experiences’, ‘Place identity, memorability &amp; city image’ and ‘Aesthetic qualities’ were the 5 main Urban Happiness Ingredients used in the design. The project ended with a discussion on how these ingredients can be applied better to transition experience design and what this master thesis project contributed to the domain of transition experience design.","Happiness; Transition Space; positive design; Urban Happiness Ingredients; Research through Design; Generative research; Arch; Design for Emotion","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","","52.001670, 4.370155"

It investigates the behavioural change caused by the new policy using Dutch stated preference discrete choice data. Two stated choice experiments are performed, one exploring the demand for privately used alternative fuel vehicles and one on the modal shift for one-person trips with varying distances. A mixed logit model was applied to determine to what extent specific groups were price-sensitive to the kilometer charge. We find that well-educated,high-income people, who either frequently use their car or own a business car, are more incentivised by the kilometer charge to purchase alternative fuel vehicles. In general, people value purchase prices over the kilometer charge and range. Moreover, it turns out that these groups are willing to purchase a substantially more expensive car in exchange for a lower variable kilometer charge. By applying a multinomial logit model for all distances in the mode choice experiment, we find that the least sensitive group towards the kilometer charge for a modal shift are high-educated, older, commuting car users that live relatively far away from the nearest train station. Furthermore, the larger the travel distance, the higher The value of travel time savings ranges from 4.44 - 14.00 euro for distances including train and car whilst small city trips with bike and car as mode alternatives have a value of 6.86 euro. The found behavioural effects were used to evaluate the impact of constructed scenarios with varying tariffs for the kilometer charge, ultimately showing that an emission-based differentiation can positively affect tax income and emission savings. Besides that, this implementation form is the most supported by the Dutch population. In addition to these substantial insights, this paper makes a contribution by showing how stated preference discrete choice data can enhance the decision-making of such pricing policies.","Road Pricing; Discrete Choice Modeling; Stated preference; Survey; Kilometer charge; Car fuel-type choice; Mode choice; Tax income; Emissions; Modal shift","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Transport, Infrastructure and Logistics","",""

Especially the installation of offshore wind energy is expected to skyrocket to a total of 2000 GW by 2050. The majority of rights to develop and operate offshore wind farms are allocated through tendering procedures.<br/>In tender procedures, interested parties issue a bid, which includes a subsidy price called strike price at which the party would be willing to accept to develop and operate the wind farm. Lower strike prices increase the chance of winning the tender. In principle, this should lead to the cost-effective deployment of wind energy. However, current wind farm tender designs have been found to cause multiple undesirable results. Understanding the behaviour of the bidding parties that leads to these flaws will help policy makers improve the design of offshore<br/>wind farm tenders to counteract this.<br/>Current modelling methods have failed to incorporate the influence of bounded rationality in the bidding procedure together with a realistic representation of the economic valuation of the tenders, which all bidding organisations conduct. This knowledge gap is addressed in this thesis. This thesis has performed a careful sensitivity analysis on a valuation model provided by the industry to find its influential parameters, developed a coupled model by designing an agent based model and connecting it to an economic valuation model, and conducted exploratory experimentation with the coupled model.<br/>The work presented in this thesis is a proof of concept for using coupled modelling for socio-economic processes with a strategic component. The work contributed to the usage of model coupling in cross-disciplinary studies and encourages the research community to use coupled modelling for socio-economic processes in other domains as well.","coupled modeling; agent based modeling; wind energy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","",""

These types of systems are referred to as discrete event systems (DES), and they consist of jobs that need to be performed at available resources. In an autonomous sorting system, jobs consist of robots receiving and delivering parcels at the correct locations. With scheduling, optimal allocation of the jobs to those resources over time is computed, where the decisions that need to be made are routing, ordering and synchronization. The behaviour of DES is often described by non-linear models, but max-plus linear (MPL) systems are a class of DES that can be described by a model that is linear in the max-plus algebra. This algebra uses two operators maximization and addition. Allowing different routes and switching between orders of jobs extends an MPL system to a switching max-plus linear (SMPL) system. Robots in a sorting system often have many routes to choose from, and need to make order choices with respect to other robots in the system.<br/><br/>In this thesis, a general SMPL model is made for the autonomous sorting system at software company Prime Vision, which can be applied to any sorting area design. The solution to the scheduling problem for the model results in a time schedule for the active robots at the correct locations in the sorting area, as well as the optimal decisions on routing, ordering and synchronization. The optimization problem is solved with a model predictive scheduling (MPS) approach and recast as a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problem. The model is created in Python and the optimization problem is solved with Gurobi. The resulting schedule is visualized with a simulation, in which the decisions of the robots are clearly shown. An idea for implementation of the optimization into the sorting system is given as well.","max-plus algebra; switching max-plus linear system; model predictive scheduling; autonomous sorting system; mixed integer linear programming; Gurobi; Python; discrete event systems; optimization; simulation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-06-28","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Urban wastewater systems can impact the urban ecology by untreated wastewater discharges through combined sewer overflow (CSO) events, or by partial treatment of the wastewater at the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). CSO events can cause oxygen depletion, eutrophication, and the discharge of pathogens. The partial treatment of the wastewater causes an increased concentration of ammonium in the WWTP effluent, which can lead to toxic ammonium levels in the receiving river water. These problems can be (partially) mitigated by optimizing the existing infrastructure. Optimization of the available storage will help handle the increased pressure on the urban drainage system (UDS) and the stricter environmental regulations simultaneously. A method to control the dynamic performance of the combined sewer system is Real-Time Control (RTC). A RTC strategy controls the combined sewer system dynamically based on real-time information about the system state. This research aims to develop a RTC strategy that decreases the negative ecological impact of the combined sewer system on the river by optimizing the available in-sewer volume. By doing so, the objectives to reduce the total amount of spilled CSO volume and to decrease the ammonium peaks towards the WWTP should be met. This research is applied to the case study of Geldrop-Mierlo, this is a municipality located in the UDS of Eindhoven. The trade-off between those two objectives was explored in the Wastewater Process simulator WEST. Rainfall events with a maximum intensity of 3.1 mm/hr and higher or rainfall events with maximum intensity &lt; 3 mm/hr and total rainfall depth of &gt; 4.8 mm, were found to be more likely to cause DO dips. The objective function which is used in the optimization process is dependent on the forecasted rainfall and the trade-off described above. The UDS is modeled in a full-hydrodynamic (FH) model and a simplified conceptual model. The conceptual model is made to reduce the computation time. The catchment of the FH model is split up into 3 different catchments, and each is modeled as a reservoir in the conceptual model. The characteristics of each reservoir are dependent on the characteristics of these catchments in the FH model. The characteristics that are included are storage curve, outflow dynamics, and CSO dynamics. Both models are calibrated and validated. The UDS is controlled with the Model Predictive Control (MPC) methodology using a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to find the optimal solution to minimize the negative ecological impact of the UDS on the river. Both the FH model and simplified model are used in the MPC optimization. Based on the analysis of the case study, the optimization results show that the impact of the MPC procedure on the receiving river is not significant. The reasons for this are location specific, but the main findings are that 1) the hydraulic constraints of the catchments restrict the MPC procedure from working, 2) although the calibration results of the conceptual model indicated accurate results, this does not guarantee that the model is also accurate enough to use in the MPC procedure.","Real Time Control; Combined sewer system; Model predictive control; Urban drainage systems","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Water Management","","51.4598769491441, 5.503510323687421"

We introduce a novel synthesis pipeline - LCT-GAN - an improvement to the current state-of-the-art in tabular data synthesis CTAB-GAN. Our approach addresses the dimensionality explosion problem by introducing a low-dimensional embedding step via an autoencoder prior to training. It is then combined with a novel conditional GAN architecture, operating in latent space. After thorough evaluation, we observe that our solution achieves more than 30\% improvement in certain statistical metrics in comparsion to CTAB-GAN, accompanied by 5 fold decrease in size and 150 times speedup in training time for a single epoch.

Working from home became the norm for almost two years. This has caused the needs and preferences of employees and employers regarding work and the workplace to change for good.<br/><br/>As a result, the common preference for implementing more remote work in the post-pandemic era grew. This combination of remote work and in-office work is named a hybrid strategy. Many services and public sector managers plan to create a hybrid workplace to support these preferences. However, the research toward this post-pandemic office is in its starting blocks. Furthermore, creating a workplace is complex, and no one-size-fits-all solution exists. Managers must find a future workplace that aligns with their organisational beliefs, values, strategy, and assets. How these characteristics are used to transition toward a hybrid workplace remains unclear.<br/><br/>This research aims to understand how organisational characteristics are used to transition to a hybrid workplace. This knowledge can serve as a map for managers planning to initiate a similar transition and as a backbone for further research towards future workplaces.<br/><br/>A literature study first identifies the organisational characteristics by introducing a corporate real estate asset management model. Then, case studies are performed on implemented hybrid workplaces to collect data on how characteristics are used in a transition. Cases are collected from the client pool of the graduation organisation Dev_ real estate, a real estate advisor with experience with hybrid workplaces. Three cases are selected based on various selection criteria. The workplace can be seen as a complex issue. Therefore, a qualitative approach is used to analyse the various perspectives and data sources in-depth. Data is collected from semistructured interviews, exploring the views and experiences of the participants open-endedly. The<br/>participants are the architect, the project manager, the organisational manager, and the employee. Other sources are internal reports and floor plans. The data is collected, reduced, and coded based on the model introduced in the literature. A within-case and cross-case analysis are performed to identify the similarities and differences between the cases and literature.<br/><br/>The analysis identifies a common sequencing of organisation characteristics used in all cases. The research also concludes that the neglect or ignorance of certain characteristics causes the hybrid workplace to remain unaligned with organisational values after completion. Furthermore, the management model used during this research is critically and improved for future post-Covid research.","hybrid; workplace; Corporate Real Estate Management; orkspace; alignment","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Management in the Built Environment","",""

In this study, the GPM DPR Ku-band Level 2A instantaneous observations are compared with continuous measurements from a surface network in the Netherlands for high-intensity precipitation events during summer months. The aim of the research is to gain more insights in the temporal and spatial correspondence of the DPR’s measurements with precipitation occurring on the surface. The surface network consists of 2 C-band weather radars and an automatic gauge network of 33 gauges (approximately 50 km apart). Radar reflectivity factor is one of the prime parameters used for precipitation retrievals from radars and is thus the parameter used for anal- ysis of both the DPR and the weather radar network. Precipitation intensity is the parameter retrieved from the automatic gauge network. Space-borne and surface measurements have vary- ing characteristics, for instance in spatial and temporal resolution, and thus many challenges arise to perform an accurate and qualitative comparison. In this research, data is funneled by selecting high-intensity gauge data with a threshold of 15 mm/h within 40 minutes from GPM scan time within a 2.5 km range from the nearest DPR footprint. Ultimately, 26 high-intensity gauge measurements spread over 18 dates were used in the comparison analyses, selected out of data ranging from May - October for the years 2018 - 2021. The analyses showed that DPR and WR data correspond best in time (average correlation of 0.785) when DPR scantime is within 3 minutes of WR scantime. Also, results showed that instantaneous DPR data can be related to high-intensity gauge observations within a 40 minute time range by use of wind direction and wind speed. Furthermore, it was observed that precipitation performance of DPR is found satisfactory for intensity ≥ 0.5 mm/h (POD between 0.7 - 0.9 based on distance WS-IFOV), but unsatisfactory for intensities ≥ 15 mm/h (POD of 0.18 - 0.25). The results imply that DPR measurements don’t have an obvious temporal and spatial lag with respect to the observations made from the surface and thus form a prospect for global usage, if more follow-up research is conducted.","severe precipitation; remote sensing; weather radar; GPM DPR; gauges; comparison study","en","master thesis","","","","","","Specialization in Water Management and Environmental Engineering","","","","","","Water Management","",""

With a global warming potential of 28-34 times that of CO2 over 100 years, and with 80 times the warming power of CO2 in the first 20 years, methane has a large impact on climate change. Measurements from the satellite instrument TROPOMI help inform on the global atmospheric content of methane. We frequently observe methane plumes in TROPOMI data. These plumes come from super-emitters, and those provide a significant but uncertain contribution to global methane emissions, and they are relatively easy to mitigate. The TROPOMI automated plume detection algorithm makes plume detection and emission quantification possible around the world, which is infeasible without automation. However, the current TROPOMI plume emission quantification algorithm makes use of mass balance methods to estimate the methane emissions of point sources. These approaches provide reasonable but highly uncertain estimates. Hence, in this thesis, we aim to improve the accuracy of the automated emission quantification algorithm with the help of more sophisticated techniques based on atmospheric transport models.<br/><br/>First, this study analysed mass balance methods by quantifying emissions from synthetic plumes having known emission rates. Synthetic plumes were generated using the WRF and FLEXPART atmospheric transport models. A classification algorithm was developed to segregate synthetic plumes into different categories based on their geometries to determine challenging plume emission quantification scenarios for the mass balance methods. We found that mass balance methods produce uncertain emission estimates due to several inherent limitations like missing plume pixels, performance under low wind speed conditions, and no utilisation of three-dimensional wind speeds. Next, the atmospheric transport model based plume scaling approach was analysed by quantifying emissions from synthetic plumes. This analysis revealed that the plume scaling approach could overcome several inherent limitations of the mass balance methods and reduce the uncertainty of plume emission quantification by nearly 10%. Finally, the plume scaling approach was applied to TROPOMI plumes. The FLEXPART model was observed to be most suitable for replicating TROPOMI plumes. With the help of results obtained from this research, a decision tree algorithm was developed. This decision tree can choose the most suitable plume emission quantification method between the mass balance methods and the plume scaling approach for a given TROPOMI plume, maintaining a balance between ease of use of the mass balance methods and accuracy of the plume scaling approach.<br","Methane; CH4; TROPOMI; Plume emission quantification; Mass balance methods; Atmospheric transport models; FLEXPART; WRF-CHEM; Plume scaling approach","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-07-14","","","","Aerospace Engineering","","52.17334722061466, 4.468486163888763"

In search of representation medium, the arising “new elite” of the new democratic republic confidently portrayed themselves in the public sphere through the means of the baroque-like style. The intriguing character of Mafia Baroque could be described as a cocktail of various stylistic elements, along with the ebullient use of luxurious materials.

Either seen as kitsch and tasteless, or purely fascinating, the Mafia Baroque is an active element of the Bulgarian cityscape. On one hand, the style indicates the rejection of expert opinion, as well as the conscious decision to dispel the memory of the socialist past. On the other hand, Mafia Baroque as a phenomenon of the post-soviet time<br/>can be seen as the result of an attempt and longing for integration in the architectural context of Western Europe. The thesis will take into consideration how the transition from the Soviet regime to democracy has been the trigger for this new architectural style.

A solution to reduce carbon emissions is to focus on Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) such as biofuels or synthetic fuels or to focus on sustainable alternative technologies such as electric-powered or hydrogen-powered aircraft. A literature review is conducted that indicates a lack of scientific knowledge regarding factors on social feasibility of sustainable aviation technologies in the industry. This resulted in the research question: What are the motivations, commitments, and beliefs of aviation stakeholders with respect to promising sustainable aviation technologies? The research used a qualitative exploratory research approach using primary data collecting consisting of semi-structured interviews held with relevant stakeholders in the aviation industry. Exploratory research on the different sustainable technologies has indicated that biofuels are currently the only commercially available SAF, but require feedstock. Therefore, synthetic fuels based on captured CO2 with green hydrogen has currently the most potential for aviation although it is very energy-demanding, it still requires development, and it has an expensive production process.<br/>Based on scientific literature, a conceptual framework is constructed from innovation and business theories on why motivations, commitments, and beliefs are relevant for adoption and whether there are examples in literature. The conceptual framework visualizes the coherence of the theories and presents potential adoption factors but the combination of theories lacked specification, degree of importance, and a concise list of all relevant adoption factors reflected by the industry. Therefore will this research as a relevant scientific contribution, with the use of the conceptual framework, explore and specify relevant motivations, commitments, and beliefs in the industry toward adopting sustainable aviation innovations into the current technological regime.<br/>The interviews that have been held with stakeholders have resulted in multiple specified types of adoption factors regarding motivations, commitment, and beliefs. Within these types are factors determined on their importance as well as factors that can be stated as new interesting knowledge. Based on these factors, the research concludes that over the last couple of years sustainable awareness is increasing a lot and therefore it is one of the most important motivations to start adopting SAF. SAF is becoming more widely known and it is seen that momentum for sustainable transition is being built in the industry. Nevertheless, the research can conclude the implementation of regulations is strongly demanded to create motivation for adoption in the industry. The industry explicitly claims that they require the implementation of blending mandates that cause pressure which is needed to motivate businesses to already start adopting SAF. <br/>The main recommendations to put on the scientific agenda are to do additional similar research including more European countries or on other continents. For policymakers, they need to lay focus on the development of regulations that stimulate the adoption of SAF. For the industry, this research recommends using the specifications of the adoption factors at the negotiation table or as advice for firms as a supportive base to start adopting SAF<br","Aviation; Sustainable Aviation Fuels; Business perspectives; Technology adoption; Innovation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","Master Thesis",""

The efficient operation of DHSs is therefore also an important subject of study. The operation of DHSs where combined heat and power (CHP) plants are used are particularly interesting, because CHPs can operate with high efficiency.<br/><br/>In this work, the operational optimization of DHSs with CHP plants is considered. Determining the optimal heat and electricity production for CHPs for multiple time steps into the future is a complex problem. Because of the heat storage capabilities in the network many solutions are feasible, but determining which solutions are infeasible because of constraint violations in the DHS involves computing time delays that depend on complex network dynamics.<br/><br/>In this work, the possibility of using an input convex neural network (ICNN) to learn the network dynamics of a DHS is explored. ICNNs have limitations on their learning capabilities, but theoretically allow for easier optimization. Experiments on the learning capabilities of ICNNs reveal that caution should be used when they are used to learn non-convex constraints, as the accuracy of the ICNN highly depends on how non-convex the function is. Experiments on the feasible space of supply temperatures to a small district heating network (DHN) reveal that although the network does not provide the same flexibility as heat storage tanks, still some flexibility in the operation can be found. This is due to the fact that water with a higher supply temperature is consumed by consumers at a slower pace and this increases the time delay between production and consumption. Supply temperatures that follow can then be lowered if the increased time delay causes this water to arrive when the heat demands are lower.<br/><br/>In the experiments it was found that this flexibility in operation translates to non-convex areas in the feasible space. When this space would be learned by an ICNN, this space would be made convex. How much of the flexibility would be removed by doing this is yet unknown and could be researched in future work. Other future work can be done on safely learning non-convex constraints with an ICNN.","District Heating Systems; District Heating Network; Neural Networks; Optimization; nonconvex optimization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science","",""

The project’s objective is to explore how creativity techniques can be used to increase the impact of the Peak4 programs by analyzing the client’s needs, values and expectations with a more standardized approach.<br/><br/>Readiness for change was found to be an important factor in the implementation of planned change initiatives. It influences both the innovation process of an organization, and the organizational culture, both a focus of the Peak4 service. Creativity is the fuel of innovation. The use of creativity techniques can target the client’s motivation, readiness for change, and acquire insights into the situation and different perspectives within the client’s organization, targeting knowledge of multiple levels of deepness. Moreover, the use of surprising creativity techniques, fits the style of current Peak4 interactions. Peak4 currently uses the initial client inquiry as a foundation for their design and change process. However, a problem changes when more information on the context is uncovered throughout the process. A more iterative approach is advised to tackle the Kerber and Buono problem, and improve the Peak4 impact.<br/><br/>With the current growth of Peak4, change and professionalization are high priority. This comes with the concern that a more rigid structure and approach is not in line with Peak4 values and culture. The most important strength of the Peak4 is its strong, personal connection with the client, resulting in tailor made programs with sustainable impact. <br/><br/>The greatest opportunity for a to be designed toolkit can be found in the sales phase of the Peak4 process. Focusing on the beginning of the process allows the follow up steps in the process to retain their experimental nature while providing opportunities for further standardization. It also provides the chance to initiate a bold move for a real connection, that creates a trustworthy environment and relationship. This interaction initiates an iterative approach. It sets the tone for a real partnership and allows Peak 4 to carefully select projects that match the Peak4 strategy.<br/><br/>The Discovering Desire toolkit offers a sales interaction that allows the consultant to co-create a clear project brief with a potential client in a challenging but supportive way making the client feel inspired and empowered to change as it offers the client a taste of what a Peak4 partnership could be like. It consists of a session, a canvas, and a facilitator manual. The canvas ensures that at the end of the session, both parties have a tangible product that illustrates the patterns that underlie the client’s problems, a shared vision statement, and suggestions for next steps.

However, model validation is rarely done adequately due to the rare occurrence of floods and even less frequent reporting of corresponding damages. <br/> <br/>In this research, validation is defined as the process of ensuring that a model performs within a range of accuracy and precision, satisfactory for its intended use. To guide experts in their validation efforts, a four-phased framework is developed to validate flood-event damage estimations, created with hazard x exposure x vulnerability models. <br/><br/>The framework was applied to two damage estimates created by the Global Flood Risk Tool (GFRT). 1) For damage caused by the Limburg 2021 river flood (The Netherlands - Europe) and 2), for damage caused by a 2019 hurricane-induced coastal flood in Beira (Mozambique - Africa). For the Limburg case, total direct damage was determined at 349,4 million euro. An initial model overestimation of 34% was caused primarily by a large exaggeration of exposed agricultural surface area, and significant modelling errors of linear infrastructure. Furthermore, an uncertainty range was quantified between 271,8 (-23%) and 388,2 million euro (+11%) due to uncertainty in residential assets (across all three model parameters) and an uncertain exposure parameter of agricultural assets. <br/><br/>To create additional damage estimates for verification, a Structured Expert Judgement (SEJ) experiment was executed with ten flood-damage experts. Due to the high experiment cost and low expert-informativeness, the method is currently not advised as a validation approach. In situations with limited data, experts may still be a relevant information source.<br/><br/>For Beira, damage was determined at 8,1 million US dollar. The model underestimated damage by 82% due to errors in infrastructure, industrial, and commercial assets. Besides, overestimations were found for informal residential- and agricultural assets. The estimate ranges between 5,2 (-36%) and 13,2 million US dollar (+62%). This range excludes uncertainties at port and industrial assets, as insufficient information was available. Contrary to the Limburg case study, insights from the plausibility assessment were too uncertain for quantification, thus the validated estimate is based on damage- and construction cost data. Novel techniques were used to disaggregate the compound damage data, such as comparing wind and flood vulnerability curves and applying employee-based estimations.<br/><br/><br/>The significantly altered damage estimate for both case studies demonstrates the usefulness of the framework. However two main limitations remain: first, lacking information on direct damage to critical infrastructure hinders validation. <br/>Second, additional detail in data is required to allow parameter calibration that increases accuracy across multiple flooding scenarios. Therefore, the main recommendation for future research is to increase the detail in damage data reporting so that parameter calibration is supported. This may be done by increasing the spatial resolution of reported damages or adding additional variables such as inundation depth in reports.","Flood damage; Validation method; Flood risk management; Mozambique; Limburg Floods","en","master thesis","","","","","","double degree in Civil Engineering Hydraulic Engineering and Construction Management and Engineering","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","","50.865231,5.832052"

The Shapley value, a solution concept in cooperative game theory initially proposed by Nobel prize-winning economist Lloyd Shapley, has attracted increasing interest for redistribution in energy settings. However, due to its high time complexity, it is intractable beyond communities of a few dozen prosumers. This study proposes a new deterministic method for approximating the Shapley value in realistic community energy settings and compares its performance with existing methods. To provide a benchmark for the comparisons of these methods, we also design a novel method to compute the exact Shapley value for communities of up to several hundred agents by clustering consumers into a smaller number of demand profiles. Experimental analyses with large-scale case studies of a community of up to 200 household consumers in the UK show that the newly proposed method can achieve very close redistribution to the exact Shapley values but at a much lower (and practically feasible) computation cost. Furthermore, it performed similarly to the probabilistic, state-of-the-art approximation method while having smaller time complexity as well as other desirable characteristics for cost redistribution in energy communities.","Energy Community; Shared assets; Shapley value; Approximation algorithms; Smart grid; Stratification; Cost allocation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As these cities grow, the benefits of living in them are increasingly unequally distributed. One factor that can turn the tide of glooming urban inequality is equitable access to opportunities. Designing policies for equitable access requires taking into account several components that impact accessibility: (i) land-use, (ii) transportation, (iii) individual needs and opportunities, and (iv) temporal constraints. In this research, the interaction between a novel mode of public transport, microtransit, and the first three components of accessibility is investigated. The accessibility implications of microtransit in the case study area: the Southern suburbs of the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan, are assessed. It is concluded that microtransit manages to reach vulnerable rider groups and interacts with the land-use environment by pairing residential areas with commercial centers. Microtransit also interacts with other modes of transit by adding both extra demand and lowering the demand for ride-hailing and personal car use predominantly. Microtransit rarely seems to replace public transit or walking alternatives. Overall, it is found that microtransit does significantly increase accessibility levels in the case study area and especially impacts groups with low car ownership. Lastly, the benefits of microtransit are more fairly distributed than those of traditional transit in the studied area. This research demonstrates the positive access equity impact of microtransit and suggests further research into choice-riders, the application of microtransit in urban (core) and rural environments, and the interplay between public transit and microtransit, as well as policy interventions for policy-makers and transit providers.","microtransit; on-demand transit; urban inequality; accessibility; access equity","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","","44.9375,93.2010"

A DC-DC boost converter is an electronic device that can be used for maximum power point tracking (MPPT). When implementing MPPT at sub-module level, the shade resilience of the module can be increased. This thesis aims to investigate the feasibility of implementing planar inductors into c-Si solar cells using the numerical simulation software COMSOL Multiphysics®. Through simulations, the inductance and resistance values for various planar coil geometries were obtained. Subsequently, the feasibility of using these coils in a sub-module DC-DC boost converter was investigated. For this study, a specific case was assumed where a Gen 2 Cell - 160 mm c-Si cell is used with a DC-DC boost converter with a duty cycle of 0.5 and a current ripple of 20%. Given the parameters from these devices, the minimum required inductance of 1.20 μH for a frequency of 200 kHz and 2.40 μH for a frequency of 100 kHz were obtained. The series resistances that can be added to the solar cell while still maintaining high eﬀiciency, range from 1.0 mΩ to 4.8 mΩ, for a 1% to a 5% power loss, respectively. This is all for single-cell power conversion. Two different approaches have been examined; the screen-printed coil(s) approach and the screen printing thickness exceeding coil(s) approach. The former studies coils that do not exceed the maximum thickness achievable with screen printing. As such, these coils could be simpler to implement into a solar cell production line than coils with a higher thickness. In this research, for thicknesses below 300 μm a best-case scenario is studied where the skin effect is neglected. The latter studies a larger range of thicknesses, not taking any specific production method into account, but the skin and proximity effect is taken into account. The screen-printed approach is limited to a thickness range of 10 μm to 200 μm, thus simulated by the 2D model. For the air-core single-cell inductors for DC-DC boost converter applications, the inductance and resistance values were either below the 1.20 μH threshold or above the 4.8 mΩ threshold, respectively. These thresholds change depending on the number of series-connected cells. The inductance of a planar inductor can be boosted up to 200% when adding a magnetic material in a sandwich structure, however, this will also increase the costs of the application. In a boosted-inductance case, the 3-turn coil with a thickness of 200 μm, and a 5% power loss is the only configuration that is feasible for a 200 kHz DC-DC boost converter application, with an inductance of 1.569 μH and a resistance of 3.45 mΩ. By increasing the number of coils per cell, the power dissipation in the coils can be reduced. Using this approach, six feasible topologies can be created. One of those is the nine parallel-connected 8-turn coils with a thickness of 200 μm, reaching an inductance of 1.210 μH and a resistance of 3.186 mΩ, allowing for a 200 kHz DC-DC boost converter application without any magnetic inductance increase. All six options are feasible for integration on a single cell using screen printing, however, the actual resistances will be higher due to the skin and proximity effect, and single-cell integration will be too expensive for industrial applications. When studying thicknesses above the screen printing limit, only the 4-turn coil with a thickness of 300 μm, a magnetically increased inductance of 2.718 μH, and a resistance of 4.01 mΩ, is feasible for the 100 and 200 kHz frequencies. This case however does neglect the skin effect. For the 3D model and thicknesses above 400 μm, the skin effect significantly impacts the resistance. When series connecting multiple cells to a single coil, the only feasible option is the eight-cell connected 8-turn coil for a thickness of 200 μm and 300 μm, both reaching a magnetically increased inductance of 10.431 μH and resistance of 23.33 mΩ and 15.56 mΩ, respectively.","Photovoltaic; Planar inductor; Simulation; COMSOL Multiphysics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-07-13","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

By recording the electrical signals of the heart, a better understanding can be gained of the mechanisms behind cardiac arrhythmias. A method that can be used to investigate the state of the heart is electroanatomic mapping (EAM), where the local electrical activity is related to a point within a 3D anatomical reconstruction of the heart. By investigating the electrical activity, areas of scarring can be identified.<br/>Currently, the electrical activity is recorded with a plaque multi-electrode array at the Erasmus MC. Local activation maps can be recorded during sinus rhythm (SR), and with the use of a reference electrode, total activation maps are generated. This can only be done during SR. During arrhythmia’s, this is no longer possible due to temporal variation in electrical activity. To investigate the activation maps during arrhythmia, an electrode array that can record the total activity of the ventricles was designed and developed in this thesis.<br/>By studying the literature and with the help of medical experts, a requirement list was established. Different concept ideas were compared using a Harris profile to select the best design for further development.<br/>From the Harris profile it was concluded that a 3D printed sock was the best design for the electrode array. An investigation of the effects of the pattern and thickness on the stiffness and fatigue life of the sock were performed with the help of tensile tests and fatigue tests. From the results of the tensile and fatigue tests, a decision for the design of the electrode array was made. A 3D printed sock with the optimized design and electrodes were used to make epicardial recordings on a porcine heart in an ex vivo heart perfusion setup. The electrical recordings were later analyzed and visualized on a 3D model of the heart.<br/>Even though the resolution of the electrode array was lower than that of the epicardial mappings performed at the Erasmus MC, the results obtained from the electrode array looked promising. This is the first study that has developed a 3D printed electrode array the can record the electrical activity of the ventricular surface from multiple sites simultaneously. However, before the electrode array can be used for elucidating the mysteries behind epicardial activation during arrhythmia’s, further development is needed.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Last-mile delivery in urban areas causes many problems, including air pollution, nuisance, and congestion. There are various delivery methods, which differ in terms of costs, sustainability impacts, and societal impacts. One of these methods is crowdshipping. According to literature, crowdshipping is a promising solution to various last-mile delivery problems, because it promises social (less nuisance), economic (cheaper delivery), and environmental benefits (less fuel consumption). In order to investigate whether crowdshipping is a delivery method that can be implemented in urban areas in the Netherlands, this thesis researched the success and failure factors (SFFs). This thesis aims to fill this knowledge gap by answering the main research question: What are the success and failure factors of crowdshipping in urban areas in the Netherlands, and what implications do they have for future implementation?<br/><br/>To answer the main research question, five analyses have been performed. First, a literature review distinguished two manners of crowdshipping, namely value-driven crowdshipping and profit-driven crowdshipping. Second, based on the two manners that were distinguished in the previous analysis, a societal impacts analysis showed that the crowdshipping manner highly affects whether the societal impacts will be positive or negative. Value-driven crowdshipping will have positive societal impacts and profit-driven crowdshipping will have negative impacts. Third, a stakeholder analysis showed that the courier's power is high because they form the supply. The biggest problems between couriers and customers are trust and safety issues. Value-driven crowdshipping receives more support and user acceptance than profit-driven crowdshipping. Fourth, focus groups were conducted to deepen the knowledge of value-driven crowdshipping with travellers by applying a participatory method rather than literature study. Although literature was very optimistic about their user acceptance, the results from the focus groups showed that participants of potential courier target groups have a negative attitude towards participation. Fifth, in the SFF framework construction, the results of the previous analyses and their implications for the SFFs are integrated. A general framework and two specific frameworks for value-driven and profit-driven crowdshipping were constructed. The main outtake of the framework is that the factors affecting trust and user acceptance are the most important factors that should be improved for crowdshipping to work. Happy crowd is crucial because this factor was seen in all previous analyses. The way to obtain the happy crowd differs for value-driven or profit-driven crowdshipping. Linked to this, critical mass of couriers is highly important because this affects the effectiveness. Finally, the manner in which crowdshipping is implemented (value-driven or profit-driven) influences the environmental benefits. This impacts the perceived effectiveness and customer experience, which in turn affect trust and user acceptance.<br/><br/>The following conclusion is drawn from this research. If crowdshipping is to be implemented, the value-driven manner is recommended because this yields positive societal impacts. Therefore, the couriers are travellers instead of dedicated couriers. However, crowdshipping implementation in urban areas in the Netherlands has significant failure factors. Involvement of local governments and more research into minimisation of courier efforts are necessary to overcome these. However, it is unsure whether these failure factors can be readily overcome. Therefore, it is debatable whether crowdshipping is the most desired solution to resolve urban delivery problems. Future research should focus on investigating how the trust and user acceptance failure factor could be overcome.","Crowdshipping; Success and Failure factors; Logistics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

(mentor); Onderwater, M.C. (mentor); Tissier, M.F.S. (graduation committee); Klooster, J. P. G. N. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","San Andrés is a Colombian-Caribbean Island located 800 km from the Colombian coast. On its Eastern side there is a barrier reef formation protecting the island from offshore incident waves. Due to the protected environment created by the coral reef, sandy beaches can be formed on the East side of the island. <br/>During normal conditions, waves come predominantly form the East (90% of the wave climate), have significant wave height of 2 m and period of 8 s. Besides, San Andrés is situated on the Caribbean hurricane route, which can cause an enormous damage to the island. The storm season at San Andrés is between October and December, which is also when major erosion events take place.<br/>The economy of San Andrés is mostly built upon tourism, specially related to its biodiverse ecosystems and Caribbean beaches. The island’s ecological environment is composed by mangroves, seagrasses, and coral reefs, attracting a wide spectrum of fauna and flora to its ecosystems.<br/>During the Masterplan for Coastal Erosion (PMEC), San Andrés was pointed out as a location in which coastal erosion is problematic. In a follow-up of this Masterplan, the island was elected to be part of a program in which solutions against coastal erosion would be presented. This research is part of this project, as a parallel trajectory to get a more profound understanding of the system and the possible mitigation measures that could be applied on the island.<br/>With increasing urbanization and frequency of extreme weather events, erosion is becoming a problem with which San Andrés and its residents are repeatedly having to deal. Erosion is specially problematic for the Northern part of the island, called Spratt Bight. This region is not only the most densely populated area of the island, but also economically and touristically very important. Its beach presents periodically eroding patterns during storm seasons, when wave action drives the sediment towards the East, decreasing its beach width almost to none. A decreasing beach width has a direct negative impact on tourism, making coastal erosion in Spratt Bight not only a coastal safety problem, but also an economic issue.<br/>This study aims to look into the main hydro- and morphological processes driving coastal erosion in Spratt Bight and, using the Building with Nature philosophy, propose a set of solutions to mitigate this problem. To reach this objective data analysis and literature research has been carried out, after which different environmental conditions were modelled using the numerical model Delft3D. <br/>During these activities it was found that independently of its direction, waves approaching San Andrés break upon the coral reef and induce a water level set up inside the coral lagoon. The difference in water level in- and outside the lagoon generates a current and sediment transport, which is directed towards the western opening in the coral reef.<br/>When the Northern waves approach the island (1.5% of the wave climate), the same water level set-up phenomenon is observed. However, as waves are approaching form the North, they not only break upon the reef, but are also able to enter the sheltered lagoon through the western opening in the coral reef. These waves are able to bend around the reef reaching the shore and the headland on the Northern part of the island, inducing a longshore current and a sediment transport that is southeastward directed. The result is that Northern waves are mostly responsible for a strong westward and erosive sediment transport pattern. These waves are mostly observed between October and March, which coincides with the storm season in San Andrés. <br/>Besides, it was found that the Eastern waves are responsible for restoring the (dynamic) equilibrium profile of Spratt Bight Beach. However, this restoring force has a less strong intensity, taking more time to restore the beach than to disrupt its equilibrium.<br/>The solutions proposed include seagrass restoration to enhance ecology, restrain sediment transport and attenuate wave heights; the beneficial reuse of dredged material, to nourish Spratt Bight Beach; and finally, the implementation of artificial coral reefs as breakwaters to prevent the newly nourished sediment to be lost from the system. Besides, artificial coral reefs enhance the ecosystem by attracting fauna and flora increasing biodiversity. All proposed solutions have a positive impact on the beaches and therefore on tourism and the economy of the island. This makes them multifunctional solutions, serving the main goal of protecting the beach while at the same time creating benefits for other functions and values in the area. Following in this way the prescriptions of the Building with Nature design approach by van Eekelen and Bouw (2020).<br","Coastal erosion; Building with Nature; colombia; San Andrés; DELFT3D; XBeach; coastal engineering","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Event cameras and spiking neural networks (SNNs) allow for a highly bio-inspired, low-latency and power efficient implementation of optic flow estimation. Just recently, a hierarchical SNN was proposed in which motion selectivity is learned from raw event data in an unsupervised manner using spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP). However, real-life applications of this SNN are currently still limited by the fact that the exact choice of neuron parameters depends on the spatiotemporal properties of the input. Furthermore, tuning the network is a challenging task due to the high degree of coupling between the various parameters. Inspired by neurons in biological brains that modify their intrinsic parameters through a process called intrinsic plasticity, this research proposes update rules which adapt the voltage threshold and maximum synaptic delay during inference. This allows applying the already trained network to a wider range of operating conditions and simplifies the tuning process. Starting with a detailed parameter analysis, primary functions and undesired side effects are assigned to each parameter. The update rules are then designed in such a way as to eliminate these side effects. Unlike existing update rules for the voltage threshold, this work does not attempt to keep the firing activity of output neurons within a specific range, but instead aims to adjust the threshold such that only the correct output maps spike. In particular, the voltage threshold is adapted such that output spikes occur in no more than two maps per retinotopic location. The maximum synaptic delay is adapted such that the resulting apparent pixel velocities of the input match those of the data used during training. A sensitivity analysis is presented which illustrates the effects of newly introduced parameters on the network performance. Furthermore, the adapted network is tested on real event data recorded onboard a drone avoiding obstacles. Due to the difficulties in matching the output of the adapted SNN to the ground truth data, quantitative results are inconclusive. However, qualitative results show a clear improvement in both the density and correctness of optic flow estimates.","Optic flow estimation; spiking neural networks; neuron adaptation; computer vision; dynamic vision sensors; intrinsic plasticity; spike-timing dependent plasticity","en","master thesis","","","","","","https://github.com/tudelft/IP-STDP-FlowNet Complementary code","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Currently, in remote off-grid locations, electricity is primarily generated using diesel generators, which is expensive and has significant carbon emissions. Alternatively, these remote locations have a huge potential for utilizing renewable energy sources. In such locations, airborne wind energy (AWE) systems could have an advantage over conventional wind turbines. Since, the AWE systems operate at higher altitudes, stronger and more consistent wind energy can be harnessed. Moreover, they are more compact and have higher mobility, which can reduce installation, operation, and maintenance costs. The centralized controller of the HPP optimizes the energy sources’ dispatch based on the resource and demand forecasts. Due to the anti-correlation between the wind and solar resources, electricity can be generated more constantly on a daily and seasonal scale. The batteries can be smaller, and diesel generators rarely need to be used. The stronger the anti-correlation between the wind and solar resources, the better the HPP performs. The model of the HPP uses wind, solar, and load data as inputs. The hourly energy production is calculated, and combined with the load data, the battery capacity is determined. To find the optimal number of kites, modules, battery capacity, different combinations of kites and modules are put in the model. The levelized cost of electricity (LCoE) is evaluated for each configuration. The model’s output is the minimal LCoE with the corresponding capacity of the different components. The model is used to evaluate multiple case studies, which resulted in the following key findings. HPPs have a stronger case in off-grid markets than utility-scale grid-connected markets. The cost reduction by sharing the infrastructure is minimal. The security of the power supply is better maximized at lower costs than standalone installations. The LCoE has become so competitive that the use of diesel can almost wholly be replaced in suitable locations, which results in a significant reduction in carbon emissions.","airborne wind energy; solar energy; solar pv; wind energy; Energy Storage; modelling; hybrid power plant","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

(mentor); Goyal, N. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","The effects of climate change on the global community are becoming more strongly felt every year, creating devastation on our everyday lives. To combat that, a transition to low-carbon energy carriers is being envisioned by state and private actors through pledges during climate conferences and several candidate carriers are proposed. Among these, green hydrogen, produced through electrolysis stemming from renewable electricity is poised to become the dominant renewable energy carrier. However, its production process entailes serious challenges, as for importing countries it will be very difficult to achieve security of supply. The field of security of supply is a highly complex one and correlated with the technological, scientific background of the energy carrier but also with the financial and market structure and the political stability of the importing and the exporting country. All of these components together formulate a very complex system that needs to be studied and further understood to better deal with the security of supply for importing regions, such as Europe. <br/>There are several ways to study the foregoing system and its implications on the security of supply. These entail focusing on the technological aspects, the market structure or the geopolitical context. The first one would include research on the technology arms race by several state actor, whereas the second one would encompass a comparative case study between centralized and decentralized distribution and transmission systems, and whether unbundling would be beneficial for the energy transition. The third aspect, the geopolitical one, was chosen for two reasons. The first one is that a more holistic approach was needed and the problem of security of supply should be seen from a more spherical point of view. The second one is that there is already thorough research taking place in the previous two fields. <br/>Hence, the following research question was answered: How might the geopolitical implications of a transition to green hydrogen affect the energy security of supply of the EU?<br/>To answer the research question, initially, pattern modeling was introduced. To develop the patterns, the neoliberalism and neorealism schools of thought in international relations were used as foundation. A discursive approach was taken to formulate the patterns. Out of the many discourses that could have been used, the storyline approach was considered as most appropriate. Hence, two storylines were developed based on the two IR schools of thought. A deductive approach was taken and hence these schools of thought were used as a foundation to develop general themes that would be followed in each storyline. However, very little information and projections exist on the shape of the future green hydrogen system. Thus, a comparative case study was taken between the hydrogen and the natural gas system. The rationale is that there are many structural similarities with the existing gas system and the projections for the green hydrogen one. Initially, the gas system pattern is created based on historical data and expectations and the main insights gained are used as a foundation for the green hydrogen system pattern. Later, the green hydrogen system pattern is formulated based on a combination of its own projections and the gas system insights. <br/>The results verify that there are indeed clear indications that the security of supply of the green hydrogen system will be challenging in a similar way such as the gas one. However, this research reveals that there will be much higher complexity in the green hydrogen system than in the gas one. The fact that green hydrogen is interconnected with the need for electricity and water and hence the security of these systems as well, there are many more ways that disruption can be brought to the supply chain. At the same time, this thesis showed that the geological advantage is much less of an issue at the green hydrogen system rather than the fossile fuel industry, which increases the number of potential patterns on energy imports significantly.<br/>Overall, this research acknowledges the importance of understanding the geopolitical implications of a shift to renewable energy carriers. It is a clear indication for policymakers to implement and incorporate plans within their energy strategies that include ensuring security and stability to the main green hydrogen supplying countries. Additionally, it provides a brand new approach to academia in the energy transition sector, so that more focus takes place on ensuring the security of supply in the energy-food-water nexus rather than on advocating in favor of conflict resolution as a result of the shift to renewable energy. <br/> <br","Geopolitics; geoeconomics; green hydrogen; Security of supply; Pattern creation; pattern modeling; Comparative case study; scenario analysis; European Union","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-08-31","","","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","",""

Fibre-steered variable stiffness laminates have promising characteristics due to the ability to better tailor designs for expected loading, as the fibre orientation can be varied within a layer. This thesis was created to develop a fibre placement planning algorithm for fibre-steered layers on moderately curved open shells for a given fibre angle distribution.<br/><br/>The fibre-steered layers are to be produced by Automated Fibre Placement (AFP) without any course overlaps, which means that several manufacturing defects have to be considered. Gaps between courses are inevitable due to course shifting in combination with the prescribed fibre paths, and tow cuts run the risk of tow straightening due to loss of steering control of the AFP roller head. Furthermore, steering limits have to be observed to prevent tow buckling.<br/><br/>The thesis objective was approached by dividing it in three parts. Firstly, the geometry of the mould and the course paths was defined parametrically in the form of NURBS surfaces and curves. These have been widely used in Computer Aided Modelling (CAM) and have extensive support in terms of existing algorithms and documented work. Additionally, performing most operations in the parametric space allows for greater accuracy compared to general finite element methods.<br/><br/>Secondly, the fibre angle distribution was converted into a fibre layer. This was initiated by generating initial course centre lines, which were then fit onto the parametric surface. Representations of tow courses were made by geodesically offsetting the course centre lines in the binormal direction. A curve-curve intersection algorithm was then used to accurately detect tow overlaps, which were handled according to the tow placement strategy. Two tow placement strategies have been developed, one for general use and one to specifically prevent tow straightening. In addition, curvature of the course centre line was registered to check for tow buckling, and the minimum cut length was enforced by evaluating the length of tow segments.<br/><br/>Lastly, fitness criteria for fibre-steered layers were defined. Layers were evaluated for gap percentage, fibre angle error and number of cuts. These can be used to objectively grade layers against each other, or to assess the effects of fibre steering against conventional laminates.","Variable Stiffness; Composites; Fibre Steering; Automated Fibre Placement","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

However, it is also possible that the two-stage model can influence the sustainability of infrastructure projects since the risks are reduced and a different way of collaboration between market parties and public parties is introduced. Nevertheless, it is unknown if the two-stage model makes an impact on sustainability of infrastructure projects. Boskalis Nederland, where this research is performed, is interested in if the two-stage model can make an impact on sustainability of infrastructure projects because of the high relevance of these two topics in the Dutch infrastructure sector. Therefore, the main objective of this study is to explore the impact of the two-stage model on sustainability of infrastructure projects. Taking into account the knowledge gap, the problem statement and the research objective, the main research question is defined as follows: ""What is the impact of the two-stage model on sustainability of Dutch infrastructure projects?"".<br/><br/>The expectation regarding the impact of the two-stage model on sustainability of infrastructure projects is that the model will offer market parties and public parties more room to discuss, incentivise and implement sustainable solutions in infrastructure projects because of the integral collaboration between the parties in the project team. The impact of the two-stage model on sustainability could be seen when comparing the model to a one-stage collaboration model. For example, a technical specification (which is a one-stage collaboration model), is characterized by having result-oriented specifications prescribed by the public client which results in leaving little freedom for the contractor for sustainable input in infrastructure projects. In contrast, the two-stage model is characterized by collaboration between the involved parties which creates more freedom for input on sustainability from the involved parties. This may lead to a bigger chance to implement sustainable solutions in infrastructure projects. The essential difference between the two collaboration models is the collaboration aspect between the involved parties, which eventually may make a difference in chances to implement sustainable solutions in infrastructure projects.<br","Two-Stage Model; 2-Stage Model; Early Contractor Involvement; Sustainability; Altan Ceylan; ECI; Two-Stage Model Construction Industry; Experiences Two-Stage Model the Netherlands; Collaborative Contracting","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

The historical low turnup rate of last municipal elections in Rotterdam, 39%, reflect the low trust people have in the municipality and how they feel unrepresented by the city council. Because of this, municipalities are striving to bring politics closer to citizens and are increasingly working more participatory; including citizens in city- and policy making. <br/><br/>The public good became something that is not created publically anymore. The interaction between the municipality and citizens is characterised by distance: civil servants are used to design services without citizens and citizens are used to a municipality that does its own thing. Both are not used to approaching each other in order to collaboratively make better public spaces, services and policies. If the municipality does not put effort in finding new ways to actively invite people to participate the distance will become bigger, making cities less inclusive and neighbourhoods less liveable.<br/><br/>Participatory activities strengthen the social network of people within a neighbourhood and through this a neighbourhood becomes more resilient. Also through a stronger local network, people tend to engage more in participatory activities. It’s an ongoing challenge for the municipality to include less obvious citizens in this local network of participation processes. The municipality should be a facilitator of community building and actively approach people in order to connect to them. <br/><br/>The Wijkbox concept is an intervention that combines these social and participatory aspects. In this box, citizens can leave their opinion, dreams and concerns about the neighbourhood. The box is handed out by civil servants in the neighbourhood and later passed on from citizen to citizen. As the boxes travel through the neighbourhood, more opinions are collected, more social connections are formed and new people enter the local network. The Wijkbox is a starting point for collaboration related to the topics proposed in the boxes. It allows civil servants to approach citizens more personally and provides citizens an accessible way to form their opinion about the neighbourhood, possibly stimulating them to join other participatory activities. <br/><br/>The Wijkbox was tested in two pilots with both citizens and civil servants. The Wijkbox shows potential in reaching ‘not-yet-active’ citizens and stimulating social connection within the neighbourhood. Citizens evaluated the form of participation as positive and civil servants were enthusiastic about the personal approach the Wijkbox initiates. At the moment, the concept is being implemented by the municipality in two local projects. It shows that the concept can potentially contribute to the more local approach that the municipality wants to take. The results of these experiments, which will be available after this graduation project, will show whether the concept benefits real-life projects and if it contributes to a long term relationship forming between Rotterdammers and the municipality.","Participation; Municipality; Neighbourhood; Social cohesion; Social resilience; Local democracy; Social Design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

Much research has been performed on the mechanisms and methodologies behind their implementation and realisation.

To analyse the efficiency of peer-to-peer energy markets, we consider two different popular approaches to peer-to-peer trading, i.e. centralised and decentralised and explore the economic benefits these models bring given optimal trading schedules computed by a joint schedule optimizer. In both these modes, benefits can be realised mainly due to the diversity in consumption behaviour and renewable energy generation between prosumers in an energy community. <br/>This diversity decreases quickly as more peer-to-peer energy contracts are established and more prosumers join the market, leading to significantly diminishing returns. In this work, we aim to quantify such effects using large-scale real-world data from two trials in the UK, i.e. the Low Carbon London project and the Thames Valley Vision project.<br/>We show that only a small number of peer-to-peer contracts and a fraction of the prosumers are needed to realise the majority of the Gains from Trade. <br","Peer-to-peer energy trading; Energy Community; Automated Negotiation; Optimization; Data Driven","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science | Software Technology","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","To produce an alternative fuel like Methanol from scratch, on a miniature scale- the reactants CO2 and H2O are sourced locally. Zero Emission Fuels B.V. (ZEF) does this by collecting carbon dioxide from the air, via carbon capture techniques and compressing it to high pressure of 55bars. As a consequence of humidity inside the captured CO2, condensation is observed which is detrimental to the life of the compressor. To avoid this, a packed-bed drying system is designed as an auxiliary to the rolling piston compressor. This study aims to understand and model these two systems and subsequently integrate them to examine the effects of their dynamic operation. The purpose of this model is to provide a design tool, with the ability to predict the reaction of the system when sized differently, in various environments.<br/><br/>At first, the physics and governing principles of the two subsystems are studied and a layered modelling approach was devised. The systems were modelled individually and then integrated using Simulink- a tool that allows this layering up of the models. To build a dynamic model of such a setup, a characteristic time scale analysis was performed to identify the relevant phenomena inside each subsystem. Significant internal factors to be modelled were variations in relative humidity and temperature caused by the drying system, the changes in thermo-physical properties of the gas due to a change in temperature and the pressure fluctuations caused by the compressor. The external factors to be modelled were the changes in ambient temperature over operation time, caused by a variation in solar irradiation. The main finding was that the compressor's characteristic time scale (300s) was considerably smaller than that of the drying system (4-8hours/day). This meant an almost instantaneous operation of the compressor, rendering it uninteresting in the dynamic model of the integrated system.<br/><br/>A mechanistic dynamic model of the drying system, based on literature, was made with inherent controls to flip it between adsorption and desorption modes. It is responsive to the changes in the ambient and allows optimisation by changing the duty cycles of energy inputs. The model was then validated using experimental data from two working prototypes at ZEF. Some heat and mass transfer properties were then fitted to conform to these setups. A methodology to obtain these parameters while sizing a new design is discussed. The key performance indicators, which are cycle time and cycle capacity are given by the model and are crucial in deciding the energy consumption of the system.<br/><br/>On the other hand, an empirical model is built to replicate the rolling-piston compressor. The compressor is treated like a grey box and is described by a polytropic coefficient. A novel approach to create a compressor map for a positive displacement compressor, that is not mass-produced, is chosen. This compressor map is then used to predict the mass flow and output temperature of the system. Since the compressor map is empirical, the model was also validated using data from the literature.<br/><br/>Finally, the drying system and the compressor were integrated, in the model and experiments, by means of a capillary tube. A model was made for this as well to obtain the `interacting parameters'- which were the mass flow into the compressor, mass flow out of the capillary tube and the temperature and pressure of this re-loop flow. The effects of integration and the consequences to other systems upstream and downstream of this setup were scrutinised.<br/><br/>To conclude, a validated model is built to size new iterations of the setup. Multiple cycle models of a packed bed drying system and compressor maps of positive displacement compressors- that are not found commonly in literature are explored in this study and recommendations to further develop them are given towards the end.<br","Rolling Piston Compressor; Packed beds; Dynamic modelling; system integration; adsorption; Drying","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-07-12","","","","","",""

The first step to helping these home users secure their network starts by being able to autonomously detect the type of IoT devices connected to their network.

In practice, train dispatchers are responsible for mitigating the influence of disruptions, such as delays of trains, train cancellations, and overcrowdedness at stations. The solutions they propose are highly dependent on their experience, often resulting in low quality solutions. In addition, the disruptions must be solved in a matter of minutes, which is challenging because of the problem scale and computational complexity. Effective models and solution approaches are required to mitigate the influence of disruptions.<br/><br/>In recent decades, railway rescheduling models have been developed to support train dispatchers and to improve rail services. A recent and promising model is the event-activity network model, which is a graph-based formulation that supports a wide variety of rescheduling measures. This thesis extends the event-activity network model by including rolling stock circulation with depot entry and exit operations to increase the practicability of the operator-centric model. In addition, a passenger-centric model is proposed by embedding detailed passenger-related factors into the operator-centric model, where the train capacity is included, and the detailed number of passengers in the railway network is calculated. Therefore, the effect of delays on passengers can be handled properly. The passenger-centric model can help minimize the number of waiting passengers on platforms to avoid overcrowding and to improve passenger satisfaction. In practice, the resulting passenger-centric mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem is hard to solve due to the introduction of binary variables for train orders, which are important for calculating the detailed number of passengers. An adaptive large neighborhood search (ALNS) algorithm is introduced to address the complexity due to train orders and to improve the computational efficiency of the passenger-centric method. With properly designed destroy and repair operators, the ALNS algorithm can explore the solution space efficiently. Therefore, a balanced trade-off between solution time and quality can be made. <br/><br/>Case studies are conducted based on the train lines operating between the stations of Utrecht and 's-Hertogenbosch in the Netherlands. The simulation results show that the developed model can explicitly include the number of passengers while considering the rolling stock circulation plan. Compared to directly solving an MILP problem using a commercial solver, ALNS can calculate solutions more efficiently while maintaining a high level of solution quality.","railway; disruption management; Optimization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

Recent work has shown that neural networks trained with supervised learning are a good candidate for real-time optimal quadcopter control. In these methods, the networks (termed G\&amp;CNets) are trained using optimal trajectories obtained from a dynamical model of the quadcopter by means of a direct transcription method. A major problem with these methods is the effects of unmodeled dynamics. In this work we identify these effects for G\&amp;CNets trained for power optimal full state-to-rpm feedback. We propose an adaptive control strategy to mitigate the effects of unmodeled roll, pitch and yaw moments. Our method works by generating optimal trajectories with constant external moments added to the model and training a network to learn the policy that maps state and external moments to the corresponding optimal rpm command. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by performing power-optimal hover-to-hover flights with and without moment feedback. The flight tests show that the inclusion of this moment feedback significantly improves the controller's performance. Additionally we compare the adaptive controller's performance to a time optimal Bang-Bang controller for consecutive waypoint flight and show significantly faster lap times on a 3x4m track.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

In recent years, various neurodegenerative diseases such as locked-in syndrome, epilepsy and retinitis pigmentosa, for which there currently exist no cures, have been successfully treated using implantable BMIs.<br/><br/>BMI development is continuously striving towards increasing the recording resolution and number of recording channels. As a result of recent innovations in electrode design and implementation, the recording of single brain cells has become possible, enabling the development of BMI with single-cell recording resolution. The primary bottleneck preventing more recording channels in single-cell resolution BMIs is caused by the neural amplifiers required to amplify the neural signals from the electrodes.

The amplifier is designed and verified with post-layout simulations, achieving a gain of 45 dB over a bandwidth from 93.8Hz to 5.44kHz, power usage of 600 nW per recording channel and an input referred noise voltage of 9.00 μVrms with a total chip area of 2190 μm2 per recording channel.","amplifier; brain-machine interface; Neural interface","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering","",""

The required power is to be provided by the power plant, which has a fixed set of equipment such as diesel engines, generator sets, electric machines, and batteries. Typically, the control of vessel's power plants consist of two levels; a primary level with local controllers for the power plant components, and a secondary level that determines the distribution of the required power to the various components in the power plant. The state-of-the-art only considers a multi-level power plant control architecture assuming a fixed power plant layout, but in practice, the fixed power plant layout may not suffice for generating the power demand dictated by a new mission. This may lead to inefficient use of components, risk of overloading components, or the inability to deliver the required power. To handle this issue, equipment modifications such as additions, removals or replacements would probably be necessary, along with modifications in the multi-level control scheme. To enable the seamless operation of the multi-level plant control system after the modifications is essential for guaranteeing safety and reducing the downtime, which could be achieved by a control architecture that allows for modular use of the power plant components. <br/><br/>This thesis presents the design methodology of a mission-oriented modular control system for marine power plants. To this end, first power profiles, power plant layouts and control systems of multiple vessels such as tugboats, offshore support vessels, cargo ships and cruise ships are analyzed. By decomposing the power profile in two components, the propulsion and auxiliary power demand, the correlation between the power profile of a vessel and its mission is derived, and an algorithm that computes the power profile using mission and vessel data is proposed. Furthermore, the correlation between the power profile and the layout of the power plant is also investigated, with emphasis on how changes in the power profile result in power plant automation modifications. A modular secondary control level is then designed to cope with the required power plant automation modifications, by combining the Equivalent Consumption Minimization Strategy (ECMS) with Supervisory Switching Control (SSC). In this thesis we consider battery modifications, following the example of Wärtsilä's ZESPacks. Simulation results are used to show the performance of the proposed switching control methodology, in relation to the stability of the components in the power plant after automation modifications occur. <br/><br/>The main contribution of this thesis is the novel approach for the secondary level power plant control system, introducing modularity to the otherwise assumed fixed layout of the power plant. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm can be used to determine the expected power profile for a new mission, to identify required modifications of the power plant equipment.<br","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Multi-Machine Engineering","",""

However, since its construction was completed in 1965, the livelihood of the riverine communities drastically changed. The seasonal peak and low flows in the river, which provided environmental services for many downstream households, are now replaced with a stable river flow throughout the year to favour hydropower production. A study on dam reoperation is not only of interest to look into the possibilities of restoring healthy ecosystems but also to look at how current water demands in the basin can be sustained. Climate change and increased water demands for irrigation are expected to strain the water resources in the Lower Volta. Reoperation is also complicated by the absence of water treaties with neighbouring countries. This can result in lower flows from upstream riparian states due to their increasing water needs. In this study, we aim to understand the vulnerabilities of the Akosombo system while finding robust policies that can cope with challenging climate and demographic conditions. This study highlights the challenges in balancing irrigation, environmental, and hydropower goals while also identifying system vulnerabilities and opportunities for robust operations to meet the Lower Volta River water demands under future challenging conditions. This is done by reevaluating previously found optimal release policies under uncertainty. From this study, it can be concluded that the uncertainties included in the analysis will alter system functioning. Not only will floods occur with the onset of climate change, but energy production and irrigation potential will also become lower if upstream states start to use more water. The most critical abstractions are those of Togo and Côte d'Ivoire. A benefit of this is that these abstractions also provide some protection against floods. It is therefore wise to create cooperation projects with these countries to safeguard the current benefits of the Akosombo and Kpong dam and create new benefits for all parties.","Dam optimisation; Water management; EMODPS; Akosombo dam; Uncertainty Analysis; exploratory modeling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","","6.2969048,0.0595342"

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","The significant adverse contribution of the construction industry to greenhouse gas emissions and natural resource depletion has to be reduced. Regarding jetty platform structures, this challenge can be faced by designing for reusability, a promising concept for environmental impact reduction. However, this principle is not yet being widely implemented, leading to the absence of reusable jetty structures. This research aims to identify the feasibility of designing a jetty platform for reusability and the contribution of reusability to the environmental impact reduction of jetty platform structures. A jetty, that is being constructed in the port of Rotterdam during the execution of this research, was taken as a reference structure. By creating a design according to the Design for Disassembly requirements, while fulfilling similar functions as the reference jetty, a concept of a reusable jetty plat- form design was created. A numerical prediction model was created in the SCIA Engineer software so that the global behaviour and robustness of the structure were found when using simple connection solutions. Next, demountable connections were designed based on existing configurations from other applications. The practical aspects of assembly and maintenance were assessed through an interview with a maintenance expert from Port of Rotterdam. Furthermore, a brief study was done to investigate the possibilities of modularity and applicability to other jetties in the port. To quantify the environmental impact reduction, a life cycle assessment was performed, in which the impact of the reference structure was compared to that of three reusable structure variants: the reusable design, the modular reusable design and the modular reusable design using concrete with a lower impact. Due to the use of simple connections in the reusable jetty design, discontinuities in the displacements are found between elements. These cause limitations in the flexibility of placing the superstructure and may cause deformations in pipelines when those are placed on the platform. Therefore, a solution was presented to mitigate the discontinuities. Also, the reusable jetty has to be constructed with a larger crane than is conventionally used, which may cause hindrance to the surroundings. However, the duration of construction will be reduced. The results of the life cycle assessment show that the initial impact of each reusable variant was larger than that of the reference jetty. However, already for reusing once in the structure’s lifetime, this investment can be compensated when compared to replacing the reference jetty with a new structure. When assuming a structure is reused or needs replacement once during its lifetime, a tipping point was found when 24 to 44% of the structures are being replaced or reused, at which the investment is compensated. When not constructing the platform entirely directly, but adapting it when future requirements become more certain, potentially no investment is needed to be made. From the results, it can be concluded that reusability contributes to lowering the environmental impact of the jetty platform when it needs replacement or reuse at least once during its lifetime or when the given percentage of the structures are being reused once during this time. Thus, reusability can be applied to reduce the environmental impact of jetty platform structures.","Reusability; Jetty; Circular design; Life cycle Assessment; Sustainability","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering","",""

Because of the high level of expertise required to learn from- and work in a real-time environment, TU Delft created a middleware layer, DUECA (Delft University Environment for Communication and Activation), and a simulation-specific addition framework: DUSIME (Delft University SIMulation Environment). A common practice is embedding the numerical optimization tool in an aircraft model and retrieving the starting conditions, referred to as the initial trim set. Setting up such an embedded tool for every aircraft model is very labor-intensive. For over 20 years, these issues have limited the overall user experience in DUECA. Hence, the research created an independent, generic, User-commanded, Sequential Quadratic Program (SQP) module capable of solving the aircraft trim problem in DUECA. The trim module works by a user selecting a desired steady-state aircraft trajectory through a Graphic User Interface (GUI) and then commands the trim module to search for the set of initial trim conditions. The advised flight trajectory found so far by minimizing the DASMAT trim problem are the straight-and-level descending, pull-up, and turning flight. The calculated initial trim sets allow the starting up of an aircraft simulation in a steady-state, stable enough such that a pilot can take over manual control.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

(mentor); Eijt, S.W.H. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","The Bullet Cluster is a galaxy cluster, which is often used as evidence for dark matter [10]. In this thesis, Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) is studied for various interpolation functions on a model of the Bullet<br/>Cluster. MOND is a theory proposed by Milgrom which modifies the Newtonian gravity law, such that it explains the flat rotation curves observed in all the galaxies and galaxy clusters [13]. It is an alternative theory<br/>to the dark matter model and in this thesis, the results of MOND are compared to results from the paper of<br/>Paraficz et al which have studied the Bullet Cluster with the dark matter model [15]. In MOND, the Newtonian<br/>gravity law is changed at low accelerations, for a around and below the value of 1.2 · 10<sup>-10</sup>  m/s<sup>2</sup><br/>, which is introduced as a constant a<sub>0</sub> by Milgrom. Accelerations much smaller than a<sub>0</sub> are in the deep MOND regime and<br/>should satisfy certain conditions. Combining the low acceleration regime (a ≪ a<sub>0</sub>) and the Newton regime<br/>(a ≫ a<sub>0</sub>), an interpolation function is needed. The following interpolation functions are studied: the standard<br/>interpolation function, the Verlinde interpolation function and the Angus interpolation function.<br/>First the Newtonian gravitational potential Φ<sub>N</sub> is introduced which can be calculated for a certain mass<br/>distribution ρ using the Poisson equation. Also the acceleration field can be obtained from ΦN . It could<br/>be seen that in the model used in this thesis for the Bullet Cluster, the strength of the acceleration field a<br/>is mostly below a<sub>0</sub>, but not much. Similarly the MOND potential Φ<sub>M</sub> can also be calculated for ρ with the<br/>MOND equations, which are different equations for each interpolation function. The MOND equations are<br/>non-linear and can not be solved analytically in most cases. Thus a numerical iterative method is introduced<br/>to solve the MOND equations and to obtain Φ<sub>M</sub> . After obtaining Φ<sub>M</sub> for each interpolation function, the acceleration field f can also be calculated. We found that Φ<sub>M</sub> is steeper than Φ<sub>N</sub> for all interpolation functions.<br/>Also the acceleration field f is larger than a, and f is mostly above a<sub>0</sub> in the model of the Bullet Cluster used<br/>in this thesis.<br/>By substituting Φ<sub>M</sub> in the Poisson equation, another mass distribution could be obtained: apparent matter. This would be the matter distribution needed to give the acceleration field f using the Newtonian gravity<br/>law. From this matter distribution, the apparent dark matter could be obtained. We can compare this apparent dark matter distribution with the dark matter model found in the paper in Paraficz et al. Also the apparent<br/>matter distribution can be compared to the image of the Bullet Cluster. For both apparent dark matter and<br/>apparent matter, the MOND model is not in agreement with the dark matter model and the observation respectively. In general, the dark matter did not spatially coincide with the galaxies. By increasing the number<br/>of galaxies or increasing the mass of the galaxies, dark matter distributions that spatially coincide with the<br/>galaxies can be obtained","Bullet Cluster; Modified Newtonian Dynamics; Dark Matter","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Physics","",""

The class of functions for which the resulting MH kernels are Peskun optimal in high-dimensional regimes is characterized. We will refer to these functions as \textit{balancing functions} and to the class of resulting MH proposal kernels as \textit{pointwise informed proposals}. In [PG19], the class of balancing functions is used to construct Markov Jump Processes (MJP) on discrete state spaces. As a result, the Zanella process is constructed. In the absence of a theoretical result on the optimal balancing function to choose from the class of balancing functions, a heuristic approach is proposed using the Zanella process. To further encourage the mixing behaviour of the simulated chain, the algebraic structure of the state space is exploited to achieve non-reversible Markov chains on short to medium timescales.

The island is currently facing serious challenges. One of the defined issues is the lack of local food production which leads to expensive fruit and vegetables in the supermarket. This results in unhealthy diets of the citizens which leads to 60% of overweighted inhabitants in Bonaire (Verweij et al., 2020). To fight this problem, the local government of Bonaire is starting agricultural projects such as community gardens. However, there is a need for examples and knowledge on how to set up successful agricultural projects. This information is currently missing in Bonaire, which makes providing guidance in such projects the main aim of this thesis. <br/>To achieve this goal, I in my role as a researcher, became a member of an ongoing communal food initiative project in the agricultural department of Bonaire called “Nos mes por”. My integration into the community created a unique opportunity to gain real-world experiences by using participatory action research (PAR) as a methodology. In short, there are two objectives namely (1) implementing actions for “Nos mes por” (gaining action) while also (2) generating information for the process and product design of community gardens in Bonaire (gaining knowledge). <br/>This research methodology in this dissertation is compiled by using interviews, observations, and focus groups as research methods. This study resulted in both real-world actions which are applied in “Nos mes por” and specific guide-lines defined by the members of the community garden to make the project successful. Moreover, strategies to set up and design communal urban agriculture initiatives in Bonaire specifically and SIDS generally are developed. However, future research in Bonaire and SIDS should test the guidelines to see how they work in practice.","Community garden; Participatory research; Design guidelines; Bonaire","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Metropolitan Analysis, Design and Engineering (MADE)","","12.161056, -68.253778"

Both the inhabitants and tourists in Amsterdam experience nuisance from litter. The future growth of Amsterdam will only amplify this problem. To address this, the municipality needs to increase the productivity of the Schoon department, the department tasked with keeping the public space of Amsterdam clean. Therefore, the responsible and effective introduction of a cleaning robot is researched. During a series of walk-along days, interviews, experiments and observations, I identified multiple themes, important for the job satisfaction of the Schoon employees. This knowledge, combined with observed knowledge on practical challenges caused by the design of the Amsterdam public space on the cleaning activities, translates into a number of design qualities for a future cleaning robot. The results of this research seem to indicate that this cleaning robot could best be deployed during the shifts tasked with brooming the streets and emptying the trash bins, the Veegshift and Vuilnisbakkenshift respectively. During those shifts it can potentially assist in cleaning the street using the RAVO mechanical streetsweeper and emptying trash bins respectively. Assisting during those two tasks frees up manpower that can be utilized to increase the productivity of those shifts. The findings further highlight that this future robot should not compromise the freedom experienced by the Schoon employees in how they carry out their work. Nor should this robot replace the Schoon employees, as this would remove the human interaction with bystanders, an aspect of the work greatly appreciated by the employees. The loss of human interaction might also lead to a more monotonous situation, which is the opposite of the variety enjoyed by the Schoon employees during their work. The future robot should also be user friendly, allowing everyone in the department to operate the robot. Furthermore, the robot must be able to communicate its status, intentions and possible help requests and offers to its Schoon colleagues. Overall, the introduction of a cleaning robot can improve the cleanliness of the city of Amsterdam when the design incorporates the themes important for the job satisfaction of the Schoon employees, aims at an efficient human-robot collaboration through clear communication and combines the right type of autonomy with the challenging Amsterdam environment.","amsterdam; public space; waste; human robot interaction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Metropolitan Analysis, Design and Engineering (MADE)","",""

To this end, the spheroid size and cell viability were measured over time after treatment. It was also attempted to obtain further qualitative information of the effect on the spheroids using confocal microscopy. During experiments spheroids were formed of FaDu tumour cells, cells of a head-and-neck squamous cell carcinoma, using Matrigel®. These spheroids grew fast within the first 10 days of seeding up to a size of 550-600 &#x1d707;m reliably. These spheroids were then exposed to both single HT and RT as well as combined HT and RT. Both single treatment modalities showed a decrease in cell growth and cell viability with increasing treatment dose. The thermal doses of 30 and 120 CEM43 and radiation doses of 2 and 6 Gy were chosen to be used in the combined treatment experiments. Combined treatment showed an improved effect on the cell growth and cell viability for most treatment groups, both for HT followed by RT and the other way around, with the determining factor seemingly being the thermal dose. The thermal dose of 120 CEM43 combined with 6 Gy of radiation dose showed the highest cell killing potential, with 9±2% of the cell viability remaining when using radiotherapy before hyperthermia and 18±3% when starting with HT before using RT. The most significant difference in effect due to the order in which RT and HT were administered was seen in the group treated with 2 Gy of radiation dose and 120 CEM43 of thermal dose. In this group RT preceding HT resulted in a cell viability of 13±2% on day 7 after treatment, whilst HT preceding RT resulted in a cell viability of 48±8%. Visual inspection of the spheroids showed an increased effect in the form of less growth, as well as flaking around the edges of the spheroids.

The area is an example of how a former industrial port area is being transformed into a sustainable urban district. Because of the transformation of the area, the identity of the place is slowly changing to something different. Place identity is a two-way relationship in which a place influences people and where people tend to change and create the place in a way that represents them. This research wants to get insights on the place identities of the municipality of Stockholm and the residents of the Stockholm Royal Seaport, to see how synergies can be created between them. The four elements of Amundsen (2001) are used to assess and define the place identities and allow to understand what makes the areas distinctive compared to other places. With these insights, the aim of the research is to provide the municipality with recommendations for the further place branding and development of the Stockholm Royal Seaport, as many scholars argue that the identity of a place should be the base of a place branding strategy. This is important to consider as the place brand should be representative to all segments of the area, especially as it has the potential to affect the place identity over time.<br/><br/>The results of the interviews with the residents of the Stockholm Royal Seaport imply that they mainly define their place identities on spatial qualities that distinguish the place from others. Also, the characteristics or qualities of the inhabitants indicated to be important, as most responses were about the many children in the area. This element also raised awareness on the inclusivity of areas such as the Stockholm Royal Seaport. The comparison of the place identities of the municipality of Stockholm and the residents of the Stockholm Royal Seaport led to the insights that the social needs of residents without children should be considered, more efforts should be made on the socio-economic level of the area, there should be more attention to the unique location of the area and the knowledge on the sustainability of the residents needs to be improved. The element of culture and history is underrepresented in the place identities of the residents, but both the municipality and residents expect that the further development of the area might bring more awareness to this. This shows that it is important to keep monitoring and managing the place identities in transformative port-city areas. It also implies that the local unique elements are defining for the area and should be the driver of the place branding strategies of the municipality, especially as more cities are developing their former industrial port areas into urban districts.","place identity; transforming port-city areas; place branding; sustainable urban development; Stockholm","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Metropolitan Analysis, Design and Engineering (MADE)","",""

The quasi-static model of the electric field is verified using a measurement setup, which entailed the measuring of transmission and reception between electrodes and the impedances and noise of different types of electrodes. In small box of water (30L) it was shown that the quasi-static model matches the measurements and the size of electrodes influences the transmission and reception.

Using non-linear control in the future is therefore unavoidable. Being non-linear, reset control is able to achieve better performance than linear control. However, the lack of robustness to measurement noise withholds most reset controllers from being implementable in industry. The high frequency content of the noisy measurement signal causes excessive resets, which degrade the reset controller performance. In this thesis, two control loop architectures are studied while using an observer to filter out the measurement noise. Prior research is exploited to derive stability conditions and the performance of the two loop architectures is analyzed. The results show that the tracking performance of a CgLp-PID and CR-CgLp-PID controller with noisy measurements is improved by reducing the pseudo-sensitivity over a broad frequency range. The overshoot in the transient response is removed and the performance is not influenced by modelling inaccuracies in the observer when reset feedback line filtering is used. The presented architectures thus improve the reset control systems, making them well implementable in practical setups.","Reset control; Motion Control; Observer","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-07-12","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Mechatronic System Design (MSD)","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","The majority of existing infrastructure assets are ageing, and sooner or later, they will have reached the end of their service life. As a result, many asset owners are confronted with large-scale replacement projects in the coming decades. Annually, they allocate a significant number of resources, but these budgets are never adequate for executing all maintenance and replacement activities for their respective assets. It can be said that the same pattern of consequent cost overruns and budget exceedance that is observed in new infrastructure projects over the years also exists for life-cycle budgets. Based on the literature, some scholars investigate the various factors that can lead to budget overruns in new infrastructure projects. Accordingly, others are trying to deal with this issue for new infrastructure projects by proposing different models. However, little information about this issue exists for replacement projects. This research attempts to fill this gap by identifying the factors contributing to the cost overrun problem in replacement projects and providing a model to deal with them. The first part of the research contains a theoretical and practical analysis. In the first, a literature review is conducted to determine the cost overrun factors other scholars have spotted for new infrastructure projects and examine their applicability to the replacements. Once these factors are identified, then a practical examination of these factors is conducted by examining multiple case studies concerning past replacement projects. In that part, all the available cost assessments between different cost estimation phases are revied, and valuable findings are extracted, leading to the development of a conceptual model capable of explaining the cost overrun issue in reconstruction projects. Based on that, two essential characteristics of replacement projects influence the accuracy of their cost assessments. The first is associated with the fact that their budgets are usually structured based on preliminary cost estimations with a high error range and low reliability. The second is related to the fact that usually, replacement budgets are structured many years before the actual initiation of works. During this long-time frame, many changes can happen, such as price (de) escalation, which can significantly influence the initially estimated cost. All this information extracted from this twofold analysis is used in the second part of this research, which includes the process of developing and validating a model capable of dealing with these identified factors. The proposed model consists of two building blocks, each intended to target the factors that originate from the two specific characteristics of replacement budgets. More particularly, the first building block suggests a probabilistic model that can improve the current ways of preliminary estimating costs. The second intends to incorporate the price escalation effect into the estimation by using historical prices and a stochastic model. Based on the validation process, the proposed model could provide more accurate results than the current practices but also a probable range of costs and a projection of them in the future. Consequently, its use can contribute to reducing the cost overruns in reconstruction projects.","Cost overruns; Asset replacements; Forecasting; Geometric Brownian Motion; Probabilistic; Life-cycle Costing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

Owing to the high complexity of this sequential decision optimization problem, traditional methods such as thresholdbased approaches, fail to arrive at an optimal strategy, while at the same time the commonly used offline knowledge about the environment can not capture efficiently the stochastic way in which an engineering system deteriorates. Over the last few years, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has been proven a promising tool to tackle such problems, being often limited though by the dimensionality curse and the implications caused by large state and action spaces, an issue which leads to simplifications like their discretization. Bayesian principles and model updating are the most widely used tools to model accurately systems with high uncertainty, by incorporating data acquired through monitoring devices and thus improving the knowledge about the stochastic system. <br/><br/>This research proposes an integrated framework that aims to determine an optimal sequence of maintenance decisions over the lifespan of deteriorating engineering systems, combining the aforementioned core concepts of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) and Bayesian Model Updating (BMU).

All these tools will be first applied to elementary problems for the sake of verification and validation, while the culmination of this research is the application of the framework on a more realistic and complicated, multi-component structure. The obtained results are compared with benchmark performances to properly showcase the efficiency and the weaknesses of the tool.","Deep Reinforcement Learning; Bayesian Inference; Infrastructure maintenance; Continuous state-space; Proximal Policy Optimization; Double Deep Q-Network; Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering","",""

Together this is called the missing mass problem and the most well known theory trying to explain these differences states that there is additional undetectable mass in the form of dark matter. Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) is another theory that tries to explain these discrepancies in a different way then by introducing dark matter. Instead the theory changes Newtons law of gravity for low accelerations, smaller than Milgroms constant a0. In this bachelor thesis we look at a discrete model to simulate MOND in galaxy clusters. To simplify calculations we will not be looking at full MOND, which holds for all accelerations but instead we look at the so called deep MOND, which only holds for accelerations much smaller than a0. We use two different versions of the Poisson equation, the standard version for Newtonian dynamics and a modified version for MOND, to compute the gravitational potential fields caused by a mass density distribution. This is done by using the discrete Fourier transform on an discretized region of space. The initial mass density distribution consists of a number  of galaxies ranging between 50 and 1000 per cluster. Each galaxy is modelled as a sphere of constant density. To calculate the potential with MOND we use an iterative process starting from the potential we get using Newtonian dynamics. In this iterative process we made use of the Helmholtz decomposition. From the MOND potential we can compute an apparent mass distribution, which is the mass distribution that would result in the same MOND potential using Newtonian dynamics. This apparent matter distribution we use to predict at what distance of a galaxy most apparent dark matter is located. Lastly we also look at the apparent mass distributions when the galaxy cluster is projected on a 2d plane. All of these calculations were made in Python on a discrete grid of 256 × 256 × 256 points.<br/>When looking at the total amount of apparent mass in concentric spheres around galaxies in our cluster we saw that this increases in three distinct phases. The middle phases, where a linear increase was seen, had a slope in the same order of magnitude as the theoretical value. We found that the average apparent mass density is the highest in the center of galaxies and decreases very quickly at higher distance to the galaxy. When the distance becomes high enough to reach neighbouring galaxies in the same cluster the average apparent mass density stabilizes and becomes almost constant, but still slightly decreases. For the projected mass density a similar pattern was found.","MOND; Poisson equation; Galaxy clusters; Helmholtz decomposition","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics | Applied Physics","",""

Prior designed variable reluctance tunable magnet actuators use a C-shaped actuator that has a quadratic relation between the force and the flux. By using lumped parameter models, an Hybrid Tunable Magnet Actuator design based on biased fluxes is developed. The linear behaviour of this design is proven by a finite element analysis. The force-flux relation is piecewise linear for different positions depending on the direction of the flux. Within a position range of ± 500 µm and a force range of ± 20 N, the error of a linear fit is in the order of 0.08 N. With an experimental setup the linear relation is also proven with an error of 0.03 N. Comparing the designed tunable magnet actuator with an hybrid reluctance actuator shows that the tunable magnet actuator is more efficient for quasi-static forces that are constant for time periods longer than 1.4 s.","actuators; tunable magnet; magnetic circuits","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Mechatronic System Design (MSD)","",""

As a result, fast charging that can ensure long-distance drive with shorter charging time draws more and more attention.<br/><br/>In emerging fast-charging stations, DC fast chargers (DCFCs) are employed which rely on power electronics and control to achieve the required performance. Harmonic current emission induced by the complex system behavior is of great concern in the DC fast charger (DCFC) system. This thesis proposes a harmonic emission model for the typical DCFC design, i.e., the two-level active front end. The technique is based on the Fourier series method and the impedance model which is able to reveal the harmonic current emission of DCFCs under different grid conditions. Time-domain simulations and experiments are presented subsequently to validate the proposed model.<br/><br/>The analytical model can be implemented in cloud-based charging, which is a popular topic right now because of the lower overall cost. Besides, cloud-based systems have a larger storage capacity and are easier to maintain. Another reason for the appealing cloud-based charging is that all of these Internet of things (IoT) devices are interconnected, and vehicle data are shared.

The high voltage grid connections are expensive and increasingly difficult to receive permits for. This work presents a solution in which the high voltage grid connection is undersized in comparison to the renewable energy generator. A battery energy storage system is installed in the local grid to solve the issue of excess energy generation (congestion).<br/><br/>A simulation of the local network has been built that models a battery energy storage system (BESS), the network and uses data from a solar park. A case study in which a 19 MW solar park is connected to the high voltage grid with a transformer of only 14 MW as well as a 14 MW | 30 MWh BESS on the network is investigated in the rest of the work. Furthermore a BESS control strategy for price arbitrage on the TenneT imbalance market is presented and encoded such that it can be optimised.<br/><br/>Four heuristics are presented that time and size the congestion issue in a manner the control strategy of the BESS can prepare for and solve congestion when necessary. These heuristics are tested against strategies optimized for revenue maximisation through price arbitrage. While the most aggressive strategies did not solve all the congestion events in these simulations, we found that the heuristic that takes the average generation of the solar park into account performs the best while remaining appropriately conservative.<br/><br/>A basic evolutionary algorithm is presented that optimizes a BESS control strategy for price arbitrage when the BESS is not needed on the local network to solve congestion. Although the strategies earn ~33% less revenue due to the congestion related limitations, the optimisation surrounding congestion does improve revenue by 2.58%.<br/><br/>The results presented in this work suggest that this setup of a local grid can be economically viable and that the BESS can solve the congestion issue when steered with an appropriate control strategy.

While several passive surveillance methods exist, such as primary drone radar, a cooperative surveillance system would provide more data to airspace users and other drones to allow for features such as automatic separation. An Automatic Dependent Surveillance system concept is presented in this paper, allowing the drone to broadcast information about itself without external input.

Through the literature, it was found that direct integration of the system with current ADS-B on the 1090 MHz frequency is possible, but may cause performance degradation for existing aircraft. Therefore, the carrier frequency and code allocation are changed. The simulation and capacity study shows that the system works in high-density scenarios (in excess of one drone per square kilometer), but will require additional work on hardware, format and modulation techniques to enable this. <br/>Finally, the hardware demonstrator shows that an inexpensive COTS implementation with a range of approximately 200 meters is possible, on hardware drawing less than five Watts of power.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering | Control & Simulation","",""

Over the past years, engine-off taxiing techniques have been considered to reduce the environmental impact of airport taxiing operations. One promising technique is Tug-Enabled Engine-Off Taxiing, a concept in which aircraft are towed to the runway by an external towing truck. However, implementation of this concept changes operations at the airport and creates challenges to coordinate and control vehicles efficiently and safely. Although operational changes are mostly expected in the bay areas and around decoupling locations close to the runways, especially bay areas are often excluded or simplified in existing research. In this work, we therefore aim to analyze Tug-Enabled Engine-Off Taxiing by using a detailed airport layout that includes bay area movements, such as push-back and engine start. A novel hierarchical multi-agent planning approach is used to route aircraft over the airport as an alternative to the current Air Traffic Control System. Vehicle movements are planned by a routing algorithm that accounts for shapes and kinematics. Real-world flight schedules from two days, under different runway modes of operation, were used to simulate ground surface movement operations. We compared outbound Tug-Enabled Taxiing to Multi-Engine Taxiing (MET) operations regarding taxi time, taxi distance, and bay area taxi times. Aircraft engine start times and tug decoupling durations were varied between in short, medium, and long scenarios. Our results show that the difference in taxi time between Tug-Enabled Taxiing and MET largely depends on the engine start time, decoupling duration, and taxiing distance to the runway. For runways far away from the ramps, lower taxiing velocities and the need for tug decoupling resulted in longer outbound taxi times in the Tug-Enabled Taxiing scenarios. However, in scenarios with long engine start time combined with short decoupling duration, the increase in taxi time was largely balanced out by a reduction of bay area taxi time. This trend becomes even more visible for operations to runways close to the ramps, since the engine start time forms a larger share of the total MET taxi time. Inbound flights were not significantly influenced by the Tug-Enabled Taxiing concept for outbound aircraft.","Engine-off taxiing; multi-agent systems; bay area operations; Artificial intelligence; Hierarchical multi-agent path planning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-07-11","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

(graduation committee); Bazyar, H. (graduation committee); van Lier, J.B. (graduation committee); Jafari, Morez (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","The aim of this research was to evaluate the feasibility of direct hollow fiber nanofiltration membranes for drinking water purposes. The experiments were performed on the dNF40 pilot provided by NXF. The fouling potential and the ion retention of the dNF40 pilot were determined by continuous filtration experiments using raw IJssellake water under different operational conditions. The performances (ion retention and fouling potential) of the dNF40 on raw IJssellake water were compared with the dNF40 performances on pre-treated water from Waterwinstation Prinses Juliana (WPJ) (previously done at PWNT). The WPJ pre-treated water has undergone extensive pre-treatment consisting of drum screens, flocculation, sedimentation, rapid sand filtration (RSF) and granular activated carbon (GAC). The OMP retention of the dNF40 pilot was determined by full recirculation experiments using WPJ pre-treated water under two different operational conditions with elevated concentrations 'spiked solution'.<br/>Limited to no fouling impact was observed on the membrane performance when feeding the pilot with raw IJssellake water. The membrane performance parameters (mass transfer coefficient (MTC), trans membrane pressure (TMP) and normalized pressure drop (NPD)) were stable over time. In addition, limited to no fouling impact was observed on the membrane when feeding the pilot with WPJ pre-treated water. However, membrane performance (i.e. MTC) was better for raw IJssellake water (1 year old membrane) compared to WPJ pre-treated water (virgin membrane). This implies that the active outer layer of the membrane has undergone a change in properties leading to these higher MTC values. <br/>An increase in recovery, flux and crossflow velocity resulted in a decrease in ion retention. However, a decrease in ion retention with elevated crossflow velocity is unusual. Higher crossflow velocities should actually lead to an increase in ion retention due to reduced ion build-up next to the membrane surface (i.e. lower concentration polarization effect). However, the lower ion retention can be attributed to the elevated MTC during experiments. The removal of natural organic matter (NOM) was consistently above 90% and was not influenced by a change in operational condition. Ion retention was higher for WPJ pre-treated water (virgin membrane) compared to raw IJssellake water (1 year old membrane). This can be attributed to the increase in MTC of 1.5 LMH/bar in raw IJssellake water (compared to WPJ pre-treated water) potentially caused by a change in the properties of the active outer layer.<br/>For determining the OMP retention of the dNF40 membrane, a spiked solution containing per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and pharmaceutical compounds was analyzed. The PFAS compounds of the spiked solution were retained very well (above 80%). As expected, the retention increased with increasing MW. The adsorption percentage of PFAS was between 40%-90%. The pharmaceutical retention was around 30%, although all pharmaceuticals analyzed had a MW below the MWCO of the membrane. <br/>A 5-stage full-scale dNF40 plant was designed based on a permeate flow of 15 M m3/year, a total hardness concentration in the permeate stream below 1.4 mmol/L and a recovery percentage of 85%. Based on the 5-stage full-scale dNF40 plant an economical analysis was performed and compared to the full-scale UF-RO in Heemskerk. The total cost (OPEX and CAPEX) were cheapest for the full-scale dNF40 plant fed with raw IJssellake water (12 ct/m3), followed by the dNF40 plant fed with WPJ pre-treated water (32 ct/m3) and most expensive for the UF-RO plant (35 ct/m3). The major factors in the OPEX was the membrane replacement cost for the dNF40 plant and the energy and chemical cost for the UF-RO plant.","direct nanofiltration; membrane fouling; ion retention; OMP removal; surface water","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-07-11","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

(mentor); Venkatesha Prasad, Ranga Rao (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Tactile Internet (TI) is the next step in the evolution of our digital communication. It will extend the conventional audiovisual interaction by enabling the users to convey the sense of touch over vast distances in real time. The potential to transfer haptic (touch) information will have a significant impact on many industries as well as on everyday life. However, there is still a long way to go in achieving a fully immersive user experience. One of the most significant shortcomings of today’s haptic devices is their lack of ability to reproduce texture. The conventional way of high-quality texture reproduction is to control the vertical displacement of pins in a two-dimensional finger-mounted pin array. In such a Haptic Texture Device (HTD) the final quality of the texture will solely depend on the actuation method of a single pin. A Haptic Texture Device Actuator (HTDA) needs to match the fingertip’s force sensitivity and spatial resolution and the reaction time of a human for fingertip stimuli. It must also be small enough to be integrated into handheld or wearable haptic devices. We have based our work on an existing HTD design that is fast enough to match the human reaction time and has a small enough pitch between adjacent pins to match the fingertip’s spatial resolution. However, in other aspects of haptic perception, the design fell short of the expectations. We have improved the HTDA of this base design to match every requirement of haptic perception. To match the force sensitivity of the fingertip, we have added a Hall-effect sensor to the actuator design for position measurement and implemented a closed-loop actuator control based on the measured pin position. Using the same actuator concept in a new configuration allowed us to decrease the actuator length by 12.5% while increasing the force output by 50%. Besides not fully matching the requirements of human haptic perception, the base design had a serious flaw. Due to minimal design, the HTDA’s of the base design tend to interfere, causing unwanted pin actuation. We were able to mitigate this issue by adding a backiron to our design. A backiron is essentially a layer of ferromagnetic material around the actuator, which besides magnetic shielding, also contributed to the 50% increase in force output. Our improved HTDA design enables the development of a HTD, capable of high quality texture reproduction.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Embedded Systems","",""

These deficiencies can play a role in the disease, but also expose vulnerabilities with therapeutic potential. Targeted treatments exploit specific repair deficiencies, for instance based on synthetic lethality. To decide which patients could benefit from such therapies requires the ability to determine the repair deficiency status of a tumor. It has been suggested that mutational signatures could be better predictors of DNA repair deficiency than loss of function in select genes. However, current models for prediction of repair deficiency rely on mutational signatures extracted using unsupervised learning techniques. As a result, the signatures are not optimized to discriminate between repair deficiency status or pathway. We argue that the supervised learning of mutational signatures guided by repair deficiency status could enable the identification of signatures that are predictive of repair deficiency, and capture underlying mechanisms of DNA repair.<br/>Results: We propose S-NMF, a supervised non-negative matrix factorization method, which jointly optimizes two objectives: (1) learning of signatures shared across tumor samples using NMF, and (2) learning of signatures predictive of repair deficiency using logistic regression. We apply S-NMF to mutation profiles of human induced pluripotent cell lines carrying knockouts of genes involved in three DNA repair pathways: homologous recombination, base excision repair, and mismatch repair. We show that S-NMF achieves high prediction accuracy (0.971) and learns signatures that better distinguish the repair deficiency of a sample.

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Wind energy plays an essential role in the transition to a sustainable future and wind turbines allow us to utilize it. Wind turbines are often installed in close proximity to make the best use of the given space and to save costs. This also has the disadvantage that the turbines influence each other due to wakes. This is where wind farm control strategies can help to increase the power generated by the farm again. Model based wake steering is a promising strategy which utilizes a surrogate model to determine the best set-points for the wind farm. FLORIDyn is one surrogate model which provides basic flow dynamics at a very low computational cost.<br/><br/>In this thesis we increase the fidelity of FLORIDyn by extracting features from high fidelity simulations and extending the model. A crucial element of the wake description is the center line, especially for wake steering. We present a pipeline which 1.) extracts the center line from given flow field data, 2.) converts the center line into FLORIDyn model inputs, 3.) identifies a state-space model to translate the low fidelity center line behaviour to one closer to the high fidelity, and eventually 4.) extends the model.<br/><br/>To achieve this, we test and compare DMDc and MOESP system identification methods in two simulation cases with a 10 deg and 20 deg yaw step. The results indicate that the DMDc implementation has a better fit than the MOESP models. To get an idea of the general behaviour, we also test the models in a 15 deg case they have not been trained for.<br/><br/>Previously, the FLORIS and FLORIDyn parameters had only been trained for steady state conditions. This study can be seen as a proof-of-work that shows that dynamic extensions for FLORIDyn are possible, and how to perform this for the center line. The DMDc system identification showed to be a promising tool in identifying high fidelity dynamics from SOWFA simulations, due to its ability of identifying large scale physical systems. Research on the implementation of the FLORIDyn model in a model based wake steering framework is required to make a trade-off between the need for a more dynamical model, and following additional computational cost. <br/><br/>The current application of the framework is limited to the use of two dimensional SOWFA flow field snapshots at hub height, a turbulence free environment, the use of a single wind velocity and single yaw step data in the system identification. Further research and more extensive training data is required to broaden the framework to more real-life scenarios. Furthermore, the computational efficiency of the identified DMDc model can still be improved by decreasing the amount of center line states, making it better applicable in a model based framework.","Wind farm; modelling; FLORIS; FLORIDyn; SOWFA; center line; dynamics; implementation; Identification; DMDc; MOESP; Dynamic; Mode; Decomposition; Control","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

(mentor); Bishnoi, A. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Out of Home advertising is traditional outdoor advertising. Over the last decade the digital Out of Home advertising possibilities have grown substantially. These possibilities include hour-based advertisement schedules, rapidly implemented changes to advertisements and obtaining location data from consumers being exposed to advertisements. Investigating these possibilities further for improving customer engagement and optimising target group reach is of great importance in marketing and marketing science. This thesis will focus on exposure data obtained from vehicle locations in central London. Using this data we want to model the frequency with which individuals see advertisements and research the overlap in exposures of individuals to multiple media vehicles where advertisements are displayed. We focus on modelling exposures of individuals to two vehicles, comparing different types of bivariate distributions. In this thesis we present the comparison of two models: an adapted version of the Sarmanov bivariate distribution and copulas. We refer to these models as the Danaher and Copula model respectively.<br/><br/>The fitting and simulations of the models are based on bivariate data of two specified vehicles, to be able to comment on the overlap between these vehicles. To investigate the performance of the models all combinations of vehicles are modelled after which the results are combined. Both models simulate small frequencies of exposures of individuals adequate, but for more extreme values both models fail to represent the observed data. Especially the simulation of overlap is done poorly by the models. Several approaches have been tried to improve the models' performance, without much success. The analysis shows that the data at hand requires more sophisticated methods to handle joint exposure and more research needs to be done.<br/><br/>In addition the variable distance is added to the research problem, which intuitively has great influence on the overlap between media vehicles. This is done by using 3-dimensional copulas. For this research we modify the data: instead of first fitting and simulating a copula model on the data of two vehicles and then combining the results of all vehicle combinations, we first combine the data from all the combinations of vehicles and repeat the fitting procedure thereafter. Several options for the modelling of these copulas are presented. Similar analysis shows, again, that the nature of the data requires more complex models to handle the overlap while also accounting for the vehicle distance. Finally, using the modified data we look back at the 2-dimensional copula model and perceive an excellent resemblance of the data for the Student-t copula.","Probability Theory; Copulas; Dependencies; Marketing; Bivariate analysis","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","This Bachelor End Project Thesis is about creating parallel variants of time-dependent methods. To achieve this, the time-dependent problem is formulated as a large system of linear equations that is solved iteratively. This linear system is determined from the time-dependent linear heat equation in 1D that all the analysis is about. The experiments are tested for different boundary condition combinations. Namely, for a mixture of Dirichlet, Neumann and Robin conditions. Also, three different time integration methods are used, namely Forward Euler, Backward Euler and the θ-Rule for θ = 0.2, 0.4, 0.6 and θ = 0.8. Since time is continuous and moves in the positive direction, time integration methods need the previous solution in order to find the current solution. Executing a calculation in parallel time is therefore a complex and tricky phenomenon. This research considers two different iterative methods, the block Jacobi method and the block GaussSeidel method. Both have a lot in common but the main difference lies in the use of different parts of the matrix. Where the Jacobi method uses just the diagonal in order to approximate the inverse, the Gauss-Seidel method also uses the upper or lower triangular part of the matrix. Therefore, creating a parallel variant for the block Jacobi method is easily possible, but for the block Gauss-Seidel method it is not. In order to get to a valid conclusion, the stability of each time integration method is considered. The block Jacobi method converges slowly to the solution since it uses the diagonal for every step instead of the whole matrix. Therefore, in this research, combinations of the block Gauss-Seidel method have been created and tested. Three different variants are discussed. The first one is the step-wise combination method which uses a block Jacobi iteration for every step size chosen, and uses the sequential Gauss-Seidel time steps for all the other iterations. The second variant is called the Red-Black Ordering and is known for its odd and even iterations. Here every odd iteration is done in parallel and similar for its even iterations. Since the equation only needs its previous solution, this method would work very well in parallel. The last variant uses the number of processors to manipulate the maximum number of iterations. Here the method converges earlier or at the number of processors chosen. What can be concluded from the results is that the way a method converges all depends on how many Jacobi iterations take place during the computation. The Gauss-Seidel calculation only takes one iteration, so the time until the solution converges all depends on how many Jacobi iterations the method computes. Having a computer with more processors than number of Jacobi iterations performed, will also speed-up the computation. Our predictions show in particular that with only implicit time integration methods the speed-up can really be achieved. For the block Jacobi method, this equals that the maximum number of iterations is also the number of time steps nt. The Gauss-Seidel variants are all more efficient, since less Jacobi iterations are used. For variant 1, the step-wise combination method, the maximum number of iterations equals nt/step . For the Red-Black Ordering method, every other iteration, a Jacobi step is used so the maximum number of iterations equals nt/2. The last variant, the processor-wise combination method, is a special variant of the first variant. This method has the characteristic that the maximum number of iterations equals the chosen number of processors, np and therefore has, in terms of the first variant, a ’step’-size of nt/np. This project has been conducted with Matlab which did not fully cooperate when using the parallel time function. In order to really test, and therefore not predict, the obvious way to perform a parallel computation is to implement this program in another programming language and later on test it on the DelftBlue supercomputer. The predictions should still hold but the results will be more clearly visualised.","Parallelism; Numerical Analysis; Jacobi method; Gauss-Seidel","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics","",""

This research contributes significantly to the scientific knowledge base, as ZTA is hardly investigated. Moreover, recent developments are causing the perimeter to disappear, such as increasing collaboration between companies, ecosystem connections, and working from home due to Covid-19. As a result, public and private organizations need to rethink how to protect their IT infrastructure, assets and data better.<br/>Several organizations are willing to opt for a Zero Trust approach because of its benefits.

Additionally, innovation in enterprise architecture security is urgently needed as it can reduce data breaches, decrease lateral movement, and avoid ransom payments and a company freeze.<br/><br/>Even though Zero Trust brings many advantages, it has not yet replaced existing perimeter-based security approaches. The complication is that many organizations struggle with the implementation of ZTA due to a lack of knowledge and clarity on how to implement the Zero Trust security strategy.

(mentor); Pfenninger, S. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Heavy-duty trucks (HDTs) are a significant contributor to global anthropogenic carbon emissions. In contrary to passenger cars, HDTs have to cope with decarbonization complications due to range and weight characteristics. Overhead catenary electric road systems (ERS-OC) can aid in decarbonizing this sector. Here, trucks are equipped with a pantograph and connect to catenaries on the highway, using electricity from the grid for propulsion. This technology complements other drivetrains and eliminates some of their major flaws, allowing HDTs to travel large distances with modest batteries or fossil-fuel consumption. Countries like Germany and Sweden have dedicated efforts and resources to ERS-OC as a carbon mitigation solution, and have multiple demonstration projects in use. However, this technology is lacking attention in the Netherlands, while emission reduction targets are closing in, and emissions keep rising. <br/><br/>Initiating ERS-OC activities through a demonstration project is determined to be a logical starting point in various countries. Identifying their perceptions is considered an essential step when aiming to implement an ERS-OC demonstration project. The aim of this research is therefore to answer the following research question: What are stakeholder-perceived factors that affect the feasibility of creating an overhead catenary electric road system demonstration project? This research is performed by conducting a qualitative case study for ERS-OC in the Netherlands. Nine interviews were conducted with organizations that have shown interest in the technology as a business opportunity. These nine respondents represent six out of the seven stakeholder groups that compose the ERS-OC system-of-systems. It has to be noted that no energy supplier was able to respond. Their perception of ERS-OC is therefore not considered during this research. The respondents were able to talk freely to avoid biases resulting from suggestive questioning, but the conversation was guided to other topics when necessary. The factors explaining stakeholder perceptions were extracted from the transcripts and coded to enable statistical analysis.<br/><br/>First, the perceptions of the individual stakeholder groups were analyzed. From the results can be concluded that the truck manufacturers mainly foresee implementation issues in the first years due to complications gathering investments. They think that when profitability is proven and the system will have shown it can play a vital role in decarbonizing HDTs, that upscaling will be just a matter of time. Freight operators are willing to engage, but need others to finance and construct the infrastructure, since they cannot afford to build infrastructure on their own. They are looking for the most cost-efficient manner to decarbonize their fleet, and it does not matter what technology that would be. The governmental entities acknowledge the potential of ERS-OC as a carbon mitigation tool, the huge reduction potential of electrifying the core highway network, and other advantages like decreased resource dependency, but await international developments to have guidelines on how to configure the system-of-systems, which explains stakeholder roles, responsibilities, and the interfaces between stakeholders,. They highlight that political acceptance of the technology is essential for the successful implementation of an ERS-OC network. Road power component producers highlight the unique capability of complementing other zero-emission drivetrains, and emphasize that ERS-OC should be considered as support for other powertrains rather than competition. They also consider it a cost-efficient measure compared to zero-emission alternatives, and say that ERS-OC is the only zero-emission technology that is currently implementable on a large scale for HDTs. There are few technical hurdles to overcome, proof of concept is present, but political urgency is lacking. Their biggest perceived barrier is a lack of leadership and priority with policymakers, and they think ERS-OC copes with an image problem. Standardization of catenary systems is considered key for the rollout of an international network. The construction firm sees the opportunity of bringing stakeholder groups together to create awareness and support base, and identify the lack of leadership as the main obstructing factor. Awareness among potentially involved parties is absent and increasing which could induce fast progression of ERS-OC implementation. The researchers state that ERS-OC seems expensive, but can have short payback periods, especially when compared to alternatives. Shuttle routes should be used when creating a demonstration project. They express concerns about power transfer issues when system occupation is high, and about the overall circularity of the system. They state further research is required before efforts and resources should be dedicated to ERS-OC.<br/><br/>The second sub-question investigates the perceived enabling and disabling factors for ERS-OC. Setting up policies stimulating engagement in ERS-OC is mentioned as a key enabling factor. The respondents state that they perceive configuring the system-of-systems as a significant challenge. Technological maturity is perceived as an opportunity that has to be exploited. Proof of concept is present and cost estimations are predictable, and there are few technical uncertainties. Catenary infrastructure can complement alternative powertrains, which is considered a vital enabling factor by the respondents. On the other hand, the possible technological breakthroughs of the other technologies is considered a disabling factor. On a political level, a decreased dependency on foreign resources is mentioned as an enabling factor, while the lack of political urgency to decarbonize HDTs in general is perceived as disabling. Economically, the potential cost reduction is an enabler, while the large upfront investment required is seen as an obstructing factor. The opportunity to lobby for a support base is frequently mentioned as an enabling factor. The emission reduction that can be achieved is mentioned often as an enabling factor of ERS-OC, a technology that complies with the ambitions of the organizations. However, the researchers mention that the circularity of the system as a whole should be furtherly assessed before conclusions on the overall environmental impact of ERS-OC can be made. <br/><br/>The last sub-question is dedicated to extracting the enabling and disabling factors that directly affect the feasibility of a demonstration project through the yes/no approach. Enabling incentives for organizations to engage in a demonstration project are that ERS-OC is a zero-emission technology that is considered sustainable. The opportunities that enable a demonstration project are technological maturity, setting up policies, lobbying for a support base, and using a shuttle route for the demonstration to ensure utilization. The perceived barriers to a demonstration project are a lack of leadership, vision, and perspective. This puts a risk on the significant investment that is required for the realization of the demonstration. The challenges that have to be overcome exist in configuring the system-of-systems, and gathering the investments required for the demonstration. Politically, the urgency to decarbonize HDTs has to increase, and ERS-OC has to be accepted by policymakers as a decarbonization measure before the demonstration project can take place.<br/>Aggregating the findings of the three sub-question enables answering the main research question. The stakeholder-perceived factors that affect the feasibility of creating a demonstration project are divided into internal and external factors for the organizations. The incentives that positively affect the feasibility of creating a demonstration project, according to stakeholders, are organizational ambitions, political urgency, the need for electrification, the societal pressure on decision-makers, and the opportunity for stakeholders to generate more business by entering new markets. The opportunities, perceived by stakeholders, that positively affect the feasibility of creating a demonstration project are the technological maturity, lobbying for support base, creation of enabling policies, the proof of concept that shows the functionality of the technology, and creating a test site or game to familiarize stakeholders with the technology and their future role and responsibility. Starting with a shuttle route and gradually expanding the network is an opportunity that needs to be kept in mind when choosing a location. Stakeholders can take an early advantage when engaging in the demonstration project, and green investors that aim to gain profits from the sustainability trend can be attracted when struggling with financing the project. The stakeholder-perceived barriers that negatively affect the feasibility of creating a demonstration project are waiting for international developments to provide an example, a lack of leadership, a lack of vision and perspective, absence of incentives to engage in ERS-OC projects, the lack of consequences when emission agreements are not met, the magnitude of investment that individual organizations have to make, and the risk of losing that investment when the technology will not become successful as an HDT decarbonization measure. The challenges that might negatively affect the feasibility of creating a demonstration project are mainly political. Setting up the system-of-systems that explains stakeholder roles, responsibilities, and interactions is required before a demonstration project can be set up. An attractive business case that is profitable for all involved parties needs to be composed before the required suitable partners can be attracted. It is essential that ERS-OC is politically accepted as a decarbonization measure, and that the political urgency is present that allows for the required resources to be released.<br/><br/>When interpreting the results, the following statements can be made. All respondents acknowledge the potential added value of ERS-OC to HDT decarbonization. They are also all positive about engaging in a demonstration project. But, there are planning and financing concerns that have to be addressed first before stakeholder engagement can be ensured. The respondents expect governmental entities to take the lead, and account for (part of) the funding. But, they are waiting for international developments and feasibility reports before dedicating efforts to ERS-OC. Still, it is this stakeholder that is expected to take the lead and induce progression. It is up to the researchers to provide the substantiated information on ERS-OC implementation that justifies investments for the governmental entities. When clear statements and promises about the future of ERS-OC are subsequently made, freight operators and truck manufacturers will investigate the possibility to engage in ERS-OC. When these stakeholders decide to engage in ERS-OC-related projects as well, ERS-OC is likely to succeed. Trust in the future of the technology will increase among stakeholders. And then, the construction firms, road power component suppliers, and energy suppliers will engage too, adding an additional market to their portfolio without having to change their core business. <br/><br/>The main themes that are identified when aiming to create a demonstration project are questions like: who will take the lead? What is expected from me? Where do we start? How do we finance this? How do we start? Based on the findings of this research, the following can be recommended. Start with assigning a project leader, and create a clear vision for the future of ERS, this will create trust among stakeholders about the investments they have to make. Then, the required investments for the infrastructure should be gathered from either public or private money. When this is secured, find a suitable corridor where multiple operators drive back and forth daily and which has a high truck occupation. Bind them by making a financially attractive offer, for instance by subsidizing catenary trucks or usage of catenary infrastructure.

With limited patching resources and only a fraction of the vulnerabilities posing a real threat, prioritization is key. Current prioritization methods, such as CVSS, are failing and are sometimes no better than random guessing. Exploit Prediction Systems (EPS) try to fill this gap leveraging a data-driven approach. Related works in the exploit prediction domain make EPS design decisions based on different methodological assumptions. Some of these assumptions are unrealistic or faulty, yielding models that fail to represent a real world situation.<br/>The first contribution of this thesis is the identification of critical methodological assumptions in EPS design and the magnitude of their effects. Then, as second contribution, EPS performance is optimized under restricting yet realistic circumstances, by exploring different techniques to handle class-imbalance, creating richer textual features and/or leveraging different prediction algorithms. The third contribution of this thesis is the implementation of an open-source framework that enables easy experimentation with different machine learning techniques for exploit prediction.<br/><br/>Six critical methodological assumptions have been identified in the area of realistic data collection, correct processing of data, and proper model evaluation. Experiments show that when adhering to the most realistic assumptions, only a fraction of the predictive power of the evaluated EPS is sustained. Almost all prior works fall victim to at least one faulty or unrealistic assumption, and thereby report overoptimistic results.<br/><br/>Substantial improvements are achieved in the optimization step of this thesis. With an optimized EPS with a F1-score of 0.366, performance is insufficient to justify its deployment in a production environment. With the current level of maturity, exploit prediction could have value as a complementary measure to existing vulnerability prioritization systems. Further improvements and more transparent systems are essential for EPS to be suitable for practical usage.","Exploit prediction; Exploit Prediction Systems; EPS; patching management; vulnerability management","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science | Cyber Security","4TU Cyber Security Specialisation",""

In this thesis, we aim to reduce bias against non-native speakers of Dutch compared to native Dutch speakers. Typically, an important source of bias is insufficient training data. We therefore investigate employing three different data augmentation techniques to increase the amount of non-native accented Dutch training data, i.e., speed and volume perturbation and pitch shift, and using these for two transfer learning techniques: model fine-tuning and multi-task learning, to reduce bias in a state-of-the-art hybrid HMM-DNN Kaldi-based ASR system. Experimental results on read speech and human-computer interaction (HMI) speech showed that although individual data augmentation techniques did not always yield an improved recognition performance, the combination of all three data augmentation techniques did. Importantly, bias was reduced by more than 18% absolute compared to the baseline system for read speech when applying pitch shift data augmentation and multi-task training, and by more than 7% for HMI speech when applying all three data augmentation techniques during fine-tuning, while improving recognition accuracy of both the native and non-native Dutch speech.","automatic speech recognition; bias; data augmentation; transfer learning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Engineering","",""

Recently, carrier-selective passivating contact (CSPC) designs have shown that they can effectively reduce recombination losses and exhibit efficiencies above 25 % which approaches the Shockley-Queisser limit of single-junction solar cells. To overcome this intrinsic efficiency limit, research and industry have started to investigate multijunction devices which utilize two different absorber layers in order to reduce the spectral mismatch losses. In this project, the focus lies on the fabrication of a high temperature CSPC bottom cell with polycrystalline silicon oxide (poly-SiOx) for the application in a 2-terminal perovskite/c-Si tandem device. Poly-SiOx features a higher transparency due to a wider band gap which can decrease the free-carrier absorption (FCA) and induce larger band bending in comparison to the classic polycrystalline silicon (poly-Si) contacts.<br/>To fabricate a c-Si solar cell with high temperature carrier-selective passivating contacts, the passivation of the contacts was optimised using symmetric lifetime samples. It was found that the optimal processing conditions for the dry thermal oxidation process and the high temperature annealing step are 675 °C for 3 minutes and 900 °C for 15 minutes, respectively. This resulted in an implied open-circuit voltage (iV<sub>OC</sub>) for the n-doped and p-doped symmetric samples after hydrogenation of 745 mV and 674 mV, respectively. Those optimised processing conditions were adopted for the fabrication of a single-junction n-type front-side polished and p-type rear-side textured CSPC solar cell. This resulted in a solar cell with an efficiency of 16.67 %. By lowering the thermal budget of the recovery annealing conditions after the sputtering of the transparent conductive oxide (TCO), the passivation properties are restored more effectively. This resulted in an enhanced solar cell with a final efficiency of 18.76 %. Other techniques to improve the performance like the modification of the p-layer thickness, the incorporation of an additional annealing step after the a-Si deposition, or the introduction of indium tungsten oxide (IWO) as the TCO did not result in an improvement of the final solar cell efficiency. Optical simulations were performed in GenPro4 to investigate the optical performance of the solar cell. Finally, a 2-terminal perovskite/c-Si tandem device with a high temperature carrier-selective passivating c-Si bottom cell was fabricated in cooperation with TU Eindhoven. The final tandem solar cell exhibits an efficiency of 23.10 % with a fill factor of 74.00 %, a V<sub>OC</sub> of 1.76 V and a J<sub>SC</sub> of 17.81 mA/cm<sup>2</sup>.","Solar cells; c-Si; tandem solar cells; carrier-selective passivating contacts; poly-SiOx carrier selective contacts","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-07-04","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

(mentor); Groenevelt, W.G.M. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","This research consists of two applications of image processing, namely, image compression and image denoising. Image compression aims to reduce the size of an image without losing too many features. This is often used to store a large number of images such as fingerprints. Denoising is a technique for removing noise from an image while preserving as many of the edges and other detailed features as possible. This research studies the use of different discrete wavelets and the Dual Tree Complex Wavelets in the image compression and denoising process. The wavelet transform decomposes the original image into approximation and detail coefficients, where the approximation coefficients are calculated by averaging and the detail coefficients by taking differences. The wavelet transform is also invertible so that the image can be reconstructed again using the approximation and detail coefficients. The compression and denoising method consists of three steps: decomposition, thresholding and reconstruction. The difference between compression and denoising lies in the threshold part. For image compression, a percentage of the detail coefficient is chosen as the threshold. The wavelets db6, sym5, coif3, bior4.4 and rbio1.5 are chosen to compress the images. The images are tested with compression rates ranging from 5:1 to 43:1. Based on the Structural Similarity Index Measurement (SSIM), the bior4.4 wavelet performs best. For denoising, the threshold is optimised to obtain a denoised image. The discrete wavelets used are db4, coif3, bior2.8. Of these, the bior2.8 wavelet performs the best on images used in this research. Therefore, the bior2.8 wavelet is compared with the Dual Tree Complex Wavelet (DTCW). Based on the Peak Signal-toNoise-Ratio (PSNR), the denoised image using the DTCW performs better than the bior2.8 wavelet. Overal, wavelets are a powerful tool in image processing. The different wavelets each have their own characteristics. The choice of the optimal wavelet depends on the application and cannot be generalised.","Image Processing; Wavelet Transform; Image compression; Image denoising","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering","",""

During the last three decades, offshore wind has become an economically attractive option of renewable energy source for many countries to fulfill their commitment to combat the climate crisis. However, an open challenge remains in offshore wind, namely the aerodynamic interactions between multiple turbines, referred to as wake effects. When the upstream turbines extract energy from wind, they generate the wake with low velocity and high turbulence level on the downstream turbines, which substantially reduces the overall wind farm performance. The annual power production loss due to wake effects is generally 10 - 40%, which limits the reduction of the levelized cost of electricity for offshore wind energy.<br/><br/>Therefore, developing effective wind farm control strategies which could mitigate the wake effect has become an emerging research area in the past decade. Recently, a novel wind farm control strategy called the Helix approach is proposed. The Helix approach adopts the individual pitch control technique to dynamically deform the wake into the helical shape, which induces wake instability and thereby stimulates wake recovery. This control strategy has demonstrated promising potential to mitigate the wake effect and to enhance the wind farm performance. To date, the Helix approach employs single harmonic pitch signals. However, more complex and higher-harmonic signals to potentially improve the effectiveness of the Helix approach have never been explored. Therefore, the purpose of this master thesis is to explore the potential of using multi-sine pitch profiles to further enhance the wake mixing.<br/><br/>The high-fidelity aeroelastic simulator OpenFAST with its recent free vortex wake code is adopted to simulate the dynamic wake evolution. A Fourrier stability analysis is used to quantitatively identify the wake breakdown position. According to the simulation results for the multi-sine pitch profiles, the wake breaks down at 1.75 D, which is earlier than the one at 2.50 D for the original single-sine Helix strategy. The earlier wake breakdown indicates the potential of faster wake recovery, which is required to be validated by the higher-fidelity model in the future studies.","wind farm control; wake effects; wind energy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

However, operationalizing machine learning. i.e. converting machine learning experiments into sustainable production-grade applications, remains a key challenge, which limits banks from realizing the true business value of machine learning.

The main objective of this research is to develop a socio-technical framework, that supports the understanding and implementation of the machine learning operationalization process in the banking sector. This research combines an extensive literature study and 15 expert interviews to identify nine socio-technical factors that influence the operationalization of machine learning applications. The identified factors are then validated and applied to a real-world context through a case study analysis. The findings suggest that risk management is one of the most crucial yet challenging aspects of the process. To investigate this further, the research analyzes the socio-technical challenges of risk management and proposes four strategic guidelines to address the same. This leads to the development of a conceptual model which illustrates how factors such as shared knowledge and controls reduce the challenges of risk management and thereby support the machine learning operationalization process.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

However, RCMs exhibit noticeable deviation from observation, and can show large variation in ensemble projections (biases). The objective of this study is twofold, first to assess the robustness of two high-skill bias-correction methods; empirical quantile mapping (QM), and scaled distribution mapping (SDM) in improving the hydrological modelling of the Rhine River. The second is to assess the potential impacts of climate change on low flows at Lobith based on RCP8.5 scenario. The two correction methods are applied to correct the systematic bias from five climate datasets from the Coordinated Downscaling Experiment in Europe (EURO-CORDEX) covering the Rhine domain, using high resolution gridded datasets (1 km2) spanning from 1979 to 2019.<br/>The bias-corrected simulations from the hydrological model provided more accurate discharge estimates than the wet biased simulations, with an average error of less than 100 m<sup>3</sup>/s at Lobith. The correction methods are also capable of correcting unprecedented temperature and precipitation values, making them useful in climate assessment studies in the Rhine river. However, it appears that the accuracy of the bias correction depends on the parent GCM, performance of the raw RCM and the skill of the hydrological model in estimating discharges at the point of interest. In addition to that, the drizzling effect could not be reduced using these methods. <br/>Noticeable climate change impacts at Lobith are found using the bias-corrected projections. These projections suggest that low flows are going to be more frequent and longer in the coming 38 years. Unprecedented discharges (&lt; 700 m<sup>3</sup>/s) are projected to occur at least 50 times between 2020 - 2060. This is coupled by a decrease in the long-term mean annual flow by 100 m<sup>3</sup>/s and a slight shift in the seasonality of low flows (2 weeks shift).<br/>The general hydrograph at Lobith is set to change due to climate change for the period (2020 – 2060), with relatively higher discharges from early June to end of August followed by relatively lower discharges in the last four months of the year. Water levels are projected to decline in average by 20 cm (early June to the end of August) and increase in average by 30 cm (end of August till to end of December). The study recommends the need of combining bias correction, the feedbacks in the climate system (land use changes) and climate adaptation strategies to study these effects further.<br","Climate Change; Hydrological modelling; Bias correction; Non-stationarity; Performance-based weighting","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Water Management | Hydrology","",""

(mentor); Uijlenhoet, R. (graduation committee); Velner, Roel (graduation committee); Jansen, Koen (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Flash floods are a major concern in hydrology and natural hazard science due to their high potential of causing fatalities and damages. They are caused by short, high-intensity rainfall and characterized by a flood event happening within six hours of the onset of precipitation.<br/>In July 2021 an extremely large rainfall event took place in the mid mountain area of Belgium (Ardennes), Germany (Eifel), Luxembourg and the Netherlands (South Limburg). Precipitation amounts of up to 250 mm in 48 hours were recorded in the core of the rainfall area in Belgium. In the Netherlands the Geul catchment was affected the most as the high precipitation resulted in a flash flood hitting the villages and cities along the rivers.<br/><br/>This research is aimed at understanding the hydrological response of the Geul catchment to this extreme rainfall event. To begin with, the catchment and its hydrological behaviour is studied in detail, followed by an event analysis including rainfall, discharge and groundwater data. Furthermore, the antecedent wetness conditions prior to the event are assessed. Next to the data analysis, a wflow model was set up and adjusted to reproduce the event, to evaluate the event contributions of the different tributaries, and to test the impact of different antecedent conditions, rainfall amounts and infiltration capacities on the discharge response. By adjusting three parameters in the model (soil thickness, maximum leakage and a horizontal conductivity parameter), the model was able to reproduce the floods and the different responses of the subcatchments.<br/><br/>In July 2021 the Geul catchment received on average 128 mm precipitation in 48 hours. The highest rainfall sums were recorded in the Belgian part of the catchment and around Ubachsberg. The high rainfall quantities led to high discharges in the catchment. Based on model results, the peak discharge in the central part of the catchment at Gulpen was approximately 124 m3/s. The discharge response of the catchment differed strongly between the subcatchments, especially between the tributaries and the Belgian upstream part of the catchment. The Belgian part contributed about 60% to the flow in Gulpen,<br/>although its contributing area is only 45%. The event run-off coefficient in the Belgian area was approximately 41%, while the event runoff coefficients of the tributaries Gulp and Eyserbeek were 21 and 23%, respectively. The differences in hydrologic responses within the catchment can be linked back to the geology. While the upstream part is characterized by thin soils and impermeable carboniferous rocks at the riverbed, the central and lower part of the catchment consist of a thick unsaturated chalk layer acting as major storage areas. In general, the overall run-off coefficient of 32% is fairly small for such an extreme event. The floodplains and the thick unsaturated zone at the chalk plateaus stored much water, and considerably delayed and dampened the peak. Based on the simulation approximately 75mm of water was stored in the catchment area upstream of Gulpen. 30-days prior to the event the catchment received 50% more rain than the long-term average. Assuming average July wetness conditions, according to the simulation the event peak and cumulative discharges would have been 20-35% lower, and an additional 4.8 x 106 m3 water could have been stored in the catchment upstream of Valkenburg. Consequently, the wetter-than-usual antecedent wetness conditions increased the severity of the flood from being minor (under normal conditions) to the major flooding which was experienced in the downstream catchment areas. However due to climate change, wetter summers are projected to become more frequent in the future and consequently the role of antecedent wetness will become even more important.<br/><br/>In the Geul catchment the geology is a dominant control on the runoff response of the (sub)catchments. The impact of flood mitigation measures can be maximized by taking the role of geology and its interaction with the effect of land-use changes into account in the selection process. Flood mitigation measures are especially required in the Belgian upstream part of the catchment. Retaining water already there, will attenuate and delay peak discharges at the villages and cities downstream.","Limburg Floods; Flash Floods; Geul catchment; Wflow-SBM; Hydrology","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Water Management","","50.859883334, 5.842241667"

People who are suffering from incurable cancer are no exception (Wang et al., 2018). Often patients encounter a shift from focus on diagnosis and treatment, to emphasis on psychosocial support when cancer treatment is no longer effective. When it comes to intimacy and sexuality, these topics are experienced as difficult to discuss for both patient and healthcare specialist. To improve the quality of life of patients with incurable cancer, the GPS project, which stands for Conversations About Psychosocial Needs, Intimacy and Sexuality (Gesprekken over Psychosociale behoeften, intimiteit en Seksualiteit) was founded by the Amsterdam UMC. Their goal is to help and support nurses and clinical nurse specialists (CNS) improve their knowledge and skills about signaling and discussing psycho-social needs, intimacy and sexuality with patients with incurable cancer by putting together a training program.This graduation project focuses on designing for the online learning environment the GPS project set up, to effectuate awareness among nurses and contribute to a better understanding of the patient’s needs and questions about intimacy and sexuality in this important phase of the end-of-life. The aim is to make the online learning environment the base of their training in order to develop conversation skills and be engaging, inspiring and effective. To achieve this goal, extensive research has been done on the needs of nurses and CNS. By using the method Context Mapping interviews are conducted which have led to uncovering their barriers and enablers towards discussing intimacy and sexuality with patients with incurable cancer. Supported by literature and multiple Co-creation sessions with stakeholders, this has led to a design for a preparatory exercise within the online learning environment which is called: “The sea of experiences”. In an empathetic way, the exercise encourages the participants to think about their own abilities when it comes to discussing this topic, complemented by showing different perspectives on barriers and enablers. An evaluation of the concept with the target group showed that the exercise helped them to have a better understanding of the patients’ needs, feel supported and have the right mindset by feeling inspired to go through the rest of the online learning environment. As a result of the evaluation, recommendations are formulated with regard to the form and content of the concept. After complying with the recommendations, the concept should be ready to be implemented in the online learning environment of the GPS project. To conclude, the concept is a valuable step towards improving communication about intimacy and sexuality between healthcare specialists and patients, and therefore contributes to improving the quality of life of patients with incurable cancer. <br","Intimacy; Sexuality; Conversations; Awareness; Incurable cancer; Supporting; Nurses","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","GPS Project",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","The Geul river, a tributary of the Meuse located in the south Netherlands, Belgium, and part of Germany, is vulnerable to extreme hydrological events, such as floods, droughts, and erosion. There is evidence that these conditions are exacerbated by land use and climate changes. This thesis focuses on investigating the temporal variability and trends of hydrometeorological variables, as well as the main land use changes in the Geul river catchment. Accordingly, this thesis aims to improve understanding of the impacts of climate change and human intervention on the hydrological response of the Geul. In the first part of the thesis, temporal changes in (extreme) precipitation regimes for the period 1951-2021 and potential evaporation for the period 1965-2021, are identified by calculating trends for each 30-year moving period within the available time frames. The main land use changes are evaluated using CORINE annual land cover maps for the period 1990-2018. Changes in discharge regimes are investigated using a multi-temporal approach in which trends are evaluated in every possible combination of start and end years. In the second part of the thesis, the effects of climate variability and land use changes on the variability of runoff patterns are assessed. This is achieved by correlating the rates of change between extreme precipitation and maximum discharges all over the moving periods. The work also includes the use of a water balance separation framework to estimate the attribution of alterations in mean stream flows to land use and climate changes. A statistically significant increase in very wet days is reported in the area that mainly derives from the winter period. The extreme summer precipitation<br/>shows a relatively strong increase since the 1980s. The trend analysis in the potential evaporation time series suggests a very strong and stable increase. The main land use changes dominated before the 1970s, while there do not appear to be significant changes in the catchment from 1990 to 2018. Extreme annual discharges show an increasing insignificant tendency, while mean stream flows are decreasing. Results suggest that the variability of extreme and mean flows is mainly driven by climate variability, while at the same time the effects of land use changes on runoff patterns are not visible for the period 1970-2021. This study emphasizes that climate change should be incorporated into flood designs and climate adaptation strategies should be provided.","Geul; Trends; Climate change; Land use","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Water Management","",""

Three different concepts that can vary their stiffness were generated, prototyped and evaluated against each other. Finally, a mechanism was designed that can vary its stiffness drastically by radially jamming wires together between a braided sheath and a radially rigid core that is also flexible in bending. Friction between the wires and the steerable segment generates the stiff configuration. If the braided sheath is released the wires can move along each other and the mechanism is flexible. The variable stiffness ability was tested by clamping the mechanism into a frame while applying a load to the distal tip. This resulted in a force-displacement curve that was 20 times stiffer in the stiff state than in the flexible state. The use of a braided sheath in a Variable Stiffness Mechanism (VSM) is an effective and<br/>simple way to obtain variable stiffness.

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","In this thesis, we present simulation studies of a non-parametric estimator, proposed by Liebscher (2005). This estimator uses a well-known non-parametric estimator called kernel density estimator. Non-parametric estimation is used when the parametric distribution of a given dataset is unknown. This technique is then applied with an assumption that the distribution in question has a density, so that its density can be estimated. The density that we are interested in, belongs to a class of elliptical densities which has a similar contour shape as the Gaussian distribution. One of an example of such density is the density of multivariate normal distribution. Liebscher’s estimator uses elliptical density to circumvent the ’curse of dimensionality’. The ’curse of dimensionality’ often appears in non-parametric estimation. When a high dimensional dataset is applied to a nonparametric estimator, the convergence rate of the estimator becomes slow. This is what we refer to as the ’curse of dimensionality’. Liebscher’s estimator circumvents this ’curse’ by assuming that the multi-dimensional dataset is sampled from an elliptical distribution. The estimator then transforms the dataset into one-dimensional dataset, so that we can use the univariate kernel density estimation, instead of the multivariate ones. We use Liebscher’s estimator to estimate the generator of elliptical distribution. The generator is a positive real-valued function. Liebscher’s estimator depends on two parameters: the bandwidth parameter and the tuning parameter around the boundary. In this thesis, we investigate how these two parameter influence the performance of the estimator. We start with the case when the simulated dataset is sampled from the standard multivariate normal distribution. Then, we apply the estimator on a different elliptical distribution with different generator. As it turns out, finding the parameter such that the estimator gives a minimal error is a difficult task. This is because the area where the error is small, depends on the generator. We also observe that as we increase the dimension of the simulated dataset, the computational time of the estimator increases as well. Lastly, the estimator is applied to Wisconsin breast cancer dataset. The estimator is used to study the accuracy of a Bayes’ classifier is based on estimated posterior probabilites. From the study, it appears that the role of the tuning parameter is smaller in comparison the bandwidth parameter, in changing the accuracy of the classifier.","Simulation study; Statistics; Estimation","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics","",""

A car-centred public space has become the status quo, while this appears to have far-reaching consequences for both climate and society. Herefore, the transition toward more people-centric cities is brought into full swing. Stimulating and aggregating the use of shared mobility with mobility hubs is one of the multiple strategic interventions for this purpose. Regarding the latter, significant knowledge has yet been produced and applied, however, little is known about inclusive design in existing neighbourhoods with limited free space. Moreover, existing approaches generally fail to integrate the end-user's needs from the starting phase of the designing process. This thesis develops an approach for this context by putting through a bottom-up design process for a specific testbed in Amsterdam. This case study consists of a literature review bundling existing guidelines for mobilty hubs, the integration of co-creation to tailor the design principles, a subsequent designing phase, and finally testing the designs among a sample from the population. The results showed that there were either additional conditions (e.g. vandalism prevention and late adopter guidance) or that conditions deviated from what was suggested beforehand (e.g. location choice and network density). The subsequent designs generated wide public acceptance, thus proving the method to be successful for this particular case, also emphasising the added value of such a bottom-up approach. Thus, this thesis recommends a similar tailor-made approach in future situations with a more critical note against suggested assumptions from theory. When put in broader context, having executed the process even exposed a possible flaw in the still ubiquitous approach of urban planning in existing neighbourhoods, often struggling to generate sufficient support from society. Hence, this thesis insists that a tailor-made planning approach could be applied more broadly, even for stimulating the wider sustainability transition.","Climate Change; Mobility Transition; Public Space; Neighbourhood hubs; Co-creation; Urban Planning; Urban Design; Mobility Hubs","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Metropolitan Analysis, Design and Engineering (MADE)","",""

However, in phytoplankton communities the paradox of plankton appears, amounts of plankton species can coexist that far exceed this<br/>upper limit. A resource competition model is formulated and it is shown that the paradox arises for several systems, which indicates that the bloom in biodiversity is a result of the resource competition and not of any external factors. A proof is given that the principle of competitive exclusion only holds in equilibrium solutions. Therefore, as long as a system does not intersect with an equilibrium solution the biodiversity is not restricted by the amount of limiting resource types. It is concluded that intersecting with an equilibrium solution is avoided when there are only unstable equilibrium solutions present in the system. When a plankton species allows an asymptotically stable equilibrium solution, with a region of convergence equal to the domain of the system, to appear it will be called dominant. It is proven that an asymptotically stable equilibrium solution always exists in a simplified system with less than three limiting resource types. Furthermore, an algorithm is constructed that determines all the new equilibrium solutions, and their respective stabilities, when a new plankton species is introduced to a system.<br/>By applying this algorithm it can be determined whether a species is suitable for an ecosystem, when the goal is to maintain biodiversity. The resource competition model is expanded to include light as an additional resource for all plankton species. It is observed that the coexistence of the plankton species and the total biomass is limited<br/>if there is too little light for the plankton species to consume, or if one plankton species becomes dominant due to it being significantly better at consuming light than the other species.<br/>Additionally, the physical context of a flowing river is introduced, with dispersive and advective mass transfer and finite length. It is observed that while the spatial distribution of the plankton species along the river is strongly influenced by the spatial parameters, the biodiversity of the ecosystem is still primarily determined by the original parameters from the resource competition model, as long as the dispersive mass transfer is the dominant type of mass transfer not too large in comparison to the length of the river.","","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics | Applied Physics","",""

This has endangered the ecosystem and the possibilities of water recovery. Commonly used tertiary wastewater treatment technologies have proven to, not under all conditions, be less effective in OMP removal. Hence, Advanced Oxidation Processes (AOPs) have gained attention in the recent past due to their production of reactive oxidative species (ROS) that unselectively degrade OMPs. Photocatalysis (PC), an AOP that uses solar radiation to produce ROS, has been investigated earlier, but shows low efficiency due to fast electron-hole recombination. Photoelectrocatalysis (PEC) is a modified version that additionally uses electrical energy, thereby reducing the recombination and improving the OMP removal efficiency. Bismuth vanadate (BiVO4) photocatalyst has gained importance due to its narrow band gap of 2.4 eV and hence, efficient absorption in visible light spectrum. Thus, this research focused on investigating PEC using BiVO4 electrodes for the removal of OMPs in aqueous solutions. The BiVO4 electrodes were fabricated using dip-coating from 1 to 5 layers, and electrodeposition at -0.2 V and -0.4 V, each at durations of 2, 5, 7, 10 and 15 minutes. They were then characterized using analytical techniques to investigate their structural, optical and optoelectronic properties. Subsequently, all the BiVO4 electrodes were used for the photoelectrocatalytic degradation of Acetaminophen (ACT). The electrodes fabricated by dip-coating were shown to achieve superior degradation efficiencies of ACT of over 99% in 5 hours, due to optimum surface morphology and band gap. It was seen that their varied surface structures played an important role in improving OMP degradation, and compensated for their low average quantum efficiency at 7%, as compared to that of electrodeposition at 14%. Next, the photoelectrocatalytic degradation of multiple OMPs in a solution was studied, and it was determined that although the ROS unselectively targeted all the OMPs, some were degraded quicker than others due to their chemical structure. Scavenging experiments were also carried out that affirmed the role played by ROS in the photoelectrocatalytic degradation of the OMPs. Eventually, the degradation of OMPs in secondary wastewater treatment effluent was conducted to test its usage in purification applications. Overall, PEC using BiVO4 electrodes was found to be feasible and successful in OMP degradation, and has the potential to be developed for usage in environmental remediation strategies like water treatment and recovery.","Photoelectrocatalysis; Organic micro-pollutants; Bismuth vanadate","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-01-01","","","","Applied Earth Sciences","",""

One property of a spherical dielectric particle with half of its surface covered by a layer of another dielectric or metal is that it has a non-uniform scattering pattern when exposed to light. However, the angle with which the light is shone on the particle has a large effect on the scattering pattern produced. Thus it is important that we are able to orient these Janus particles. The orientation can be controlled if we apply an electric field to the particle for example. The movement of colloidal particles with an electric field is widely studied and this field is called dielectrophoresis. For a Janus particle, the calculations for the force and torque become complicated. The movement and rotation of these particles have been studied, however, no analytic solution has been found. In this report, we derive a semi-analytic description of the force and torque due to an external electric field on a spherical Janus particle. For this, first the potential due to an external electric field is determined and then the force and torque are calculated with two methods: the dipole approximation and the Maxwell Stress Tensor method. In the dipole approximation, there is no force on the Janus particle. But, there is a torque on the particle in the dipole approximation. Due to this torque, the Janus particle will orient itself such that its cap points in the direction perpendicular to the applied field. For the torque calculated with the Maxwell Stress Tensor, we get a similar result as in the dipole approximation. On the other hand, according to the calculations with the stress tensor, there is a relatively small force on the particle.","Janus particles; Electrostatics; Colloidal particles","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics | Applied Physics","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution); Aix Marseille Université (degree granting institution)","2022","Cardiac perfusion magnetic resonance imagining (MRI) is often used for ischemic diagnostics. However, the currently most popular technique uses an intravenous contrast agent: gadoliniumchelate. As this injection can cause problems in patients with renal problems, which are more prevalent in cardiac patients, a non-contrast cardiac perfusion technique would be ideal. Arterial spin labelling (ASL) is such a non-contrast technique. However, ASL requires using separate labelling pulses, complicating timing and sequence design. Concurrent labelling and imaging would solve this, which is why in this project simultaneous multi-slice (SMS) ASL was investigated. SMS is an imaging method during which multiple slices are excited at once and after receiving their signals the images are separated. If SMS were to be applied to two slices that contain the same arteries, the upstream slice would be functioning as a labelling and imaging site at the same time, as the blood in the upstream slice inevitably gets saturated during imaging. This is a way around the aforementioned downsides of ASL. Since blood flow in the arteries is highly pulsatile, SMS-cine was used, a dynamic SMS method which is more robust to motion. To isolate the saturated blood from background tissue and to compensate for bias from magnetization transfer between boound pools, the subtraction between upstream blood saturation and downstream blood saturation was taken. The hypothesis of this report is that by continuously labelling and imaging at the same time with SMS-cine, a signal can be produced directly related to the dynamic cardiac perfusion of the arteries. The viability of the proposed technique is investigated and optimized using numerical models and phantom experiments. From the phantom experiments and model predictions, it follows that for SMSASL a large flip angle and large slice thickness are optimal. The relative flow enhancement seen in the phantom experiments, using tubes with flowing water, responded to the varying of these parameters as predicted by the simulations. Yet, the relative flow enhancement was much higher than predicted by the model. This is probably caused by the fact that the tubes and water have a different T1 than blood and tissue. The model predicts relative flow enhancements of more than 90 % caused by pulsatile flow, regardless of the dicretization grid in z used, which indicates that it would be fruitful to further explore the potential of SMS-ASL in vivo. It is recommended to use an SPGR sequence and both a large flip angle and large slice thickness for this. Unbalancing the flip angle and slice thickness could also be explored using an expanded version of the numerical model and later phantom and in vivo experiments. Finally, a large potential improvement could be made to the numerical model by applying a strict conservation of total magnetization when moving spins to simulate flow, which is currently not guaranteed by the interpolation embedded in flow simulation.","","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics | Applied Physics","",""

Using only one membrane pore in a salt buffer, an applied potential creates a measurable ion current through the pore’s constriction. If a small molecule passes through the pore, this disruption is visible as a characteristic current pattern based on the molecular structure of the molecule. Recent developments by Henry in 2021 show that single amino acid substitution in short proteins can be detected using this method. Unfortunately, due to the complexity of the reading, de novo sequencing does not yet apply to these single molecule reads. Nevertheless, detecting different variants of a protein is possible. In current work this method is being developed to detect phosphorylation sites on a peptide of biological significance. For the latter, an immunopeptide called IRS2 is chosen to be once and twice phosphorylated. This phosphorylation causes the peptide to be a cancer biomarker. If this low-cost method of post-translational modification detection is successful, it would be an improvement compared to the standard mass spectrometry sequencing approach. In this BEP research, problems faced before and after sequencing the IRS2 peptide are approached from two different perspectives. The first aim is to adapt the data acquisition software to automate the workflow. The second aim is to adapt and model the Freely Jointed Chain (FJC) Model to a heterogeneously charged peptide. Both aims are defined to be applicable to other peptides as well. For the first aim, a LabVIEW plugin was developed using insights from data processing in MATLAB. This tool detects the state of the nanopore reading, responds using voltage control in a closed feedback loop and frequently allows for calibration checks. All features were tested with training sequences from real data and show promising results. However, more testing in the lab is required to determine its accuracy compared to a human operator. For the second aim, the FJC model was analytically adapted to the IRS2 peptide inside the nanopore’s electric field. The energetically most favourable configuration was then sought with a Metropolis Algorithm. As a result, the electrostatic potential was calculated and implemented into the Metropolis Algorithm. Despite the simplification of this method, it is still expandable in a modular way to incorporate additional potential such as charge-charge interactions or springs to simulate backbone flexibility. Finally, improving this model further would eventually lead to the relative positions of all chain elements inside the pore to develop an understanding of the (phosphorylated) IRS2 readings.","immunopeptide; Protein; Nanopore sequencing; LabVIEW; MATLAB; Python; biophysics; Data Acquisition; Automation; Metropolis; Freely Jointed Chain; Statistical Physics","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Physics","Bachelor End Project",""

Metamaterials are structures typically consisting of repetitive micrometre-sized features that introduce new and extraordinary ‘material’ properties. However, up to now these structures are predominantly fabricated with slow 3D-print fabrication techniques. In this work, a range of micromechanical metamaterial designs are closely studied for their design aspects, alongside an investigation towards the high-throughput opportunities of mechanical contact-based fabrication techniques like nano imprint lithography and microtransfer moulding. What is missing from current research, is the connection between the design attributes of micromechanical metamaterials and the capabilities of high-throughput micrometre-level fabrication techniques.<br/><br/>Here I showthat micromechanical metamaterials can be broken down into geometric elements and eventually elementary material transformations that can be directly linked to fabrication techniques with high-throughput potential. These material transformations can be used to form several fabrication process flows. During this breakdown, stencil printing emerged as a compelling fabrication technique for high-throughput fabrication of thin intricate 2½D features. At this moment little is known about the prospects for stencil printing with polymeric materials because stencil printing has its origins in printed circuit board (PCB) fabrication. By performing experiments on the most influential parameters of ordinary PCB stencil printing found in literature and applying these parameters to polymer stencil printing, an understanding of the operating mechanisms is obtained. It is exhibited that by tweaking parameters such as viscosity, wettability,<br/>stencil design and substrate temperature, stencil printing with polymers like polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) can be transformed from an ill-defined mess to a successful replication of the designed laser-cut stencil.

(mentor); Peeters, D.M.J. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Laser-assisted automated fiber placement (LAFP) is a promising additive manufacturing technique for the production of large aerospace components. Thermoplastic prepreg tapes will be placed ply-by-ply on top of a mould and in-situ consolidated. This is beneficial for higher production rates. The mechanical performance of thermoplastic composite laminates is highly dependent on the consolidation quality. One of the quality indicators is the maximum allowable void content after LAFP-manufacturing, which still exceeds the 1% limit for aerospace standards. Challenges remain before LAFP can be completely industrialized with the desired throughput and still obtaining the minimum required quality. <br/><br/>During the heating phase the material is heated to a processing temperature of around 400 ±C within a very short heating time (0.2-0.8s) and no pressure application. As a result of rapid heating, interconnected mechanisms can occur which affect the final consolidation quality. These mechanisms and their relation with processing parameters need to be understood to achieve a high quality laminate manufactured by LAFP. Previous research at Delft University of Technology has shown that deconsolidation phenomena, such as decompaction of the fiber reinforcement network, waviness formation and void thermal growth occur during the heating phase. This will give rise to an increase in void content, surface roughness, out-of-plane deformation and dimensional changes. However, this research did not include tape pre-tension in the experimental setup which is the main component of a LAFP tape placement head. Also, thermoplastic prepreg tapes with a resin-rich surface have been suggested in literature to contribute to a higher consolidation quality of the final laminate. The effect on deconsolidation of thermoplastic prepreg tapes with resin-rich surface during the rapid heating phase is not known yet. <br/><br/>Therefore, the focus of this study is on the effect of a resin-rich surface and tape pre-tension on the deconsolidation response during the heating phase of LAFP. Deconsolidation was quantified through the following response variables (output): surface roughness, maximum out-of-plane deformation, void content, thickness increase and arc-length increase. The results showed that the processing parameters (heating time, heated spot length, resin-richness and tape pre-tension) affect the deconsolidation response through similar interlinked mechanisms as were observed before. However, it has been demonstrated that the mechanisms affecting the deconsolidation response are different due to the presence of a resin-rich surface and as a result of tape pre-tension. <br/><br/>Suprem resin-rich thermoplastic prepreg tapes have a great potential to be used together with the LAFP- process. It has been shown that a resin-rich surface contributes to significantly less decompaction of the fiber reinforcement network. This resulted in less surface roughness and less out-of-plane deformation after the heating phase. Because the fibers are surrounded by resin, no dry fibers are popping-out of the heated surface. The smoother and more resin-rich surface are beneficial for intimate contact development during the consolidation phase of LAFP. It is therefore expected that a higher degree of effective intimate contact can be reached with Suprem resin-rich tapes which is favourable for a higher final quality of a LAFP-manufactured laminate. <br/><br/>Laser heating experiments were performed with three levels of tape pre-tension: 5N, 10N and 15N. Increasing the level of tape pre-tension improved the contact between the tape and the surface of the tool. Since the tool worked as a heat sink in this case, it was shown that local heat absorption occurred only at locations where fiber clusters were present. Increasing the tape pre-tension level towards 10N and 15N seem to be disadvantageous for the LAFP-process. Large out-of-plane deformation was observed and the temperature data showed a highly non-uniform temperature across the simulated nip-point (for 10N and 15N) which is unfavourable for intimate contact development during the consolidation phase of the LAFP-process. It is therefore expected that the optimum pre-tension level lies around 5N. It is assumed that global out-of- plane decompaction and global surface roughness increase will remain lower if a low (5N) pre-tension force is applied. <br/><br","Laser-assisted automated fiber placement (LAFP); Thermoplastic; Prepreg; Deconsolidation; Resin-rich; Tape pre-tension; Heating phase; Carbon Fiber; PEEK","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Previous years were focused on a linear economy, consisting of the make-waste concept. The products that are made with raw materials are thrown away after its use. Unfortunately the Earth does not contain an unlimited source of materials and we need to focus on reusing materials. Concluding to create a circular economy in which waste does not exist at all. <br/><br/>The goal is to start with reusing as of today, instead of in the future. In other words, using the current existing elements. However, to do so it must be known which elements are available. Therefore, a data analysis has been done on the current existing structures as well as the future perspective. These analyses combined concluded in a common scope, visualized as a Lego box. This Lego box does not only consist of all the current existing structures (within the determined scope), but also provides a future perspective on the demolishing plans in the near future. Based on a time-consuming manual research a variety of nearly 70 viaducts have been examined. This lead to the summarization of 5 different girder categories: Box girders, inverted T-girders, Infilled girders, T-girders and remaining.<br/><br/>With the specific girders known, design applications can be created. The focus on these applications is to think outside the box and reusing a girder in a different function than the original purpose. The design applications are created with a brainstorm session. For this session multiple different broad-minded individuals had been invited for an open discussion which concluded in over 20 different design applications. Thereafter, these applications have been examined with the help of an MCDA, based on the three main criteria. This MCDA is executed with the help of multiple different experts with a background regarding one of the three main criteria. With these expert judgements the total amount of design applications have been demarcated to a top 5.

With the different impact factors determined, the possibility looks very promising. It can be stated that reusing in general will be better for the environment, as well as for your own wallet. Reusing a girder as culvert can in theory be seen as a good reuse application, but not higher in a general value than reusing again as a girder. This is based due to the fact that using the girder as a culvert will take more research in practice, especially regarding structural aspects. However, from this thesis it the first impression conclude in the fact that the impact in costs as well as environmental impacts are bigger when reusing the girder in another function","Circularity; Reusability; Concrete girders; Closing the loop; High value reusability","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Building Engineering - Structural Design","",""

Many practical distributed networks are of heterogeneous nature. Because of this, algorithms operating within these networks need to be simple, robust against network dynamics and resource efficient. Additionally, if privacy preservation methods are properly implemented, they add to the power of distributed processing by making it possible to leverage the data of many different users, without infringing the privacy of the individuals involved.<br/>In this study we focus on the primal-dual method of multipliers (PDMM), which is a promising dis- tributed optimisation algorithm that seems to be suitable for distributed optimisation in heterogeneous networks. Most theoretical work that can be found in existing literature focuses on synchronous ver- sions of PDMM. However, in heterogeneous networks, asynchronous algorithms are favourable over synchronous algorithms. So far, simulation results have indicated that asynchronous PDMM converges and can even converge in the presence of transmission losses.<br/>In this work we analyse the properties of stochastic PDMM, which is a general framework that can model variations of PDMM such as asynchronous PDMM and PDMM with transmission losses. We build upon previous empirical results of PDMM and formulate theoretical proofs to substantiate these results. After defining stochastic PDMM and proving its convergence, we compare a number of PDMM variations that have been mentioned throughout the literature. Lastly, we derive a lower bound for the variance of the auxiliary variable in the context of stochastic PDMM, assuming uniform updating probabilities. This lower bound indicates that subspace based privacy preservation is applicable to certain instances of stochastic PDMM, like asynchronous PDMM.<br/>The main result of this work is a theoretical proof that shows that stochastic PDMM converges almost surely if the updating probabilities of each auxiliary variable are nonzero. Two important conclusions that follow from this proof are the almost sure convergence of asynchronous PDMM and unicast PDMM with transmission losses. Another useful result is the fact that subspace based privacy preservation is effective when using asynchronous PDMM.","distributed optimization; convex optimization; PDMM; asynchronous algorithms; privacy; stochastic","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering","",""

The ensemble combines the results of a diverse set of components allowing it to accurately detect the different types of outliers. The components are based on the most efficient reconstruction-based method, the Random Projection (RP) method, which we enhance with a sliding window to better capture the dependencies of the time series and highlight context-dependent outliers. As a result, the RPOE method performs competitively when tested on different datasets. Moreover, the efficiency of the base detectors allows the RPOE method to have a remarkable run-time. Thus, with the RPOE method, we believe to have taken a step forward in the search for an effective outlier detection method.","Outlier detection; Time series; Random Projections; Ensemble","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science","",""

Daarom is vanuit ‘Delft Global Initiative’ de vraag gekomen of het Poissonproces een goed model kan zijn voor regenval in Afrika. <br/><br/>In dit onderzoek hebben we regendata van één weerstation gebruikt dat tijdens de moesson gegevens heeft verzameld op Mafia eiland, een eiland zo'n 20 kilometer voor de kust van Tanzania.<br/><br/>Een Poissonproces kan homogeen of inhomogeen zijn en we hebben de data op beide processen getoetst. Voor het homogene Poissonproces zijn veel verschillende toetsen te vinden in de literatuur. De Monte Carlo simulaties zijn gebaseerd is op de geïntegreerde verdelingsfunctie en gebruikt om de p-waarde te bepalen. Voor alle regen samen in de gehele observatieperiode was de p-waarde 0 en daarom kan de regen niet met een homogeen Poissonproces worden beschreven.<br/><br/>Voor de inhomogeen Poissonproces benadering hebben we ervoor gekozen om de intensiteit van de regen te benaderen met een stuksgewijs constante intensiteit. Met taut string werd de regen opgedeeld in 474 deelperiodes met een constante intensiteit die per deelperiode verschilt. Voor iedere deelperiode is getoetst of de regen met een homogeen Poissonproces kan worden beschreven. De p-waarde is voor iedere deelperiode bepaald met Monte Carlo simulaties en we werken met een significantieniveau van 5%. Voor 448 van de 474 deelperiodes kan de regen met een homogeen Poissonproces worden beschreven. <br/><br/>Een inhomogeen Poissonproces met stuksgewijs constante intensiteit lijkt daarom een redelijk bruikbaar model om de regen op Mafia eiland mee te beschrijven.

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","While bracing has been proven to be an effective treatment strategy for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis, its effectiveness is often found to be inconsistent in practice. One of the main reasons for this is that the forces applied by the brace may be subject to constant change, while its required effect is expected to change over time as well. Brace treatment becomes even more complicated when considering that both the patient and the practitioner are provided with limited to no information on how this relation may be changing over time. While measurements of the pressure distribution may be used for evaluation of the brace, most commercially available devices are too expensive or unsuitable to be integrated in a brace. This study therefore sought to investigate the possibility of designing a cost effective monitoring system based on force sensitive resistors (FSR) that can be implemented in the brace to evaluate brace performance. <br/><br/>Several metrics were defined to evaluate different functional aspects of the brace. This simultaneously served as a basis for the system requirements, which focused on finding a cost effective solution for evaluating brace performance, while no restrictions on dimensions and mass of the prototype were set at this time. The hardware of the system was based on an Arduino Mega microcontroller connected to custom designed PCBs for voltage regulation and signal conditioning, which were integrated in a purposely designed belt. The belt was connected to a sensor pad with a total of 15 integrated FSRs (FSR402 by Interlink Electronics) and was designed to fit the pad located in the lumbar area of the brace. The FSRs in the sensor pad were calibrated in the 0 - 26kPa range using a model developed for creep and hysteresis compensation. When tested with a consistent actuation system, a random error of 4% was found. The model also showed to yield a decent approximation of the hysteresis behavior of the FSRs using a parametric third order polynomial function, but further research is required for this to be validated.<br/><br/>In order to evaluate the three dimensional effect of the brace forces on the spinal column, the spatial geometry of the spine and the sensor pad had to be reconstructed. A generative design algorithm was developed for doing this using only a surface model of the torso, an AP radiograph of the spine, standard vertebra dimensions and the geometry of the sensor pad including the relative two dimensional locations of the integrated FSRs. The method yields a low resolution reconstruction of the required geometry and serves as a proof of concept for acquiring data that normally would require sophisticated equipment which may not always be available.<br/><br/>Validation showed that the system could effectively be used to measure pressure distribution inside a scoliosis brace. Differences were measured related to posture and respiratory movement, which was found to have an effect on the mean pressure and the pressure distribution in the lumbar area. Combining the measurements with the spatial geometry allowed for computation of equivalent bending moments, which seemed to be in line with the expected function of the brace.<br/><br/>Although this research showed promising results for an FSR based pressure measurement system for scoliosis braces, further research is required to optimize the different aspects of its design.","Orthosis; force sensing resistor; Monitoring; pressure; Scoliosis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | BioMechanical Design","",""

The solution uses the continued fraction of the ratio of the orbital periods of the planets, as the slopes of the lines are this ratio. The convergents of the continued fraction form basis vectors with which the point (&#x1d458;, &#x1d459;) is searched for. This is called lattice basis reduction.<br/>Results: Where brute force always takes &#x1d458; steps to find the integer point (&#x1d458;, &#x1d459;), the method with continued fractions and lattice basis reduction often finds the point in about √&#x1d458; steps.

We start by describing optical theory called Fourier optics also known as wave optics. This type of optics is found by making assumptions from the Maxwell equations for magnetic and electrical fields. This leads us to the Rayleigh-Sommerfeld diffraction integral, which we need to propagate light. To optimize an optical system, we introduce the standard optimization methods used when gradients are available and also dive into data-driven methods. Two wellknown algorithms in each category: the Adam optimization method, which is an extension of normal gradient descent methods, and the UNet convolutional neural network. To make the optimization methods work with our physics simulation, we use an automatically differentiable implementation which gives the gradients for the optimization. Combining the two optimization methods with our optics engine, we optimize optical designs such that the resulting intensity on the sample plane resembles some target intensity. We are able to optimize systems with single and multiple DOE and for high and low resolution DOE designs. We find that more lenses makes the optimization better and increases the variability in the created projection. We also find that increasing the resolution severely slows down the optimization with the Adam method. Although, the optimization method Adam is well suited for this optimization task. It becomes computationally very expensive on high resolution due to the physics simulation at every optimization step. Some physical simulations require high resolution to make sure the simulation does not contain to much artefacts. We show that the data-driven approach has potential to solve this issue. We train a network that takes as input a target intensity and outputs the lens that produces that intensity. Combining these results, we conclude that modern optimization methods are well suited for optical system optimization and we find that there is a large untapped potential for data-driven methods in optics.","Optics; Diffractive optical elements; Freeform lens; Unet; deep learning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics","",""

(graduation committee); van Gelder, P.H.A.J.M. (graduation committee); Roosenboom-Kwee, Z. (graduation committee); Haseth, C. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Digital challenger banks in the UK retail banking industry have caused unprecedented Personal Current Account (PCA) market share changes at the cost of traditional banks. This loss in competitive position prompted traditional bank managers to reconsider the way they operate, resulting in the commoditization of digital services till date. Now, the industry is faced with another potentially disruptive strategic innovation: sustainable business models. Adopting such a business model is, however, a complex decision for bank managers, as they need to ensure that the resources and capabilities of their bank align in an optimal manner to achieve competitive advantage. On the one hand, there is evidence in favor of sustainable business models as they have been associated with lower bank risk, better (financial) performance, and higher stakeholder value. In addition, consumers and policymakers increasingly expect UK retail banks to adopt a sustainable business model. On the other hand, there are also many uncertainties regarding the disruptive potential of sustainable business models - in part because there is no insight on how consumers might respond. Bank managers are thus faced with a dilemma on whether to change their business model at the cost of existing revenue for potential future profit.<br/><br/>In this study, we aimed to address these latter risks by providing insights into the mechanisms that underlie changes in the PCA market shares of UK retail banks and investigating what the future composition of the UK retail banking industry might entail when banks adopt sustainable business models. The UK retail banking industry is, however, a complex, open, uncertain, and dynamic multi-actor system in which the competitive position of banks depends on the strategic decisions of themselves and their competitors. As a consequence, there are many plausible future states of the system that can only be explored by the quantitative simulation of banks’ interactions. Previous literature advising bank managers on the adoption of sustainable business models fail to do so.<br/><br/>Due to the lack of detailed data on the consumer response to sustainable business models, however, we could not employ existing market share models that generally rely on the statistical analysis of this detailed (time-series) data. As such, we developed a novel simulation model that used the language of game theory in the context of agent-based modeling (ABM) to understand the complexity of customer market share dynamics. Specifically, the model simulated the consumer choice of bank behavior in response to the strategical decision-making of 20 banks on a variety of topics (e.g., sustainability, digital capabilities) during a seven-year time period. Consequent to being the first model of its kind that allows the study of the disruptive potential of a strategic innovation, we note that the model is unique in its ability to (i) simulate the endogenous decision-making by the banks under study in response to the evolving state of the system, (ii) simultaneously include (potentially) competitive effects (i.e., customer switching volumes) and (potentially) market-expansive effects (i.e., PCA market growth), and (iii) systematically address system uncertainties.<br/><br/>Using exploratory modeling of 12,000 alternative future scenarios, we show that PCA market shares are quite robust (i.e., between 0.5-2% decrease) to different factors such as the customer switching volume, PCA market growth, consumer choice of bank behavior, and different types of sustainable banking implementation strategies (e.g. being a leader or follower). As to the mechanisms that do underlie the marginal changes in the market shares of UK retail banks, we identify a role for improved digital capabilities of mid-tier banks resulting in an improved competitive position of these banks. In addition, smaller specialized banks in the UK may capture some market share, but this growth is limited as serving more customer segments is associated with less overall satisfaction and a consequent potential decrease in market share. This trade-off means that the organic growth of smaller banks in the UK retail banking industry is limited. We furthermore show that low PCA market growth, low consumer preference towards banks’ sustainable operations, and moderate to high consumer preference towards banks’ service quality and digital services significantly contribute to limiting the market share decrease of big 4 banks to max. 0.7%. Finally, we also show that PCA market pressure is not sufficient for all UK retail banks to adopt a sustainable business model. As such, we conclude that sustainable business models are not directly associated with PCA market share dynamics and that they have a minimal disruptive potential.<br/><br/>While numerical inaccuracy limits confidence in the simulation model outputs, the findings of this study can be used to draw general policy directions for UK regulators and bank managers.<br/>To regulators:<br/>• Focus on increasing competition through unique new entrants, as increased switching volumes currently have little effect on dynamics in customer market shares due to too little competitive differentiation between retail banks;<br/>• Introduce additional incentives for retail banks to adopt sustainable business models, as PCA market pressure alone is insufficient to introduce a sustainability transition in the UK retail banking industry within the next seven years;<br/>• Facilitate consistent data collection on a number of bank KPIs and make this data publicly available to aid future research onto the competitive positions of banks by both regulators and the private sector.<br/>To bank managers:<br/>• Do not focus on building customer market share, as one will likely capture customers that open a secondary (or even tertiary) account which is often operated with a very low margin (if not at a loss);<br/>• Redefine how the customer value proposition is designed, as sustainable business models might have non-tangible side effects such as more loyal and less price-sensitive customers;<br/>• Set up specialized PCA products to focus on an underserved small customer segment to avoid competing with the bulk of PCA providers;<br/>• Use monetary incentives to compensate for a lacking performance on sustainability, digital capabilities, or service quality, as these incentives effectively dampen the dynamics in customer market shares;<br/>• To mid-tier managers, investigate the potential to capture market share, as this study indicates that a potential upswing in mid-tier market share is possible.<br/><br/>Finally, we urge bank managers to consider the ecological consequences of sustainable business models when designing their policies. Precisely because there is no direct link between sustainable business models and customer market share, one can adopt such a business model without fearing the competitive position. The plausibility of irreversible climate change does mean that investment in measures for dealing with these circumstances, and not just greenwashing, should be taken sooner rather than later. Future work should focus on facilitating such multi-objective decision-making for bank managers by extending the model KPIs (e.g., consumer deposits, sustainability metrics) and by improving the model structure to increase numerical accuracy.<br","Retail banking industry; sustainable banking; market share dynamics; strategic disruptive innovation; game theory; agent-based modeling; exploratory modeling and analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","",""

One type of this system focuses on recommending the most appropriate physician based on previous patient feedback in the form of ratings. Such advice can be challenging to generate for new patients as their interaction with the new environment is too limited to inform meaningful recommendations. Their preferences from the previous system can be transferred to the new system to help generate recommendations in a cross-domain approach.<br/>Cross-domain recommender systems aim to bridge the gap between domains where such interactions are plentiful and domains with relatively little interactions for the new users, using transfer learning techniques. However, while privacy concerns in single-domain recommender systems have been studied extensively, the same does not apply to cross-domain systems where multiple domains collaborate. Privacy is essential in settings such as healthcare, where rating information is sensitive and prone to leaking patient medical history to third parties. Existing works lack an efficient design that provides sufficient privacy while generating recommendations.<br/>This thesis presents a privacy-preserving cross-domain recommender system with partial user overlap. We first propose a privacy-preserving matrix factorization approach with differential privacy and multiparty setting to serve as the base of our cross-domain design. Our matrix factorization design with privacy is easy to adopt by existing systems, incurring negligible overhead, and requires no modification to existing factorization implementations. Next, we show the privacy-accuracy trade-off in our base method with experiments over the MovieLens dataset. Finally, in the cross-domain setup, we demonstrate that adding privacy to the proposed scheme has a minimal predictive performance loss, essentially providing privacy for free.","Matrix Decomposition; Differential Privacy; Recommender Systems; Cross Domain; Healthcare; Privacy Preserving Machine Learning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science | Cyber Security","",""

Not only the established renewable sources like wind and solar are interesting to exploit. There is a vast amount of energy stored in the world’s oceans. To harvest this energy, one needs a Wave Energy Converter (WEC). There<br/>are already some prototype WECs tested around the world but there is no leading design that proves to be a cost-effective way to convert this energy to electricity.<br/><br/>A company from the Netherlands, Dutch Wave Power, also tries to build a cost-effective device to harvest the ocean’s energy. Their design consists of a floating tube or cylinder that converts the heave and sway motion into a pitch motion. This pitch motion drives a generator which generates electrical power. The generator is connected to the outer wall of the float and rotates as the float pitches. Inside the generator is a shaft that is kept in place by an inside pendulum. Dutch Wave Power validated their concept with experimental tests in a wave flume. The next step in the development is a numerical model. This model<br/>gives insight into the effects that influence the dynamics and power production of the WEC. Secondly, a numerical model eliminates the need for new experimental tests each time a design parameter is changed.<br/><br/>The numerical model estimates the dynamics of the WEC. The BEM software NEMOH is used to estimate the diffraction and radiation forces coefficients. A state-space approximation of the Cummins equation is used to capture the memory effect of the radiation forces. The Froude-Krylov forces are fully non-linear and are evaluated for each time step. Lastly, some friction and drag forces are included. The PTO system is described as a linear damper. The numerical model is validated with experimental tests executed by Dutch Wave Power.<br/><br/>Next, the numerical model is adapted to also estimate the hydrodynamics in irregular waves. The irregular waves used in this thesis are based on a JONSWAP spectrum. Using the parameters of the JONSWAP spectrum, a sea-state with the desired significant wave height and peak period can be generated. The<br/>Froude-Krylov and the diffraction forces are estimated based on the principle of superposition. With this irregular wave model, a power matrix is constructed for a WEC with twice the size that was used in the experimental tests. This power matrix gives an indication of the ideal operational wave conditions, where the efficiency of the WEC is the highest, and it makes it enables the possibility to compare the performance of the WEC at different sea-states.","Time domain modeling; Wave energy; Wave power; Point absorber; Non-linear Froude Krylov; NEMOH; WEC; Wave energy convertor; Surge; heave; pitch; Analytical Froude Krylov; Linear damper; Ocean energy; Experiments; nonlinear wave loads","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

Today, up to almost one billion people still lack access to safely managed drinking-water. Especially in sub-Saharan Africa this remains a major issue for many countries. With this project, Quooker wants to help people in these regions gain access to safe drinking-water and help improve the quality of life.<br/><br/>To limit the scope, and make the project more manageable, the focal point is the urban areas of Ethiopia, and in particular Addis-Ababa. In urban areas, the concern surrounding drinking water is the degrading water quality rather than access to water. Improving the water quality is an area in which Quooker can use its expertise.<br/><br/>In Addis-Ababa, people have access to water from a tap point outside their homes. On average, people can get water from these tap points once a week. To bridge the periods of intermittence in the water supply, people store the water in jerrycans at home. During this ‘Water-Journey’ the water quality degrades due to user interactions and poor sanitation. In the end, only 24% of the water consumed by people can be considered safe to drink.<br/><br/>During this project, I developed a product that helps the people in Addis-Ababa treat their water at home by building on and using the expertises of Quooker. The design process focused on providing people in Addis-Ababa with an affordable, reliable and long-lasting product. To achieve this, different water treatment methods were analysed. UV-C was chosen as the preferred method due to its long lifespan and potential to innovate. Because UV-C is a novel technology in the context, this project became a feasibility study for the implementation of UV-C as a water treatment method in Addis-Ababa.<br/><br/>The end-result is the UV-Tap (figure 1), a jerrycan cap with an integrated disinfection system. It disinfects the water with UV-C light at the same time as it dispenses it., which kills the pathogens present in the water. With the UV-Tap a household can treat up to 15.000 L of water before components need to be replaced. This equals to approximately 3.5 years of drinking water for a household of 4 people.<br","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

Especially multi-carbon (C2+) products are industrially of high value and hence a promising candidate for CO2R products. Copper is uniquely capable of producing these value-added C2+ products. Currently, the application of CO2R technology is hampered by low selectivity and rates of C2+ products. Ionomers, or ion-conducting polymers, are used in the catalyst layer to optimize the local reaction environment. In particular Nafion, a cation exchange ionomer, has proven to promote C2+ formation, but the mechanism behind it remains unclear. For this thesis, we focused on elucidating the role of the Nafion ionomer in altering product distribution on copper. A planar Cu electrode was used, onto which the Nafion was drop-casted. Atomic force microscopy was used to observe the restructuring of the ionomer during CO2R, while attenuated total reflection surface enhanced infrared spectroscopy (ATR-SEIRAS) enabled us to observe adsorbed chemical intermediate species during electrochemical CO2R. Flow cell experiments were performed to study the effect of the ionomer on product distribution and activity. The addition of Nafion significantly increased formation towards ethylene, due to stabilization of the atop-CO intermediate. The ionomer layer underwent restructuring during CO2R, where it is expected that the hydrophilic domain of the ionomer takes over the surface interactions from the hydrophobic backbone, due to electrowetting of the catalyst. With the insights gained in this thesis we elucidated the interactions between the ionomer and catalyst during electrochemical CO2R, which relates to the fundamental understanding required for designing advanced catalyst layers in the gas diffusion electrode.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

The sub-6 GHz spectrum comprises frequencies up to 6 GHz and provides large geographical coverage for radio signal in 5G. The mm-wave spectrum on the other hand, comprises higher frequencies ranging from 24 GHz -100 GHz and plays a major role in serving high data rates for the 5G technology. The evolution of 5G plays a pivotal role in the realization of challenging applications like Social XR conferences, which requires the network to deal with heavy traffic while maintaining low end-to-end latencies. The right configuration of the radio access network becomes crucial for such applications. The introduction of Massive Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) technology in the radio network, concentrates the signal energy to the target user, which significantly improves the throughput and efficiency of the system. The quality and capacity of the radio channels also depend on the downlink Channel State Information (CSI). The CSI when obtained accurately at the Base Station (BS), plays a significant role in reaping the best benets out of Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) technology. This thesis explores (or assesses) the different options and configurations of CSI feedback using an indoor Social Extended Reality (XR) conference application scenario. The performance analysis of the radio downlink while using the latest 5G New Radio (NR) Types I and II CSI which use a DFT-based codebook are detailed.

The frequency bands of 3.5 GHz (sub-6 GHz spectrum) and 26 GHz (mmWave spectrum) are chosen for the thesis and performance variations between the two bands are studied.

Even though a plethora of benefits is attributed to IM, a clear overview of how to effectively manage interfaces is non-existent. Without a general understanding on what IM entails, false expectations about its use are created. At the same time, IM developments from academic research are facing obstacles in their adoption in practice, for practitioners are often not represented in these developments.<br/><br/>The absence of situated knowledge (i.e. knowledge found and created in practice) in IM development is problematic, for a profession, or professionalism in general, builds on a body of knowledge comprised of integrated knowledge from theory and practice. For this reason, this research has attempted to take a step in the professionalisation of IM by converging the knowledge from theory and practice. That is, enriching the professional content by creating uniformity on the concept of IM and its key principles. The following research question underpinned this effort: What step can be taken in the professionalisation of IM, based on the perspectives from theory and practice?<br/><br/>For this, the theoretical perspectives on IM and its professionalisation were studied first, by means of a literature review. Then, practitioner perspectives were studied on the same topics through semi-structured interviews with twelve practitioners involved in the different domains of integral project management. These practitioners were all employed by a large Dutch engineering and consultancy firm. The gathered data was then subject to thematic analysis.<br/><br/>A comparison of the findings revealed a similar dichotomy in IM in both theory and practice: a distinction between the technical and organisational aspect. As the results showed possibilities for professionalisation from both sides, it was argued that professionalisation should ultimately happen on both fronts.<br/><br/>To create a basis for professionalism, an appropriate means to integrate the theoretical and situated knowledge needed to be found. To this end, literature on the professionalisation of related construction management disciplines was consulted. Inspired by the professionalisation of risk management, a set of key principles was deemed an appropriate medium to integrate the theoretical and situated knowledge of IM. Hence, a rough guide to IM has been created containing key principles. These principles have been validated by two IM experts in separate validation interviews. <br/><br/>Concluding, the development of a set of key principles of IM is the answer to the research question, which in itself provides a step towards professionalisation. Uniformity on the topic has now been created by the convergence of knowledge from theory and practice. The principles thereby lay a foundation for (professionalism in) conducting IM, while leaving room for customisation at the same time. Practitioners from the different roles of integrated project management are recommended to use the principles at the start of (infrastructure) construction projects to create an understanding of interfaces and IM in general. It is believed that in this way the established uniformity on paper can be translated to practice.","interface management; integrated project management; professionalisation; construction industry; principles; interfaces","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

This exploration resulted in a solution space with different possible directions. Through brainstorming, ideating, using the non-verbal cues of sympathy found during user research, and clustering these ideas, a final concept direction was chosen through a Harris profile. This evaluation resulted in the final concept direction, which was prototyped and tested further into the final design: Uppie. This final design is prototyped and evaluated through a final user test to validate the design and gather new insights. <br/><br/>Explorations of the topic showed that it is challenging for a gloomy person to talk about their mood, lacking communication channels for social support. This resulted in the final design goal and direction to let a gloomy person feel more comfortable sharing their gloomy mood with their loved ones over a distance by receiving non-verbal cues of sympathy from loved ones while sharing the need for social support in a gloomy mood. <br/><br/>Through Uppie a gloomy person can share their gloominess indirectly by asking for a hug through hugging Uppie. A loved one can respond by hugging back, which is felt through vibrations. These vibrations are dynamic and change depending on how the user holds Uppie, mimicking the loved one being close. The final evaluation showed how Uppie does comfort a person in a gloomy mood to share this mood in not having to talk to ask for support. And in hugging Uppie, the loved one shows they have their full attention available, making the gloomy person receive the sympathy and the initial social support of the loved one at a distance.

Many countries take interventions to try and minimise the spread of MRSA. Interventions, such as a search-and-destroy policy and restrictive antibiotics use, have proven to be effective. Different strains of MRSA are grouped into clonal complexes (CCs) by their similarity to a central allelic profile. Separate MRSA CCs have evolved independently over time. In most countries a limited number of CCs is responsible for the prevalence in the population. In each country different CCs are present and the exact reasons why these CCs are successful in the specific countries is unknown. The aim of this project was therefore to study two different models, one implemented in R and one implemented in Java, that both simulate the spread of multiple MRSA CCs in a population. The two individual based models (IBMs) considered in this research produce similar results when setting them side-by-side using simple model set-ups. The R model turned out to be computationally expensive and very restrictive, where on the other hand, the Java model was much faster and more extensive. Consequently, the Java model was used to simulate the spread of MRSA CCs in a more advanced setting. Although the model set-up and population parameters were not yet realistic, it demonstrated some interesting findings. The general observation was that CCs with higher antibiotic resistance contribute most of the MRSA infections. The model showed that intervention by means of a search-and-destroy policy can lower the overall prevalence in a population significantly and create more variation between the CCs present. Since the model set-ups adopted during this research most likely do not completely agree with the biological processes, populations and interventions in the real world, future research should determine whether the obtained exploratory results also hold true in more representative populations.","MRSA; mathematical model; infectious diseases; individual based modelling; clonal complexes","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science","",""

This strategy is vital, as a suboptimal drilling sequence will lead to more expenses and fewer gains.<br/>Furthermore, the wells considered in most exploration strategies are geologically<br/>dependent. Thus, a realistic model of these dependencies will be beneficial and<br/>contribute to a more reliable optimal drilling strategy.<br/>Previous research has shown that modelling similarities between the geological<br/>properties of prospect wells in the same region and updating the drilling strategy dynamically after more information is available can add much value. However, the currently developed models are not realistic enough to use in practice. Previous models separated the process into two parts, first modelling the geological success with deterministic rewards and then applying dynamic programming to obtain the sequential drilling strategy.<br/>This thesis proposes a new model with the addition of flexible uncertainty and<br/>dependency models between the geological characteristics in the hydrocarbon volume calculation of a reservoir. For this purpose, non-parametric Bayesian networks in combination with copulae are used. This model and the input format of the required data align with how data is gathered in the oil and gas industry. The dependencies are modelled based on simple expert assessments.<br/>After the new model for the geological properties of prospect wells and their dependencies is constructed, a decision policy that hinges on the observations of previously drilled wells is constructed. Previously used dynamic programming becomes infeasible with continuous variables and with a large number of wells. Therefore, the reinforcement learning algorithm Q-learning is used, which is better equipped to handle these more complex models.<br/>The analysis shows that Q-learning achieves similar results to dynamic programming. Afterwards, the new model is applied to a case based on real oil and gas industry data. The results show that this case does not lend itself to an improvement when the drilling strategy is sequentially updated as the decisions compared to the original drilling strategy did not change. This occurs because the prospects all have high positive expected rewards and should be drilled, regardless of the other wells’ outcomes and dependencies.<br/>Another case with synthetic data is explored with more favourable characteristics<br/>that, in theory, should lead to the result of the policy from the new model and Qlearning outperforming the current industry policy. However, this was not shown yet within the time constraints of this thesis, as the Q-learner should be run for a more extended period and tuned according to the case.<br/>While the model is created for dynamic sequential decision making in the application of drilling wells, this method can easily be adapted to fit any other application where decisions should be updated sequentially, and the <br/>dependencies can be modelled through a Bayesian network.<br/>In conclusion, the key contributions of this thesis are the creation of a new model for the dependencies between geological properties of a hydrocarbon reservoir and the use of the Q-learning reinforcement learning algorithm to compute the sequentially updated drilling strategy as an alternative to dynamic programming.<br","Bayesian networks; Non-parametric Bayesian networks; Reinforcement learning; Q-learning; Sequential decision making; Hydrocarbon drilling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics","",""

Employees proved that they could be productive while working remotely, and they do not want to lose the flexibility they gained (Dahik et al., 2021). In addition, many companies are struggling to bring back employees to the office, and a lot of empty office space is becoming available (Gujral et al., 2021). In consequence, a new concept of the workplace is required. However, to design a future-proof workplace, it is necessary to understand what employees will need in the future and how they will work, have a clear vision of the company, and envision futures without the present's constraints. Unfortunately, the traditional research tools used in workplace studies fall short in this task, and some companies find these types of studies time-consuming. Therefore, this thesis aims to design a time-efficient tool to trigger users and clients to think and speak about the future workplace. <br/><br/>This project starts by understanding the evolution of the workplace and its trends and condensing this information into a development map divided into five workplace dimensions (Work model, location, space, services, and technology) and organized in three timelines (past, present, and future). Then, it develops a tool using future studies and co-design methods and incorporating the investigated workplace development map to trigger clients and users to think and speak about the future workplace. Finally, the tool was prototyped, tested with users, and iterated two times. The test results were positive, proving that incorporating futures studies and co-design is a potent combination that incites future thinking and provokes conversations about the future workspace.<br/><br/>The main contribution of this thesis can be condensed into five principles offering possible new applications of the tool to other domains where triggering people to think and speak about the future is required. The five principles are: Start with a multiperspective trend analysis on the specific topic, organize the information into timelines and dimensions, include random future predictions, enable open conversations in a workshop setting, and keep the outcome strategic and tangible. Moreover, this thesis also explores the potential combination of futures studies and co-design methods, enabling further research opportunities. <br/><br/>This project was done in collaboration with Drees &amp; Sommer, a real estate consulting firm with headquarters in Germany and offices in the Netherlands.<br","Workplace study; Future workplace; Workplace visioning; Futures studies; Co-design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

(graduation committee); Zuniga, Marco (graduation committee); Gunay, Gokhan (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","In recent years, the big data era has produced an increasing volume and complexity of data that requires processing. To analyze and process these large amounts of data, applications are being scaled on large clusters using distributed data processing frameworks. A more recent trend utilizes hardware accelerators to offload computationally intensive tasks and reduce compute time and energy consumption. As a result, a rapid growth of data center deployment containing heterogeneous compute infrastructures is observed. Alternative to the more commonly used general-purpose GPUs (GPGPUS), the field programmable gate array (FPGA) is becoming an increasingly popular choice of accelerator. Its effectiveness to accelerate highly parallel applications in combination with the flexibility due to its reconfigurable nature make it well suited for a wide range of applications. As a spatial compute resource, the problem size a single FPGA can process is bounded by the available programmable logic and memory. However, applications that do not require the full resources of an FPGA can be vertically scaled by instantiating multiple instances of the hardware design on a single node. A barrier in the adoption of FPGAs is formed by the complexity of hardware design which requires in depth hardware-specific expertise. Additionally, integrating FPGAs in distributed data processing frameworks is a challenge on itself. <br/><br/>These challenges are being addressed in two directions. High level synthesis (HLS) tools and compilers are being developed to decrease the complexity of hardware design by allowing users to develop FPGA designs in high level languages. Additionally, there is an increased availability of ready-to-use FPGA designs for common applications in hardware libraries such as Vitis libraries.<br/><br/>To aid the adoption of FPGAs and improve their accessibility, this work presents OctoRay: a python framework with a focus on ease-of-use that allows users to flexibly and transparently scale applications both vertically and horizontally on FPGA clusters. Scaling a binarized convolutional neural network (CNN) with OctoRay resulted in performance improvements linear to the number of nodes, or copied instances applied. The framework was also used to analyze the cost-efficiency of a cluster of low-end PYNQ-Z1 FPGAs compared to a data center class Alveo U280 FPGA. A partly in hardware accelerated implementation of Full Waveform Inversion (FWI), a seismic imaging algorithm, was developed and used to conduct the investigation. It was concluded that 32 PYNQ-Z1s are required to match the performance of a single Alveo U280 FPGA. An important bottleneck in the performance of the PYNQ-Z1s was the low-performance host processor on which a significant portion of FWI was executed. The small number of resources available on a PYNQ-Z1 limited the attainable accuracy of FWI to a bare minimum. The FWI hardware design with the same specifications made for the high-end FPGA only utilized a fraction of its resources, far from harnessing its full potential. It was concluded that, unlike FWI, applications that do not require the abundance of resources a high-end FPGA offers, but do benefit from rapid development cycles and low energy consumption are suited for a distributed low-end FPGA composition.","Scalability; FPGA; Full Waveform Inversion","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Engineering","",""

Bidders and sellers simultaneously submit quantity-price pairs to an auctioneer, denoting the quantity they want to buy or sell at specific prices. The auctioneer aggregates the offers into demand and supply curves to compute the auction result by finding the intersection between supply and demand. In this way, commodities exchange owners in an economically efficient manner, driven by the market. In an ideal scenario, the auctioneer is a trusted third party that does not abuse the information they gain. However, in reality, offers reveal usage patterns of customers, such as electricity usage, or may be used by the auctioneer for their economic gain as insider information. The auctioneer also has opportunities to manipulate results of which there are real-life allegations in electricity trading or advertisement auctions. These concerns call for solutions that conduct the auction in a privacy-preserving and verifiable way while not compromising the auction functionality or economic efficiency.<br/><br/>Proposed solutions for privacy-preserving and verifiable double auctions offer confidentiality but do not allow participants to verify results independently or vice versa without interaction of participants in the full auction procedure. We specifically focus on electricity trading to design a solution covering the above concerns. To the best of our knowledge, we propose the first privacy-preserving and verifiable double auction scheme without interactivity of all participants, tailored to electricity trading on (inter)national exchanges.

The first study proposes and identifies a list of 22 machine learning-specific code smells collected from various sources, including papers, grey literature, GitHub commits, and Stack Overflow posts. We pinpoint each smell with a description of its context, potential issues in the long run, and proposed solutions. In addition, we link them to their respective pipeline stage and the evidence from both academic and grey literature. The second study aims to develop a tool to improve code quality and study the prevalence of machine learning-specific code smells. We extend a static analysis tool dslinter and run it on both Python notebook datasets and regular Python project datasets. Moreover, we analyse the result to check the tool's validity and investigate the code smell prevalence in machine learning applications.

Models can help understand in-event crowd management system more thoroughly, and illustrate potential effects of measures before they have to be implemented in real life. However, applications of crowd models for operational support on in-event crowd management are sparse. Two main reasons are the cause of this: (1) inherent uncertainty regarding crowd modelling; and (2) computational requirements regarding large-scale applications. This research proposed three methodological steps for model-based experimentation—exploration, selection, and evaluation—to overcome current challenges in the application of crowd models. These steps were then applied on a case study of operational in-event crowd management at the Grote Markt, in the city of Breda. The research question thereby was: “What effect do the in-event crowd management measures—traffic regulators, directional guidance, and object placement—have on the density and walking speed of pedestrians in the Grote Markt, Breda?”. To answers this question, this study: (1) constructed a detailed microscopic crowd model of the Grote Markt, utilizing open-source crowd simulation framework Vadere for rapid, yet sophisticated, development of an agent-based model; and (2) applied this model according to the proposed steps for model-based experimentation, using techniques from the field of exploratory modelling and analysis. A connector between Vadere and the Python based Exploratory Modelling and Analysis (EMA) Workbench was constructed to synergize these two steps. Main findings highlight the potential of the proposed traffic regulator measure, and its effectiveness compared to object placement and directional guidance. With the proposal of the methodological steps, this work provides the needed stepping stone for operational support on crowd management. One that utilizes crowd models to understand in-event crowd management systems, and thereby enables the comparison between different in-event measures before they have to be implemented in real life.","agent-based modelling; pedestrian; crowd management; exploratory modelling and analysis; computational decision support","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","",""

Moreover, we have also calculated a lower bound for the dimensions of themain beam needed to prevent it from breaking based on a static state. We have seen that the mangonel and trebuchet improved on the seesaw by increasing the range roughly sixfold which was expected. The maximum range of the trebuchet, however, slightly decreased compared to the mangonel. This was something we did not expect but think is due to the fact that the dimensions of the catapults were not optimised. Lastly, we found that the beam needed to be at least 18.7 cm to prevent it from breaking.

One type of this self-organized form of housing, that is currently re-emerging in European cities, is the housing cooperative, e.g. housing co-op. Members of a housing co-op jointly own the building and are together responsible for the design, construction, and management of their own building. The housing co-op is the owner of the building and the leaseholder, and the members rent their homes from their own cooperative. Examples of housing co- ops from Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and Switzerland have shown a strong record of providing affordable, high-quality, and safe housing for middle and low-income groups. The recently developed and currently developing housing co-ops in Europe have been championing environmental sustainability and prioritizing sustainability in the design and management of their building. In Amsterdam, so far, even though many groups with active citizens have started a housing co-op, few housing co-ops have completed the whole process from idea to functioning organization and realized their own building.<br/><br/>Therefore, the purpose of this research was to investigate the potential of housing co-ops to contribute to sustainability in the housing sector, as well as what (additional) measures are needed to support housing co-ops. This is especially significant today in view of the dual challenge of providing adequate housing to all citizens while addressing urgent issues of urban sustainability, contributing to Europe’s fair and inclusive transition to sustainability. To investigate this, this research studied several cases in the city of Amsterdam by conducting semi- structured interviews with housing co-op members, relevant actors of the surrounding institutional dimension, and analyzing policy documents from the Amsterdam municipality.<br/><br/>The findings of this study suggest that housing co-ops have high sustainability ambitions and a high potential to contribute to sustainability in the housing sector. Though housing co-ops are still in their experimental and pioneering stages and initiatives are having difficulty realizing their vision. There are still numerous hindrances to this development in the current housing sector, especially regarding financial and institutional aspects. Amsterdam has made significant efforts to support these initiatives and stimulate the development of the housing co-op sector, as they aim to facilitate this in their city. The results appear promising, but there is still much work to be done. Several measures could be implemented on a municipal and national level to encourage the development of housing co-ops in the Netherlands. Other policy measures, however, are proposed to further stimulate development to make this niche the new (sustainable) form of housing.","housing cooperative; housing co-ops; sustainable housing; collective housing; collaborative housing; wooncoöperatie","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Metropolitan Analysis, Design and Engineering (MADE)","",""

For practitioners there is need for governance strategies that improve the added value of combining these roles and their approaches in a complementary way. To identify how governance strategies help to obtain complementary added value from IT-architecture and agile software developer interactions this research used a multi-case study approach with exploratory and theory building focus.

This approach allowed to identify governance strategies with governance strategies that were used in practice. Multiple cases were chosen to analyse governance strategies across cases, which improved generalisability. The results include a topology of interaction models, a set of added value and problems found in the cases, related to their interaction model and a set of descriptions of governance strategies that could be used to achieve complementary added value from the interaction of software architects and agile development teams.The case studies and results provide practitioners with the opportunity to update their knowledge and change their perspective on interaction of IT-architecture and agile development roles.

Currently, beginning sewers have a learning journey full of struggles. <br/><br/>In this project, a design process is described that attempts to design an online learning platform for these beginning sewers. Through extensive user research, prototyping and exploring the field of sewing, the final concept was presented. <br/><br/>Maki is a platform that provides sew-alongs where the user learns hands-on through making garments. The user first gets to design how they want the garment to be through varying modular elements, like sleeves, or collars. After this the sew-along guides them through a process where they learn to draw the pattern and sew it together. This is done with steps in text, illustration and video, so the beginning sewer is fully supported. Since Maki users have the desire to learn how to make and design the clothing that truly fit them, the sew-along teaches them how to draw their own patterns. This is done with the help of a set of printable rulers. The rulers and sew–along will help them build a skill-set that can serve as a stepping stone in making anything they want later in their learning journey. <br/><br/>On the platform some collaboration with other users can take place. Users get the chance to inspire others with their work through sharing pictures of end-results. The sew-along also allows users to comment, so they can help each other out and a community of beginning sewers can grow.<br/><br","Maker Movement; Sewing; Learning platform","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

To get a greater understanding of the behaviour of these micelles is important. Nuclear imaging, such as SPECT and PET can provide relevant information about the behaviour of the micelles. However, to use these techniques, the micelles must be radiolabelled. In this thesis a chelator free method will be described to radiolabel micelles. The goal of this thesis is to radiolabel block copolymers with Zr-89. For this purpose series of experiments were carried out. In these experiments three different concentrations ZrCl4 are applied, C1 = 0.04mM, C2 = 0.07mM and C3 = 1mM. These experiments are conducted for two different types of polymer micelles, PCL-PEO 2800-2000 and PLA-PEO 10500-5000. With these polymers, micelles are prepared, which are used for the radiolabeling process. The fractions obtained by the SEC (size exclusion chromatography) were analysed and the data was processed. At the first concentration C1 = 0.04mM, PCL-PEO 2800-2000 had an efficiency of 37,65 ± 2,48 %. PLA-PEO 10500-5000 gave a radiolabeling efficiency of 28,27 ± 1,23 %. The second concentration, C2 = 0.07mM, showed a decrease in radiolabeling efficiency. For the PCL-PEO-2800-2000 polymeric micelles a radiolabeling efficiency of 23,30 ± 13,94 % was found and for the PLA-PEO 10500-5000 micelles an efficiency of 19,76 ± 1,70 was found. Lastly at the third concentration, C3 = 1mM, for PCL-PEO 2800-2000 the radiolabeling efficiency was found to be 0,88 ± 0,07 %. The PLA-PEO 10500-5000 micelles gave back 2,91 ± 1,68 % as radiolabeling efficiency. A stablity test was performed at C1 = 0.04mM. The PCL-PEO 2800-2000 polymeric micelles had a retention ratio of 37,57 ± 4,35 %. The PLA-PEO 10500-5000 performed better, 69,03 ± 1,27 % of the zirconium was still found to be in the micelles after being challenged by diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid, or in short, DTPA.

Current benchmarking proposals either focus on gate-level evaluation, are centered around a single performance metric, or only evaluate in-house quantum computers. This gives rise to the need for a holistic, application- oriented, and hardware-agnostic benchmarking tool that can provide fair and varied insight into quantum computer performance. This thesis continues the development of the QPack benchmark, which collects quantum computer data by running noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ)-era applications and transforms this data into an overall performance score, which is decomposed into four subscores.<br/><br/>These scores are quantitative metrics of quantum performance that allow for easy and quick comparisons between different quantum computers. The QPack benchmark is an application-oriented cross-platform benchmarking suite for quantum computers and simulators, which makes use of scalable Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm and Variational Quantum Eigensolver applications. Using a varied set of benchmark applications, an insight into how well a quantum computer or its simulator performs on a general NISQ-era application can be quantitatively made. QPack is built on top of the cross-platform library |Lib⟩ (pronounced: libket), which allows for a single expression of a quantum circuit and execution on multiple quantum computers.<br/><br/>Using the QPack benchmarking scores, a comparison is made between various quantum computer simulators, running both locally and on vendors’ remote cloud services. Tested local simulators include Qiskit Aer, Cirq, Rigetti QVM, and QuEST. For remote simulators, the IBMQ, IonQ, and Rigetti simulators have been benchmarked. The QPack benchmark is also executed on the Rigetti Aspen-M-1 and a selection of available quantum hardware from the IBMQ aviary, namely the Nairobi, Jakarta, Perth, Lagos, Quito, and Manila processors. For all quantum computers, an analysis is made of their individual performance in the QPack benchmark, as well as an evaluation of how these simulators or hardware implementations compare to each other. Based on the results of the QPack benchmark, the local QuEST simulator, the remote IBMQ QASM simulator and the IBMQ Nairobi and Quito quantum computers achieve best performance compared to the other tested backends.<br/><br/>This work shows that the QPack benchmark is capable of providing holistic quantum computer performance for quantum computers, be it physical implementation or their simulator counterparts.

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution); Universiteit Leiden (degree granting institution)","2022","Many higher-income countries export plastic waste to lower and middle-income countries where treatment facilities are often less advanced, which therefore comes with greater environmental consequences. China was the largest importer of plastic waste until it issued the Prohibition of Foreign Garbage Imports (referred to as ""the China import ban"") in 2017, which drastically changed global plastic waste trade. This study uses country-level data on waste management, and trade statistics combined with high resolution sub-national population density maps to assess the effect of the China import ban on plastic waste leakage into the aquatic environment. The results are presented on a 30-arc grid (approximately one km$^2$) resolution. Global mismanaged plastic waste (MPW) generation is estimated to increase from approximately 62 Mt (million ton) in 2016 to 64.7 Mt in 2019. Around 64\% is emitted into the aquatic environment, which is estimated to increase from approximately 39.5 Mt in 2016 to 41 Mt in 2019. MPW emission into the aquatic environment from imports accounted for approximately 1.9\% of global emission in 2016 and decreased to 1.4\% in 2019, which is the result of a 43\% reduction in global traded plastic waste. Despite the substantial decrease in Chinese aquatic MPW emission from imports, other lower or middle-income countries with higher rates of mismanagement and a higher probability of emission experienced strong increases.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Industrial Ecology","",""

Because of this, there are many novel methods to treat it being currently researched. One of the answers from the nuclear medicine perspective is Radionuclide Therapy, where alpha or beta emitters are applied, with the goal to selectively irradiate tumours in the body. A promising radionuclide researched for Radionuclide Therapy is Holmium-166, which is a beta emitter with a short half-life of 26.8 hours, which is useful for the treatment of large metastases. A method to ensure an effective treatment with Holmium-166 is the use of a Dysprosium-166/Holmium-166 in vivo generator, as the dose delivered to patients per administered dose is two times higher with the in vivo generator rather than the direct use of Holmium-166. However, carriers used in Radionuclide Therapy, which usually involve the formation of a chelator-metal complex are not effective for the in vivo generator due to the release of auger electrons during the decay process leading to the destruction of the chelator-metal complex. A promising non-chelator method designed by Liu et al. at the Applied Radiation and Isotopes research team at TU Delft involves the radiolabelling of micelles. This thesis sought to evaluate the use of micelles, radiolabelled with this mechanism as an effective carrier for the Dysprosium-166/Holmium-166 in vivo generator. For this, micelles made of Polycaprolactone-block-Polyethylene Oxide and Polylactic Acidblock-Polyethylene oxide were evaluated based on the obtained radiolabelling efficiency and their stability when challenged with diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA). The results in this study show that the radiolabelling method used to encapsulate Dysprosium relies on the diffusion of Dysprosium hydroxides into the micelle core, followed by precipitation as the right concentration is reached inside the micelles. The best results obtained by this study occur when radiolabelling Polylactic Acid-block-Polyethylene Oxide (PLA-PEO) micelles, and then adding phosphate ions at a concentration of 3 × 10−8&#x1d440;, 30 minutes after the addition of the active Dysprosium.

Numerous initiatives are being taken globally to achieve a carbon-neutral energy system. These goals require a complete shift from non-renewable energy sources to renewable sources like geothermal energy. These renewable sources of energy have to be constantly improved in order to maximise their efficiency and to ensure the cleanest possible source of energy. One of the challenges in geothermal energy is degassing of geothermal fluids. These fluids contain a lot of minerals and chemicals dissolved in them that are at equilibrium at a certain pressure and temperature. When there is change in this pressure and temperature during extraction, the equilibrium condition changes and the gases dissolved in the fluids degas. These gases then get trapped in pores and decrease the efficiency of extraction of these fluids. They might also prove harmful to the environment due to release of greenhouse gases from the geothermal fluids. The aim of this experimental research project is to visualise the degassing of geothermal fluids and understand the conditions and affect of degassing on the core.<br/>The experiments were carried out by injecting either tap water or brine at a set flow rate of 15ml/min and different concentrations of &#x1d436;&#x1d442;2.

One of these is the geovectoring protocol, which aims to reduce traffic complexity by setting limits on the allowed ground speed, course, and vertical speed. A geovector can be used to increase the capacity of an airspace by lowering the conflict rate. However, problems with priorities emerge when performing conflict resolution maneuvers in geovector airspace, as the limits are ignored in this process. A powerful conflict resolution algorithm is the Modified Voltage Potential (MVP). This research proposes an extension to the MVP ruleset, based on Velocity Obstacle theory. Making use of an alternative conflict resolution maneuver which respects the geovector, five resolution strategies are defined with different priority settings for the separate limits. The performance of these strategies is compared to pure MVP on geovector, safety, and stability measures, making use of fast-time simulations in a corridor airspace. All resolution strategies show improvements on the ability to perform conflict resolution maneuvers within the geovector limits, albeit at the expense of safety and stability. It is recommended to further investigate the performance of the geovector resolution strategies for other types of airspace, to verify whether the observed reduction in conflict rate from the geovectors can be reinforced by the resolution strategies.","UAVs; drones; U-Space; geovectoring; Conflict Detection and Resolution (CD&R); Detect and Avoid","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

The energy transition has multiple challenges, one of them being that it risks increasing inequality. This challenge also occurs in Amsterdam Zuidoost. In Amsterdam Zuidoost almost one out of five households lives already in energy poverty, which risks to increase due to the energy transition. The LIFE project, located in Amsterdam Zuidoost, aims to reduce energy poverty and contribute to the transition towards clean energy. LIFE is an acronym for Local Inclusive Future Energy. The aim of the project is to stimulate smart energy use which enables flexibility of the local energy system. To ensure meaningful interaction between future users and the design of the project, this research aims to develop a framework that presents the conditions for interventions that contribute to a more inclusive energy transition in Amsterdam Zuidoost. For this research, inclusivity is conceptualised as the active involvement of citizens in the energy transition. This means that an open door policy is not enough, inclusion is a reflexive process in which the competences and desires of the excluded are put at the centre. The data collection method consisted of an exploration of the literature, ethnographic research in Amsterdam Zuidoost and an analysis of transcripts of interviews with key-informants. This led to a framework consisting of nine conditions for interventions for an inclusive energy transition. The established conditions are the following agency, identification of the community, skill development, multi-objectivity, the need for safety, communication methods, practical examples, lightheartedness and youth. These conditions were found to emphasise, ensure or stimulate the inclusivity of the interventions for the energy transition. The different conditions are heavily interlinked and are able to stimulate each other. Intentional participatory observations led to the suggestion of interventions that align with the found conditions. Some suggested interventions are a pop-up park, energy desk, training on how to save energy, heat photos, smart meters and energy classes at schools. These suggested interventions meet some of the conditions of the established framework, and therefore aim to contribute to a more inclusive energy transition in Amsterdam Zuidoost. Finally it is recommended to evaluate the outcome of the different intervention and compare those for further steps. Also investigating if the framework is applicable to other neighbourhoods or other types of transition might be of value.","Inclusivity; inclusion; energy; energy transition; Intervention","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Metropolitan Analysis, Design and Engineering (MADE)","LIFE",""

One of the most impacted regions in the world by maritime transport emissions is the South Pacific Region. Studies show that if climate change is not mitigated, then the increase in temperatures could lead to droughts, changes in intensity, frequency and duration of cyclone seasons, sea rise and effects on ecosystems, food security, and economy in the region. Thus, the goal within this century is to keep the global mean temperature to 1.5°C. <br/>With this idea in mind, the regional goal of the Pacific nations was set for a decrease in carbon dioxide emissions from shipping by 40% until 2030 and complete decarbonization until 2050. A possible solution proposed by the local organizations such as USP and MCST is the implementation of Wind assisted ship propulsion (WASP) on existing and new built vessels. In that regard, a collaboration was initiated between TU Delft and the University of South Pacific to assist by developing a methodology and a practical tool that can assess the technical performance and environmental, economic, and societal impact of WASPs. For this reason, this thesis investigates the applicability of WASPs in the South Pacific Maritime Transport using a proven vessel, Sailing Vessel Kwai, as the main case study.<br/>The method employed for the overall research was an adaptation of the Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA). The LCIA encompasses the environmental impact from cradle to scrap of a certain product. The present study considered only the operational cycle of the vessel's hybrid propulsion and its impact on the triple-bottom-line items. Aspects such as the impact of manufacturing, scraping, painting or machinery waste have not been included and need further research to conclude the LCIA. The conceptualized methodology represented the theoretical foundation for the development of a practical Excel tool that assesses the technical performance of the hybrid propulsion, fuel and emissions output, norms compliance and ship finances. The novelty of the research stands in the assessment of SV Kwai from an academic perspective. Empirical methods and frameworks were used for the impact on society, ship finances and the environment. The results of the case study are promising for the future of shipping in the South Pacific region. Even though SV Kwai has the hull of a 71 years old fishing vessel and is retrofitted with sails and an oversized engine, it still accomplishes tremendous fuel reduction of around 37% per voyage. The calculations have shown that a similar trend line is encountered for the CO2 and SOx emissions. From an environmental and policy-making perspective, SV Kwai fits within the international emissions EEDI chart, CII chart mile and in the CATCH index. EEDI and CII parameters were calculated with regard to reference line formulas provided by the IMO for general cargo vessels.<br/>Overall, the present research is an indication of an early-stage WASP design performance and its impact on the local South Pacific region. Several conclusions have been drawn with regard to the future of WASP technology in the region and its applicability.<br","Wind assisted ship propulsion (WASP); Hybrid propulsion; South Pacific; Impact Assessment","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-07-06","","","","Marine Technology | Ship Design","",""

Some methods try to retain the information by explicitly including the relation between genes, however, not without caveats. In this work, we present a model to Transfer and Align Cell Types in Cross-Species (TACTiCS). First, TACTiCS uses an natural language processing model to match genes using their protein sequences. Next, TACTiCS employs a neural network to classify cell types within a species. Afterwards, TACTiCS uses transfer learning to propagate cell type labels between species. We applied TACTiCS on scRNA-seq data of the primary motor cortex and the ventral tegmental area. Our model can accurately match and align cell types on these datasets. Moreover, at a high resolution, our model outperforms two state-of-the-art methods, SAMap and CAME.

Understanding which cells respond to a particular perturbation and how these responses vary across populations can be used to, for example, improve vaccine immunogenicity. However, an exhaustive exploration of single-cell perturbation responses in every population is usually experimentally unfeasible. Several machine learning models have been developed to predict perturbation responses, but they are limited to single-modality data. Single-modality data alone, such as only transcriptomics, is not suited to capture all cell responses accurately. For example, the identification of immune responses requires transcriptomic and proteomic measurements. Here, we introduce cellPMVI, a method built to predict perturbation responses from multi-modality data. cellPMVI combines the single-cell data modeling from scVI with a mixture-of-experts posterior integration to allow for multi-modality input data. In this work, we validate cellPMVI for immune response prediction of adjuvants across populations. The model is trained on two-modality CITE-seq data containing gene and protein measurements from three different populations. We show that cellPMVI can model both modalities of the CITE-seq data without information loss in either modality and predict immune responses with a high correlation to the observed responses across different populations. Hence, cellPMVI is the first model to capture and predict immune response for multi-modality data with the potential to be applied for other perturbations, such as drugs.","Bioinformatics; Variational Autoencoder; single-cell RNA sequencing; Perturbation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-06-30","","","","Computer Science | Bioinformatics","Artificial Intelligence Technology",""

To increase the time to take early measures against such disasters it is of great importance to have access to accurate prediction of the rainfall. For the prediction of floods, Quantitative Precipitation Forecasts (QPFs) are used as input for hydrologic models. Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models are commonly used to generate QPFs, but for short lead times (less than 6 hours) the NWP forecasts are not accurate enough. For very short-term forecasting the nowcasting method is used. Nowcasting rainfall is a computational process of extrapolating the most recent rainfall observations and has great potential for lead times up to 6 hours. A source for opportunistic sensing to generate rainfall estimations is Commercial Microwave Links (CMLs). Signals for telecommunication purposes will travel along a CML (link) path from one station to another. When a rainfall event occurs, the signal attenuates. This attenuation can be used for the estimation of path-averaged rainfall intensity estimations. This thesis investigates the possibilities of using CMLs for estimating and nowcasting the rainfall. The study area is Sri Lanka, a country without access to radar-based rainfall estimation. A 3.5-month CMLs data set with 2560 unique links from Dialog Sri Lanka is used and compared to 8 hourly and 12 daily rain gauge stations. The studied period is from September 12 to December 31 in 2019. To generate rainfall estimations from the CMLs, the algorithm RAINLINK is used. RAINLINK includes a set of default parameters, which was optimized for the Netherlands. For Sri Lanka, two new optimal parameters are derived. For the optimal parameters daily CML estimations are calibrated with the 12 daily rain gauges. With the new optimal parameters, the rainfall estimations are calculated and used in Pysteps, to generate nowcasts for 20 rainfall events in the studied period. Deterministic and probabilistic nowcasts are generated. These nowcasts are compared with a benchmark nowcast, called Eulerian Persistance (EP). RAINLINK gives more accurate rainfall estimations in Sri Lanka with the new parameters of the wet antenna attenuation and the coefficient compared to the default parameters. Longer path lengths tend to have lower wet antenna attenuation and a higher value for the coefficient. Nowcasts were made for the 20 selected rainfall events. The accuracy was calculated with two verification methods: the Fraction Skill Score and the Critical Success Index. From these results, the deterministic nowcasts with S-PROG and benchmark EP are accurate for lead times up to an hour. The deterministic nowcasts give the most accurate results, compared to the EP and the probabilistic nowcasts. The probabilistic nowcasts show the least accurate results, and are with a lead time of one hour only accurate for low rainfall intensities (1 mm/hr). Overall, the nowcasting results are showing that with CML rainfall estimations, Pysteps can make accurate nowcasts in Sri Lanka. To improve the nowcasts even more, a combination of rainfall estimations from CMLs, rain gauges, and satellite data could be considered.","nowcast; commercial microwave links; rainfall; Sri Lanka; Pysteps","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Water Management","",""

As a result, wind power is one of the most important renewable energy sources. As land-based turbines have reached their maximum potential, recent market trends are moving into deeper waters with higher capacity turbines. The design of a ﬂoating offshore wind turbine (FOWT) foundation poses technical challenges. Mooring design, installation operations and the fact that it is a new engineering field, to name a few. Moreover, as mooring design for FOWT is still at an early stage of development, cost-effective installation remains one of the critical issues. After the FOWT is towed to the site, the mooring lines are hooked up, and one line is usually shortened. This can be performed in three ways: By seabed tensioning, inline tensioning or tensioning at the fairlead. In this investigation, details about mooring installation processes are collected from interviews, academic papers, manuals and videos to investigate differences between mooring system installations and ultimately figure out how pre-tensioning of these systems can be carried out most effectively. This work presents a comparison between these three existing methods for the final phase of mooring installation. To perform a quantitative study, the Umaine VolturnUS-S 15MW floater is considered. Current modelling techniques are expanded to allow for the static simulation of the rotations or sliding at the tensioning device. The model framework is used to find the static equilibrium and tensions at different phases in the installation operations. Additionally, an alternative mooring configuration is proposed with synthetic inserts to verify whether the tension is dependent on the mooring configuration. Finally, the dynamics between the anchor handling vessel(AHV), the FOWT and the mooring chains are modelled as a linear mass-spring system. Vessel responses and work wire tensions are compared against each other for identical environmental conditions and equipment specifications. Based on simulation results, it is found that the seabed tensioner causes little dynamic relation between the AHV and the floater and was not further investigated. Inline tensioning showed to be the method that requires the lowest tensions in the AHV work wire. Fairlead tensioning was found to be discouraged since the high required bollard pull forces. This issue is mitigated by a proposed new concept of fairlead tensioning. When the chain is hauled in from above the fairlead by a vessel crane or A-frame, it is possible to tension effectively without fuel-intense bollard pull.","Offshore; Pre-tensioning; Floating Wind Turbines; mooring","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-06-06","","","","European Wind Energy Masters (EWEM)","EWEM",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","This thesis considers the problem of nonlinear output regulation in a Koopman operator framework. The goal of output regulation is to asymptotically track a reference and/or simultaneously reject a disturbance signal, both generated by some external autonomous system called the exosystem. The nonlinear output regulation problem is solvable if and only if a set of partial differential equations (PDE) are satisfied. From the solution, a feedback law can be obtained that achieves output regulation. However, solving the PDE is difficult. In this thesis, we instead aim to construct a feedback law by utilizing the Koopman operator instead.<br/>The Koopman operator associated with a state-space model of a (nonlinear) dynamical system describes the evolution of functions of the states, called observable functions, by propagating the state forward in time according to the flow of the system, and evaluating this at each possible observable function. The space of observables is an infinite-dimensional vector field. Therefore, the Koopman operator is infinite-dimensional and linear. The Koopman operator of an autonomous system associated with a nonlinear control system provides a bilinear description of the control system instead. The use of the Koopman operator to tackle the output regulation problem has not been done before in the literature. We identify conditions under which the Koopman operator can be used to rephrase the nonlinear output regulation problem as a bilinear output regulation problem. We then show when the bilinear output regulation problem is solved using linear dynamic error feedback. In particular, a Lyapunov-based approach is used to characterize a set of initial conditions for which the output is regulated. Finally, to verify the results, a numerical example is presented.","Koopman Operator; Nonlinear dynamics; control theory","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-06-30","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

This thesis is an overview of what has been done before, and what the potential is of modern marine nuclear power applications considering the long-term goals of harmful emission reduction in the maritime industry.<br/>The concept of nuclear power is discussed, followed by the current state of nuclear power in both the shore-based, naval and the mostly historic marine application. The regulations for the marine application are noted to be outdated and require significant work for a successful application. Finally, the societal aspect of nuclear power is highlighted, as societal acceptance is not self-evident for nuclear power applications.<br/>Different developments in the field of nuclear power are addressed, with specific interest in the SMR (Small Modular Reactor), concepts that are part of the “generation IV” family, and concepts that can operate using thorium as fuel. Multiple options are considered, from the well-established PWR (Pressurized Water Reactor) to the gen IV concepts: the HTR/VHTR (high/very high temperature reactor), fast reactors in both gas-cooled, liquid-metal and sodium cooled varieties (GFR, LFR, SFR) and finally the MSR (Molten Salt Reactor). Of these the HTR/VHTR and MSR in small modular reactor form are considered the most attractive option for the marine application, due to their passive safety, high burnup, high operating temperatures, and possibilities for thorium use in the future. <br/>Criteria are established that are of importance to a marine propulsion and power generation system, establishing a framework for an implementation. Focusing on topics as: efficiency, transient loading capabilities, environmental impact, economic viability, size, and weight.<br/>For power conversion (linking the heat generation to power/electricity for the vessel) the open-cycle Brayton turbine with a heat exchanger is selected as most suitable, despite the steam turbine being more developed and projecting a possible higher efficiency. The choice for the open-cycle Brayton turbine stems from the system size and weight reduction, along with a relatively easily implementable heat rejection system for enhanced load following capabilities. The selected heat exchanger is of the helical coil type, as this is significantly more developed and proven than the PCHE.<br/>The most suitable layout is determined to be an all-electric layout, as this will greatly improve reliability (enhancing safety by redundant arrangements) and make the implementation easier applicable to a host of vessels. The electric layout allows for the combination of additional system such as batteries and emergency power. This layout is then combined with the open Brayton turbine and its heat rejection capabilities to ensure a system that is both compact as well as highly capable in performance.<br/>Finally, four suitable concept vessels were established that allowed for a like-for-like replacement with a nuclear propulsion and power generation system. This allowed for a comparison to the conventional fuel-based systems where it is shown that the implementation of nuclear power can provide very large CO2eq reductions (over 98%), while reducing size and weight if vessels of suitable size are selected. The trade-off to this reduction is the production of nuclear waste, alongside the increased upfront cost due to the high capital investment associated with nuclear power. <br","Nuclear power; marine; small modular reactors; Thorium; Generation IV","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Marine Technology | Marine Engineering","",""

(mentor); Faber, J.S. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Space Mission Sanitas is a game-based health intervention to help cardiac patients maintain their physical activity level after cardiac rehabilitation. Often people find it hard to maintain their physical activity level after cardiac rehabilitation. They face different barriers that lower their motivation, resulting in an unhealthy lifestyle with low physical activity.<br/><br/>This project is done in collaboration with the Capri Hartrevalidatie centre. The target group for this project are the participants that are rehabilitating here. The people that come to the rehabilitation training are often open to a lifestyle change but need guidance on how to achieve this. A part of the participants are people with a low socio-economy position(SEP), for them, it is even harder to maintain their physical activity after rehabilitation. <br/>To integrate physical activity into the daily life of cardiac patients, a game-based health intervention is designed and tested in this project. All participants in cardiac rehabilitation can take part in this game, including participants with a low Socioeconomic position(SEP). When designing the game, the barriers of people with a low SEP were considered. The game is a tool to motivate physical behaviour in the gamified world so that the experienced physical activity for the game will motivate people to perform this behaviour in the real world. <br/>To design this game-based health intervention, a user-based literature study and a context field study were conducted. A deeper understanding of the participants’ drivers and barriers view on physical activity and needs and motivation during and after rehabilitation were gained. By combining the insights, a behaviour analysis and a user persona could be made of the target group. A design brief, including a design goal, vision and design opportunities were set up. The design goal of this project is to develop a persuasive game that supports the maintenance of physical activity in cardiac patients’ daily life by stimulating their sense of competence, relatedness, and autonomy. From the behaviour analysis, the three elements: competence, relatedness and autonomy resulted in important factors of motivation for physical activity. In the ideation and conceptualization phase of this project, the game-based health intervention got its shape. Co-creation sessions, interviews and expert validations were conducted to find the best concept direction. This led to the final design: Space Mission Sanitas.<br/><br/>Space Mission Sanitas is a game where six teams are challenged during the cardiac rehabilitation period to achieve their weekly fuel goal. This fuel goal needs to be reached to provide their space shuttle with enough fuel to complete the overall mission. The fuel goal can be seen as a metaphor for a weekly physical activity goal since the goals are related to physical exercise they can practice in their daily life context. Every week during the training, they will evaluate which team has achieved their fuel goal and every week they will draw and select a new fuel card for the coming week. <br/><br/>Finally, an evaluation cycle of one week, showed that the game had a positive effect on people their sense of competence, relatedness, and autonomy. This suggests that the game has a promising effect on the maintenance of physical activity after rehabilitation. In future research, the game will be tested over a period of six weeks to measure the actual effect on people’s physical activity maintenance. The variety of insights gathered in this project can be used in future CR research and CR health interventions.","Motivation; Gamification; Cardiac Rehabilitation; Physical activity; Persuasive Game Design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

This research looks into how to increase the sensitivity of a methylation-based cell type deconvolution method. We do this by adapting an existing method, CelFiE, which uses the methylation values of individual CpG sites to estimate cell type proportions. Our new method, named CelFEER, instead differentiates cell types by the average methylation values of individual reads. We additionally improved the originally reported performance of CelFiE by using a new approach for finding marker regions in the genome that are differentially methylated between cell types. This approach compares the methylation values over 500 bp regions instead of at single CpG sites and solely takes hypomethylated regions into account. We show that CelFEER estimates cell type proportions with a higher correlation than CelFiE on simulated mixtures of cfDNA. Moreover, we found that it can find a significant difference between skeletal muscle cfDNA in ALS patients (n=4) and a control group (n=4).","cfDNA; Bioinformatics; Cell type deconvolution","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Color centers in diamond offer exciting opportunities for implementing an effective solid-state spinphoton interface. Access to and control of spin-photon interaction can help realize a scalable, modular quantum computer using the color center spins. A large magnetic field is needed for splitting the color center spin states, enabling definition of the qubits. In addition to the large, global magnetic field (∼1T), applying a small and tunable magnetic field (order of mT) in the vicinity of individual color centers is advantageous as it allows for external field inhomogeneity compensation and multiplexing of the qubit driving frequency. Local tuning of the magnetic field magnitude might be achieved by driving DC currents through microscopic coils located in close proximity of the respective color centers. Since the systems must be located at cryogenic temperatures, cooling power is limited. Superconducting coils are therefore considered for local tuning instead of conventional metal. Design requirements for the local tuning coils depend strongly on design choices of the external magnet, externally applied field magnitude, number of FDM channels and coil distance from the color center. In order to find a design process that easily accounts for changes in these choices, the utilization of FEM physics simulations is studied. Two simulation methods are considered and tested in COMSOL Multiphysics. The first method is called &#x1d43b;-&#x1d719;-formulation, which is considered for optimizing the coil geometry. This method is based on a classical description of superconductivity and is shown here to have potential for simulating large coil structures. The second method allows for 3D simulation of superconductors based on the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau (TDGL) equations. This method is considered with the goal of predicting changes in critical current density due to differences in cross-section dimensions. It is shown that this method can qualitatively reproduce transport characteristics of microscopic wires when no magnetic field is applied. When a magnetic field is applied, the observed vortex dynamics and resistivity correspond to that of material with no impurities or defects. Adding impurities in the form of geometrical deformations is shown here to be possible. However, further development on the method is required in order to overcome computational limitations and to determine unknown factors such as the impurity density and pinning forces. Until such time, the design procedure recommended in this thesis is based on &#x1d43b;-&#x1d719;-formulation simulations in combination with measurements of straight transport lines for critical current density characterization. Fabrication of NbTiN films is successfully tested by patterning coil-shaped structures, followed by DC magnetron sputtering and liftoff. The coil structures will be used to measure deviations from the expected critical current density due to geometry and to validate the recommended design procedure. Straight lines NbTiN geometries are fabricated with the purpose of finding the critical current density as a function of cross-section dimensions and magnetic field. These samples will be used to select the cross-section dimensions that deliver optimal critical current density, which will consequently be used in simulation to optimize the geometry.","superconductivity; FEM simulation; color center; NbTiN; COMSOL","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2027-07-06","","","","Computer Engineering","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","The online supermarket Picnic uses the volume of groceries to pack them into totes and bags. While this generally works well, there are cases in which an article's volume fits into a designated space, but its dimensions do not. To prevent this so-called overflow, Picnic uses a maximum fill rate of 85%, which means that no tote can be filled to more than 85% of its volume. Unfortunately, the use of a maximum fill rate does not guarantee that no overflow occurs at all and workers are sometimes still instructed to perform infeasible packings. To solve this, this thesis proposes a Three-dimensional Bin Packing algorithm (3D-BAGS) which uses the width, height and length of an article to determine whether it can be placed inside a bag. A Biased Random-Key Genetic Algorithm is used to converge to a good packing solution. After which, the same algorithm divides the bags into so-called totes, which are shipped to the customer. 3D-BAGS expands upon the state-of-the-art Three-dimensional Bin Packing algorithms by including bag stretching plus the diagonal rotation and squeezing of articles. Computation time of the current state-of-the-art is reduced by including memoization, priority based multithreading and a different stopping criterion. This thesis shows that the use of 3D-BAGS leads to more accurate packings, while simultaneously lowering the amount of totes needed to ship ambient and chilled groceries. However, 3D-BAGS needs more totes to ship frozen products compared to Picnic's current approach and is also more computationally expensive.","3D bin packing; Picnic; genetic algorithm","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science","",""

By using matrix decomposition to split the gathered data into a low-rank atmosphere matrix and a sparse matrix with the signal and photon noise, the algorithm avoids the subtraction of two noisy signals, and therefore the factor of √2 additional noise that comes with it. The algorithm was specifically developed for DESHIMA 2.0 (DEep Spectroscopic HIgh-redshift MApper), a wideband spectrometer that achieves a bandwidth from 220 to 440 GHz, using 347 spectral channels. Previous performance tests of the algorithm included the comparison of the weighted root mean square error between SPLITTER and the usual technique of Direct Subtraction on realistic data simulated using the TiEMPO (Time-dependent End-to-end Model for Post-process Optimization) software package. This resulted in a ~1.7 improvement factor for the whole spectrum and ~1.3 in the emission line area.<br/><br/>The performance of SPLITTER on two key components of the spectrum have been analyzed separately. First, the measurement of the continuum has been analyzed by using TiEMPO to create realistic simulations of the observation of custom spectra with a linear continuum. SPLITTER showed to be more precise as the noise level was lower, but less accurate, as there was a systematic offset in the estimated continuum. Using a modified black body model for the continuum and assuming the relative offset is independent of the strength of the continuum, the observed offsets and errors were propagated to offsets in estimations of dust temperature $T_{dust}$ and spectral emissivity of the dust $\beta$. Because of the offset, SPLITTER also showed a systematic offset in estimated $T_{dust}$, but as the algorithm is more precise, it performed better at estimating $\beta$, since $\beta$ determines the shape of the spectrum and has less influence on the strength. Second, to test the detection of emission lines, custom spectra have been created containing the same linear continuum and single spectral line at four different frequencies. Each line was set to have a known signal to noise ratio compared to the photon noise in its frequency bin. The retrieved signal to noise ratio as compared to noise of neighboring bins showed an improvement of ~1.9 for SPLITTER compared to Direct Subtraction for bright lines. Weak lines did not show any improvement in SNR. There seemed to be no correlation between continuum overestimation and emission line measurements.<br/><br/>Conclusion is that SPLITTER definitely shows improvement in noise reduction, but comes with an overestimation of the continuum. The consequences of this are that Direct Subtraction is still preferred for estimating dust temperature, but for estimations of spectral emissivity and detection of emission lines, SPLITTER is more robust.","DESHIMA; SPLITTER; astronomy; terahertz; dusty galaxies; denoising; spectrometer; Submillimeter-wave; submillimeter galaxies; high redshift","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Physics","",""

They are most commonly made out of Nickel-Aluminum-Bronze alloys. This is due to their superior characteristics over other metals in terms of strength and corrosion resistance. Metal propellers are assumed to be rigid and undeformable. Current research opts to construct propellers out of more flexible materials such as composites. The potential of this material lies in the theory that this results in propellers which could unload themselves in the wake peak, which should lead to significant improvements in the cavitation- and noise behaviour of the propeller.<br/>Since the material is much less stiff, the deformation can no longer be neglected and must be computed simultaneously with the hydrodynamic solution. This is done in a branch of fluid dynamics known as Fluid-Structure Interaction (FSI). Maritime Research Institute Netherlands (MARIN) is involved in the development of a program known as the ComPropApp.<br/><br/>The first goal of this thesis is to validate the unsteady FSI module of the ComPropApp which uses a coupled BEM-FEM code to calculate the hydrodynamic and structural performance of marine propellers in non-uniform inflow conditions. The numerical simulations are validated by comparison with conducted experiments at MARIN. It shows that the average deformation of the experiment and simulation are in good agreement but the ComPropApp overestimates the wake peak deformation. This is most likely the effect of divergence issues which do not allow for sufficiently small step sizes. This step size also does not allow for analysis of vibrations happening within a revolution as much more points should be considered. The most important recommendation, therefore, is to improve the numerical stability of the application.<br/><br/>The second goal is the exploration of the design space of flexible propellers. By altering propeller geometry parameters it is investigated which parameters have the potential to design adequate flexible propellers in the future. To quickly assess the cavitation risk of the propellers, the amount of negative pressure coefficients on the blade is used to quantify the cavitation risk in the initial propeller design stage. Through this method, it is shown that suction side cavitation risk is decreased easily by altering pitch, skew, chord length and camber. Pressure side cavitation risk is however much harder to relieve, mostly because of the deformation of flexible propellers. Yet, cavitation risk can be decreased with a combination of skew and camber. It is also shown that unfavourable tip pressures (thus risk of tip vortices) can be further decreased by applying a positive tip rake.<br/>All these propellers were simulated in open water (because of the above-mentioned divergence issues in the unsteady FSI module). Thus it is no conclusion that these propellers also perform adequately in non-uniform inflow conditions. It is shown with a demonstration that two of the three most potential propellers of the open water study do indeed unload themselves and maintain better cavitation behaviour at the velocity in the wake peak compared to a metal reference propeller.<br/><br/><br/><br","Fluid-structure interaction; Composite Propellers; Propeller design; Cavitation; Maritime","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Marine Technology","",""

This therapy consists of irradiating the affected body part with an external beam of ionising radiation. A limitation of this technique is its damaging effect on healthy cells surrounding the tumour. Semiconducting nanoparticles could offer a solution to this, as these compounds can generate reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS are a group of free radicals that are known to be able to damage DNA and potentially cause necrotic or apoptotic cell death. Using these metal nanoparticles could increase the radiation damage to malignant cells during radiotherapy, without raising the risk of cell death for the surrounding tissue. Especially TiO2 nanoparticles have been increasingly studied due to their ability to produce singlet oxygen, one of the most reactive ROS, while also having low toxicity and cost. However, many aspects of the ROS-formation remain unclear, including certain ROS production pathways. This report will therefore focus on the ability of TiO2 to produce specific ROS in response to ionising radiation, which will primarily be compared to the ROS formation through the radiolysis of water. The focus lies on the detection of singlet oxygen and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2 ) after irradiation by either a Co-60 gamma or a low energy X-ray source over a range of 5 to 40 Gy. Their concentrations are detected by fluorescence spectroscopy for singlet oxygen, and by UV-VIS spectroscopy for hydrogen peroxide. The results were promising for the use of TiO2 in radiotherapy, with both MilliQ water and TiO2 being able to produce singlet oxygen in increasing amounts over the entire researched irradiation range for both radiation sources; Moreover, TiO2 could produce a significantly larger amount of this ROS than the MilliQ water samples did. The hydrogen peroxide detection experiments were first conducted with ZnO instead of TiO2 . During these, the trends observed for the H2O2 concentration were similar to the ones obtained during the singlet oxygen experiments. The main difference was that the ZnO samples produced approximately the same amount of H2O2 as the MilliQ water samples for X-ray irradiation, instead of higher values. Lastly, the hydrogen peroxide concentration in both TiO2 and ZnO samples was measured after irradiation by Co-60. ZnO exhibited an upward trend in which the H2O2 molarity increased as the applied dose got higher. The detected H2O2 levels in the TiO2 samples were, on the other hand, relatively stagnant. This observation is likely attributed to a relatively high extent of either the degradation, conversion, or adsorption of this ROS at the surface of TiO2","titanium dioxide; Nanoparticles; ionising","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Chemical Engineering","",""

When each project designs its own data format and protocols the ability to collaborate between hardware developers is diminished, which is an issue especially in the open-source community. Because the high-level meaning of a protocol is often lost in translation to low-level languages when a custom protocol needs to be designed, extra documentation is required, the interpretation of which introduces new opportunities for errors. <br/><br/>The Tydi specification (Tydi-spec) was proposed to address the above issues by codifying the composite and variable-length data structures in a type and providing a standard protocol to transfer typed data among hardware components. The Tydi intermediate representation (Tydi-IR) extends the Tydi-spec by defining typed interfaces, typed components, and connections among typed components.<br/><br/>In this paper, we propose Tydi-lang, a high-level hardware description language (HDL) for streaming designs. The language incorporates Tydi-spec to describe typed streams and provides templates to describe abstract reusable components. We also implement an open-source compiler from Tydi-lang to Tydi-IR. We leverage a Tydi-IR to VHDL compiler, and also present a simulator blueprint to identify streaming bottlenecks. We show several Tydi-lang examples to translate high-level SQL to VHDL to demonstrate that Tydi-lang can efficiently raise the level of abstraction and reduce design effort.","computer aided design; streaming data flow; compiler; HDL","en","master thesis","","","","","","https://github.com/twoentartian/tydi-lang Source code for the thesis project.","","2022-09-05","","","","Computer Science","",""

Recent studies have shown that the total radiative forcing from aviation is around three times higher than that from CO<sub>2</sub> alone. To account for the full effect of aviation, climate metrics are needed, which equate the environmental impact of various emissions and effects. However, there is currently no consensus on which climate metric should be used in aviation policy. This thesis systematically analyses existing climate metrics by: 1) comparing the responses to simple emission profiles; 2) investigating the sensitivity to changes in high-level aircraft design variables; 3) using a Monte Carlo simulation to determine inherent biases in metric calculation methods; and 4) evaluating the ability of climate metrics to estimate CO<sub>2</sub>-equivalent emissions. It is concluded that the Average Temperature Response (ATR) is the most appropriate climate metric for aviation climate policy. However, it is found that the time horizon remains a subjective choice that must be chosen carefully depending on the climate objective. The GWP*, a newly proposed climate metric, is concluded not to be suitable as a climate metric because of its high variability and secondary time horizon. Nevertheless, it is recommended to investigate the potential of using the GWP* as a Micro Climate Model to further climatic understanding.","Climate Metric; Aviation Emissions","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","This thesis presents the development of guidance cards for consumers engaged in “3D Printing for Repair” (3DPfR). When being engaged in 3DPfR, consumers face multiple challenges, for example printing parts that can resist high temperatures, or making parts with fine details. The goal of this project was to develop guidelines which allow repairers to overcome these challenges themselves, this way allowing them to repair a broader scope of products and to increase their chance of success. This thesis consists of three parts, each presenting a distinctive phase of the project. <br/><br/>During the first phase of the project, literature research was performed to study the concept of repair, the discipline of 3DPfR, the related disciplines of “Design for Repair” (DfR) and “Design for Additive Manufacturing” (DfAM), and 3D printing categories and technologies. Several usable frameworks for both 3DPfR and DfAM were identified. Despite the similar name, it was found that the knowledge on DfR is of limited use to 3DPfR as defined in this project. Additionally, it was found that there is a strong focus on desktop Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) in 3DPfR, while it was also demonstrated that several other printing technologies are available to the user as well, mostly through 3D printing service providers. Lastly, user interviews were hosted, from which it appeared that the interviewees were unaware of many of the insights acquired in the other chapters of this part, affirming the need for supporting tools. <br/><br/>The second phase focused on acquiring new insight in the challenges encountered during 3DPfR. The acquired knowledge from Part 1 was applied in a case study. In this study, a Dyson V11 vacuum cleaner was disassembled and mapped. A variety of parts with different challenges for 3DPfR was selected, after which the parts were redesigned and printed in metals and plastics. Through this study, it was found that the current set of criteria to determine the eligibility of a part for 3DPfR was not complete. Also, ways of (partially) resolving the challenges in 3DPfR were acquired, as well as a more profound understanding of the difficulty imposed by the challenges. <br/><br/>The synthesis of the accumulated knowledge of phase 1 and 2 took place in the third phase. In the final phase of the project, guidance cards were developed, with each of the cards addressing one challenge in 3DPfR. The cards include an indication of the difficulty of designing and making the part, an example, an explanation of the limitations, and finally strategies for designing and making the part. The cards were evaluated with several users and generally received positively, each participant indicated that the cards would help him or her to repair more products through 3DPfR.","3D printing; Repair; Guidelines; 3DPfR","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

This figure is expected to increase over the coming decades, as demand for cooling energy may rise in the Netherlands due to climate change. The heating and cooling of buildings are at relatively low temperature compared to the industry and thus allowing for a 5th Generation District Heating and Cooling (5GDHC) network with thermal energy storage. Several guidelines are available for the design of 5GDHC substations \cite{ISSO39}, however they do not integrally consider the control design. <br/>Currently, in literature the performance of the substations is generally based on 1-hour measurements yet the control of the short term dynamics have a significant impact on the performance, thus shorter time steps are required to improve the performance.<br/><br/><br/>This study considers the short term dynamics of substations of large utility buildings connected to a 5GDHC grid, allowing for seasonal thermal energy storage and independent bi-directional consumption for all buildings. A hydro- and thermodynamic model including the controllers are compared with a case study of utility buildings at Utrecht University where high frequency operational data is gathered. This provides a view on the causes of the problems and inefficiencies and new insights into improvements on the hydro- and thermodynamics and control of the substation. A new control method for the heat exchanger and for the Heat Pump (HP) group is proposed to maximise the networks capacity.<br/><br/>The use of Model Predictive Control (MPC) controllers is investigated to determine the performance improvements that can be achieved based on a simple physical system model and the energy demand and temperature setpoint predictions. As the short-term dynamics are discussed, the time steps for the MPC optimisation are relatively small while the many on/off switches that are allowed might make it computationally intensive due to large number of binary variables. The flow in some parts might be reversed, which is modelled using binary variables. Finally, as the system is transporting water at different temperatures and different mass flow rates, it is described by bilinear equations. These equations can be linearised by the McCormick relaxations, however they once again increase the computational burden as new binary variables have to be introduced.<br/><br/>The changed proposal for switching conditions could easily be implemented and reduces the temperature limit violations as well as the proposed control method for the warm Heat Exchanger (HEX) as it stabilises the substation control. The proposed method for the temperature setpoint and capacity control showed an improved regulation of the temperature and energy provided by the heat pumps and could even reduce the consumption of conventional heating sources. Finally, the MPC controller shows an increased performance both for the constant and variable flow conditions, but cannot yet be implemented as the computational burden is too large.","operational stability; 5th generation district heating and cooling substations; ATES; MPC; high fequency operational data","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

Biofouling is known as the undesired adverse effect of living organisms growing on submerged surfaces. Fouling creates roughness on the hull and propeller and thus additional frictional resistance and loss of propeller efficiency, also referred to as an additional sea margin for ships due to biofouling. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) identified marine biofouling as one of the primary problems from both economic and ecologic points of view. Biofouling threatens the ecological balance of world seas by transferring invasive aquatic species and it causes a reduction in hydrodynamic performance of ships, which in turn increases fuel costs and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. A white-box model is first developed to predict biofouling growth together with resulting roughness, and compute increase in frictional resistance, loss of propeller open water efficiency, and change in wave resistance. With this a physical modelled prediction can be made for increase in power. This increase is then used in a data-driven model together with all other used parameters, to improve the prediction and output of the model. With the developed model, relevant questions have been answered from both a research and industry perspective. For Feadship, the developed model was applied for their yachts to give insight in power increase, fuel increase, maintenance increase, speed loss, range loss and added cost due to biofouling. With implementation of the proposed grey box and white box models, predictions can be made for ships varying in all ranges of available data. With an indication of ship profile and parameters, biofouling and its resulting sea margin can be estimated with high accuracy in early stage ship design.","Biofouling; Grey-box modelling; Machine learning; Ship design; Yachting","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Marine Technology","",""

However, open research data sharing has not become common practice in some research fields such as Epidemiology due to a variety of issues. We propose that the negative impact of issues in front of open research data adoption can be tackled by the right institutional and infrastructural instruments. The objective of this study is to understand the roles that infrastructural and institutional instruments (or their combinations) can play in promoting open research data sharing and (re)use behavior in Epidemiology. To achieve this objective, first, we conducted a systematic review investigating what instruments could be used to lead researchers to open data practices. Then, to examine the availability and importance of the proposed instruments in Epidemiology, we conducted a case study that includes interviews with Epidemiology researchers and a research data management consultant who work at various University Medical Centers (UMCs) in the Netherlands. We also evaluated the transferability of our case study findings in a workshop with data stewards and research data officers that work in different research fields at a Dutch research university. To our best knowledge, this study is the first study that focuses on the field of Epidemiology while examining the roles of instruments in open research data adoption based on field-dependent characteristics. Our study shows that researchers in Epidemiology do not openly share or reuse research data due to many different reasons relating to the legal, cultural, technical, and organizational issues. Many of the potentially effective instruments are not fully within the reach of Epidemiology researchers. Researchers do not have sufficient access to research data managers, search engines with satisfactory functionality, overarching registries, and reward systems for data sharing contributions. Institutional instruments can support open research data adoption by reversing the lack of an open data sharing culture with the right incentivization approaches, by the provision of financing, and by actively supporting researchers via data stewards, research data managers, libraries, and data privacy officers. Infrastructural instruments have the potential for supporting open research data adoption by increasing the findability and interoperability of the research data, and making researchers’ interactions with data infrastructures easier. Our study shows that institutional instruments (especially those that target enhancing the open data sharing culture and creating data sharing incentives) are in a more vital position to open research data adoption. Nevertheless, considering that many instruments complement one another, to increase the effectiveness of the instruments, they should be combined. We recommend conducting case studies in other contexts (e.g. involving policymakers, infrastructure providers, etc.), considering that the issue that we examined in this research is a multi-actor issue and that in this single case study, we only focused on researchers.","Open data; Open science; Research data management; Data sharing; Data reuse; Infrastructural instruments; Institutional instruments","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

After a short review of the relevant theory, two linear spectral statistics are proposed which are deduced from the nonlinear shrinkage estimator where for one of these linear spectral statistics its limiting distribution is derived. This results in a ready to use sphericity test statistic in the large-dimensional framework and is one of the main results of this thesis. The sphericity test corresponding to this new test statistic is called the nonlinear shrinkage test (NLS-ε). The theoretical results are illustrated by means of a simulation study where the new nonlinear shrinkage test is compared with al- ready existing tests, in particular the commonly used corrected likelihood ratio test and the corrected John’s test. It is demonstrated that the new nonlinear shrinkage test is most powerful under a non homogeneous variance alternative where it outperforms well known sphericity tests.

(mentor); Colomes, Oriol (graduation committee); Fazi, S. (graduation committee); Antonini, A. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Climate change is triggering an ever-growing demand for renewable energy. The U.S. is still far behind Europe when it comes to offshore wind energy. They have made ambitious plans to reach 30 GW in offshore wind energy by 2030 while currently 42 MW is installed. One of the main challenges in the U.S. is the installation method since a legislation called the Jones act prevents the usage of European installation vessels for shuttling (the conventional method). Building a Jones act. compliant installation vessel is a large investment which comes with risks and long lead times. Feedering is an alternative strategy, but barely any research on it is available. Here, a feeder vessel sails back and forth from the storage port to the (non-Jones act. compliant) installation vessel to supply Wind Turbine Generator (WTG) components. These components need to be lifted from the floating feeder in order to be installed. In the literature, this step is deemed to be the riskiest. However, barely any technical research is available with regards to the lift-off. <br/><br/>In the first thesis of this double degree program, a lift/installation sequence called the direct installation method is deemed to be highly interesting with respect to the logistics and costs. However, this research misses a technical study in order to understand if it is technically reachable to directly install these components. In this offshore engineering thesis, a barge is used as a feeder vessel and tower segments of a 20 MW WTG are chosen as the to-be lifted components. This research focuses on the pre-tension phase before the lift-off. This contains the steps where the crane of the installation vessel is already attached to the tower, pre-tension is building up and the release of the sea-fastening. Here, pre-tension is a percentage of the load that is taken in the crane before the lift-off. This research aims to increase the understanding of whether a tower can be released safely on the floating barge and what can be done in order to realise the idea of a direct installation method. <br/><br/>Frequency, as well as time-domain simulations, are used to investigate the problem. The results show that snap loads occur for pre-tensions up to 10\%. From 30\% and higher, the tower will start toppling. Toppling is initiated due to the inertia of the large tower segment when it is released from its sea-fastening. Toppling the tower is not allowed since this could damage the tower itself, the sea-fastening and/or other components on deck of the feeder. Increasing the limiting wave height is a must in order to make the direct installation method more practicable. This can firstly be done by using more tower segments. Therefore, reducing the size of each segment. Another option is to implement a motion compensation tool that decouples the motions of the feeder and the tower. The third option is to design a seafastening system that reduces the moment after the release, a temporary counteracting toppling system. All in all, can be stated that safely releasing a 20 MW tower segment on a floating barge is highly challenging and more research is required to solve the issues that are found in this research. This is necessary to allow the direct feeder method to be used for future offshore wind installation projects in the U.S.","Offshore wind; Feedering; Lift-off; WTG installation; Frequency domain analysis; Time-domain analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-07-05","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

The states resulting from estimating an MSVAR on intraoperative hemodynamic data were interpreted and related to postoperative troponin T measurements. The MSVAR was estimated in two ways: with the EM algorithm and in Bayesian fashion with the Gibbs sampler. Prior distributions were chosen and a Gibbs sampler was developed for estimating the MSVAR with these priors. The differences between the EM algorithm and the Gibbs sampler are mostly fundamental and not practical. Furthermore, the MSVAR is an appropriate model for modelling intraoperative hemodynamic data. The states of the MSVAR were related to various surgery variables, but did not have any prognostic value for predicting postoperative troponin T.

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","To obtain and fully use long series of high-precision observations of water balance components, it is necessary to quantify and reduce random and systematic data errors. This thesis applies and evaluates a previously developed data fusion methodology for bias-correcting and noise-filtering remote sensing observations of water balance variables that results in a consistent set of estimates that close the water balance. The method combines monthly water balance constraints and probabilistic data models for each water balance variable (precipitation, evaporation, river discharge and water storage), and uses Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling and iterative smoothing to estimate data errors and water balance variables without the need for any ground-truth. The methodology is evaluated here by application to three river basins in China located in different climate zones (humid to semi-arid). The evaluation assesses (i) how the method performs in the case study basins and to what extent data error assumptions in the probabilistic data models are satisfied, (ii) how sensitive the results are to changes in the datasets, and (iii) whether the use of dataset ensembles rather than dataset pairs (as in the original method) changes the results and further improves the overall data fit. The findings for these three research questions are as follows. First, the posterior water balance estimate for humid and arid basins with average standard error of 6-10 mm/month for precipitation, 4-6 mm/month for evaporation, 8-14 mm/month for water storage. Significant increase in both precipitation and evaporation uncertainty during wet summer period and the data error assumption is violated for precipitation in Wuding basin. Second, the results of replacing precipitation are more sensitive for Baihe humid basin, with both precipitation and evaporation increased, while for Wuding basin, replacing evaporation datasets is more sensitive.Third, significant increases in likelihood value by fusing all precipitation and evaporation datasets, with posterior uncertainty of water balance components increased. And the data error assumption is satisfied for Wuding basin. <br/>Therefore, the use of dataset ensembles as opposed to dataset pairs is recommended in further applications of the data fusion methodology.

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Fiber Metal Laminates needs to be seen as a construct of its individual constituents rather than a material on which the industry has capitalized on. Therefore, analytical models must be made in order to predict the mechanical behavior of the laminates which would reduce the big test matrix for defining empirical values for design allowables. An analytical model made to predict the mid-section stress distribution of Fiber Metal Laminate plate with a centre round hole under uni-axial tension. The σ 0 ε-curve of the laminate is defined by the Metal Volume Fraction. Assuming that the elasto-plastic energy of a small strip is equal to the uni-axial imaginary elastic energy, the σ 0 ε-state of these small strips can be calculated. The elastic peak stress profile at the midsection is defined by a decreasing exponential equation with three parameters. The centre of the small strips are the points where the value of interest are determined. Predicting the net-section stress distribution under elasto-plastic loading is determined iteratively by using the Finite Width Correction Factor as a convergence factor between the applied and net-section load. The analytical model gives quite good and accurate results far into the plastic regime validated by DIC experiments and strain gauges. One of the major findings was that indeed it is possible to have delamination and fiber-bridging beneath the plastic zone, which had implications for determining accurately the Blunt Notch Strength.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

(mentor); Plomp, J. (mentor); Bouwman, W.G. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Nano-carriers have the potential to be an enormous game-changer in medicinal drug delivery systems. The polymeric nano-carriers used in this study are a product of the self-assembly of amphiphilic block copolymers, a complicated process which must be understood completely to finely tune the desired morphology for drug delivery. The goal of this thesis is to gain a better understanding of the self-assembly process of amphiphilic block copolymers. Specifically, it will focus on the ’opaque phase’ observed for poly(1,2-butadiene)-b-poly(ethylene oxide) (PBd-PEO) block copolymers, which seems to occur in the early stages of the self-assembly process. A nano-precipitation method has been developed at the TU Delft, which induces selfassembly and brings forward the opaque phase. The used block copolymer has a hydrophobic PBd block and a hydrophilic PEO block. This block copolymer dissolves well in acetone, but upon water (H2O) addition, it starts to self-assemble into spherical aggregates, useful for drug delivery. At small volumes of H2O, the opaque phase appears and disappears as more H2O is added. In this thesis, multiple samples have been prepared with the so-called Inverse Nanoprecipitation method and different experimental parameters among which the volume percentage of H2O present in the sample, have been varied. The samples have been studied using Visual Inspection, Dynamic Light Scattering and Spin Echo Small Angle Neutron Scattering. The experiments show that the time intervals between H2O addition do not affect the formation of aggregates, but rather the ‘when’ of adding the H2O. If this is added to the acetone before the block copolymer is dissolved, it affects the self-assembly process. A visual experiment showed that the opaque phase occurred 1.2±0.1 vol% H2O earlier than in previous research, which might be a result of the lower room temperature during this thesis. Another significant result might be that the addition of acetone-D6 or D2O affects the self-assembly process, which must be considered for future SESANS measurements. Lastly, during the opaque phase a strong temperature sensitivity is observed (which was already found in previous research at TU Delft, by E. Remmelts and further researched by R. Baaijens), high light scattering intensities are detected with DLS and for SESANS measurements the scattered neutron intensities were low. These observations all strongly point to a theory called ‘pre-micellization’, which gives a better understanding of the opaque phase.<br","Opaque Phase; self-assembly; PBd-PEO Polymers","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Physics","",""

Devices are connected to this network through gateways, and they will run in that deployment for years without replacement. Therefore, bugs and security issues in such devices' firmware are present for a long time, unless firmware updates are applied to fix them. Firmware-Updates Over-The-Air (FUOTA) is a firmware update application framework for LoRaWAN, but packet loss is an unsolved issue for such firmware updating frameworks. State-of-the-art packet dissemination uses the Low-Density Parity Checks (LDPC), but this has decoding overhead. Also, it is inflexible due to its fixed-rate nature. The code can not be dynamically adjusted to adapt to temporary changes in channel conditions.<br/>In this work, we provide critical analysis to justify replacing Low-Density Parity Checks code (LDPC) proposed in FUOTA with the famous code Random Linear Network Coding (RLNC). The benefit of RLNC shows when scaling to multicast networks using LoRaWAN FUOTA as fewer messages need to be exchanged to serve the complete network of firmware updates. An analysis is presented on how to configure the finite field size, generation size, and redundancy for generation-based RLNC. The parameters are optimized to cope with the worst-case packet-error rate. As such, RLNC can optimally counter every lost packet with redundancy with near-zero decoding overhead. Since devices sleep after decoding a set of fragments, or the generation, sending additional fragments does not decrease efficiency. Finally, the decoding probability is provided as an analytical tool to show that a specific amount of redundancy can deal with a specific worst-case packet-error rate.<br/>To evaluate and test the RLNC code for LoRa, embedded firmware and terminal software have been developed to do indoor and outdoor measurements. This testbed has been developed with a custom control plane replacing all FUOTA MAC layer modules (Fragmentation, Multicast, Synchronization, Device Management, etc.). Therefore, it can be shaped into custom network configurations meant for evaluating the firmware updating process without having to set up infrastructures like ChirpStack or TheThingsStack. Our work's testbed can isolate the decoding process and evaluate it for artificial packet drops.<br/>Results are presented, which show that systematic coding phase of LDPC will perform poorly compared to RLNC. This systematic phase is at least as large as the firmware update. Between 38% to 88% improvement in decoding success is found by using RLNC in case of varying network conditions due to burst loss.","LoRa; Firmware Update; RLNC; LDPC; LoRaWAN; Coding; Redundancy; FUOTA; LPWAN; Multicast; IoT; Class B; WSN; Adhoc Networks; STM32","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Embedded Systems","",""

The efficiency of such algorithms often deteriorates when employed in high traffic densities. Several methods have tried to prioritize certain conflicts to alleviate part of the problems introduced at high traffic densities. However, manually establishing rules for prioritizing intruders is a difficult task due to the complex traffic patterns that emerge in multi-actor conflicts. Reinforcement Learning (RL) has demonstrated its ability to synthesize strategies while approximating the system dynamics. This research shows how RL can be employed to improve conflict prioritization in multi-actor conflicts. We employ the Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm with an actor-critic network. The RL model decides on intruder selection based on the local observations of an aircraft. It was trained on a limited number of conflict geometries in which it was able to significantly reduce the number of intrusions. A conflict prioritization strategy was then formulated based on the decisions taken by the RL model during training. We show that the efficacy of a conflict resolution algorithm that adopts a global solution, the solution space diagram (SSD) in this research, can be improved when utilizing this conflict prioritization strategy. Finally, these results were compared to the performance of a pairwise CR method, the Modified Voltage Potential (MVP). Even though MVP resulted in a smaller number of intrusions compared to SSD with conflict prioritization, the prioritization strategy did reduce the gap between the two CR methods.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Generally, the leakages can be categorized into access, search, and volume pattern. In most existing Searchable Encryption (SE) schemes, these leakages are caused by practical designs but are considered an acceptable price to achieve high search efficiency. Many attacks on SSE schemes have shown that such leakages could be easily exploited to retrieve the underlying keywords for search queries. Each attack abuses a different leakage pattern and uses different techniques to achieve high query recovery accuracy. An attacker could be passive or active, where an active attacker can inject files in an SSE scheme, while a passive attacker only observes the queried data. Some passive attacks use the number of files returned by a query to create a match with a candidate keyword. Others use the co-occurrence of multiple keywords in the files to match a query with the same occurrence. We continue this research and design a new Volume and Access Pattern Leakage-abuse Attack (VAL-Attack) that exploits both the access and volume patterns. Our proposed attack only leverages leaked documents and the keywords present in those documents as auxiliary knowledge and can effectively retrieve document and keyword matches from leaked data. Furthermore, the recovery performs with great accuracy and without false positives. We compare VALAttack with two recent well-defined attacks on several real-world datasets to highlight the effectiveness of our attack and present the performance under popular countermeasures.","Searchable Encryption; Access pattern; Volume pattern; Leakage; Attack","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science","",""

The aim of the current study was to validate the performance of human body modelling software Madymo, intended for use in car-crash simulations, in reconstructing human falling movements. This was achieved by first performing experiments in which the kinematics and kinetics of participants were recorded during falls from a short height. Next, the initial conditions taken from the experimentally recorded falls were used as input to run corresponding simulations using Madymo. Finally, the results from the simulated falls were compared to those from the real falls, based on the posture just before landing.

The model showed that phoresis produces enhanced diffusion in the order that was expected for the enzyme urease.

These images remain fuzzy but clearly show the shadow of a black hole with a bright disk and will only improve in quality over time. We want to be able to deduce, from the images, the following properties of the observed black hole; the mass, the angular momentum and the orientation of the black hole. This can be done by visualising the mathematical model of a black hole. This model is a result of the theory of general relativity and comparing the theoretical model to the real-life observations could be used to validate this theory. We have visualized a Kerr black hole. This is a black hole that is more realistic than the original Schwarzschild black hole because it also includes the angular momentum of the black hole. The Kerr solution describes the curvature of space-time around a rotating black hole. This curvature of spacetime causes light rays to travel in a curved path instead of a straight line. The distortion of light rays causes distortions in the image of a black hole in a similar way that a lens of a camera causes distortion in an image by curving light. By using the mathematical field of differential geometry we can exactly describe the curved path of a light ray around a Kerr black hole. This path of the light ray can be formulated in different coordinate systems. We will use the so-called Kerr-Schild coordinate system because it does not have the coordinate-related singularities of other coordinate systems. To create the visualisation of a Kerr black hole we will implement a ray-tracing algorithm. This is an algorithm that can create a 2D projection of a 3D space. The algorithm normally uses straight light rays to create an image, we will however adapt this program to model the curved light rays around a Kerr black hole. The visualisation employs a celestial sphere around the black hole to project the universe around it. Furthermore, an accretion disk around the black hole is added to model light-emitting particles orbiting the black hole. Our ray-tracing algorithm makes it possible to realistically visualise a Kerr black hole with varying parameters. These parameters are the mass of the black hole, the angular momentum, orientation compared to the observer and the size and structure of the accretion disk. To exemplify the ability of the ray-tracing model to fit these parameters, different angular momentum and orientation values are compared to the properties of the resulting image. This means that when in the future we get higher resolution observations of a black hole, the properties of this black hole can be deduced from the ray-tracing model. This can help our understanding of the curvature of space-time caused by general relativity and our understanding of the universe as a whole.","ray tracing; differential geometry; Kerr; Schwarzschild; Kerr-Schild; Black Holes","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Layman Summary<br/>The goal of this paper is to study how waves move over a fluid in with an underlying current. Oceans displace debris and heat. Ocean models can be used to predict the movement of debris and even predict the effect of the movements of oceans on the climate. Modeling water can be improved by introducing more information from observations into the models. The goal of this paper is to combine the effect of varying density and an underlying current in a model for ocean water near the equator. Our model focuses on long, shallow waves. This allows us to simplify the model and solve it more easily. We combine methods from different sources to create a model for our problem. The model we create shows there are two types of solution waves: Periodic travelling waves and Solitons. Solitons are single waves that don’t change shape through time. We find that density influences the amplitude of waves and the perturbation of the current. We find that the underlying current influences the wave profile’s width as well as the amplitude.<br/><br/>Summary<br/>Models of oceans can be used to predict the displacement of debris and even trace its path back to its origin. Oceans are a large influence on the weather and climate all over the world. Improving these models is therefore very useful.<br/>There isn’t a general equation that describes all water dynamics. Even if there would be, we would not have a computer good enough to make all the necessary calculations for the model. Though there will not be a perfect model, there is still a lot of room to improve the current models. The accuracy of water models, specifically for oceans, can be improved in different ways. We can increase the resolution to model smaller, more intricate behavior. The model can also be improved by coupling more different phenomena.<br/>The goal of this paper is to combine existing methods for modeling the propagation of waves in a model that describes the propagation of waves over a current in a stratified fluid. We assume the fluid to be inviscid and incompressible. We also assume there is no thermal conductivity. We choose to focus the model on long and shallow waves and changes in the current. These<br/>assumptions mean we can choose to base the governing equations on the Euler equations for inviscid fluids. Through non-dimensionalisation and scaling transformations, we transform our model to unitless equations.

However, it is important to gain a better insight into both the quantitative and qualitative housing demand for housing in that middle segment, to make sure that suitable housing supply can also be realized in this housing segment. To be able to realize suitable housing supply in the middle segment rental sector, it is of importance to know which characteristics of the house and the living environment are more decisive for the housing satisfaction of the tenants. The research methods in this thesis are quantitative and qualitative. Quantitative analysis will be done to define the supply and demand in the current housing stock. First the quantitative data will be analyzed by using data from WiMRA (2021), which provides information about the current situation of the middle segment housing, the users and their housing satisfaction. The qualitative research will be done by interviews with tenants of housing provided by housing associations and private actors in Amsterdam and by analyzing the current state of satisfaction of these tenants, to complement the quantitative research. The goal of this research is to create a solution to match supply and demand from both a qualitative and quantitative perspective for midsegment housing and to increase satisfaction of residents of middle segment housing.","Housing; Middle rental segment; housing satisfaction; Amsterdam; Rental Housing; WiMRA; Housing Associations; Private landlord","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Management in the Built Environment","",""

It comprises a sector that has managed to make south Spain the “orchard of Europe” with a profit margin of more than 900 million euros in the Segura river basin and over 100,000 direct jobs associated. The industry is dependent on the immense engineering works of the Tajo-Segura transfer, a major infrastructure that transports water from the North to the South. <br/><br/> Water is considered the most valuable resource in the region. There is a tremendous system of exploitation underneath the ground, formed by wells, pipes, and desalination plants, many of which are neither authorized nor monitored. This setting is damaging the Mar Menor lagoon, the largest hypersaline lagoon in Europe, and its natural ecosystems; groundwater is overexploited and polluted with nitrates, despite the fact that European regulations mandate its protection.<br/><br/> This intensive system of production is also dependent on an increasing migrant workforce that seeks a better level of liveability in the European context.

In the case of component failure, the autonomous robotic system requires reliable adaptation capabilities combined with a consistent understanding of the task, environment, and the robot’s capabilities for successful task completion. Recent research has shown that<br/>Active Inference, a unifying neuroscientific theory of the brain, has the potential to intrinsically handle substantial uncertainties in the system, resembling the adaptability of humans. These works, however, have the following limitations: (1) no distinction is made between actions with some commonality, capable of satisfying similar tasks, and (2) actions are assumed to be always feasible when preconditions are satisfied, regardless of their context. Given the situation, certain actions satisfying a task might not lead to task succession. This work<br/>proposes the AI for retail (Airet) framework, a novel extension of action planning through Active Inference for mobile manipulation. The Airet framework uses Bayesian networks and Ontological Reasoning to facilitate context-awareness in action planning through Active Inference. Reasoning on robot components, action-, manipulation- and environmental constraints is facilitated through a description-logic-based reasoner and an OWL-based ontology containing concepts relevant for action selection in a retail context. The capabilities of the Airet framework are demonstrated through the following cases (1) irrecoverable task &amp; component.

Following that, most of these shared vehicles are electrically powered, which also contributes to a more sustainable future. A crucial factor for the success of these shared mobility systems is its ability to properly match the demand and supply of the vehicles. This is achieved by rebalancing operations, in which vehicles are repositioned from areas with a surplus of vehicles to areas with a deficit of vehicles, based on the expected demand and supply. Determining effective rebalancing operations is a complex challenge that requires the consideration of many different elements. In this review, various methodologies from the literature to rebalance the fleet of vehicles within shared mobility systems are examined.

(graduation committee); Grossman, Vanessa (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","India's rapid urbanization results in a horizontal urban expansion to the periphery, shaping them into a dynamic rural-urban interface termed the 'peri-urban'. On the one hand, urbanization has profoundly impacted villages within the urban boundaries and resulted in a massive breakdown of local space through gradual changes in land use, economy, and social linkage. On the other hand, infrastructure works in the city have provided many job opportunities, attracting poor migrants from surrounding rural areas to move to the city. In 2010, about 35% of the population in Navi Mumbai were rural migrants. They were mainly working in labour-intensive sectors, such as quarrying. <br/><br/>Unprecedented urbanization in India increased existing inequalities and exacerbated urban exclusion in the context of disability to access social services and formal houses. Government interventions have been unable to respond to the exclusion appropriately, especially in the housing sector. Under the existing social housing allocation system, most quarry workers are excluded from applying for formal social housing without legal citizenship and stable incomes in the city. They have to live in self-built informal shelters which have difficulty accessing basic amenities and are exposed to high levels of risk, including pollution, dynamite blasting, and heavy industrial road traffic. In general, the dynamic socio-spatial spaces in the peri-urban area are full of multidimensional conflicts between villagers, migrants, and government officials. Fortunately, housing is a combination of domestic activities, income generation, and social linkage in the Global South. It is significant for urban development and facilitates social integration. <br/><br/>From an urban aspect, long-term socio-ecological urban resilience will be achieved through urban upgrading in Navi Mumbai's quarry belt. The upgrading will be divided into three phases: resettlement, urban upgrading, and ecological restoration. Focus on the resettlement phase, the proposal of the residential cluster is based on quarry workers' collective and mutual-help lifestyle. The temporality in the quarry area has also been taken into account, which may help the project adapt to the post-quarry period. Finally, a conclusion of urban-scale design principles will serve for upscaling and replicability of this project. It will guide the resettlement and upgrading of many informal settlements located in the quarry belt.<br/><br/><br","Rual-Urban Migration; Quarry Worker; Affordable Housing; Resettlement","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Global Housing","Global Housing Mixing Mumbai:","19.052514734619912, 73.03115921508362"

Collecting and processing hundreds of tonnes of municipal solid waste per day, this industry supports the millions of people engaged in this business and provides ecological and economic contributions to Indian cities. However, IWM is currently faced with the problems of internal vulnerability from slums and external threats from cities. The current situation of Indian slums does not correspond to the aspirations of dwellers and workers for a better living and working environment, nor the expectations of cities for a better urban image and development prospects. Over the last few decades, many slum redevelopment schemes have attempted to change this situation, yet their entire focus on resettlement strategies has left no space for IWM as well as other informal businesses. As ecosystems buzzing with activities, slums cannot simply be replaced by neat low-income housing estates unless they allow for the flourishing of many dynamic economic and social activities and new trajectories of resource use that contribute to sustainable livelihoods. The aim of the research is to explore a new direction for future slum development, which entails a synthesis of economic, environmental and social sustainability.

The aim of this research was to lower the As concentration in Dunea’s effluent<br/>to &lt; 1 µg/L by improving our system understanding and exploring novel techniques for As(III) oxidation. Fieldwork was performed to assess whether each well section contributed to the elevated As concentrations. In order to enhance As(III) oxidation at Dunea’s DWTP, the use of electrochemical advanced oxidation processes (eAOPs) with a RuO2/IrO2-coated anode was examined during laboratory experiments. Fieldwork results showed that in each monitoring point the measured As concentration was &gt; 1 µg/L, indicating that each well section contributed to the elevated As concentrations. The combination of strongly fluctuating groundwater tables, infiltration of oxygenated water, the observed pH decrease and synchronous mobilisation of several TEs, indicated that As was most probably mobilised by pyrite oxidation. It was observed that the As-bearing layer was present between -2.5 and -8.5 m NAP. With an average filter depth from -1.6 to -7.4 m, water was being extracted from the As-bearing layer. Laboratory results showed complete As(III) oxidation by eAOPs at a current density (i) of 7.5 A/m2, with a corresponding charge dosage (q) and hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 30 C/L and 1.4 min, respectively. At the aforementioned condition, the energy consumption of the eAOP cell was 0.066 kWh/m3 with operational costs of 0.04 e/m3. Free chlorine formation was minimized by reducing q, HRT and i. During the optimal anodic configuration of 7.5 A/m2, the estimated cathodic OH− production was sufficient to replace the dosed chemicals for pellet softening (PS). However, it was not sufficient to buffer for the anodic pH decrease. It was proposed to implement the eAOP cell at Dunea’s DWTP after PS and before aeration and rapid sand filtration.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-05-01","","","","Water Management","",""

(mentor); Pietrzak, J.D. (graduation committee); de Roode, S.R. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","As the environment is changing temperatures are changing, becoming more extreme. This is expected to affect the oceans and its transport, specifically the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC). The Labrador Sea is a part of the AMOC, where overturning in depth and density space occurs, due to deep convection. Deep convection is the process of seawater losing its heat to the atmosphere, due to atmospheric cooling during the winter. This causes the seawater to become colder and denser, and it therefore sinks towards the bottom of the basin. Deep convection is previously studied extensively as it is a unique and important process of the global ocean circulation system. The key process that causes the AMOC water to overturn, is due to buoyant eddies shedding from the boundary current into the interior. The buoyant eddies exchange their buoyant boundary current water with the dense interior water, causing the boundary current (and in extension the AMOC water) to cool down.<br/><br/>Previous studies have shown that the properties of the boundary current water are strongly dependent on the eddy exchange, and therefore on the surface heat loss. However, it is not known how consecutive strong winters impact the dynamics of the Labrador Sea on various timescales, which will therefore be the focus of this thesis. Data for this research will be obtained by using an idealised model configuration of the Labrador Sea, where the hydrostatic primitive equations of motion are solved by the MIT general circulation model (MITgcm). Different types of scenarios are defined to analyse different effects on the dynamics. These scenarios are analysed by looking into how the mean basin temperature changes, how the eddy kinetic energy (EKE) and mixed layer depth (MLD) develop, and how the properties through a transect of the basin change. The effects of these interactions are then studied by looking at how the transport of water throughout the boundary current, per density class and per vertical layer change. <br/><br/>The thesis mainly shows that the mixed layer depth in the interior increases during a strong winter. As a result, the eddy kinetic energy increases significantly in the boundary current, as the horizontal density gradient increases, thus causing an increase in boundary current velocity in the downstream direction. Additionally, more and denser interior water accumulates, depending on how many consecutive strong winters occur. This deep convected water in the interior partly remains near the bottom of the basin. In the next winter, it is mixed again due to deep convection, consequently a positive feedback loop occurs. Meaning, that the number of consecutive winters positively impacts the interactions in the basin, as the horizontal density gradient increases, and thus the velocity and eddy kinetic energy increase as well, in respect to the previous winter. The effect of the strong winters persists in the years afterwards, as the interior remains relatively cold. Additionally, a part of the accumulated convected interior water resides too deep in the basin to be exchanged by the eddy exchange and therefore flows near the bottom out of the basin, due to a pressure difference. The flow near the bottom is a negative feedback loop, as the volume of dense convected water decreases and can therefore not be further cooled during consecutive strong winters. Finally, the properties and the transport of the boundary current water are directly related to the interior water and eddy exchange. As the MLD in the interior and eddies in the BC are still relatively large in the years after the additional surface heat loss, the export of boundary current water therefore also remains affected. In conclusion, the effect of wintertime surface heat loss on the Labrador Sea Water in the short term has the most influence on the MLD and EKE, however the influence of the MLD and EKE remains and therefore in the long term affects the export through the BC. These conclusions can help to better interpret the limited available measurements of the Labrador Sea Water.","Labrador Sea; Labrador Sea Water; winter surface heat loss; strong winters; consecutive strong winters; varying intensity; boundary current; deep convection; eddy current field; MITgcm; numerical model; OSNAP","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","","61.00000, -56.00000"

High potential to improve the interaction with high resolution haptic feedback is often ignored. In this paper, the use of a haptic pseudo-potential field rendering method on a friction modulated touchscreen is proposed. With this method, the user is assisted in moving towards a target by lowering the friction and impeded in moving away by increasing the friction coefficient. In a human factors experiment, this rendering method is compared to a position-based friction modulation method. Subjects are instructed to find a target path, based on the haptic feedback. The results show that the position-based rendering method has a higher hit-rate and lower movement times. This demonstrates that the pseudo-potential field method is difficult to perceive, however it is expected that advancements in rendering larger friction coefficient ranges or even active lateral force feedback will improve this rendering method.","Surface haptics; Ultrasonic Friction Modulation; pseudo-potential fields","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

There are methods to counter the leakage of data while pushing code to a repository however, these are heavily reliant on regular expressions. Personal names, locations and other Personally Identifiable Information (PII) do not follow a reoccurring pattern and can thus only be prevented by manual code reviews, which are also prone to errors. A tool to detect these PII should be designed as an initial measure to counteract the leakage. In this paper, we propose a heavily modifiable tool in which we combine the strength of regular expressions with a state-of-the-art machine learning model to detect a variety of important PII within the code changes of Python software projects. We use CodeBERT, a RoBERTa-like Transformer model, as our PII recognizer. This recognizer is fine-tuned using the Scikit-learn library of which we injected the git commits with fake sensitive data. To test and improve the quality of the model and the entire tool, we design an experimental methodology to find the optimal value for the hyper parameters of the model, compare it against another Transformer model and run the fine-tuned model against several other code-bases with different programming languages. The outcome of these experiments benefit the quality of the model in a positive way and allows us to design a robust tool with a well-performing machine learning model to detect a variety of entities. This tool can be personalized to any business and mitigate a significant part of the potential data leaks.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science | Software Technology","",""

This surface inspection tool is part of a proposed redesign of the thermal conditioning stage of VDL-ETGs atmospheric wafer handler. A meticulous requirements study was performed, and the most important results were the following: 1) droplets with diameters larger than 35 μm should be measured, 2) the size, shape and location of the droplets is not relevant, 3) the wafer is not allowed to heat up by more than 3 mk as a result of the inspection, 4) the entire wafer surface should be inspected in less than 2 seconds and 5) only one droplet may pass undetected in every 6200 wafers. Several concepts were generated and after comparing them the synchronous dark-field flying spot scanner was selected, mainly for its high signal strength, and the low amount of signal fluctuation for different droplet locations. The design contains several parameters, the combination of which influence the system performance in a non-trivial way. A parametric design tool has been developed that takes in the design parameters as inputs, and outputs the system performance values and important design dimensions. This design tool was used to find design parameters that yield the desired performance. A simplified version of the design was built as an experimental setup for validation. For the experimental setup, a small spot size was chosen. This allowed us to better characterize the scattering behavior, however as a consequence this also prevented us from directly comparing the experimental results to the system performance yielding from the design tool. The experimental results were the following: 1) A very small part of the droplet surface is responsible for the large majority of the measured scattering, 2) the peaks are narrower in the cross-scan direction than in the scan direction, most likely due to the droplets being flat. 3) The measured noise is much higher than the predicted noise, this is likely due to poor grounding, poor shielding or a lack of filtering out high frequencies. Although the experimental setup yielded interesting results, the setup was not sufficient to fully validate the design – further experimentation is required to determine 1) if the predicted signal amplitude is correct, 2) if the signal amplitude scales with the square of the diameter of a droplet, 3) if the optical components remain as clean as we expect during operation of the dry unit, and 4) if the noise levels can be reduced to the desired level. Additionally, to improve the design further we suggest looking into ways of reducing the wafer warp and wobble.","Design study; Surface inspection; Laser scanner; Dark-field illumination; Detection; Surface deposited water droplets; Silicon wafer; Geometric scattering; Semiconductor industry","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Mechatronic System Design (MSD)","",""

In the most general sense, the economy represents production and consumption activities in which urban residents participate, yet there is no tangible space in cities where this relationship is physically exhibited and witnessed. The reason being that the industry though a keystone of the economy, has not survived the evolution of the urban tissue, resulting in the consequent lack of synergy between humans and the act of production. <br/><br/>Etymologically, the term industry appears as a synonym of ‘diligence’ and ‘hard work’ which allusively refers to that of humans. Though throughout the years the word represented the means of production, this is now out of sight. Production, once indispensable to human existence and the urban tissue, is no longer a part of everyday life. The functioning of the machines led to pollution and inadequate sources, while the industry needed bigger and cheaper lands which were hard to possess within the dense city center. This ever-changing dynamic resulted in the subsequent isolation of industry and production to the outskirts; resulting in segregated urban planning where it was not possible to witness the act of making.<br/><br/>Production is an everyday actor which plays a vital role in the urban flow. Gleaning the industry, collecting and giving it a new meaning, can reintroduce this everyday forgotten existence of production to its city. This way, production would not only represent the economy but also become an urban catalyst to evoke new possible interactions such as the sense of collectiveness. This collectiveness is provided by the ever-changing urban dynamics and; as a result, by a new understanding of urban culture. This approach offers shared urban spaces for different types of users, urban residents, makers, manufacturers, and workers.<br/><br/>After having been pushed away for years, the industry is now ready to be celebrated, offering unconventional perspectives for new urban and architectural explorations. By enabling many dualities such as humans and machines, contextuality and universality, etc. to exist together, it intends to form a more homogenous urban atmosphere.<br","Industry; production,; human; machine; makers","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","",""

(mentor); van der Ent, R.J. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Managing water resources for the future is challenging, given the wide range of climatic and hydrological uncertainty. To support decision makers in formulating robust adaptation plans and finding their way through the broad range of available climate data and models, decision scaling was introduced: an approach for bottom-up climate vulnerability assessments, informed by Global Climate Models (GCMs). This study aims to improve decision scaling as developed by Brown et al. (2012) by introducing three recent advances in climate adaptation and uncertainty science.<br/><br/>First, the concept of environmental flows (eflows) was adopted to represent the local ecology and variable hydrology with a broad range of indicators for evaluating the impact of climate change. Second, the GCM weighting strategy of Knutti et al. (2017) was applied to account for model performance and interdependency when estimating the plausibility of future climate conditions. Lastly, climate stress testing was not only done for annual average climate changes, but also for a prolonged dry season to represent the interannually variable character of climate change. The potential application of the novel decision scaling approach was illustrated through a case study of the Mokolo River. This river is situated in the South African Waterberg Biosphere Reserve, which faces competing water demands from tourism, industry, agriculture, and ecology under a changing climate. <br/><br/>It was found that the additions contribute to decision scaling, as eflows indicators introduced the climate impact on multiple flow components, which provides extra information on the climate vulnerability of the river during different flow conditions. In Waterberg, low and average flow conditions were found similarly sensitive to climate change. Moreover, GCM weighting increased the range of temperature uncertainty and showed high weights for both wet and dry GCM projections, which emphasizes the need for robust climate adaptation in Waterberg. Next, the additional stress test showed that prolonging the dry season by one month influences flows throughout the following year, especially in the posterior months. In this way, understanding the impact of plausible characteristics of future climate was improved. <br/><br/>Finally, this study revealed that local activities, such as groundwater extractions and land use changes, and available knowledge challenges the application of decision scaling to a real case study as it requires models and quantification of indicators. Therefore, carefully matching models, performance indicators, local concerns and knowledge are required for formulating climate adaptation strategies with decision scaling.","Decision Scaling; Climate adaptation; climate uncertainty; Global Climate Model weighting; Environmental Flow; South Africa","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Water Management","","-24.002795316181313, 27.73854601122841"

It uses the refractive properties of an atmosphere to converge light rays to a focal line. It has been hypothesized that using Earth’s atmosphere could, under favorable circumstances, yield an amplification of 55; 000 for a detector that has a surface area of 1m2. However, the precise effects of the oblateness of Earth in combination with the effects of physical effects such as turbulence inside the atmosphere have not yet been researched. Here we show that incorporating the eccentricity of Earth diminishes the amplification greatly. We found using a ray tracing model for gradient-index media that the amplification for ellipsoidal planets has the following relation with the detector or pixel size: A / D&#x100000;0:66. For spherical planets this relation is A / D&#x100000;1. Furthermore, we implemented velocity diffusion to simulate physical effects inside the atmosphere, which surprisingly did not affect the amplification significantly. We anticipate this result to be a starting point for more sophisticated ray tracing models. For example, a full map for the refraction in the atmosphere could be used to test the effect of a non-homogeneous atmosphere.

(mentor); Keyzer, L.M. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","In this study the contribution of the low-frequency residuals to the sea-level variability has been examined. This is done using 106-year old sea-level record obtained at Hoek van Holland. Computing the mean sea-level per season each year and the corresponding standard deviation one finds an increase in both these features of the sea-level record. The rise of the mean sea-level implies the effect of climate change. Moreover, it is found that the standard deviation in the sea-level, thus the intensity of variation, is the highest during fall and winter. This implies that the sea-level variability has a seasonal dependency. Furthermore, one finds an increase in the standard deviation on the long term. However, since a big part of the mean sea-level is influenced by tidal events, the increase in standard deviation is possibly linked to climate change in meteorological factors as has been found is in the study carried out by Gerkema and Duran-Matute(2017). With the use of the computational algorithms such as the Fast Fourier Transformation and the Wavelet Transformation one can extract the low-frequency residuals from the sea-level record. Inspired by the study of Gerkema and Duran-Matute(2017) a correlation between the wind speed and the low-frequency residuals have been found. Using the Wavelet Transformation it is found that the low-frequency residuals obtain the most energy during fall and winter, this empowers the finding that these low-frequency residuals are seasonal dependent. Moreover, when studying the low-frequency residuals closely it is found that the frequencies below 0.60 1 day obtain the most energy during fall and winter, especially the frequencies near 0.10 1 day . With these findings one can say that the contribution of the low-frequency signals, thus the low-frequency residuals, is correlated to meteorological events, such as the wind. Moreover, it is found that the variation in the low-frequency residuals is much smaller during spring and summer compared to the case during winter and fall. This seems not to be the case for the sea-level variability due to the tidal constituents and the high-frequency waves. Therefore, one may conclude that these low-frequency residuals contribute to a great extent in the standard deviation of the sea-level.","Low-frequency waves; sea level; variability","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","","51.980632,4.134185"

First, a descriptive case-study at CET analyzed which challenges researchers at CET face, using semi-structured interviews, logbooks and focus groups. Next, the research designed a reflection tool, using brainstorming techniques, prototype evaluations session and a test session. The resulting reflection tool is a card-game that makes CET-researchers exchange ideas about which roles to adopt in a playful way. Through the game, the CET-researchers learn a new language with which they can talk about researcher roles. They widen their repertoire to think and speak about what they want to contribute to transdisciplinary collaborations and how they can do that. This can help them when making role-divisions in researcher-teams and when discussing expectations with collaboration partners. Helping the academic changemaker reflect on their role in transdisciplinary collaboration – it is a crucial step towards creating more conscious and purposeful collaborations with the ability to transform society in the face of climate change.","transdisciplinary collaborations; knowledge co-production; researcher role; climate and energy research; reflection","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Sciences | Science Education and Communication","",""

This results in high water levels in towns and cities, leading to risk of loss of life and many financial damages. Currently the region is vulnerable, because there are no hydraulic structures that regulate the flow safely downstream towards the coastline. Instead, at this moment the current channels are inadequate dry rivers. To reduce the risk of flooding, the objective of this design was to design a flood abatement control zone (ZAC). This design followed the design approach for Hydraulic Engineering.<br/><br/>A ZAC consists of a series of dikes that enclose separate reservoirs that are able to temporarily store water. This dampens the peak discharge of the flash flood, which reduces the flood risk of the downstream area. The peak reduction is the main function. The water that is stored is being discharged with a delay, spreading an acceptable discharge over a longer time to discharge the same rainfall event volume. <br/><br/>The first step of the design was to define the system of the ZAC. The ZAC was combined with the creation of an up- and downstream channel with short lengths to fit the structure into the environment. Its design life was set at 50 years, corresponding to a design rainfall event of once per 474 years. To design this structure, it was important to determine the maximum rainfall event discharge and the existing maximum discharge capacity without floods occurring downstream. These 2 factors, together with soil properties and land boundaries, acted as boundary conditions to the system.<br/><br/><br/>In step 2, two locations were considered as potential construction location, both indicated by the client Universidad Polytechnica de Cartagena (UPCT). By applying a multi-criteria analysis (MCA) based on predominantly the water inflow, potential storage area, close company buildings and houses, the more upstream location was chosen.<br/><br/>Step 3: in order to design an adequate ZAC, a model was required to create the before-and-after-construction situation. A hydrological 2D-flow model was created in HEC-RAS. This was closely tied to functional design and design steps were taken iteratively. The 2D-model was able to compute flow in longitudinal and lateral direction, which is strongly needed in a flooded terrain. The most important design parameters to test in the model were the culvert-spillway-structure and the number of reservoirs. The model was validated qualitatively by flood maps from Centro de Descargas del CNIG.<br/><br/>Then, the functional design of the ZAC was done in step 4. The ZAC was placed partially dug into the soil upstream, and partly sticking out of the soil downstream. Upon iteration, it was decided to create 5 reservoirs, because of costs and a smaller marginal peak reduction effect of extra reservoirs. The ZAC is created in combination with a downstream funnel, downstream outflow channel and upstream channel. This means that the reservoirs are enclosed by 2 side dikes and 6 lateral dikes.<br/><br/>Then, detailed design in step 5 followed. The culvert-spillway structure was designed. The aim of this structure is to let water through the reservoirs without overflowing and therefore damaging the dikes. The structure consists of a culvert, spillway and retaining walls. For each element an MCA was set-up to determine the optimal shape, followed by choosing the design alternative. The design is a trapezoidal spillway, an arched culvert and a retaining wall. <br/><br/>With the optimal design, a conceptual design is constructed. In this conceptual design, the reinforced concrete dimensions and governing load combinations are determined. From this, the strength of the ZAC structure is evaluated in the finite element method program DIANA.<br/><br/>Finally, the final design was created. The conclusion is that the combination of structural elements that have been modelled in the system satisfies the aim to reduce the design rainfall event flood wave enough to avoid flood risk to the downstream areas of Murcia.

Mobility hubs present the opportunity to reshape our cities and mitigate the previously mentioned problems by contributing to a more sustainable and equitable transport system. This thesis defines mobility hubs as places where shared cars, mopeds, and e-bikes are offered to improve connectivity and ameliorate mobility options. Given a limited budget, cities would like to optimize the locations of mobility hubs to maximize benefits. This problem is solved in this thesis by presenting an optimization model that allows the distribution of mobility hubs and allocation of shared cars, mopeds, and e-bikes to maximize social welfare. The algorithm can provide the optimal locations for the hubs and their respective capacity in terms of vehicles, while accounting for multimodal trips. It focuses on maximizing the utility of the population rather than the operators’ profits. The model is divided into several modules: computational modules that calculate the number of people that would like to use a mobility hub; a mathematical optimization module to optimize the capacity, availability, and relocation of shared vehicles; and finally, a genetic algorithm that performs several iterations to find the optimal distribution of hubs. The model developed is applied in a case study for the city of Amsterdam. Several scenarios are performed to assess how the distribution of hubs varies depending on the budget provided to construct them. The results show that having more hubs with a lower number of shared vehicles is more beneficial than having fewer with more vehicles. Areas with higher population density are prioritized when lower budgets are invested in building the hubs. Additionally, the shift towards shared modes and the travel time savings are minimal. The benefits increase considerably when investments lead to complete coverage of the area by the network of mobility hubs. A modal split of 5% for the shared modes is expected when Amsterdam is fully covered by 288 hubs. From an environmental point of view, only 32 % of the shared trips replace trips previously made by car, leading to a limited CO2 emissions reduction of 1.27%. To conclude, the model developed is one of the first models that optimizes the location and capacity of multimodal hubs to maximize social welfare by considering multimodal trips. It has the ability to quantify the benefits of introducing mobility hubs depending on the investments made.","Shared Modes; Mobility Hubs; Mathematical Optimization; Genetic Algorithm; Transport Modelling; Demand-supply Interaction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Transport and Planning","",""

(mentor); Fayolle-Chambe, M.S. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","This thesis project investigates navigational aspects of the upcoming JUICE (JUpiter ICy moons Explorer) mission, which is expected to deliver valuable data products for the scientific study of the Jovian system, and the three Galilean moons Europa, Ganymede and Callisto in particular. One such data product comes from the 3GM radio science payload, which is expected to contribute towards more accurate ephemerides of the Galilean moons and a refined study of their gravity fields. Accurate and reliable acquisition of these data depends greatly on the successful Guidance, Navigation and Control (GNC) operations, where an efficient GNC performance can unlock excess ∆V capabilities. It is the goal of this work to identify statistical ∆V savings from integration of in-mission radio science ephemeris improvements into the GNC operations. The resulting excess ∆V could be used to effectuate one of the mission enhancement and extension options (e.g. coverage of the Jupiter’s mid-high latitudes or a lower-altitude Ganymede orbit), the enablement of which ultimately motivates this thesis project.<br/>A navigational orbit determination (OD) framework was set up, modelled closely after the OD setup from the JUICE mission analysis team. An interface for simulating moon state knowledge updates from external ephemeris products was implemented. This setup was then extended to support a simplified statistical ∆V analysis. The external ephemeris products were modelled using an adopted high-fidelity OD setup with a coupled filter configuration, which simulates the uncertainty of in-mission ephemeris updates from the 3GM radio science data. These results were then used to simulate external ephemeris updates to the navigation OD and to evaluate their impact on the statistical ∆V expenditure.<br/>It was found that external moon ephemerides in general, and the simulated science data based OD solu- tion in particular, are not suitable for reducing the statistical ΔV cost of post-flyby correction manoeuvres. Within one to two encounters of a given flyby body, the nominal (update-free) navigation OD has improved moon state knowledge to a point where it no longer contributes significantly to size of the correction ma- noeuvres. To generate statistical ΔV savings, the moon state knowledge must be improved for the navigation of the mission’s first encounters. It was thus concluded that moon ephemeris improvements should not be provided from JUICE science data, but from observations that have been collected prior to mission. It was furthermore found that due to its extensive coverage, the navigation tracking data captures system informa- tion that the radio science data is less sensitive to. It could therefore be considered in the post-mission efforts to improve the high-accuracy ephemerides of the Galilean moons.","JUICE; Ephemerides; GNC; Statistical Delta-V","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-06-30","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

One option is to mitigate delay propagation in the timetable design by adding buffer time to the minimum difference between the time two successive train of either direction enter a section. It is still common practice to design buffer times based on a deterministic value, decreasing operational capacity and requiring large amount of manual checking by planners. Existing approaches to effectively allocate buffer time in timetables lack flexibility and require an initial timetable. In this paper, a data-driven approach for determination of buffer time planning rules suitable for usage in an initial timetable is presented. These planning rules are not necessarily generic, but rather depend on timetable characteristic. Two metrics that describe delay propagation, mean secondary delay and hindrance percentage, are extracted from literature and predicted in a regression analysis with the use of timetable characteristics related to headway situations of two succeeding trains. The results of the regression analysis on a case study of the Dutch railway network between Haarlem, Leiden Centraal and Schiphol Airport are used to determine the amount of scheduled buffer time that would ensure a certain amount of hindrance percentage given a specific headway situation. The results show that the mean secondary delay and hindrance percentage for various headway situations can both be predicted with an accuracy of 90.7\% based on timetable characteristics and is quite heterogeneous. Mean secondary delay appeared not significantly impacted by the scheduled buffer time, contrary to hindrance percentage which is significantly influenced by the scheduled buffer time.","Railways; Timetable design; Buffer time; Data-driven; Multiple linear regression; Delay propagation; Secondary delay; Hindrance percentage","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Transport, Infrastructure and Logistics","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","class=""MsoNormal"">To encourage climateadaptive building in the Netherlands the Covenant ClimateAdaptive Building (CKAB) was developed by a consortium of stakeholders (Convenant klimaatadaptief bouwen in ZuidHolland, 2018). This nonbinding agreement proposed standards for six (climate) aspects in order to adapt the Netherlands to a changing climate. These standards were first applied in pilots in Haarlemmermeer, Utrecht, Rotterdam (Vlot et al., 2021) and in Dordrecht, where the new residential area of Amstelwijck was planned. Implementing climateadaptive measures ánd standards is yet an innovative process and iterative learning is required to improve this process. We want to know what role standards played in selecting climateadaptive measures in Dordrecht and what result they achieved. This study focused on three climate aspects specifically: heat stress, pluvial flooding and droughts. The case study in Dordrecht was evaluated by means of a stateoftheart hydrological model, UrbanWB. Urban plans of Amstelwijck provided the basis to research applicability of this model as a design and assessment tool (i). The goal of this method was to improve the integral understanding of the complexity and interrelations of a (hydrological) system for designers and policymakers, which would allow them to make better choices. Additionally, this same model was used to assess uncertainty in design, engineering and climate (ii). A quantification was made for the relative relevance of design choices, such as decreasing paved surfaces, local conditions, such as soil type or drainage velocities, and climate change, with increased evaporation, precipitation and extremes. Additionally, CKAB standards and the process of applying them in Amstelwijck was researched (iii). Two groups of stakeholders, goal oriented (Municipality of Dordrecht, WSHD &amp; hired staff) and user oriented (project developers &amp; hired staff), were identified and these groups were interviewed with the goal of learning what kind of standards encourage climate adaptation and finding where barriers or enablers exist. This was done with the help of the concept of user centred design (Long et al., 2016), inspiring the stakeholder groups and a division into standards focused on goals or means, and the concepts of principle/rulebased approach (Nakpodia et al., 2016) and creative freedom/specification (Frei and Di Marzo Serugendo, 2011). With this research it could be concluded that UrbanWB can help designers by providing arguments for design choices, which was mentioned as an enabler in interviews. The model touched on interconnectivity between different climate aspects and five model indicators were identified to compare the performance of different plans. For assessment purposes no major improvements were made yet compared to models commonly employed, except that this method offers potential for a tool, which is easytoadopt. By verification with other models this should become more clear. The model architecture was found to be less suitable for assessing urban plans on heat stress and to a lesser extent drought, but proved valuable for pluvial flooding. On uncertainty three important notions were made: climate change is a significant uncertainty; local conditions are decisive for the ’robustness’, ability to perform under different conditions, of an urban system; design choices can have large effects on the hydrology of the system, some are effective enough to deal with climate change. The type of soil was found to be a decisive factor for every climate aspect. It is reaffirmed in interviews and focus groups that local conditions could be listed as a possible theme in the process of climate adaptation. In working with CKAB standards for the first two parts of this research ideas about the way of description, direction and commitment of standards were already formed, but the interview analysis affirmed and strengthened this view. Ideal standards should be specific, focused on goals and rulebased, but principles are leading and exceptions should be allowed to ensure creative freedom, which is important in an innovative process. Designers, policy makers and engineers could apply the methodology used in this study to promote climate adaptation and deal with the uncertainty brought by climate change. The results of this research emphasized the importance of integral thinking in design and lawmaking, since this provides more insight and argumentation for selecting climateadaptive measures A perception that standards should be focused on goals instead of means is crucial to directing urban developments.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

AI computing is rapidly becoming more expensive, calling for a change in design philosophy. We consider both training and inference of neural networks used for image vision; to reveal energy-efficient practices in an exploratory fashion.<br/><br/>First of all, we examine a modern algorithm for hyperparameter optimisation and compare this to two baseline methods. We find that the baseline algorithms perform considerably worse despite their wide usage and argue that they should not be used when training large models. Furthermore, we look at the layer structure of convolutional networks and conclude that the convolutional layers have the largest influence on the total consumption. We report increases of up to 95% with only marginal improvements in accuracy. Therefore we recommend developers to reduce their network architectures as long as the performance stays within a reasonable margin. <br/><br/>Second, we present a study focused on the inference phase of the deep learning pipeline. We look at the effect of batching for image classification requests. To facilitate the data collection, we make use of a simulated queue and the Pytorch framework. We find that batching has a significant impact on the energy consumption, but the magnitude of this impact can vary a lot for different models. Our recommendation is to treat the batch size as an inference parameter that needs to be tuned first. Additionally, we highlight how the energy consumption of image vision networks has evolved over the past decade. Presenting the findings together with the performance of these networks shows a steady, upward energy trend accompanied by a decreasing slope for the accuracy. The only exception is the model ShuffleNetV2. We mention the design principles that went into the development of this network and present it as a start for future research.","Green AI; Software Engineering; Hyperparameter Optimization; Image Classification","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science","",""

The aerodynamic tools used for this study are a steady panel method (APAME) and Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes simulations using a k-ω SST turbulence model (OpenFOAM).

(mentor); Vanbellingen, Tim (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Parkinson’s Disease (PD) is one of the most common neuro-degenerative diseases worldwide, affecting patients’ ability to perform Activities of Daily Living (ADL), such as cooking and dressing, and consequently decreasing Quality of Life (QoL). Most ADL require dexterous skills which are often impaired in PD. Pharmacological therapy is often not completely effective and hasside effects. Tailored and engaging rehabilitation interventions aimed at practicing such dexterous ADL are therefore necessary at different stages of the disease. Besides the traditional physical and occupational interventions, Virtual Reality (VR) technology has proven a viable tool to facilitate such rehabilitation programs by providing flexibility in design and simultaneously creating pleasant and immersive environments. It is suggested that implementing haptic feedback into a Virtual Environment (VE) could further boost motor learning during training and improve patients’ compliance to the practise. Till date, haptic feedback during VR training, has not been evaluated in PD. The purpose of the present study was twofold. First, a novel VR haptic glove system, consisting of existing VRFree gloves integrated with a Haptic Device (HD) to provide Vibrotactile Feedback (VTF) throuh the use of Linear Resonant Actuators (LRA)s, was developed. This newly developed system was then technically tested with regard to its latency, intensities and compatibility. Second, the system was evaluated on its performance and usability in both healthy subjects and PD patients by means of a novel VR grasping task. Technical tests yielded positive results; a latency of 13 +- 12 ms is found, the HD is able to convey different intensities and the HD produces no visually noticed interference with the VRFree gloves. The user tests revealed positive results on increased grasp performance with the VTF in terms of grasp time and smoothness among healthy subjects and a good Haptic Experience (HX) evaluation among all subjects. An average System Usability Scale (SUS) score of 75 suggest good usability of the overall system. This usability study demonstrates for the first time that VTF on the fingertips during VR rehabilitation is feasible to train dexterity related ADL in PD. Further studies will be needed to evaluate its value as a rehabilitation tool to improve QoL in PD.","Vibro-tactile feedback; Virtual Reality; Parkinson's Disease; Rehabilitation; Dexterity; Haptics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Mechatronic System Design (MSD)","",""

This transition brings multiple challenges and requires new behaviours. However, in current design practice, the focus lies on products and materials, not on the required circular behaviours. <br/><br/>The goal of this research is to describe the relation between design and circular behaviour. To do so, a flexible analytical framework is created based on a literature study, which can be used to perform an empirical study in any context for any behaviour. The applicability of the framework is tested in this initial exploratory research of which the scope is focused on the circular behaviours of Reuse and Recycle Materials of students living in student housing complexes. The framework is filled in with document analysis on the context and semi-structured interviews with the inhabitants of the cases. <br/><br/>The results show that a design has influence on behaviour. A design can make behaviour impossible by having a negative influence on one or more of the three categories of the COM-B theory. A design can also make a behaviour possible, by changing the categories that are negative into positive. In between the two extremes of possible and impossible there is also the degree of the categories that influence behaviours. Someone could be able to show behaviour, but if it takes too much effort the person can refrain from showing the behaviour. If there is a high degree of capability and opportunity, it can motivate a person to show the behaviour, and likewise a low degree can demotivate. Therefore a design should strive to have a high degree of capability and opportunity for a behaviour that is desired. <br/><br/>However, it must be noted that behaviour is a complex phenomenon with a multitude of factors that influence it, both conscious and unconscious. It is difficult to map all the different factors for every person. Not all factors are related to a design, there are also beliefs and values which have a major influence in behaviour.","circularity; behaviour; design; User-centered; reuse; recycle; student housing; COM-B; choice architecture","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Management in the Built Environment","",""

The aim of the project is to design a displacement interferometer using non-polarizing light to meet the requirements and be cost-effective. The design is challenging considering the requirements of 350 mm measurement range, 300 µrad angular range and less than 1 nm periodical non-linearity (PNL) error.<br/><br/>This thesis analyzes all the design requirements first. To fulfill the requirements, efficient design strategies are clarified, and the phase detection method is determined. <br/><br/>Three interferometer designs are investigated and developed in this thesis. The design concepts are collected from ASML internal references. Mathematical models are built to represent the optics and trace the light in each interferometer. Optimization tools are developed to solve and tune the parameters that fulfill all the dimension-related requirements. Geometrical optics simulations are performed to verify the mathematical models and the optimization results. The source and behavior of PNL error in each interferometer are carefully researched. In a design with lenses, sequential mode simulations are performed to calculate the wavefront error. Further calculations based on the wavefront error indicate this interferometer design is not feasible.<br/><br/>Based on the theoretical analysis two interferometer designs can fulfill all the requirements. These two interferometers are built in the cleanroom with off-the-shelf parts to validate the working principle and PNL errors.

In this research an Excel tool is developed based on an existing CO2 calculation tool created by Partners for Innovation where reduction in volume is taken into account for the environmental calculation of the transportation processes. A factor of reduction of volume is created, which describes to what extent the packaging nests or folds when empty. Next, a calculation is performed that states whether and how many extra trips are needed because of inefficient stacking, or how many trips are saved because of efficient stacking. All of the aforementioned data is used to create a final factor which is in turn multiplied by the amount of ton kilometre in the original calculation. Applying data of fictitious scenarios to the tool shows that the new calculation gives a more precise result regarding CO2 emissions. Furthermore, it shows that nesting of packagings makes a significant positive impact on the CO2 emission as it reduces the number of trips needed to transport the packagings.

(mentor); Vande Putte, H.J.M. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","The housing market in the Netherlands faces two challenges which are the housing shortage and the climate crisis. Modular construction can help solve these challenges due to the many advantages that modular construction has over traditional construction. The advantages that are most related to solving these challenges are the reduced construction time, reduced waste production, reduced transportation movements and the reusability of modules. On top of these advantages modular construction offers many more advantages over traditional construction such as reduced construction cost, reduced failure cost, increased quality, increased worker safety, reduced disturbance for neighbouring buildings and reduced need for traditional labour. Despite all these advantages, the uptake of modular construction is still quite low, mainly due to three problems. The summary of these problems comes down to that there is a lack of knowledge about how to implement modular construction properly, so that the advantages of modular construction can be realised. Therefore, in this graduation research, recommendations will be given on how modular construction can be implemented better so that modular construction performs well. To do this, the following main question has been used: “What is the current performance of 3D modular multistorey student accommodations in the Netherlands and how can this performance be increased?”. As the research question says, this research will focus on 3D modular construction that is used for multistorey student accommodations in the Netherlands. This research will include theoretical review, a performance measurement of modular buildings and recommendations to improve this measured performance for future modular buildings. The theoretical review forms the basis for this entire research, as it gives knowledge to the state of the art about 3D modular construction. The performance measurement considers the objectives of the entire built environment and the student housing association DUWO. Based on these objectives the performance of three modular student accommodations will be measured. The final product of this research will be to give recommendations about how the measured performance of the modular buildings can be increased. These recommendations are based on interviews with experienced stakeholders, combined with the theoretical review.","3D modular construction; performance; advantages; obstructions; student accommodations","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","",""

(mentor); Huesken, L.M. (graduation committee); van Galen, T (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","For most countries, the targets set in the sustainable development goals for 2030 are far from being met. The main cause is a lack of financing, due to the relatively high risks and low rewards associated with sustainable projects. This has caused a financing gap in developing countries of upwards of 2.5 trillion US$ annually, equal to 3% of global GDP. These unattractive aspects of sustainable investment projects result in a lack of private investment, leaving public investment as the main source of funding for these projects. A vital area within the financing gap is the lack of financing for SMEs in developing countries, which are important for economic growth and job creation. The issues faced by these countries and especially SMEs have been compounded by the COVID 19 pandemic, which has claimed countless lives, but also countless jobs in developing countries and has caused extensive economic damage. In this light, achieving impact on SDG 8: ‘Decent Work and Economic Growth’ was deemed critical for the whole of sustainable development. <br/><br/>Recently, blended finance, an investment type utilizing public and philanthropic capital to accelerate private investments, has become more popular. However, effective practices of using blended finance to foster job creation in developing countries through SME financing are lacking. Furthermore, there is little to no literature on investment decisions that goes into selecting projects for blended finance. In this light, this research aims to answer the following question: “What are effective practices and key investment decisions in using blended finance to fund SMEs in developing countries, focusing on impact towards achieving SDG8?<br/><br/>To answer this question, a literature review of the concept of sustainable development, sustainable financing methods and the role of SMEs in the developing countries was conducted. This highlighted the potential of blended finance when compared to other sustainable financing methods in being able to aid these SMEs and impact SDG 8. Afterwards, a data analysis of the performance of recent SME financing projects in developing countries, as well as a case study consisting of interviews with blended finance investment experts was conducted, in order to find effective practices of financing SMEs in developing countries to facilitate the targets set by in SDG8 and highlight how investment decisions are (to be) taken when considering blended finance projects. <br/><br/>It was found that even though the projects in lower-income countries within the could have stronger performance, a balance has to be struck between projects in these countries and those in slightly less low-income countries, in order to achieve consistent results. Furthermore, the use of public loan guarantees seems like a promising method but is currently suffering from a lack of willingness by banks to engage in blended finance transactions, due to solvency issues and general lower risk appetite and unfamiliarity with the methodology. <br/><br/>Furthermore, key investment decisions from an investor perspective lie in the specific business case of the project and whether the investment is ‘additional’ to the market. Furthermore, the attitude and capabilities of the entrepreneur behind the project are essential, as investors prefer projects in which the entrepreneur has enough skin in the game and is open to collaboration with a multitude of investors, such that one investor does not have to bear all the risks. Furthermore, it is important for investors to balance impact with financial performance, as only achieving impact through risky projects is not a sustainable business practice. More investment decisions could be made in the future if more and different blended finance methodologies would become more readily available. However, many of these, such as higher-leverage loan guarantees and first loss guarantees, are hampered by a lack of willingness again of private credit suppliers to engage in these transactions with public blended finance institutions. Furthermore, larger fund sizes would help investor diversity more, and thereby reach a wider range of projects and achieve more universal impact. <br/><br/>Therefore, it is recommended that if blended finance investments globally were to be expanded, that policy makers such as the UN, local governments, and the World Bank find ways to increase awareness of private credit suppliers and for them engage in more blended finance transactions. Furthermore, concrete law and regulation changes should be considered to the use of collateral, both physical and non-physical, by SMEs in developing countries, as to ensure SMEs will become more capable of engaging in loans with banks, which could then be supported by public investors in various blended finance arrangements. It is finally recommended that further research is done on this topic, especially at a larger scale and perhaps slightly into the future, when more projects will have been completed and therefore results will have become clearer. This could further explore the effectiveness of blended finance compared to other investment methods, and if found to be more effective, convey this to private parties. If these measures are to be taken and the knowledge on blended finance is expanded, it stands to reason that blended finance could be one of the tools to reduce the investment gap in sustainable development and aid in the creation of jobs in developing countries, where people need these most. <br","Blended Finance; SDG 8; Sustainability; Developing countries; Data Analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","",""

Therefore, a modular design method is proposed for generating form-active spatial structures out of stackable blocks of a few types, having in mind its potential applications such as housing. Instead of shells, spatial masonry structures are thus the main consideration in the design process considering building on top of a vaulted ceiling. By designing a 3D interlocking grid and introducing a four-step topological design that is coupled with structural verification processes based on finite element modelling and discrete element modelling simulations, the geometry of interlocking stackable modular blocks can be automatically generated for constructing such spatial masonry structures. The proposed method ensures that the designed vaults are modular, reconfigurable, and self-supporting during construction, thus increasing the efficiency of mass production while allowing for combinatorial mass customization in designs.","3D Tessellation; Stereotomy; Modular Vaulting; Funicular Shell; Form Finding; Masonry Construction; Structural behaviour; Assembly of interlocked element; Reconfigurable buildings","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-09-01","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Building Technology","",""

This research focuses on the Global South taking Kenya as a single case study to investigate the following research question: How can NGOs support local stakeholders in Kenya to shift the production of affordable housing by the use of circular materials and methods? This research design was conducted through a double-diamond framework, and data was collected in a qualitative manner. The objective is to understand housing practices in the local market to seek alternatives to shift affordable housing development into circular practices. By these means, this research attempts to provide information on the processes of support that NGOs can give to implement circular materials and methods in housing, strategies to create acceptance and adaptation of these materials in the local market and the ways to create economic and social value through circularity in the built environment. A comprehensive literature review was made to develop a foundation of knowledge for the empirical study. <br/><br/>Furthermore, as a result of the empirical study and the triangulation of data between the literature review and the research findings, a guideline for NGOs to help local stakeholders shift to circularity was created. The output of this study endeavours to develop an understanding of how the demand and the supply of circular materials and methods need to be tackled to be able to disseminate circularity in the local built environment and create the shift towards the use of these innovations and new building practices.

The Palace remains like a parasite of a larger introverted structure that fortifies an entire urban block to hide the offices of the National Bank of Belgium. The architectural brief for this graduation project requests the renovation of the headquarters concerning the vacancy of office space with the greater intention of opening up the National Bank as an institution. To the light of this brief, this architectural thesis departs from the premise that in order for the Bank to open up it must get engaged in the problems of its nearby reality, the problems of the city of Brussels. <br/><br/>The in depth analysis of the history of urban transformation of the city of Brussels led by land speculation, revealed the problems of the Central European capital cities during the second half of the 19th century, which have been unavoidably inherited by the city of the 21st century. The process of urban gentrification of the historic town, firstly by pushing out the working classes to the periphery in favour of the wealthy bourgeois and secondly exploiting land value financially erasing any hint of residential life from the old city at the heart of Brussels’ Pentagon. The result of these consecutive processes of urban transformation can be read in space through the architectural typology of Brussels and have been explained in this research by means of the alley, the shopping arcade, the corner building and the blocks of Brusselization. Understanding them not only as architectural devices but also as urban figures has helped untangling the history of urban gentrification in Brussels which constructed through time a division between the rich bureaucratic upper eastern city and the working class neighbourhoods in lower western Brussels, articulated by a touristic uninhabited historic city where the National Bank of Belgium sits. <br/>More than anywhere else, Bd Berlaimont and the building of the NBB are examples of this urban transformation that has emptied from the residential life of this area of Brussels. In a process that anticipated Brusselization, the NBB made sure to erase a mixed block where housing and retail used to make a piece of the city to turn it into a monolithic impenetrable office block. This essential aspect of the site, together with the research make a project with three fundamental intentions: <br/><br/> - Create a public route able to establish another point of connection between upper and lower Brussels, increasing the porosity of the city and the permeability of an existing urban structure. <br/> - Reprogram the block to revert the process of Brusselization and erode its monolithic nature through the introduction of residential and retail functions. <br/> - Maximise the value of the land property which is currently owned by the NBB to launch a program of affordable housing capable of setting a starting point to revert the process of gentrification and land speculation that has historically threatened the process of urban transformation of the city. <br/><br/>These three points become the nexus between the conclusions of the research and the design decisions that followed the P2 and P3 examinations. Therefore the final design proposal is concerned with each of these aspects, from the scale of the building mass and how it is oriented towards the city, to the scale of a service staircase that tries to create a partition situation between two different programs embedded in the block. <br/><br/>Ultimately, the project envisions an urban transformation led by the National Bank of Belgium where the use of land property, the State of the Bank, is key to face land speculation and control housing prices. The unavoidable typology of Brussels, (impasse, arcade and corner building) builds a city within the ruin of the Palace of the National Bank of Belgium. <br","Typology; Brussels; Bank; Palace; Renovation; City; Ruin; Transformation; Existing structure; Public interior; Public Estate; porosity","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Interiors Buildings Cities","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","The brief of this year ‘s studio is to address the the transformation of the National Bank of Belgium located in Brussels. However, since its completion, there has been a fundamental shift in the requirements placed upon it. Industrial functions like the printing and storage of currency have been relocatedout of the city, or overseas; finance is becoming increasingly digital; while Belgium’s membership of the EU has led to much of the Bank’s traditional role being subsumed into the European Central Bank (ECB), based in Frankfurt. In response, the National Bank has decided to redefine itself physically. <br/><br/>As an architecture student, I am more prone to understanding the correlation between the social issues happening at the moment and the architecture. Social impacts of the transformation of the bank and its potentials to become a social role in the city are valuable to be explored. Other than that, it is crucial to find out the social relations between the bank and the public, also within the bank, so as to deliver a design proposal that can address the current social issues in the city while the bank itself can benefit from the renovation.<br/><br/>Starting from 1985, the international young immigration has surpassed internal outflow of the city, Brussels and they become the main reason of population growth, causing the rejuvenation of the population at the same time. However, the availability of affordable private housing and social housing is not able to support the growth and it turned out that suburbanization of young generation happened.<br/><br/>Due to the impacts of suburbanization, the socio-economic and cultural geographic patterns have created boundaries between communities living side by side with little interaction, causing intense hierarchy of social structure. This kind of social segregation poses a challenge to the long-term viability of the city.<br/>Meanwhile, the social relations and structure within the bank is another issue to be tackled with. The conventional office design of the bank has caused little communication and interaction between staff, leading the bank itself to become a complete introvert that is unable to engage with the public properly.<br/><br/>Therefore, it is a good opportunity for the National Bank of Belgium, an institution with the image of authority to take up a social role of challenging the current social structure of the city and eliminating the boundaries between communities in a way that the future generation and the bank itself can be benefitted from its renovation. <br/><br/><br","Social structure; Occupancy; working hierarchy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Interiors Buildings Cities","",""
