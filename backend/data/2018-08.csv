The problem description is the following: Companies executing EPC projects in energy and chemicals industry encounter bottlenecks in effectively implementing project strategy. Based on this a research question is formulated: How can best practices related to strategy improve project strategy implementation in an EPC company? The main research objective is to explore the best practices to improve project strategy implementation within EPC projects. This research is divided into three phases. In the first phase, literature review is conducted to a) gain insight and understanding into the practices of implementation of project strategy, b) to understand the impact of the main aspects on project strategy and its implementation and c) provide a guideline for protocols for interviews in the second phase. The following ten aspects as influential in implementation of project strategy have been determined: communication, tools &amp; methods, resources, recognition, benefits, structure, culture, leadership, decisions and actions. In the second phase, 7 project managers and project directors of Fluor Corporation, all subject-matter experts in project execution in the EPC industry, were interviewed. The interviews have been performed to understand the practice of implementing project strategy in an EPC project, resulting in the following list of main issues with implementation of project strategy; global office communication, shared understanding, strategy-operation alignment, and bottom-up ownership. In the ultimate phase (third) suitable best practices (tools and techniques) were selected to counter the main 4 issues based on an extensive literature study. These are as follows: planned communication, scrum, gamification, dialogue-mapping, balanced scorecard, informal leadership, and client-centric team development.","Project strategy; Best practices; Project Management; Shared understanding; Global office communication; Strategy operation alignment; Bottom-up ownership","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, for Dutch municipalities this means more responsibilities with less resources and consequently a different, more collaborative way of working. Moreover, it creates a participation society where municipalities have to rely more on the self-reliance of their citizens (Gemeente Etten-Leur, 2014). Municipalities are therefore often looking for ways to improve the social cohesion in neighbourhoods (Steenhuis, 2010). This is where Eco-Units wants to make a difference. Eco-Units is a social enterprise that explores the opportunities of reusing shipping containers in the public outdoor space. The concept that is explored in this project is to develop a container (meeting place) that improves the social cohesion in neighbourhoods. Social cohesion is often a romantic view of villages in the past, where everybody knew each other and took care of each other. Therefore, social cohesion is better defined in this thesis. It does not only refer to the horizontal interaction (among groups and individuals in society), but also to the vertical interaction (between government and society). These interactions can be characterized by for example the participation of individuals (J. Chan, To &amp; E. Chan, 2006). From (field) research in the first phase, it was concluded that there is not one prefabricated solution for all cities and neighbourhoods, because improving the social cohesion asks for a different strategy in every neighbourhood. So, the design goal was specified as: designing a development tool kit for Eco-Units to be able to develop a Unit that stimulates social cohesion in disadvantaged neighbourhoods, in co-creation with local stakeholders and citizens. Therefore, a framework was developed that shows the step that are necessary to develop a container that stimulates social cohesion. Different stakeholders are involved from the start and for citizens a feeling of ownership of the Eco-Unit will be created in the process. The framework starts by finding the right stakeholders to collaborate with and creating trust between these stakeholders. The next phase it to create trust between the stakeholders and citizens, by involving the citizens in the design process. First needs of citizens are identified and then the actual Eco-Unit is co-designed. In the last phase citizens will get more responsibilities and therefore trust is created between citizens. The framework visualises the steps that are needed.From the proposed framework, a tool kit was developed. Each step has its own tool or a list of recommendations to carry out the step. The tools were prototyped and the tools for step 2 and step 5 were tested. Moreover, the tools were discussed with Eco-Units. Lastly, suggestions have been made on to better define the corporate identity.","Social cohesion; Tool kit; Liveability; Co-creation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","","",""

Field data suggests that hydraulic fracture processes are directly or indirectly related to this injectivity decline. Conventional fracture theories do not apply to unconsolidated sand since this material has little to no cohesion and tensile strength. The main fracture mechanism hypotheses are shear failure of the zone ahead of the fracture tip and fluidization. For both mechanisms, a fluid pressure high enough to initiate and propagate the fracture is required. The fluid pressure is dependent on the injection rate, fluid viscosity and permeability of the formation. Unconsolidated sands have a high permeability, thus under normal waterflood conditions a high injection pressure is not expected. Three main impairment mechanisms leading to the injectivity decline have been identified based on field evidence and previous work:<br/><br/>-Plugging<br/>-Wellbore fill<br/>-Resorting of grains and finer particles<br/><br/>Plugging results from the infiltration of fines originating from the injection fluid, crossflow or drilling mud. The external and/or internal filter cake can locally reduce the permeability of the formation. During surface shut-ins, backflow and/or crossflow can occur leading to the infiltration of solid particles and fluids into the wellbore. This reduces the leak-off area of the well. Lastly, resorting of grains and finer particles can result in a denser packing of the reservoir. The dynamically mixing of particles can lead to lower permeability regions.<br/><br/><b>Research goal</b><br/>The main goal of this research is to develop a better qualitative and quantitative description of the fracturing process and the impairment mechanisms causing the observed injectivity decline. This thesis comprises of the first phase of this research, focusing on the capabilities of the equipment to create and detect fractures under waterflooding conditions. What makes this research unique is the use of low viscosity fluids, to mimic field conditions. Other work often involves the use of efficient fracturing fluids that have a high viscosity and/or good filter cake building capabilities to minimalize the leak-off. Next to that, injection of fluids is performed live in a CT scanner. This allows the visualization of fractures or low-density regions through density distributions in three dimensions over time.<br/><b>Equipment</b><br/>Injection takes place in a high-strength aluminium vessel with a sample volume of 3.84 dm3. See images 2.1 and 2.2 of an overview of the setup and pressure vessel. Axial and radial pressure can be controlled independently up to 20 MPa. A pore fluid system records the outflow mass and provides a fluid pressure on the sample. The sample consists of a very fine, very well sorted sand with a permeability around 5 Darcy. The main injection fluids are water and Fluorinert FC-770. This is a high density, low viscosity fluid that is used to visualize the preferential flow path of the injection fluid in the CT scanner.<br/><b>Results</b><br/>Fractures have been successfully created using a high viscosity fluid during the first experiment. The goal of that experiment was to test the setup and the equipment. The fractures were created at an injection pressure of 38 MPa and were up to 1 cm long and 2 mm wide. Experiments 2 and 3 were performed in the CT scanner with the use of Fluorinert as the injection fluid. The infiltration zone of this fluid was clearly visible but no fractures were created. Sand infiltration in the injection tube leaded to a number of problems during the experiments. Experiments 4 and 5 added fines to the injection water. Quartz powder was used in experiment 4 and bone meal in experiment 5. The fines leaded to a gradual increase in injection pressure, but did not lead to a higher density in the CT scans. No fractures were observed but low-density regions in front of the perforations were created during both experiments as a result of backflow. Experiment 6 introduced the use of internal pressure sensors in the sample and used a sample created with two sands and Kaolinite, a non-swelling clay. During two high flowrate injection cycles, the clays migrated away from the near wellbore region, leaving behind lower density regions.<br/><b>Conclusion &amp; future work</b><br/>Creating fractures with low viscosity fluids in a laboratory environment has proven to be difficult. No fractures have been created throughout the low viscosity experiments. Several impairment mechanisms that were identified in the field have also been observed in the experiments. This thesis forms a solid basis for the next research phase to investigate these impairment mechanisms more closely. By lowering the confining stresses, increasing the flow rates and decreasing the sample permeability, there is a good probability that fractures can be created with this equipment in future work. <br","Hydraulic fractures; Unconsolidated sand; Injectivity decline","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Whether the user is looking to compare online prices for products, searching for new movies to watch or music to listen, the available information at hand exceeds the amount of information which the user wants to consider before making a choice. For this, various recommendation systems have been developed. Primarily, the recommendations made by these recommendations systems have been evaluated based on their accuracy. More recent research has begun evaluating the subjective perception of the recommendations and has developed additional attributes such as diversity and novelty to evaluate recommendation systems. However, the impact of such attributes on actual user satisfaction has been explored less. Recent research has seen an increase in evaluating other aspects of recommendation systems such as recommendation interfaces. Nonetheless, very limited work has been done in terms of recommendation system interfaces to improve the perceived quality of the recommendations and overall user satisfaction.<br/><br/>This master thesis introduces and evaluates a novel interface, MovieTweeters. It is a movie recommendation system which incorporates social information with a traditional recommendation algorithm to generate recommendations for users. Few previous studies have investigated the influence of using social information in interactive interfaces to improve the novelty of recommendations. To address this gap, we investigate whether social information can be incorporated effectively into an interactive interface to improve recommendation novelty and user satisfaction. Our initial results suggest that such an interactive interface does indeed helps users discover more novel items. Also, we observed users who perceived that they discovered more novel and diverse items reported increased levels of user satisfaction. Surprisingly, we observed that even though we successfully were able to increase the system diversity of the recommendations, it had a negative correlation with users perception of novelty and diversity of the items highlighting the importance of improved user-centered approaches.","Social Recommendation Systems; Interactive User Interfaces; User Satisfaction; Novelty; Diversity","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To start off, both literature and empirical research have been conducted on teenagers who are pregnant in the Netherlands in order to understand (1) who we are talking about, (2) what their current situation is and (3) what needs and values can be identified within this target group. Literature was found on the professional perspective of teenage pregnancies. Subsequently, three professionals in the field have been interviewed among which an author of a paper. This research identified many contextual factors that the target group has to deal with. These context factors leave them clueless &amp; indecisive and affect their self-esteem &amp; self-efficacy. Their resilience, however, is strong and they are willing to do what is best for their unborn child. A context mapping research was done to gain deeply rooted information from the target group itself. Sensitising booklets gave clear insights into their daily life and their behaviour towards food. Subsequently, generative sessions were held that provided insights in their underlying values and needs; e.g. the status of being a mother, not to be perceived as less, a need for peers and daily activities. In addition, literature research was conducted on food behaviour and behavioural change. Based on the findings in the conducted researches, a list with twenty design guidelines was established together with the following design goal: ‘To create a set of experiences that engages young mothers-to-be to mature towards a healthy nutritional lifestyle during pregnancy’. This design goal was enhanced with a clear interaction vision and personas that visually characterise the target group. The design process started off with a brainstorm session after which a design direction was chosen. This evolved into the initial concept of a gamified idea of a ‘cookbook learning calendar’ consisting out of challenges. The goal of the game is simple: to complete all challenges and to get a hold of all items. Simultaneously, the user gains knowledge and skills about making healthy food choices. During each challenge, players gain knowledge about a nutritionally related subject and are provided with physical items to apply the newly gained knowledge to. The catch in this game is that the user needs the other players to continue to the next challenge. Aspects of this concept were further elaborated through several interventions; looking at the overall concept, its interactions and the design &amp; content of all components. Hence, “HelloPreggo!” has been created.An interactive prototype was used to evaluate the concept. For this evaluation, a usage scenario movie has been created. This showcased the intended interactions to which the target group has responded. Subsequently, the different components of the concept have been evaluated. Attention has been given towards the implementation of the concept. The business model canvas was used to display the complete network behind “HelloPreggo!”, looking at two different cases; as a stand-alone organisation and complementary to an existing organisation. The closing chapter of this thesis finalises this report with a conclusion, limitations and recommendations of the concept for future research and development.","Health; Nutrition; Teenagers; Pregnancy; Behaviour change","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","Design Aesthetics","",""

It is the first mega nourishment in the world comprising of 21.5 Mm<sup>3</sup> of sediment. There is a large difference between the predictions of the dune growth (25 ha in 20 years) and the actual measurements (1 ha in 4 years). Therefore a more advanced method is needed to predict the dune growth due to the Sand Engine. At the Sand Engine the aeolian sediment transport is determined by the availability limiting processes, e.g. sediment sorting and hydraulic mixing, instead of the wind transporting capacity. AeoLiS is a model that calculates the aeolian sediment transport based on the availability limiting processes. From a sediment budget analysis at the Sand Engine it can be concluded that 58% of all sediments deposited in the dunes originate from the low lying beaches that are regularly reworked by waves. For this reason a model is needed that takes the interaction between both the aeolian and hydrodynamic processes into account.<br/><br/>An Integrated Hydro- Aeolian- Morphodynamic (IHAM) model is used to combine the two processes. The main objective of this research is to verify and applicate the IHAM model applied at the Sand Engine (approx. 8 km of coastline). The IHAM model uses AeoLiS for the aeolian sediment transport, Delft3D Flexible Mesh (FM) for the subaqueous sediment transport and SWAN for the wave transformation calculation. The variables that are exchanged are the wave height calculated by SWAN, the water level calculated by FM and the bed level changes calculated by AeoLiS and FM. When an aeolian and hydrodynamic model are integrated there is a mixed area in which both models are relevant. An additional calibration is required on this mixed area. <br/><br/>If the IHAM model applied at the Sand Engine is compared to the measurements available between 2011 - 2016 a total Brier Skill Score of 0.8 is obtained, which is judged as ‘excellent' according to the classification of Sutherland2004. Especially the tip of the peninsula and the area just north of the tip show large morphological activity that are accurately modelled by the IHAM model. However, the modelled areas south of the Sand Engine and the adjacent coastal areas show larger differences. Overall, the dune growth prediction of the IHAM model compares very well with the measured dune growth between 2012 - 2015. The measured dune growth varies between 14 - 19 m<sup>3</sup>/m/yr, while the IHAM model computes an average dune growth of 14 m<sup>3</sup>/m/yr.<br/><br/>If the dune growth prediction of the AeoLiS standalone model is compared to the IHAM model a 3 times smaller dune growth prediction is obtained. For the IHAM model an additional transport from the mixed area towards the dunes is taken into account, due to the inclusion of waves and surge levels, which results in a much better dune growth prediction. Emphasising the need to integrate aeolian and hydrodynamic models. <br/><br/>If the IHAM model, applied at the Sand Engine, is extended to a period of 10 years by repeating the boundary conditions of the first 5 years the IHAM model shows reliable dune growth predictions. After approximately 10 years the IHAM model shows excessive erosion and can no longer be applied. If the IHAM model is applied at the entire Delfland coast, the dune growth prediction of 11 m<sup>3</sup>/m/yr is close to the measured dune growth of 7.5 ±2 m<sup>3</sup>/m/yr. However, excessive erosion is observed at the coastal areas away from the Sand Engine.<br/><br/>During the final stage of this thesis it became apparent that the excessive erosion is most likely due to a bug in the bed load transport calculation of FM. The bed load and suspended load transport are in balance at the adjacent coastal areas, resulting in a more or less stable coastline location. At the Sand Engine this balance results in erosion of the peninsula. Therefore a possible bug in FM that undermines the balance and results in erosion, will have a larger influence on the adjacent coastal areas than on the Sand Engine. Despite the bug in FM the IHAM model results of the Sand Engine are very well aligned with the measurements of the first 5 years and show reliable predictions for approximately 10 years. When the bug is fixed the IHAM model will most likely be able to show accurate model results for the entire Delfland coast and for simulation periods longer than 10 years.<br","Sand Engine; AeoLiS; Delft3D-FM; dune growth; Prediction; Integrated model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Both city areas are reliant on wind and solar electricity, and use Battery Electric Vehicle(s) (BEV) and Fuel Cell Electric Vehicle(s) (FCEV) as backup electricity plants. The energy systems include fully electric energy consumption of buildings and road transport in both the residential and services sector, for two scenarios: the near future (2020) and mid century scenario (2050).<br/><br/>Surplus electricity from the grid is stored in BEVs or converted into hydrogen which can be stored seasonally in a nearby salt cavern. Deficits of electricity on the grid are covered by Vehicle to Grid (V2G) service of either BEVs or FCEVs via re-electrication of the hydrogen on board. Hydrogen is used as an energy carrier, seasonal energy storage and transport fuel.<br/><br/>Four cases are compared with respect to Total System Cost(s) (TSC) and reliability in a case study. Three cases have solar electricity directly coupled to the building load while all wind electricity is converted to hydrogen. The first case uses only FCEVs in the transport sector and in V2G mode, the second case uses a 50-50 BEV-FCEV passenger car mix, which is the ambition of many European governments, and in the third case a TSC optimization is done to find the cost-optimal BEV-FCEV mix in the two cities. In the fourth case, both the wind<br/>and solar electricity are directly coupled to the building load through a full wind site grid connection. A cost-optimal electricity production mix, and a new cost-optimal BEV-FCEV mix are found.<br/><br/>By using only solar and wind electricity production, seasonal storage in the form of hydrogen and passenger cars as backup-plants, the balance in energy supply and demand in both cities can be obtained. In the near future scenario, no signicant reduction in TSC was found by increasing the share of BEVs for all cases. In the mid century scenario, warm and high solar radiation areas are more cost effective with higher shares of BEVs, while low solar irradiation areas are more cost effective with lower shares of BEVs.

In general, the main issues addressed are: the level of detail of the aggregation of demand, the categorization of demand in different classes and the association of the different demand categories to their specific statistical model. Nowadays, demand planners lack a general procedure to follow while making forecast for future previsions. The main goal of this research is two-folded: the creation of a universal forecasting process that can be both accessible for a managerial perspective and innovative compared to the theoretical works that have been performed until now. In this way managers would not see the forecasting process as a “black box” anymore because one of the main aim is to give accessible and adaptable explications on how different mathematical models can be used according to the market at stake. <br/><br/>The analysis is divided into three main parts: the development of an up-to-date list of forecasting models for future demand is conducted in parallel to the construction of a new market’s demand classification. The results coming from these two first analyses are then linked together through the creation of a decision tree that managers would use to associate each market’s demand category to its specific set of statistical models. Therefore, the main contribution of this research is the development of precise strategies that managers can adopt to improve operational performance when demand is intermitted.<br/>The main sources of information of this study are both the company taken under analysis and the past literature review. Concerning this latter, a lack of a universal view on intermitted demand is highlighted: the issue of classification is still in its infancy phase, the optimization of statistical forecasting methods is still an open topic for researchers and in addition to this when considering demand classification method, the past literature is hardly ever taking into account the different nature of items within an industrial context.<br/> <br/>Accessibility, clarity and completeness are the three main requirements of the support looked for during this research. A prescriptive decision making tree is hence obtained as the final deliverable of this study, in order for the demand planners to take the best decisions during the forecasting journey. The exceptional advantage of this support is that compared to statistical tools where classification’s rules are represented by a group of numbers and formulas, decision trees give a symbolical reproduction of the decision making journey. <br/><br/>The final results highlight that the final model developed in this research performs better in the 59% of the cases under analysis. This research therefore embodies five main contributions to the past literature research: (1) the knowledge theory concerning the forecasting process is brought close to the everyday managerial practice (2) this work strongly contributes to the categorization of the market demand not only from a theoretical perspective but also from a practical one by implementing it in a real industrial case (3) thanks to the clustering of the demand, this research takes into account the different nature of items within the industrial context, (4) forecasting methods are not considered as a “black box” anymore by demand planners and (5) this research creates a holistic support that can help managers during their entire forecasting journey. Finally, conclusive recommendations are given both for future lines of research and for the company at stake.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To address the diverse non-functional requirements arising from many and increasingly more sophisticated users, the community has developed many scheduling policies for MapReduce workloads. Although some individual policies can dynamically optimize for single and stable performance objectives, such as minimizing runtime or cost, or meeting deadlines for realtime-jobs, it seems unlikely that individual policies will remain competitive for increasingly more dynamic workloads and objectives. In contrast, in this work we investigate the ability to dynamically balance performance and cost of a portfolio scheduler for MapReduce workloads. To this end, we design and implement a portfolio scheduling technique, that is, a system capable of adapting to the current workload characteristics and target objectives by periodically evaluating its set of potential policies, and of switching to ""the best"" policy that targets the current system state. We implement and evaluate our system with real-world experiments on a workload containing a mixture of real-time and batch jobs, with the purpose of minimizing deadline violations, while keeping batch job slowdown in check. Our results show that POSUM is a promising alternative: it can predict map task runtimes accurately when calculating average input processing rates, while reduces need a more complex model that accounts for an application-dependent component and variability. However, even without precise predictions, the proposed system can out-perform the individual policies of its portfolio for the combined optimization goal.","MapReduce; portfolio scheduling; data center; prediction; simulation; provisioning and allocation; scheduling policies; Hadoop YARN","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this way, communicating the materials of products is difficult but necessary for online retailing. The consumer cannot directly touch and feel the products, which may lead to disappointment, as the material of the product they ordered may differ from what they thought based on the online information. Internet retailers need to choose suitable solutions for presenting their products online, which is influenced by various and multi-dimensional factors. Therefore, getting a systematic understanding, which is about advantages and disadvantages of different methods for presenting certain products in order to get a correct impression about the material of products on a website, is really necessary for the companies with online retailing demands. <br/><br/>With those considerations, a research starts in the field of online clothing shopping in order to study and deepen the understanding of popularly used presentation methods on web pages for better communicating the materials of products. After the studying of the related researches and 19 popular clothing shopping websites in Europe and China, a experiment with 90 female participants and 12 interviews are conducted to investigate the effects of 5 different combinations of online product presentation methods on consumers' actual and perceived material understanding and further assesses the perceived information and effectiveness of these presentation methods.<br/><br/>The quantitative results from the experiment and the insights are analyzed, summarized and interpreted mutually. Not only have the deep understandings been built for the material perception and better material communication of the selected products, but also the insights and inspirations could be used to for further researches related with online material communication. The advantages and disadvantages of different presentation methods for presenting clothing fabric are compared and interpreted, which comes up with a design guideline for helping the company to present the products online.

The hum is generated by nonlinear interaction of ocean surface waves, radiating acoustic signals in the atmosphere and water (named microbaroms), and coupling to the solid earth as microseisms. The hum can be generated by local near-coastal sources and distant deep ocean sources. Deep oceanic generated 'hum' occurs within the range 0.1-0.3 Hz, dominantly around 0.2 Hz. The near-coastal generated 'hum' occurs at higher frequencies. Microseisms are mainly recorded as surface waves corresponding to near coastal activities. These surface waves overwhelm the weaker deep ocean signals, body and surface waves, because they attenuate less due to the shorter travel path. Previous studies are done with individual 3-component sensors, thus spectral data of all kind of microseisms, or for teleseismic distances only. This study of deep ocean microseisms is done by seismic arrays to analyze regional microseisms. Arrays provide more information about the microseisms by applying beamforming. This enables an improved localization of the source area, in specific near coastal activity or deep ocean generated. To validate the observed results a comparison with the numerical simulated source area is be made. Denote that the use of seismic arrays requires verification on the performance of arrays due to local conditions (sensitivity variances) to find possible deviations regarding the back azimuth. It is shown that, using classical beamforming, the recordings are dominated by near coastal surface waves. Applying adaptive beamforming using multiple signal classification, also other events become visible in the f-k spectrum. Due to this method an improved deep ocean source area is obtained. This observed source area agrees with the simulated source area. Improving the localization requires to define array correction factors.","Ambient noise; Microseisms; Phase distinction; Seismic arrays; Beamforming; Localization; Seismic array corrections; Numerical source modeling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Geophysics","",""

However, vitality in the context of work does not attract much attention and the majority of existing workplace products are productivity-driven for employers’ benefit; this project and its partner OfficeVitae, aim to develop a Vitality Platform to fill in this gap.The project focuses on the millennial employees’ vitality at work as they are becoming the dominant workforce in the near future (Haworth, 2015). Through a series of literature and qualitative user-centric research (contextmapping), a holistic vitality model was formulated including intrapersonal, organizational, contextual and somatic factors. Millennial employees’ vitality at work is fluid and significantly affected by the intrapersonal (e.g. challenge, social interaction, flexibility) and organizational factors (e.g. work-life balance). Work-life balance (harmony) was further identified as the ultimate goal on account of the long-term influence and salient impact on millennial employees. They are seeking the harmony in the fulfillment of work and life achievement (work-life harmony). Then, three vitality directions were formulated accordingly: Pressure Tracker, Macro Management and Life Enrichment. The research phase was concluded with the selected vitality direction “Life Enrichment through drawing new inspirations from colleagues” on account of its positive approach (Social interaction) and the promotion of user agency and mindful person-product interaction (Active participation), which are successful long-term implementing criteria identified from digital health and existing workplace products.In the design phase, four concepts were tested in a Dutch startup company (PHYSEE). The results were accessed by the predefined vitality criteria (e.g. flexibility, social interaction, challenge, relaxation and growth), person-product interaction (Active participation) and the simplicity (Fog, 2009). In addition, the curiosity about colleagues was discovered as a strong intrinsic motivator during the test. Thus, Colleague Observation, answering a non-work-related random question about colleague, was selected for further refinement. Optimized person-product interactions and sustainable motivators (feedback) were explored through iterative research through design. At the end, The Spin Wheel was chosen for optimized interaction and better leveraging motivators (e.g. different difficulty levels of questions). Next, the design goal was reframed -- “A digital platform encouraging millennial employees to explore non-work-related aspects of colleagues with the aim of taking a mental switch from work.”; the interaction should be engaging, curious and relaxed like finding “Where is Waldo?”. The final concept “SpInsight” has three main functions: requesting and answering a random question, proposing a customized question and checking personal record. All the default questions are divided into six categories with different difficulty levels: appearance, belongings, character, experience and customized questions (time-bounded/ non-time-bounded). An interactive prototype was evaluated in four companies. The concept worked in the group of TOPdesk interns and it potentially triggered more face-to-face non-work-related interaction with colleagues, which in turn enhances vitality at work. However, employee participants showed less motivation because of less motivating questions, lack of feedback and trigger. Thus, two focus groups were conducted to clarify the critical long-term motivators. The curiosity about how colleagues perceive oneself was the most powerful spark (Fog, 2009) to enhance the retention (e.g. push notification like “You are mentioned in an answer.”). In general, SpInsight is feasible in a workplace and considered fun and engaging. There are some opportunities could also benefit from its advantage of getting to know people quickly, such as an introduction program in the educational setting. However, how to attract group participation and sustain millennial employees’ interest and motivations over time requires further research and evaluation on different working context (e.g. company scale, department, the stage of group development).","vitality at work; social interaction; positive design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

The structure is initially not designed to resist overheight vehicle impacts and the impacts occurring during construction works with impact velocities up to 40 km/h result in total collapse of the structure and, consequently, high risks with respect to road users’ safety. These serious consequences in combination with the need for revised design specifications and calculations have led to the following main research question:<br/><br/>“Is it feasible to create a design for the temporary overhead sign structure which is able to resist the overheight vehicle impact of raised trailers of dump trucks in work zones?”<br/><br/>In this research study, a load analysis is performed in order to approximate the impact load for the impact problem analysed assuming viscoelastic behaviour. The analysis demonstrated that the impact response is barely influenced by the dynamic effects in the structure. The mass of the vehicle and the global stiffness of the structure dominate the impact response. The impact load can be approximated based on the quasi-static approximation.<br/><br/>The current temporary overhead sign structure is not able to resist overheight vehicle impacts since the tensile resistance of the bolts of the column base plate connection is much smaller than the internal tensile forces it is subjected to as a result of the large overturning moment and the small internal lever arm in the connection. The behaviour of the structure could be improved by redesigning the column structure while focussing on increasing the internal lever arm and simultaneously limiting the transverse stiffness of the column structure and with that limiting the magnitude of the impact load.<br/><br/>Some design considerations are analysed demonstrating that it is a challenging task to develop a design for the demountable temporary overhead sign structure which is able to resist the overheight vehicle impact with a mass of 20,000 kg while limiting the structural mass based on the design requirements as provided by Rijkswaterstaat. The possibilities are limited up to an impact velocity of 7.4 km/h after replacing the original column with a lattice column structure.<br/><br/>The study is based on viscoelastic behaviour of the structure neglecting the influence of plastic deforming of the structure and vehicle during impact which may be of significance. Moreover, the actions of the driver during impact are not taken into account. Including the influence of these aspects and developing an optimized design for the structure might somewhat increase the currently approximated critical impact velocity of 7.4 km/h.<br/><br","temporary; overhead; sign; structure; overheight; vehicle; impact; load","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2028-08-31","","","","","",""

How- ever reports of data breaches and privacy issues on such platforms are getting more frequent. We argue that only a decentralized trust system can enable a privacy-driven and fair future of the online economy. This requires a scalable system to record interactions and ensure the dissemination and consistency of records. We propose a mechanism that incentivizes agents to broadcast and verify each others interaction records. The underlying architecture is TrustChain, a pairwise ledger designed for scalable recording transactions. In TrustChain each node records their transactions on a personal ledger. We extend this ledger with the recording of block exchanges. By making past information exchanges transparent to other agents the knowledge state of each agent is public. This allows to discriminate based on the exchange behavior of agents. Also, it leads agents to verify potential part- ners as transactions with knowingly malicious users leads to proof-of-fraud. We formally analyze the recording of exchanges and show that free-riding nodes that do not exchange or verify can be detected.

The production of oil, therefore, plays an important role in our society. Unfortunately, the process of oil production is highly uncertain. There are uncertainties associated on the production strategy, e.g. where and how many wells should be drilled and how these wells should operate because of the uncertainties associated with the limited knowledge about the subsurface. In this thesis we are dealing with the uncertainty of the rock permeability distribution. Typically, rock permeabilities in the rock vary, but from the outside this can’t be perceived. If these rock permeabilities are estimated inaccurately, they will result in inaccurate pressure solutions. Then, this can lead to faulty decisions regarding the oil exploitation. To resolve this issue, a data assimilation technique may be applied to correct these model parameters based on mismatch of simulated data and observations. For this optimization technique, often gradient information is required. Since<br/>in reservoir simulation the number of parameters generally is extremely high, computation of this information is computationally expensive. Therefore, a multiscale framework is employed to improve the<br/>computational efficiency of the forward simulation. Multiscale methods are able to solve the model equations at a computationally efficient coarse scale and can easily interpolate this solution to the fine<br/>scale resolution. Next, we use a Lagrangian set-up together with a multiscale framework to re-derive an efficient formulation for the derivative computation. However, as the multiscale method is prone to errors, this derivative computation formulation is recast in an iterative fashion, using a residual based<br/>iterative multiscale method to provide control of these errors. In this thesis we show that this method generates accurate gradients. In contract to the high accuracy of the method, this method comprises a computationally heavy smoothing step. This issue can be resolved by making smart use of the Lagrange<br/>multipliers, to re-derive an efficient iterative multiscale solution strategy. The multipliers are used to identify important domains of the region for which smoothing is required and for which regions we may neglect the smoothing. We show that the newly proposed iterative multiscale goal oriented method is computationally more efficient and we show that method is promising for efficient derivative computation, but that more work is required to fully demonstrate the benefit of this method.","multiscale; gradient; computation; lagrange; multipliers; optimization; goal-oriented; adjoint; iterative mutliscale; Porous Media; Flow; reservoir simulation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","We present a novel nonlinear formulation for modeling reactive-compositional flow and transport in presence of complex phase behavior due to combination of thermodynamic and chemical equilibrium in multi-phase systems. We apply this formulation to model precipitation/dissolution of minerals in reactive flow in subsurface reservoirs. The proposed formulation is based on the consistent element balance reduction of the molar (overall composition) formulation. To predict the complex phase behavior in such systems, we include the chemical<br/>equilibrium constraints to the multiphase multi-component negative flash calculations and solve the thermodynamic and chemical phase equilibrium simultaneously. In this solution, the phase equilibrium is represented by the partition coefficients whereas the chemical equilibrium reaction is represented by the activity coefficients model. This provides a generic treatment of chemical and thermodynamic equilibrium within the successive substitution loop of multiphase flash to accommodate chemical equilibrium reactions (precipitation and dissolution reactions). Equilibrium Rate Annihilation matrix allows us to reduce the governing component conservation equations to element conservation equations, while the coupling between chemical and thermodynamic equilibrium is captured by a simultaneous solution of modified multiphase flash equations. The element balance equation written in terms of overall component mole fractions is modified and defined in terms of element mole fractions. Therefore, the primary set of governing equations are the element balance equations and the<br/>kinetic equations. This element composition of the mixture serves as an input to the modified multiphase flash computations whereas the output is fractions of components in each phase, including solids. The nonlinear element based governing equations are solved with the modified version of the Operator-Based Linearization (OBL) approach where the governing equations are formulated in terms of space and state-dependent parameters constrained by the solution of the extended multiphase flash. The element balance molar formulation along<br/>with the modified multiphase flash has been tested in a simple transport model with dissolution and precipitation reactions. The simulation of multidimensional problems of practical interest has been performed using the Adaptive OBL technique. The same approach can be used later to model systems involving kinetic reactions and simulate the near wellbore mineral precipitation prevalent in North Sea gas reservoirs. This is the first time when a robust multiphase multicomponent flash based on element fractions is coupled with an element balance based compositional formulation and tested for multidimensional problems of practical interest. In addition, an efficient parametrization based Adaptive OBL approach has been performed for a fully implicit solution of reactive-compositional flow and transport using element mole fractions. This proposed technique improves both robustness and performance of these complex chemical models.","Reservoir simulation; Reactive compositional flow and transport; Thermodynamic and Chemical Equilibrium; Fully Implicit Method; Operator Based Linearization; Element based formulation; Chemical kinetics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Petroleum Engineering and Geo-sciences","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","Salt caverns formed by solution mining may cause soil subsidence, because the surrounding adapts to fill the void (cavity) created in the strata. The cavern volume is hence not only a function of salt extraction (estimated from mass balance) but also a function of salt creep. The cavern size can be measured by sonar, but a less costly way would be to correlate cavern volume to cavern compressibility. The size of the cavern can be obtained by a compressibility test. The compressibility test consists of injecting brine or fresh water into the cavern, causing a pressure build-up. The pressure increase depends on the cavern volume and compressibility. Bérest et al. (2006) [1] derived an equation that expresses the pressure response to injection of a volume V of fresh water. The equation includes creep that can be derived from a separate geometric creep model that relates the strain to the stress history using the Norton-Hoff law for describing an Arrhenius type of response model, and thermal expansion effects influenced by the geothermal temperature. It also considers Darcy flow and leakage through the permeable salt cavity. This thesis investigates the sensitivity related to the various mechanisms in the Bérest and Van Sambeek (2005) model. It also extends the model by introducing chemical dissolution of salt effects and taking into account the impact of the sump (insoluble precipitates at the bottom of the cavern). We state the model equations and solve them for an example of interest. We can also compare the calculated pressure response to the results of a pressure test. In this pressure test a given volume of fresh water is injected above the sump and produced at the top of the cavity. The produced salt concentration is also one of the parameters measured in the test. There are at least two widely used methods to obtain or predict cavern size of active salt solution mining caverns, namely sonar surveys and leaching simulators. However, these data can be flawed due to uncertainties of the methods and the accuracy of measuring devices like flow meters. The compressibility test can then be used as an additional survey method. The test execution is simple and inexpensive, making it possible to be performed more frequently than a sonar survey. The cavern volume is obtained from a compressibility test data by using a solution that includes not only the injection volume, but also volumes introduced by other phenomena. These other phenomena are caused by thermal, hydraulic, mechanical, and chemical influences. Previous work has attempted to introduced solutions incorporating these influences for idle caverns. The proposed solution incorporates these effects in an active leaching salt cavern. It also introduces the impact of sump (insoluble on cavern bottom) to be included in the model. The proposed solution is then tested against field data. The work here differs from previous work that it presents a comprehensive description of the various methods used in the literature and practice. Where current models predict cavity volumes with a mean absolute percentage error of 33% (Thiel’s method for BAS3O) to 127% (Bérest et al. for BAS4) for the studied caverns (BAS3O and BAS4), the model here, which includes the presence of insoluble particles, and a well-established creep model is able to predict cavity volumes to an accuracy of 33% (proposed model for BAS3O) to 12% (proposed model for BAS4).","salt solution mining; compressibility; pressure test; cavern volume estimation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Petroleum Engineering and Geo-sciences","",""

The most commonly used configuration is a doublet of wells, in which one injection- and one production well is drilled to produce warm water and re-inject cool water in the same target reservoir. One of the most important issues in operating this project is to maintain pressure communication of the doublet, with injector-producer well distance limitation and geological heterogeneity provide the main challenge to be solved. Moreover, as this application depends on flow behavior from injector to producer well, thus the determination of doublet wells location and spacing must be correctly evaluated to reduce the risk of an unsuccessful project.<br/>In this research, the Triassic successions within the Drechtsteden area in the West Netherlands Basin (WNB) are evaluated for its potential for geothermal energy production. A reservoir characterization approach is implemented to answer the above challenges by utilizing subsurface data such as 3D seismic and well data. The process consists of seismic interpretation, reservoir sedimentology, and petrophysical evaluation analysis to determine the reservoir architecture and properties within the study area.<br/>The regional study shows that most of the sandstone intervals within the Triassic successions occur in the Röt-, Hardegsen-, Detfurth- and Volpriehausen Formation. Based on reservoir sedimentology analysis, the sandstone intervals are composed of the stacked low sinuous river and sheet flood deposits with some interbedded lake margin deposits. The regional correlation suggests that the sand bodies within each formation can be correlated over distances of kilometers and were deposited along an SE-NW direction. The petrophysical evaluation result displays some variation in the reservoir properties (N/G, average porosity, and permeability) at a different location within the study area. A notable decrease is observed in reservoir porosity and permeability at greater depths which might indicate a compaction effect due to several tectonic episodes during and after the deposition of the Triassic Successions.<br/>At the end of this research, two doublet locations are determined based on the analysis results which fulfill the required conditions for geothermal application. Both of the proposed doublets are designed to follow the SE-NW overall trend of the deposition and main faults orientation to maintain the pressure communication and avoid the presence of faults in between the wells. The injector is designed to be located at the shallower level than the producer to allow for gravity-driven flow propagation. A rough estimation of temperature distribution in doublet location displays that the proposed locations have sufficient estimated temperature for greenhouses and district heating. The expected reservoir properties at the proposed doublet locations are estimated from the depth range of penetrated doublet, the generated isopach maps, and petrophysical averages on the evaluated wells within the study area by a statistical approach.<br","Geology; geothermal","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Petroleum Engineering and Geo-sciences","",""

With the rail failure data, cost information and pre-defined maintenance policies (3 conditions), the model output is able to answer two practical questions for asset managers: ‘when would be the most cost efficient to preventively replace the rails in Harmelen LCS’ and ‘how much money does one asset manager have to save to own the asset in the optimized lifecycle’. Sensitivity analysis is further performed to take more different settings into account and facilitate better understandings about the connections between model outcomes and input variables.

These problems occur at different locations, each with its own problems or limitations. The desired safety level as requested by the government is that the river should be able to have a discharge which has a probability of failure of once in 200 years. At many locations, the current probability of failure is lower than once in 50 years. This has led to the following research question:<br/>How can the discharge capacity of the Shonai River be improved to modern standards?<br/>The report has been divided in four phases. The first phase is used to formulate the final research question. This phase focuses on which part of the Nagoya urban area is most prone to flooding. Three kinds of flooding were examined: by peak river discharge, impact by tsunamis and impact by storm surge. The area is already well protected against tsunamis due to the natural shape of the bay Nagoya is situated to. The coastline is well protected against storm surges in the second half of the 20th century. At the river banks however, flood safety is still below the desired level. In the area, risks are relatively high along the Shonai River. Therefore, it has been decided to focus on the threats around the Shonai River. As already described above, there are several locations along the river with safety risks. <br/><br/>In phase 2, several locations and solutions are described to increase the capacity of the river. One major problem is the bottleneck around the Biwajima bridges, where four bridges are narrowing the river. At this location, the desired safety level of a flood discharge occurring once in 200 years is still far away. After discussion with officials of the Shonai River office, it was found that this problem was most urgent. Therefore, it had been chosen to elaborate further on this option in phase 3 and 4.<br/>In phase 3, several options are described to remove the bottleneck. The first option is to replace the bridges with more clearance and larger spans. The second option is to remove the bridges and replace them for tunnels. The third and last option is to construct a bypass along the river, with flow through a tunnel. The Shonai River office is already working on a plan to raise the bridges, thus the first option has been dropped. The second option required large amounts of space for the tunnels. Therefore, it had been decided to work out the third option of creating a bypass. To minimise the impact of such a bypass and its construction on the surrounding area, the decision is made to construct a bored tunnel. <br/><br/>In the fourth and final phase the solution is verified. This is done concerning structural, hydraulic and construction method aspects. All the aspects are found to be possible. In hydraulic aspect, it is found that the required discharge capacity to reach a once in 200 year safety level equals 4250 m3/s. The current discharge capacity is found to be 2850 m3/s. Therefore, the bypass should have a minimal discharge capacity of 1400 m3/s. When using a bored tunnel, it is found that two tunnels with the maximal internal diameter of 16 m should be applied. On top of that, because the concrete surface is to rough in the best circumstances, it was decided to apply an epoxy layer on the surface. Using such a layer, it is found that the total discharge capacity becomes 1490m3/s.<br/>The construction of the tunnel would take 137 weeks to complete. The total costs are estimated to be in the order of ¥60,000,000,000, or 60 billion yen, equivalent to 463 million euro. In comparison, the plan of the river office to replace the bridges would cost ¥68,400,000,000. It can be concluded that this option is a reasonable alternative for the current plan.","Flood; Defence; Nagoya; Shonai; River; Japan","en","student report","","","","","","","","2018-09-01","","","","","CIE4061-09 Multidisciplinary Project","35.1814, 136.9064"

Rural areas which are ideal for renewable energy development due to large vacant areas are faced with grid voltage variations due to long distribution lines. Because of the stringent conditions laid by the Distribution System Operators (DSOs) on voltage variations, voltage regulation is becoming increasingly important in the distribution grid. A complete grid reinforcement by replacing the conductors can be very expensive for the DSOs. Active solutions such as shunt and series compensation provides an economical solution to address the voltage regulation issues in the distribution grids. <br/><br/>The initial part of this work focuses on quantitatively studying the impact of series and shunt compensation on increasing the grid capacity of a Medium Voltage(MV) line compared to a grid reinforcement with conductor upgradation. The analysis was done on a 20 kV, 10 MVA radial line with 5 loads distributed equally along the line, and a generator at the end of the line. An algorithm was developed in MATLAB/ Simulink to determine the allowable grid capacity to stay within the thermal and voltage limits for different voltage regulation strategies. The study indicates that the series voltage regulation with Line Voltage Regulators(LVR) is an effective solution in increasing the grid capacity by actively regulating the voltage in the grid. The MV-LVR product offered by ABB consists of dry-type transformers and mechanical contactors for changing the tap position. However, dry-type transformers are bigger in size and more expensive than oil-type transformers. To reduce the cost and the size of the MV-LVR, the study is focused on the feasibility of a MV-LVR with oil-type transformers and On-Load Tap-Changers (OLTCs). The second part of the project work focuses on developing an economical LVR configuration with an oil-type transformer and a mechanical OLTC. ECOTAP VPD III 100 from Maschinenfabrik Reinhausen (MR) was selected as the mechanical OLTC to perform the tap changing operation in the LVR. ECOTAP OLTC enables low maintenance of transformers due to the use of vacuum switches for quenching the arc during tap-changes. 7 LVR configurations with single and two active parts are investigated. All the configurations are finally compared for their cost and range of operation. The final part of the work focuses on a feasibility study of a power electronics based OLTC for LVR applications as mechanical OLTCs require regular maintenance. Anti-parallel thyristors are used as the solid-state switches for the LVR application due to its low cost and losses. Commutation instants are defined for the complete power factor range for the thyristor based OLTC to have no/controlled short circuit during tap-changes. <br/><br/>The two active parts LVR configuration constructed with a center tapped feeder transformer and a booster transformer with the ECOTAP VPD III 100 OLTC is economical for a 20 kV, 10 MVA feeder line. A LVR rated at 20 kV, 10 MVA with ± 6 % voltage regulation using the selected configuration was simulated in MATLAB/ Simulink. A 400 V, 5 kVA low voltage setup was built with the ECOTAP VPD III 100 OLTC, and the LVR configuration was verified with experimental results. The feeder transformer model with two taps was simulated in MATLAB/Simulink for switching up and switching down operation with a thyristor based OLTC for capacitive, inductive and resistive power factors. The complete LVR system with thyristor based OLTC placed in a MV distribution line was simulated to verify the control algorithm used for the commutation. The thyristor based OLTC successfully performs tap-changes for a LVR system with a low voltage stress on the thyristor, and low short circuit currents between the taps for certain power factor angles during the commutation process.","Voltage regulation; Line Voltage Regulators (LVR); Distribution Networks; OLTC","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","European Wind Energy Masters (EWEM)","",""

A prime example is the selection of Psyche as NASA’s fourteenth Discovery Program mission. Orbital dynamics in the vicinity of small irregular bodies pose great challenges for trajectory design. In particular, science orbits close to the surface of small bodies are often strongly perturbed by the irregular gravity field. These irregularities can potentially perturb the trajectory of a spacecraft in such a way that it becomes uncontrollable, resulting in impact on the surface of the central body or escape from the system. A less dramatic consequence would be the need for costly orbit maintenance maneuvers to counteract these instabilities, which is undesirable. For uniformly rotating bodies such as the Psyche asteroid, mean motion resonances with the asteroid rotation amplify instabilities even further, warranting the need for a systematic study of orbital stability in such systems.<br/><br/>To increase our understanding of these dynamically challenging environments, we carry out an extensive numerical characterization of stability in the uniformly rotating second degree and order gravity field by uniformly sampling the initial condition space and the gravity field harmonic coefficients. In doing so, we consider two conceptually different notions of stability: Bounded-Input, Bounded-Output (BIBO) stability and the regularity/chaoticity of spacecraft trajectories, quantified by the Fast Lyapunov Indicator (FLI). Through this study we have been able to generate stability plots that can be used to quickly inform mission designers on stable and unstable regions in the phase space. Our results show that FLI maps are an effective complementary mission design tool that flag orbit instabilities sooner when compared to BIBO stability constraints. Finally, our numerical results are complemented by analytically derived equations of the semi-major axis and the eccentricity in the uniformly rotating second degree and order gravity field. These equations clearly show the origin and impact of resonant instabilities. This initial work can be developed further into a complementary mission design tool for future small-body missions.<br","Orbit Design; Asteroid; Stability Analysis; Fast Lyapunov Indicator; Chaos Indicator; Psyche Mission; Gauss Planetary Equations; Orbit Resonance","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","JPL Visiting Student Research Program",""

One method of tackling such wicked problems is the use of computer-aided modelling and simulation. Model-based decision support is a growing discipline involving the use of computer models of complex systems to explore, understand and manage them. A core concept in model-based decision support is scenario discovery. In scenario discovery, a model’s inputs and outputs are related to understand under which conditions policy-relevant outputs may occur. In a first step, a diverse set of inputs is used to generate a variety of outputs. In a second step, the subset of decision-relevant outputs is identified among the outputs<br/>through some external criterion, such as a threshold value. Finally, the inputs which generated those outputs of interest are identified, and a generative rule set is induced which usefully predicts under which conditions an input will generate an output meeting the external criterion. This rule set bounds an input subspace of interest, from which (most of) the outputs of interest originate. While scenario discovery performs adequately for quasi-linear and simple models, it is not well suited to behaviorally complex, nonlinear models. This is both because external criteria are hard to define for complex model behaviors, and also because there are often significant interactions and dependencies between model inputs, which current rule induction algorithms have trouble identifying.......","Time series; clustering; System Dynamics; Exploratory Modeling; Scenario discovery; Patient Rule Induction Method","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","",""

For the vehicle to be fully self aware multiple sensors or radars have to placed in close proximity of each other on the body of the automobile. This will lead to interference between the radars which results in sub optimal performance of the radar system. Currently most of interference mitigation techniques employ various methods of signal coding algorithms, by assigning each radar a different code or modifying beamforming and angle of arrival algorithms to suppress the interference. Most of theses technique use and exploit the properties of the transmitted signal (signal processing techniques) for mitigating the interference. In this thesis the avenue of antenna array design for mitigation of interference is explored. By modifying the radiation pattern of the array, the antenna array will act as spatial filter against the incoming interference signals. In this thesis two techniques for designing the antenna array with improved radiation pattern are proposed. The design techniques are used to optimize the MIMO virtual array of the radar for low sidelobes and increased aperture, and the optimized virtual array is then factorized to obtain the Tx and Rx arrays. 2 virtual arrays of 12 elements and 24 elements are optimized using the design techniques. The performance of the various designs is ranked based on the output SINR of an adaptive beamformer. The simulations results show that the optimized MIMO arrays result in an improvement of up to 3.5dB in SINR in comparison to the currently used topologies. Finally, a prototype of the improved MIMO antenna system is modeled in CST MS design environment, and the superior performance of the designed array topologies over the existing array topologies is verified.","Automotive radar; Antenna; Interference; MIMO","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-08-31","","","","Electrical Engineering | Microelectronics","Microwave Sensing, Signals and Systems",""

However, multidimensional characterization of these fractures remains a challenge due to structural complexity in multiscale. The progressive deformation of dilatant fracture in normal fault system from physical models are imaged in 3D using high resolution industrial X-ray computed tomography (CT) scanning to contribute to a better understanding of the effect of mechanical and hydraulic evolution of fracture zones in carbonates at shallow depth as observed in the field analogue. A simple setup consists of cohesive powder as analogue material, embedded by two layers of cohesionless sand. The overburden sand thickness is varied to create mechanical stratigraphy effect as a function of overburden stress. The raw 3D volume of acquired CT data were rendered and the qualitative analysis over three orthogonal 2D plane views reveals the complexity and differences in structure observed at the outer and center parts of the model. Structural complexity occurred in proximity of the main fault within the central part of model volume in which sedimentation of overburden sand into the dilatant main fault, as well as the formation of localized fault lens with complex cavity network on the boundary between cohesive powder and base sand are observed. Previous study that showed the structural style changes due to failure mode transition, from excavated scaled model with similar mechanical stratigraphy, are confirmed to be occurred in 3D as observed from the CT scan results. The CT scan data were processed for image segmentation, and the open fractures are extracted from the whole volume for quantification and visualization of the fracture geometry and connectivity in both 2D and 3D. The mechanical stratigraphy and the associated changes in fault zone geometry related to fault localization affect the overall 3D dilatancy of the model next to the effect of overburden load. The interplay between structural-mechanics control over fracture geometry parameters are inferred to be closely related to fluid flow parameters.","IDEA League; Geophysics; Geology; Digital Rock Physics; X-ray CT scanning; Image Segmentation; Dilatant Fractures; Normal Fault; ImageJ; AVIZO; Fracture Connectivity; Sandbox; Analogue model; Carbonates; PERMEA","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Geophysics | IDEA League","PERMEA",""

Rapid researches and developments of PSCs are shown by the increase of its efficiency from 3.8% in 2009 to a new world record of 22.4% in 2017. Hysteresis phenomenon in current density voltage (J-V) is one of the challenges occurring in some specific PSCs that should be overcome to continue the improvement of PSCs. This phenomenon occurs when a voltage is swept with different scan directions from negative to positive value (forward) and positive to negative value (backward). Hysteresis effect results in a different maximum power point on the J-V characteristic leading to under- or overestimation of PSCs efficiency.<br/><br/>Furthermore, when the applied voltage is abruptly changed, a transient current density response is introduced implying a capacitive behaviour. Due to this behaviour, there is an indication that PSCs cannot be represented by the conventional equivalent circuit. Thus, the purpose of this project is to investigate hysteresis phenomenon in PSC by electrical modelling. In this project, a PSC sample was fabricated by Solliance Solar Research. Time-resolved J-V measurement was done to obtain more insight of J(t) as a function of applied voltage. The hysteresis phenomenon was analyzed in different voltage scan direction and various scan rates. Simulation of band diagram in dark condition was done to understand working principle of PSC device. Two predicted equivalent circuit of the cell were derived from the simulated band diagram. These equivalent circuit models considered the charge accumulation at the bulk of perovskite and at the interface between charge transport layers and perovskite. Furthermore, two additional equivalent circuit models were proposed to represent the hysteresis effect. J(t) curve fitting of measurement results and simulation was employed to verify the equivalent circuit.

The high amount of wind power penetration into the power grids poses a major challenge to Transmission System Operators (TSO) in terms of the operational management, as wind power is highly uncertain. The highly uncertain nature of the wind power leads to the scenarios where the power flow exceeds the grid limits leading to the capacity problem of the grid. There are multiple solutions to prevent this grid capacity problem. The first solution is the physical extension of the grid, but this requires considerable capital investments. Moreover, the frequency of the worst-case scenarios (maximum generation coinciding with minimum load) is very low and grid expansion is a much slower process, so this solution is not optimal. The second solution is to store the excessive power using batteries. The batteries cannot store power efficiently because of the storage losses and they also degrade with time. The initial setup of the batteries and their replacement (in the case of degradation) would require considerable capital investments. The third solution is reserve regulation of the generation units to deal with the uncertainty of wind power. The final solutions is to curtail excessive wind power in the grid. The last two solutions are feasible from an economic point of view when compared to the initial two solutions. However, both these approaches are expensive. But, an optimal combination of these approaches might result in an enhanced solution in terms of total energy procurement costs (a cheaper solution).<br/><br/>The objective of this thesis is to formulate a chance-constrained multivariate stochastic optimization problem which would perform the stochastic unit commitment and simultaneously would create an optimal combination of wind power curtailment and reserve scheduling to reduce the overall costs of the system. As an initial step, the combination of the reserves and wind power curtailment (the convex combination approach) was modeled using the convex combination approach. The optimization problem corresponding to the convex combination model was formulated to find an optimal combination of reserve dispatch and wind power curtailment. Later on, the combination of reserve scheduling and the wind power curtailment was modeled using the mixed logic dynamical systems framework (MLD approach). The optimization problem corresponding to the MLD approach was formulated to find an optimal combination of reserve dispatch and wind power curtailment.<br/><br/>A randomization technique was used to generate various scenarios of the uncertain wind power. Based on a prior violation level of the grid limits, we perform scenario-based stochastic optimization to obtain an optimal combination of reserve scheduling and wind power curtailment in both the approaches for each scenario to lower the overall costs of the system. The theoretical developments proposed were evaluated on an IEEE-30 bus network.<br/>The static and the dynamic demand cases were simulated.

The vernacular Kath-Kuni (also called: ‘cator-and-cribbage’ or ‘timber laced masonry’) architecture is a centuries-old building method spread over the Himalayas and the Karakoram mountain range in India, Pakistan and parts of Afghanistan and China. This building typology’s efficacy was proved by its ability to withstand significant seismic events in the region and is, hence, well-known to be an earthquake resistant building style.<br/><br/>To ensure that the valuable building techniques embedded in the traditional Kath-Kuni architecture do not get lost completely, the main question asked in this research is: “Which earthquake resistant features and embedded traditional knowledge of Kath-Kuni walls are essential in generating adequate seismic performance of this vernacular architecture?”<br/><br/>To this end, field research, out-of-plane and in-plane analysis of walls, laboratory testing to characterise the walls ductility, analysis of the building’s box-action and a sustainability study comparing Kath-Kuni with concrete buildings have been carried out. <br/><br/>This led to the conclusion that the horizontal spanning timber beams and the robust connection in the corners are generating box-action by transferring the lateral force from the out-of-plane loaded wall to the in-plane loaded walls. Thus, the seismic capacity of the building is not depending on the rigidity of the floor diaphragms. Secondly, the in-plane loaded walls use a behaviour factor R to take non-linear wall behaviour (ductility) into account. Research to this behaviour factor is and the time period of the building indicates that the behaviour factor and time period obtained from standard formulas are too conservative. Last, the most important earthquake resistant features that contribute to the high ductility of the in-plane loaded walls are the timber connections (kadil dowel connection and maanwi dovetail connection) which are allowing internal rotation in the layer and are acting in parallel and series with one another, the lack of vertical reinforcement which leaves the wall free to deform in vertical direction without damage and the high contribution of friction in between the stone and stone-timber in the wall.<br/><br/>In addition to the seismic resistance of the Kath-Kuni building style, study showed that this architecture scores well on sustainability, in terms of performance, service life and environmental impact. However, high construction costs, due to a scarcity of the main materials, has rendered building of Kath-Kuni houses economically currently unviable.<br/><br/>Therefore, it is recommended to investigate possibilities in modernising and re-interpreting the Kath-Kuni building style using other sustainable and affordable materials, such as bamboo, stabilized earthen blocks or lime concrete. Even though earthquake resistant construction is also feasible using concrete as main material, it is the vernacular architecture and its embedded traditional knowledge that gives character to the Himalayas, which is beneficial for tourism and livelihood. Moreover, the concrete construction is a big contributor to the total global CO2 emissions; hence using local, sustainable and durable materials should be promoted.","Kath-Kuni; Vernacular architecture; Earthquake analsyis; Seismic engineering; Himalaya; India; Experimental study","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Core to these uncertainties are wake dynamics, which lack adequate models and need further validation. In lieu of conducting field experiments, this study integrates scanning lidar measurements and large eddy simulation (LES) to characterize wakes in complex terrain. LES data of flow over complex terrain near Perdigao, Portugal has been generated prior to this study. In the current study a `synthetic’ lidar is placed inside the LES to sample the wind field in space and time as a commercial scanning lidar would. From the synthetic scan fields, the wake is located and characterized using metrics of wake center location and maximum velocity deficit. These metrics are evaluated against the same metrics as determined by LES fields. By treating the LES metrics as the ``target”, the relative accuracy of the metrics can be determined. This accuracy is a function of the scan geometry, allowing for the geometry to be optimized for wake characterization. Since a lidar scan represents neither an instantaneous field nor a mean field, it is not clear whether the target should be the LES instantaneous or mean fields, therefore the metric accuracy is assessed using different LES fields in the form of instantaneous snapshots of the wake, fields averaged over the time of a scan cycle, and long-term averaged fields. <br/><br/>A set of scan geometries was tested which vary in measurement point density, scan direction, and scan area to find that accuracy depends on a trade-off in the temporal and spatial resolution of the geometry. The results highlight not only the dependency of accuracy on the geometry parameters, but also on which type of LES field is used as the target. The long-term averaged errors were found to be unsuitable for lidars in this terrain, where the longest time scales exceed the simulation time, therefore accuracy was assessed using two types of fields, instantaneous fields taken at the start of the scan cycle, and the cycle-averaged fields. From these results two geometries were identified as performing the best.<br/><br/>Improvements are still needed in the wake detection algorithm, both in distinguishing points in the wake from terrain-generated turbulence and the inclusion of more wake characteristics such as size, shape, and orientation in order to develop more accurate scan geometries, hence improving predictions of wind farm production and longevity. Other scan geometry parameters also need to be explored, including scan paths and non-uniform measurement point densities.","wake; wake characterization; LIDAR; LiDAR; Lidar; scanning lidar; LES; complex terrain; Wind Turbine; Wind Energy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Levitation systems are particularly interesting because of their non-contact characteristic which provides the possibility to isolate the levitated object from environmental effects like mechanical friction and heat flow. The levitation phenomenon can be realized through various principles. However, magnetic levitation distinguishes itself from the other levitation methods since it is the only one that can truly provide passive and stable levitation, without the help of a feedback system or energy input. This is specifically possible because of the phenomenon of diamagnetism, where the magnetization of a material opposes the external magnetizing field. In this thesis, rigid body dynamics of diamagnetically levitated objects have been studied. To do this, an experimental setup has been designed and implemented to simultaneously actuate and measure the response of the diamagnetically levitating object. With the help of electrostatic actuation and measurement of static and dynamic responses of the system, the magnetic forces on a levitating object have been characterized and used to build a rigid body model of the levitating object. Consequently, the interaction between the trapped charges on the levitating conductor and electrostatic forces that were used for actuation have been observed and modeled in the linear regime. By the integration of the mechanical and electrical model, the trapped charges on a diamagnetically levitated object were quantified by several methods, using statical and dynamical measurements. These endeavours have led to the discovery of a unique dynamical phenomenon: Diamagnetically Levitating Charge Induced Impact Oscillator. With the help of the models constructed along theway, the mechanical and electrical behavior of the phenomenon have been explained. Finally it was concluded that the oscillator is also a mechanical charge carrier which can transfer relatively equal amount of charges periodically, where the frequency of transportation and amount of charges transferred depends on the mechanical, magnetic and electrical properties of the system.","Levitation; Diamagnetism; Impact Oscillator; Electrostatic actuation; Magnetism","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-08-31","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Dynamics of Micro and Nano Systems","",""

People are annotated by bounding boxes contain their body. In this crowded social scene, people occlusion is one of the challenge barriers for detection. In this work, we study the relation between people occlusion and detecting performance by experiments. Based on a deep network consisting of GoogLeNet and Overfeat, we analyze the performance of detectors trained with various occlusion distribution at different occlusion level. On the ground of experiment results, we attempt to promote the performance by selection of training data. Apart from this, as an attempt for promotion, we train head detectors by newly collected head annotation.

This type of hearing loss can be treated by implanting a prosthesis, which replaces the stapes bone and attaches to the adjacent bone: the incus. Current stapes prostheses produce excellent hearing results, however the procedure is difficult to perform and success is not assured. With current prostheses, safe clamping forces cannot be accurately controlled, despite being crucial to the surgery’s long-term success. Inappropriate clamping force may cause slipping of the prosthesis or necrosis of the incus.<br/>The objective of this study was to first create an overview of current prostheses and subsequently examine their pitfalls, and to design a new stapes prosthesis that addresses these pitfalls. Throughout the literature review a classification and evaluation system was developed to catalogue existing and future prostheses based on, for example, air bone gap difference, force controllability and ease of implantation. From this study we found the category of prostheses that utilise elastic material behaviour to securely clasp around the incus to have the most potential in a new prosthesis design.<br/>Presented in this thesis is a novel prosthesis which features a bistable, fully compliant, two-dimensional mechanism, designed to be simpler to insert and with a more predictable clamping force compared with existing prostheses. For any incus diameter within the recorded range, the force around the incus is sure to be safe by design. The new prosthesis can be placed around the bone without causing unwanted stresses in the ossicles and joints, and is easily clicked shut.","Compliant; Mechanism; Design; Stapedotomy; Prosthesis; Bistable","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-09-01","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Mechatronic System Design (MSD)","",""

The existing infrastructure and the transportation activities are studied and modeled as an optimization problem with simultaneous vehicle routing and container-to-mode assignment. A special characteristic of this problem is the uncertain data. In other words, it is assumed that the release times of the containers belong to an uncertainty interval, and no further statistical information is available. The problem is then classified according to an extensive framework previously developed within the project. An extensive body of literature is reviewed to identify current modeling approaches and their theoretical and practical limitations. This literature study shows that, although discrete time models have been intensively investigated, there are few studies which propose continuous modeling of time. The container routing problem is modeled as a mixed integer program with explicit time variables and lateness penalties. A robust formulation is then proposed to eliminate the uncertain parameters from the objective function and constraints. By solving the new model exactly, with the aid of an optimization solver, robust solutions are obtained corresponding to transportation plans which remain feasible for any realization of the release times within the pre-specified uncertainty interval. In order to introduce some flexibility in the transportation plan, the continuous time variables are modeled as affine functions of the uncertain parameters. The resulting two-stage decision model is tested for a small-sized instance in both situations, with high and low lateness penalties. The computational results show that the adjustable robust model yields on the one hand, route-dependent adjusted solutions for the case of penalized lateness, and on the other hand, a direct improvement of the objective function for the case of tolerated lateness. The results suggest that the adjustable robust optimization framework has sufficient potential to model the synchromodal container routing problem. This thesis concludes with addressing some of the limitations of the proposed model and indicating concrete approaches for countering them.","Synchromodal; Robust; Optimization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-06-30","","","","","",""

Modeling the impact of secondary path and leakage flows on the performance and axial thrust of the pump is critical during the early design phase. Previous studies derived simplified models and empirical correlations to model leakage loss and determine the pressure distribution in the side gaps. The prediction capabilities of these models are subject to limitations and uncertainties mainly due to the interaction between impeller exit flow and sidewall gaps especially at partload operation. The effects of the leakage injection on the impeller flow are not fully understood and not captured by analytical correlations from literature. These can have destabilizing and detrimental effects on the hydraulic performance and the head curve, leading to a divergence betweenmodel predictions and experimental results. In this project a reduced order model is developed to capture the effects of the sidewall gaps on turbopump performance and determine the axial thrust on the rotor. High fidelity calculations of the pump and volute are performed to identify the key physical mechanisms associated with loss generation in leakage paths and improve upon existing analytical models found in literature. Axial thrust and leakage losses are modeled numerically with a single passage geometry to capture the interaction of impeller flow and leakage flow through the side gaps at multiple operating points. It is found that the recirculation of pressurized fluid, leakage mass flow, is the most impactful effect on the performance. The volumetric efficiency is captured within 16% with the analytical model and 6% with the single passage numerical calculations at nominal operation. At partload operation however, the accuracy of both models reduces. Disk friction is under predicted by the investigated analytical model and axial thrust is over predicted. For both effects the reduced numerical model shows promising results that improve the prediction capability around nominal operation and offer a higher flexibility required for the early design phase as compared with the high fidelity, full annulus calculations. For the investigated cases the leakage injection to the impeller flow does not show a destabilizing impact on the characteristic behavior.","Secondary Flow Paths; Leakage Losses; Turbopumps; Loss Model; Thrust Model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-03-01","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Most of the areas are in the remote rural location. Due to the off-grid location, policies, and other social factors, the grid expansion in these areas is not economically viable. Installing Solar Home Systems (SHS) is considered to be a promising immediate solution, given that most of these areas are in the tropical region where it has the highest sun-hours in the world. SHS consists of PV modules for the energy generation, batteries for the energy storage, converters for the energy conversion, and load appliances for the energy consumption. However, its high ambient temperature can potentially harm the SHS in decreasing the performance and shortening the lifetime. The lower performance and lifetime can directly translate to have high capital expenses. Therefore a precise quantification of the performance and the lifetime is essential to all the stakeholders.<br/><br/>This thesis aims to evaluate and quantify the influence of temperature on the performance and the lifetime of SHS. To achieve the research goal, an integrated SHS model is proposed by considering the performance and the aging behavior of both PV modules and the batteries. Two different battery technologies: Li-ion and Lead-acid are involved in the evaluation. Moreover, the analysis was conducted for Sumba Island, Indonesia since it has great solar potential and also the potential market for the SHS. Furthermore, this work presents a comprehensive investigation of temperature impact from the PV module and battery component level to the system level.<br/><br/>Initial system design has been performed in which it requires a 330 Wp PV module, with a tilt and azimuth angle of 11 degrees and 6 degrees respectively, and 960 Wh of batteries to achieve the LLP of 9.5%. The simulation result of the PV component showed clearly that the PV energy yield reduces due to the higher ambient temperature is used. As for the battery, there is a converse behavior concerning the temperature impact in which an increase in temperature gives a positive effect on the capacity and internal resistance in the short term. However, in the long run, it has a severe aging rate.<br/><br/>By combining PV module and battery element in an integrated SHS model, it is shown that it achieves to have a 7.4% lower LLP compared to the initial sizing. However, as the aging plays a part, the LLP increases exponentially over the years and can achieve almost doubled the initial LLP. As the ambient temperature increases, it brings negative impacts for the SHS in terms of the performance and the lifetime. It results to have even higher LLP. A decreasing trend of battery lifetime is observed as the ambient temperature increases. Furthermore, it is seen that the system lifetime is limited by the battery lifetime.","Indonesia; Solar Home System; Temperature; Model based approach; PV systems","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-08-30","","","","","","-9.7266359,120.0372663"

Nevertheless, the U.S. economy runs large trade deficits, inequality in income and wealth has risen, and there is a growing disappointment in the ability of American capitalism to deliver on its economic promise of prosperity. Evidence of superior long-run performance of enterprises operating in economies (such as Germany) where the MSV hypothesis is not the norm guiding corporate governance (but co-determination), suggests (at the minimum) that there are approaches to corporate governance which may be superior to MSV. In this thesis, the longer-run impacts of two alternative systems of corporate governance are explored with the aid of two business case studies—performed on General Motors (GM), from the U.S., and Volkswagen (VW), from Germany—with an aim to find the extent to which their diverse systems of corporate governance have contributed to (dis)investments in innovation. It has been found that, unlike the conditions at VW, the lack of a stable decision-making structure; inability to identify and confront competition; high profit-orientation, short-termism, yearly stock buybacks and regulations which permits it, and stock-based remuneration rationalised by the MSV hypothesis; flexible labour markets and downsizing; focus on the development of “general” skills; and aggressive debt financing, have shaped the corporate governance of GM and have affected its innovative capabilities. Moreover, VW—with its strong long-term competence development motive, technocratic managers, and better debt ratios—can be expected to identify and sustain its new (radical) innovation projects and if successful, can aid VW to emerge from any cost-disadvantage. GM can be expected to possess superior proprietary technologies and radical innovations or could be in a path of acquiring them. But, it is likely that with its current low cash margins and riskier credit-risk exposure—as a result of MSV perspective in corporate governance—GM may be placed at a cost disadvantage if the innovations fail or fail to appropriate gains.","Maximisation of shareholder value; Financialisation; Stock Buybacks; Corporate Governance; Innovation; Innovative Enterprises; Co-determination; Efficient Markets Hypothesis; Principal-agent theory","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

However, numerical calculations have a high time complexity. Therefore, models were constructed to approximate these flows. This thesis focuses on using probability density functions (pdf) to predict scalar probabilities in these flows. Since the pdf does not contain spatial information, small scaled mixing has a closure problem and has to be modeled using micromixing. A micromixing model, called the Shadow Position Mixing Model (SPMM) was introduced previously to calculate this mixing. In this project, its performance is determined for the mixing in two different flows. The model shows promising results for mixing of two passive scalar, initially mainly in one of three states. Comparing the results of various mixing models to the provided DNS, the SPMM predicts the evolution of the pdf over time adequately, but still has visible differences compared to the DNS. In the second test, the model is tested using an imposed mean scalar gradient in order to check the convergence of the mixing model. The SPMM does show promising results, but can not reliably predict a correct statistically stationary state. This is due to the fact that varying number of scalars and particles lead to significant inconsistencies. Under the current conditions, the SPMM cannot be reliably applied to flows with such an additional scalar force. The SPMM uses a near-neighbor sorting algorithm which has a high algorithmic complexity. For practical purposes, a lower complexity algorithm has to be developed in order to use this model for high number of particles.","micromixing; Shadow Position Mixing Model; SPMM; Turbulent Flow; PDF methods","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics | Applied Physics","",""

The study of tungsten’s recrystallization behavior and damage response during operation conditions is thus important because the divertor will have to withstand high heat fluxes and temperatures during service which induce recrystallization. This phenomena alters the microstructure of the material, inducing degradation in its properties, like loss in mechanical strength and embrittlement making it prone to large plastic deformation, surface roughening, crack networks formation and propagation. Understanding this behavior under the ITER reactor operation circumstances is paramount for the success of the reactor.<br/> <br/>The aim of this project was to test regimes simulating steady state operation and high frequency and temperature transient pulses called ELMs (Edge Localized Modes) striking the divertor. Recent research has shown that the degradation and behavior of tungsten under these transient conditions does not consistently follow the expected parameters characterized in the literature. According to it, recrystallization, grain growth, and crack formation seem to be suppressed by the plasma loading under these regimes, thus a new understanding of the material behavior for these circumstances must be developed. To do this, ITER grade tungsten samples were subjected to a hydrogen plasma beam at DIFFER’s Magnum-PSI with temperatures at the strike point ranging from ~1000 to ~1500 °C and high frequency pulses that increased the surface temperature by ~200 to ~300 °C above the steady state temperature. The surface thermal shock response to the plasma pulses was characterized by means of infrared and pyrometer readings at the samples’ surface during exposure. Temperature and power density calculations were correlated with identified damage morphologies on the targets and a damage map for the experiments was elaborated, which showed that the most severe damage (cracks and crack networks) begin to appear in the range of the measured recrystallization temperature of the samples, which was lower than expected.<br/> <br/>Using Vickers hardness, the recovery and recrystallization kinetics of the material were characterized by means of logarithmic decay and a modified version of JMAK recrystallization kinetics that includes an incubation time for the onset of recrystallization. Recrystallization kinetics were found to accelerate as the hydrogen exposure progresses, thus yielding lower effective activation energies for recrystallization when comparing furnace one hour exposures, plasma one hour exposures, and plasma four hour exposures. This pointed to the presence of hydrogen actively reducing the activation energy for self-diffusion. Simulations of hydrogen diffusion were performed to test this hypothesis, and even though the total concentration is low, given that the high experimental temperature does not permit trapping of the hydrogen, the diffusing atoms may still play a role in accelerating the recrystallization kinetics.<br/> <br/>Based on the results of this research, it is proposed that interstitially diffusing hydrogen segregating to voids or grain boundaries is modifying the behavior of surrounding tungsten crystal lattice. Specifically, the mobility of the grain boundaries may be increasing because the hydrogen’s presence would be promoting the creation of ledges in the grain boundary resulting in an overall free energy reduction for grain boundary diffusion. This localized defect formation would require a lower concentration of hydrogen than that required for solute drag or other suppression mechanisms, and might be mechanism behind the behavior observed in this work’s experiments.","Tungsten; Recrystallization; Fusion; Hydrogen; Plasma; JMAK; Recrystallization Kinetics; Recovery Kinetics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This report outlines the research and design processes carried out by Henry Fairbairn, with the support of a supervisory team from consisting of members from the Technical University of Delft and Wageningen University and Research. The SolarMal Project was the first trial to investigate the impact of odour baited mosquito suction traps as a tool for vector control and malaria prevention. Results from the clinical study show that the implementation of mosquito traps across the island of Rusinga, Kenya, lead to a 30% reduction in cases of malaria and 70% reduction in the Anopheles population (Homan et al. 2016). However, further research into mosquito escape behaviour showed the Suna-Trap, used in the SolarMal Trial, had a poor capture performance with less than 4% of approach flights resulting in capture (Cribellier et al. 2018). A study by N.Tubben found that the majority users in were unable to maintain the Solar powered mosquito trapping systems after the project. To be an effective tool for prevention of malaria, it must be possible for users in Africa to sustain the working condition of the trap to continue to reduce biting and even prevent resurgence. Based on findings from this research and an iterative R&amp;D process outlined in this report, it was possible to design an concept for an innovative mosquito trap with a high capture performance which is suitable for further lab testing and field testing. A number if concepts were tested in order to highlight how variant factor effect performance compared to the Suna-Trap. Each concept tested should include as few variables compared to the benchmark Suna-Trap to clearly conclude on how the variant effects performance. Although the testing is not thorough enough to make any scientific conclusions, there is enough data to make a conclusion as to whether incorporating the feature into a new design will increase the capture rate. High performing principals can be further tested in the future. From evaluations of the hypotheses it can be concluded that the additions of heat and moisture increase the capture rate in comparison to a standard Suna-Trap under lab conditions. The addition of hot water and a heating element above the trap canopy showed the most notable improvement compared to the BG Suna-Trap in terms of capture performance. It is thought that the additional heat and moisture in the trap prove more attractive to the target vectors increasing the number of approach flights resulting in more flights into the capture zone. Considering the context factors as well as performance factors highlighted in the research, the final design aims to provide a high performance mosquito trapping solution of which is suitable for use in Africa.","Mosquitoes; malaria; Mass trapping; Africa; Malaria prevention; sustainable design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The environmental conditions and bathymetry around Curacao are analyzed making use of data from the MERCATOR data base. A suitable location is selected and the 100 year wave and current conditions are determined. These conditions are used as input for a parametric model used to dimension the platform and make estimates on the platform weight, buoyancy, stability and mooring dimensions. <br/><br/>The platform, tendons and cold water pipe resulting from the parametric model are consequently modeled in a fully coupled dynamic time domain model making use of finite differences. The dynamically coupled model is consequently used to accurately dimension the cold water pipe, cold water pipe ballast and the constraints that manipulate the motion of the cold water pipe. <br/><br/>The environmental forces on the platform are obtained through linear diffraction software. The resulting frequency dependent wave, added mass and damping coefficients are approximated in the time domain. The resulting time dependent coefficients are used in the dynamic model to assess non-linear system behavior. The non-linearities are due to non-linear mooring forces, drag forces and higher order wave drift forces.<br/><br/>The tendons and cold water pipe are subjected to cyclic loading. To assess the danger of fatigue damage an analysis is conducted using the rainflow method on the load time series at critical points in the structure. Making use of Miners rule the risk of failure due to fatigue of the tendons and cold water pipe is determined. The system is sensitive to varying environmental conditions. To asses the flexibility of deployment several environmental conditions are observed and the risk of failure is assessed for the limit state as well as for fatigue loading. It has been concluded that the cold water pipe, constructed from HDPE, is not at risk of fatigue failure. For the tendons the fatigue damage is more critical. <br/><br/>It has been observed that plastic deformation due to creep has significant influence on the maximum allowable stress in the cold water pipe. Creep occurs at stresses far below the yield stress of the HDPE material. The 20 year plastic deformation due to creep has been estimated making use of Robinson's linear life-fraction rule. Making use of inclined constraints the stress in the cold water pipe is relieved, resulting in a total creep life of 255 years, leading to acceptable levels of deformation over the 20 year lifetime. <br/><br/>The finite difference tension leg platform model has been combined with a hydrodynamic load model for time domain simulation of cross-flow vortex induced vibrations. The hydrodynamic model contains drag, added mass and a cross flow vortex shedding force which is capable of synchronizing with the structural motion. It shows that VIV leads to non-negligible stresses on the cold water pipe. <br/><br/>Based on a cost breakdown for offshore structures a cost estimation is made for the OTEC TLP platform. Using the steel material cost as an indicator the other costs are estimated to come to a total of 13.2M USD for the TLP without the OTEC equipment.","Tension leg platform; TLP; OTEC; Bluerise; structural dynamics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-08-30","","","","","",""

Also, due to the increasing cooling demand, there is a need for sustainable cooling around the equator. This can be supplied by seawater air-conditioning (SWAC). For the cold water supply of such projects, there is a cold water pipe required that could reach to a depth of up to 1000m. The cold water pipe material that is investi¬gated in this thesis is high-density polyethylene (HDPE). The installation of these large diameter cold water pipes is challenging and requires careful attention, as it is one of the most expensive components of an ocean thermal energy project. A dynamic 3D geometrically non-linear Euler-Bernoulli model is developed that allows for large deformations. In this way, the lowering procedure, including lateral current actions on the pipe can be modelled in order to check the structural integrity of the pipe during installation. The model is validated by comparing it to scale model tests in MARIN, which results in a good comparison between the numerical model and scale model tests. Additionally, the model is compared to a geometrically non-linear Timoshenko beam model to estimate whether shear deformation plays a role for large diameter HDPE pipes. Both models showed a good comparison and the for the bending radii that are of interest, shear deformation is negligible. Making use of the numerical Euler-Bernoulli model, a case study is performed for a seawater air-conditioning project in Curaçao. Different installation methods are compared, where the subsurface cur¬rent velocity is an important parameter. This velocity determines the required amount of ballast of the largest section of the pipeline. For high current velocities, the ballast is high, such that there are multiple holding points required along the pipe in order to make it sink in one piece without exceeding the design stress of HDPE. Ballast can be applied by means of concrete blocks along the pipeline. The pipe can be controlled during installation by either buoyancy modules or vessels with tug lines. Another option is to reduce the specific gravity of the pipe and to apply post ballasting by means of rock dumping. The best solution de¬pends on site specific conditions, where detailed current velocity profiles are desired to choose the most cost effective solution. During installation, the currents will have an impact on the lateral deflection of the pipe, which can lead up to a deflection of several hundreds of meters if no measures are taken. Several vessels are required along the pipeline during installation to make sure the pipe is installed on the planned trajectory.","OTEC; SWAC; pipeline; HDPE; installation; ballast; hydrostatic pressure; effective axial stress; scale model test; currents; case study; curacao; shera deformation; Euler-Bernoulli; Euler Bernoulli; Timoshenko; large deformations; submerged pipe","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-08-30","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","","12.1885,68.9609"

New methods are being continuously developed and improved to provide enhanced kinetics and control. Non-photochemical laser induced nucleation (NPLIN) is one of the avenues being looked into extensively since its accidental discovery about two decades ago. Despite providing improved nucleation kinetics and potential polymorph control, the mechanism behind NPLIN is still unknown. Four different theories have been proposed in the literature with varying amounts of agreement between<br/>different research groups.<br/>The main aim of this thesis is to try to determine the mechanism behind NPLIN. This report can be divided into two parts, each focusing on a possible mechanism. The first is the optical Kerr effect,<br/>which involves investigating the effect of polarization of light on glycine polymorph formed. This is achieved by varying the laser light polarisation and number of pulses for a range of glycine <br/> supersaturation. The second part deals with an experimental setup designed to work with microscale volumes. This will give us the capability to isolate the nuclei and observe the events leading up to their formation.<br/>For studying the optical Kerr effect, the experiment performed by Sun et al. was repeated. A significant temperature increase inside the solution was obtained because of exposure to a high number<br/>of pulses (600) of infrared light. No dependence of laser light polarization on polymorph formation was found. The polymorph formed by laser is different than that obtained by crash cooling. In the<br/>second part of the thesis, the attention is shifted towards the role of impurities present in the solution which can also absorb the laser light leading to formation of a cavitation bubble. This possibility was<br/>examined with the help of the setup mentioned above. It was noted that the crystals were nucleating at multiple points around the laser focus at a distance which is similar to the size of the cavitation bubble previously reported in literature. These observations made can be attributed towards the presence of a bubble.<br","NPLIN; Crystallization; Nucleation; Glycine; Optical Kerr Effect; Cavitation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

The Paris Climate Agreement, among other policies, has shifted the focus towards usage of renewable energy sources. Currently, the renewable market caters predominantly to meeting the electric demand, which only represents 19% of the world's energy consumption. Zero Emission Fuels (ZEF) aims to create a small-scale chemical plant that uses renewable energy sources to create synthetic methanol. This follows the vision of adapting renewable energy sources for non-electric usage. Methanol is the simplest liquid hydrocarbon at atmospheric condition; it can be used as a fuel or as a base chemical for other products. Presently, the industry reforms syngas obtained from fossil fuels to create methanol, predominantly using large-scale catalytic reactors. For production of methanol from renewable sources, Bos and Brilman developed a small-scale catalytic reactor driven by natural circulation. ZEF adapted the Brilman reactor for their chemical plant, creating a prototype of the modified Brilman reactor (MBR). The present work aims to create a model that describes the steady-state methanol production of the prototype using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and chemical process models.<br/><br/>The MBR is an innovative design based on a closed loop geometry. The gases are driven by buoyant forces from a temperature difference between the high-temperature catalytic reaction zone and the low-temperature condensation zone. Heat recovery elements are used to exchange heat between the hot and cold streams as they travel in the loop. The CFD model developed on Fluent 18.2, uses a RNG k-e turbulent model, with multicomponent species transport, convective heat transfer and momentum loss effects from the catalytic zone. The boundary conditions are based on the operating conditions of the prototype. The model calculates flow-rate, and the effect of heat recovery elements inside the natural circulation loop. A chemical process model developed in COCO 3.2 is used to calculate a mass and energy balance for the two-phase behavior of the gas mixture inside the MBR. <br/><br/>A study of the effects of a natural circulation loop with a configuration similar to the reactor is performed, observing potential benefits by tilting the system. The combination of effects due to heat recovery and flow blockage in the reactor is studied, and the results are evaluated with experimental measurements. The chemical process model developed closely resembles the experimental characterization of the reactor. The parameters of flow-rate and internal temperatures can not be validated due to limited data available from experimental procedures.<br","Methanol synthesis; CFD Simulation; Modeling; Natural circulation; Chemical process","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-12-01","","","","","",""

As negations are usually present in a small part of much larger datasets, it is important to recognize these relatively rare negation structures within objects' data. Correctly recognizion and handling negations could improve overall classification performance in machine learning problems that inhibit negations in some of their dataset objects.

Furthermore, a comparison between several discrepancies between S2 and L8 (e.g. AC and co-registration) are studied since it is a crucial issue especially in temporal applications such as MOSES. On the one hand, the results showed that a harmonization of the two products is certainly needed.

However, natural formations (including geothermal ones) extend large length scales (in the order of km), while their properties (e.g., heat and flow conductivity) can change in small (fine) scales (e.g., cm or even below). As such, accurate simulations of filed-scale models are too expensive to be handled by the state-of-the-art commercial simulators. As a matter of fact, these geological models are upscaled excessively in order to reduce the computational costs. Excessive upscaling leads to loss of accuracy and details of the heterogeneous properties, which can result in non-optimum production estimation and operation strategies. As a remedy, in this work, we propose a dynamic multilevel method (ADM) which captures small-scale heterogeneity (i.e., accurate) while preserving the computational efficiency (thus applicable to field-scale models). This development is achieved by combining two major concepts: (1) multiscale basis functions for accurate coarse-scale treatment of heat and flow conductive properties at their original fine-scale, and (2) adaptive mesh refinement strategy to minimise the requirement for employing the fine-scale grid, i.e., when and where needed. These two developments combined in one framework allows for both accurate and efficient simulation of coupled flow-heat equations in subsurface geothermal reservoirs. The fine-scale grid is employed only at the cold water front, where most of the nonlinear (and grid resolution sensitive) interaction is taking place. The rest of the domain is solved at the coarser scales, depending on the gradients (slope of change) of the unknowns. Note that no upscaling is needed due to the employment of multiscale basis functions. Moreover, these basis functions are calculated only once at the beginning and reused for the rest of the time-dependent simulations. Our method allows for non-thermal equilibrium between rock and injected fluid, so to allow for full flexibility and possible added accuracy. Through several test cases, the accuracy of the proposed ADM is investigated by measuring its error compared with the fine-scale fully resolved simulation. Its accuracy, on the other hand, is measured through calculating the average number of active grid cells. Our results, for both homogeneous and heterogeneous models, show that the proposed method employs a fraction of the fine-scale grids to deliver accurate solutions. Therefore, it provides a promising framework for field-scale simulation of geothermal reservoirs.<br","multiscale methods; Heat transfer; geothermal reservoir","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-12-31","","","","","",""

These capital expenditure overruns have long been recognised, yet no method is available predicting the probability a mining project will experience an overrun.<br/><br/>This thesis introduces a method to assess the likelihood and magnitude of an initial capital expenditure overrun occurring for future gold mining projects. A database is populated with 65 gold mining projects that have experienced an overrun. For each project, 19 variables are described in the database that define the projects. The variables are analysed using individual variable analysis and multivariate regression analysis to investigate whether a correlation can be found between the variables and the initial capital expenditure overrun. Using the results of the individual variable analysis, a tool is developed to semi-quantify the risk a future gold mining project is exposed to regarding an initial capital expenditure overrun. The tool can visualise the risk a project is exposed to in a 2D risk matrix displaying the likelihood and magnitude of a possible overrun.<br/><br/>For 16 of the 19 variables a possible correlation is found. The variables are grouped together, representing root causes with regards to the initial capital expenditure overrun. The database analysis suggests that relatively small gold mining projects experience a larger capital expenditure overrun than large gold mining projects. In addition, projects owned by relatively large companies tend to experience a larger capital expenditure overrun. Furthermore, projects where a low number of payback years or a high internal rate of return presented in the bankable feasibility study indicate a profitable project tend to experience a smaller capital expenditure overrun. Finally, the database suggests a correlation between the relative gold price and the capital expenditure overrun. Projects from which the bankable feasibility study was published when the gold price was relatively high, tend to experience initial capital expenditure overruns more frequent and with a larger magnitude. Using the correlations resulting from the database analysis, a predictive tool is successfully developed for which future gold mining projects can be assessed on initial capital expenditure overrun risk.","Capex Overrun; Gold Mine; Feasibility Study","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recent approaches presented promising solutions relying on training NER algorithms in a iterative distantly-supervised fashion, thus limiting human interaction to only providing a small set of seed terms. Such approaches heavily rely on heuristics in order to cope with the limited training data size. As these heuristics are prone to failure, the overall achievable performance is limited.<br/>In this thesis we introduce Coner: A collaborative approach to incrementally incorporate human feedback on the relevance of extracted entities into the training cycle of such iterative NER algorithms. Coner allows to still train new domain specific rare long-tail NER extractors with low costs, but with ever increasing performance while the algorithm is actively used. We do so by employing our intelligent entity selection mechanism that solely selects and visualises extracted entities with the highest potential knowledge gain from users interacting with them and providing feedback on facet relevance. Additionally, users can add new typed entities they deem relevant. Our Coner collaborative human feedback pipeline consists of three novel modules; a document analyser that extracts deep metadata from documents and selects a representative set of publications from a corpus to receive human feedback on, an interactive document viewer that allows users to give feedback on and add new typed entities simply by selecting the relevant text with their mouse and an explicit entity feedback analyser that calculates a facet relevance score through users' majority vote for each recognised entity. The resulting Coner entity facet relevance scores are then incorporated in the TSE-NER training cycle to boost the expansion and filtering heuristic steps. Remarkably, we revealed that even with limited availability of human resources we were able to boost TSE-NER's performance by up to 23.1% in terms of recall, up to 5.7% in terms of precision and the F-score with 13.1% depending on the setup of our smart entity selection mechanism and instructions given to evaluators.","Information Extraction; Named Entity Recognition; Document Metadata; Long-Tail Entity Types; Human Feedback; Crowdsourcing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although there are quite a few techniques in practice for strengthening of concrete structures -reinforced or prestressed, various factors limit their efficiency and performance. Use of novel concrete-based materials such as Ultra High Performance Fibre Reinforced Composite (UHPFRC) can lead to an effective strengthening system due to the exceptional material properties of UHPFRC. In particular, the strain hardening behavior of UHPFRC in tension and its excellent durability. Out of the two main mechanisms of failure in concrete elements namely flexure failure and shear failure, shear failure is the most critical due to the abrupt nature of its mechanisms that leads to complete collapse of the structures with no sign of warning. This makes shear strengthening of prestressed concrete structures, that typically form the supporting elements in large infrastructural units such as bridges, a very essential course of action. To investigate the effectiveness of using UHPFRC in shear strengthening of prestressed concrete elements, the post-tensioned T girders of Helperzoom bridge, Groningen, Netherlands are chosen as reference beams which are strengthened with UHPFRC. The reference beams are subjected to a 3-point bending test to determine their failure mechanism and structural capacity. The reference beam is modelled, and tests are simulated by finite element analysis using ATENA. Since the simulated beam failure in shear compression rather than shear tension by localization of the shear tension crack. In order to understand this behavior and the failure mechanism and to check if the results from the simulations are reasonable, a detailed analysis is performed. The influence of shear reinforcement and prestressing, active in the critical shear region, on the shear capacity and the final failure mode are investigated. The results from the numerical analysis are compared to the results from experimental shear tests performed on existing post-tensioned girders which exhibit a similar mode of failure as observed in the reference T beams. The shear capacity of the reference T beam is also calculated from the Flexural Shear Crack Model proposed by Huber et.al and it is seen that the shear capacity from the numerical analysis from ATENA is in close match to that obtained from the analytical model. The contribution of the arching effect to the shear capacity calculated from the model is between 77% and 87% for the beams tested in this research and the contribution is between 28% and 58% in the beams tested in the experiment. In the last step, the effectiveness of strengthening the reference beam with UHPFRC is determined. The results show that the effect of strengthening with UHPFRC is maximum in the reference beam without stirrups and prestressing both in terms of shear capacity and ductility.<br/><br","strengthening; Ultra-High Performance Fibre Reinforced Concrete; Shear Failure; Shear Tension Crack","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Meanwhile, attacks over the Internet have been growing both qualitatively and quantitatively, with losses transcending the financial kind and threatening the well-being of human lives. This trend fuels the need for Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI), to change our reactive nature and start pro-actively tackling the online threats. This necessity has engendered the establishment of a number of CTI service providers. To ensure optimum expenditure, an organization would be best served by only procure intel on threats relevant to it. Hence, a scheme enabling organizations to choose the right subset of CTI service providers, to obtain the maximum amount of intel relevant to them, is needed. This scheme, however, is obliged to maintain the privacy of the inputs of all parties involved, lest the intel is leaked to the adversaries. Privacy-Preserving Set Operations offers the necessary properties and primitives to devise such a scheme. However, constructing protocols from existing solutions is infeasible, due to the exponential dependence, of their asymptotic complexities, on the number of participants in the protocol. This dissertation aims to devise protocols to enable the discussed scheme, in a feasible and privacy-preserving manner.<br/><br/>In this thesis, we introduce a type of composite set operations which we denote as combinatorial set operations. We construct four efficient, privacy-preserving protocols to compute the set union-combinatorial intersection cardinalities between multiple mistrusting parties, in honest-but-curious and covert adversaries models, to solve our research goal. The protocols compute the intersection cardinality between a set and all union combinations of a number of other sets, while maintaining the privacy of the set elements. All the protocols proposed in this thesis claim asymptotic complexities quadratically dependent on the number of parties involved in the protocol, while the best current alternative is constrained by an exponential dependence on the same. A comparative implementation of our principal protocol in the covert adversaries model boasts an overall computation time of 1 minute, for 15 parties with 5 elements in each party’s set. The best current alternative requires 56.5 minutes under the same initial conditions. Moreover, even after increasing the number of participants and elements to 50 and 100, respectively, our protocols outperformed the best current alternative subject to the previous initial constraints (15 parties with 5 elements). We hope that the promising results obtained in this work pave the way to help organizations in navigating the increasingly complex threat environment, allowing them to pro-actively combat the rising wave of cybercrime.","Privacy-preserving; Cyber Threat Intelligence; Cyber Security; Privacy-preserving set operations","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Foam is generated in porous media when exceeding a critical velocity and pressure gradient, that usually occur near to an injection well. There is the uncertainty of foam generation in the low-pressure gradient and velocity further from the injection well. However, foam can be generated at such a permeability change with no minimum pressure gradient or superficial velocity. In field application, permeability contrasts originate from cross-bedding in fluvial sand-channel reservoirs, reservoir layering, and sharp heterogeneity changes over a few centimeters to kilometers of the formation.<br/><br/>This study describes series of experiments with various of gas fractional flows, and injection velocities. The experiments use synthetic sintered glass porous media to create consolidated nature of porous medium with a sharp boundary between low- and high-permeability layers. The experiments are augmented by the medical X-ray computerized tomography (CT) machine, which can be used to generate dynamic images of the core flood.<br/><br/>This study proves that capillary snap-off plays a dominant role in foam generation across a sharp heterogeneity boundary (low to high permeability) regardless of the superficial injection velocity that is applied in the system. In our experiments, as the injection velocity reduced, the magnitude of pressure fluctuations increase. Across the permeability jump, as the injection velocity reduces, the observed pressure gradient during foam generation is also higher. However, foam is difficult to propagate at very low injection velocity, in our case 0.17 ft/day (0.025 ml/min). These conditions observed at sintered glass core with permeability contrast 3.8:1 (0.17 ft/day and 80% of foam quality) and permeability contrast 14:1 (0.17 ft/day and 95% of foam quality). In terms of gas fractional flow, the CT results verify the pressure gradient profile at different gas fractional flow experiments (60%, 80\%, and 95%), foam is indeed generated at the permeability contrast and propagates downstream to the outlet of the core.","Foam generation; capillary snap-off; fractional flow; injection velocity; permeability contrast","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These problems are attributed to the softening material behaviour and the iterative nature of the Newton-Raphson type methods used in NLFEA. However, robust numerical simulations become increasingly important, for example due to recent developments in Groningen. <br/>To address these issues, sequentially linear analysis (SLA) was developed which exploits the fact that a linear analysis is inherently stable. By assuming a stepwise material degradation the nonlinear response of a structure can be approximated with a sequence of linear analyses. Although this approach has been proven to be effective for several case studies, the numerical performance is still a problem that has to be solved. After every linear analysis, a single element is damaged resulting in incremental damage. As a result, the system of equations only changes locally between these linear analyses. Traditional solution techniques do not exploit this property and calculate a matrix factorisation every linear analysis, resulting in high computational times per analysis step. Since SLA typically requires many linear analyses to obtain the desired structural response, this leads to unacceptable analysis times. The aim of this thesis is to improve the computational performance of SLA by developing numerical solution techniques which exploit the incremental approach of SLA. To this extend, the following methods have been developed.<br/>A direct solution technique has been developed which is based on the Woodbury matrix identity. This identity allows for the numerically cheap computation of the inverse of a low-rank corrected matrix. In this approach, the expensive matrix factorisation does not have to be calculated every linear analysis step. Instead, the old factorisation can be reused along with some additional matrix- and vector multiplications and solving a significantly smaller linear system of equations. An optimal strategy is derived to determine at which point a new factorisation should be calculated.<br/>An improved preconditioner for the conjugate gradient (CG) method has been developed. Instead of an incomplete factorisation, the complete factorisation is used as a preconditioner which reduces the number of required CG iterations significantly. The point at which too many CG iterations are required and a new factorisation is necessary, is determined using the same strategy as the first method. From numerical experiments it follows that both methods perform significantly better than the direct solution method, especially for large 3-dimensional problems. The best performance is achieved using the Woodbury matrix identity resulting in the solver no longer being the dominant factor in SLA. Furthermore, significantly larger problems are not solvable in time frames in which previously only smaller problems were solved.","Finite Element Analysis; Preconditioning; Structural analysis; Direct method; Iterative method; Low-rank matrix correction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics","",""

The strategy proposes a number of key points, of which the most eye-catching one is the organizational structure with a cellular organization.<br/>To test whether QRM can make a beneficial change to the preprocessing department, a numerical simulation model is<br/>constructed to resemble the processes taking place. It is found that the critical path of the process is defined by parts that are ground and flanged and that parts spend around ten working days in the preprocessing department. The key points of QRM are applied and a cellular organization is proposed. This leads to a reduction in lead time of 88% and an increase in annual throughput of 73%. It is concluded that indeed there is a match between QRM and the preprocessing stage of shipbuilding and the strategy can make a real change.","Production Optimization; Quick Response Manufacturing (QRM); Preprocessing; Shipbuilding","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-08-30","","","","Marine Technology | Ship Production","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution); Technical University of Denmark (degree granting institution)","2018","Aeroelastic codes are fundamental for the design of wind turbines and the prediction of instabilities. Such codes rely on engineering models which limit their accuracy. With wind turbine blades becoming more slender to lower the costs, it is important to reduce these uncertainties to maintain a safe and stable turbine design. The dynamic stall model is one of these engineering models which simplifies the physics involved and so an improvement in accuracy might be possible. Various dynamic stall models have been published over the last 50 years. However, dynamic stall has proven to be a complex phenomenon to model accurately over a wide range of conditions and is an ongoing topic of research.<br/>Here four semi-empirical dynamic stall models, the Øye, Risø, Snel and ONERA models, are compared first in 2D against wind tunnel data to understand their accuracy and limitations. The experimental data for this comparison uses the NACA0015, NACA0030 and NACA4415 airfoils over a variety of cases relevant to wind turbines. Hereafter the models are compared within an aeroelastic code as a part of complete horizontal axis wind turbine simulations for<br/>an extreme load case (IEC design load case 1.4), standstill instabilities (IEC design load case 6.2) and the flutter speed to understand the effect of the different dynamic stall models. For the standstill cases the aerodynamic damping provided by each model is compared by reducing the structural damping of the blades to find the point where the blades become unstable. Next the Øye and Risø models are tuned to the wind tunnel data. The results from the 2D comparison are inconclusive with each model showing different strengths<br/>and weaknesses. In general the attached flow physics in the Risø and ONERA models improves the fit for the 15% thick airfoils. The ONERA model captures the lift peak the best, although it usually has the largest least squares error to the data due to the drop in lift after this peak being too early and too sharp. Once in the aeroelastic code the ONERA model started to show unphysical behaviour by reducing the deflection in the extreme load case and adding negative<br/>damping to the standstill cases. Snel’s model, on the other hand, adds so much damping that the blades remains stable even when the blades have only a small amount of structural damping, which is likely not physical. The Øye and Risø models show similar damping levels and reduce the required structural damping to prevent the standstill instabilities by at least a factor two with respect to no dynamic stall model being used. For the classical flutter analysis the Risø model shows an increase in flutter speed as expected from the implementation of Theodorsen’s theory, while the ONERA model decreases the flutter limit.<br/>Overall the Risø model is seen as the best for in an aeroelastic code due to showing better behaviour in the full turbine cases than the ONERA and Snel models. Furthermore, it is superior to the Øye model due to correctly modeling the attached flow physics and improving the drag and moment coefficients.","dynamic stall; Instability; wind; Wind Energy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering | Aerodynamics and Wind Energy","",""

However, CT imaging relies on harmful ionizing radiation. Thus medical imaging scientists are working on transferring harmless MRI scans to CT-like images where using deep learning methods are the current state of the art. Most deep learning methods however require large amounts of paired data to train the transfer systems, which is why we try to perform the transfer using an unpaired method, CycleGANs. Using ex-vivo dog hip MRI and CT scan pairs we trained a CycleGAN and a U-Net using both registered and poorly registered data. We also further investigated the effect of discriminator’s receptive field size in a CycleGAN as well as introduced a novel NMI loss component to its generators. Performance of said systems was evaluated by calculating MAE and Dice scores. We show that CycleGAN's performance is sensitive to its discriminator's receptive field size and can even generate unwanted structrures in the CT-like images. Also, we show that adding NMI loss component with the right weight can improve the system’s performance. The results of comparing the pairwise and unpaired method show that a CycleGAN will only outperform the U-Net when transferring poorly registered data. This suggest that, whenever paired registered data is available, it is better to use a pairwise transfer approach. However, the results of the experiment where the NMI loss component was added suggest that transfer from MRI scans to CT-like images can become more accurate and encourage further research. Finally, this means in certain cases CT scans could be avoided, providing a more harmless medical imaging future.","Medical Imaging; MRI; CT; Deep Learning; CycleGAN","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","Hot-dip galvanizing is a well-known process to increase the corrosion resistance of steel. As a by-product dross is formed in the Zn-bath. The dross particles are composed of Fe, Al and Zn in the form of Fe2Al5Znx and interact with the hardware that is submerged in the Zn-bath and eventually accumulate on the surface of the hardware. This accumulation of dross on the hardware is known as dross build-up.<br/><br/>Dross is formed in the Zn-bath as a result of the dissolution of Fe from the steel strip. This Fe reacts with Al present in the liquid Zn forming the Fe2Al5Znx dross particles. Once the hardware is submerged in the liquid Zn a thin compact Fe2Al5-layer is formed on top of the surface of the hardware, known as the diffusion layer. This diffusion layer acts as a barrier for Fe towards the Zn-bath and Zn towards the hardware surface. Once the diffusion layer is formed dross particles precipitate on top of this diffusion layer followed by a slow growth of the intermetallic dross particles. The diffusion layer and accumulated intermetallic dross particles are known as the dross build-up. The thickness of this dross build-up depends on immersion time, bath temperature and bath chemistry and varies typically between 90 μm up to several millimetres.<br/>The dross build-up is thought to be a critical factor in the bath hardware lifetime. The surface quality of the bath hardware directly influences the quality of products produced on the galvanizing line. More dross in the Zn-bath could lead to more defects in the coating, which could lead to failure when the steel strips are processed further, or giving the coating on the steel strip a bad appearance. Because of the dross build-up on the hardware, the bath hardware is changed every 4-6 weeks. By controlling the dross in the Zn-bath, the service lifetime of the hardware could possibly be extended. When the service lifetime of the hardware is extended the maintenance downtime and costs of the galvanizing lines are reduced.<br/><br/>Recently, Tata Steel introduced a new type of Zn-coating: MagiZinc (MZ). This type of Zn-coating differs from the conventional Zn-coating: Conventional Zn-coating (GI) consists of Zn with 0,30 wt% Al whereas MagiZinc consists of Zn with 1,60 wt% Al and 1,60 wt% Mg. This difference in composition has an influence on the dross build-up formed on the hardware. At Tata Steel, there is some evidence that the dross build-up layer on the bath hardware created in the conventional Zn-bath is diminishing when the hardware is submerged in the MagiZinc-bath.<br/>This thesis project aims to identify the characteristics of this cleaning behaviour in MagiZinc of the dross build-up that is formed on bath hardware when submerged in conventional Zn.<br/><br/>Based on the results obtained from experiments in this study it can be concluded that the delamination process of the intermetallic dross particles is a combination of intergranular diffusion of Zn and crack formation as a result of thermal shock.<br/><br/>By changing the baths from conventional Zn to MagiZinc the composition of the bath changes. As a result the thermodynamic stability of the intermetallic Fe2Al5Znx dross particles change with respect to the liquid Zn-phase in such a way that the intermetallic dross particles partly dissolve in the liquid MagiZinc. As a result, the intermetallic dross particle/liquid Zn interface changes from a faceted to a curved interface. As a consequence of this change in structure intergranular diffusion can take place between the intermetallic dross particles. By the intergranular diffusion of Zn the cohesion of the grain boundaries of the intermetallic dross particles is reduced. This reduction in cohesion is probably the start of the delamination of the intermetallic dross particles, breaking into smaller pieces at the grain boundaries when enriched with Zn.<br/>The diffusion layer remains largely unaffected in the delamination process due to the better adhesion to the hardware surface compared with the adhesion of the intermetallic dross particles to the diffusion layer. The better adhesion of the diffusion layer to the hardware surface is the result of diffusion of Cr and Ni from the 316L SS substrate into the liquid Zn at time of immersion. The area from where Cr and Ni are dissolved, Al is diffusing into the 316L SS substrate forming the diffusion layer. Simultaneously the intermetallic dross particles form at the hardware surface. This layer is mainly formed from Fe and Al from the bath, not from the 316L SS substrate.<br/>Due to this limited bonding between the intermetallic dross particles and the diffusion layer the intermetallic dross particles are more prone to crack formation due to thermal shock.<br/><br/>By changing the Zn-bath from conventional Zn to MagiZinc and vice versa the hardware and thus also the dross build-up rapidly cools down to room temperature. This thermal shock creates stresses within the intermetallic dross particle-layer. Due to a difference in thermal expansion between the 316L stainless steel matrix and the intermetallic dross particle-layer large cracks form in the intermetallic dross particle-layer. When the hardware is immersed again in liquid Zn the cracks still exist and these cracks accelerate the delamination process of the dross build-up structure. This observed mechanism is independent from the type of Zn-bath that the hardware is immersed in. The process also takes place when the hardware is taken out a conventional Zn-bath and placed back into a conventional Zn-bath.","Materials science; hot-dip; galvanizing; tata steel; tata; dross; dross build-up; build-up; continuous galvanizing; magizinc; zinc; bath hardware; hardware; pot hardware; intergranular diffusion; crack formation; Zn-Al; Zn-Al-Mg; faceted","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Materials Science and Engineering","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","Abstract<br/>The Quenching and Partitioning (Q&amp;P) process starts with an austenitization process followed by rapid cooling to a temperature named quenching temperature ranged between the martensite start (M<sub>s</sub>) and martensite finish (M<sub>f</sub>) temperatures to establish initial fractions of martensite and austenite. Afterwards, the material is reheated to a particular partitioning temperature and for a given time to allow the carbon diffusion from martensite to austenite. Finally, the steel is quenched to room temperature and a fraction of fresh untempered martensite may form from the least stable austenite. The whole process determines the phase fraction of the constituent phases, namely: tempered martensite (M<sub>1</sub>), retained austenite, and un-tempered martensite (M<sub>2</sub>). This combination of phases has the potential to simultaneously improve strength and elongation of steels due to their small grain sizes and the transformation-induced plasticity resulting of the transformation of the retained austenite into martensite during a deformation. <br/>It is known that the fraction of retained austenite of Q&amp;P steels depends on the quenching temperature, showing a bell-like relation. The volume fraction of retained austenite shows a maximum at a particular quenching temperature somewhat intermediate between the M<sub>s</sub> and M<sub>f</sub> temperatures, known as the optimum quenching temperature, below and upper which the volume fraction of retained austenite decreases in either way. <br/>Recently, it is reported [1] that retained austenite fraction after reheating up to 700<sup>o</sup>C followed by quench losses its dependency of quenching temperature and reaches a constant value. This can be a manner to further control phase fractions and consequently the mechanical properties of Q&amp;P steels. The mechanisms by which the volume fraction of austenite changes to reach that constant value are not well understood and are the focus of the present study. <br/>In the present work, Q&amp;P samples with chemical composition 0.31C-4.58Mn-1.52Si (wt.%) were reheated up to 700<sup>o</sup>C and quenched directly to compare the retained austenite fractions of reheated and un-reheated (Q&amp;P) samples. It was found that the retained austenite fractions tend to have a constant value after reheating to 700<sup>o</sup>C followed by quenching, whereas the retained austenite fraction of the Q&amp;P samples showed an optimum value and usual dependency with quenching temperature. It was also observed that the highest and lowest drop of retained austenite occurred in the reheated Q&amp;P samples at 160<sup>o</sup>C and 80<sup>o</sup>C of quenching temperature. These samples were reheated to 900<sup>o</sup>C to have a complete observation of microstructural events by means of dilatometry, optical and electron scanning microscopy, hardness, and X-Ray diffraction measurement. <br/>Interrupted reheating was applied to understand the microstructural changes during reheating. The two samples were interruptedly reheated and directly quenched at 450<sup>o</sup>C, 530<sup>o</sup>C, 610<sup>o</sup>C, 720<sup>o</sup>C, and 740<sup>o</sup>C to measure the retained austenite fraction and to capture the corresponding microstructure around the observed changes in slope. The retained austenite fractions evolution of both samples were measured and compared. It was found that the decreasing of retained austenite fraction started around the critical temperature of 600<sup>o</sup>C and remained up to 700<sup>o</sup>C of reheating temperature. Further reheating process increased the retained austenite fraction. <br/>In the specimen showing the lowest drop of retained austenite fraction, retained austenite decomposed by two mechanisms. The first one was the formation of discrete particles of cementite, which originally came from film type austenite. The second was the formation of globular carbides within tempered martensite. On the other hand, river-like patterns were observed surrounding the martensite region. The river-like patterns mainly consist of martensite from new austenite that formed between 720<sup>o</sup>C and 750<sup>o</sup>C.<br/>In the highest drop of retained austenite fraction sample, retained austenite decomposed by three mechanisms. The first two mechanisms were similar to the previous sample. The last mechanism was the formation of substructure within Martensite-Austenite islands. River-like patterns were also observed surrounding the martensite region, consisting of martensite which originally came from new austenite as a product of (martensite and) carbide transformation that formed between 720<sup>o</sup>C and 745C and lath martensite which originally came from the unstable austenite forming upon reheating to 740<sup>o</sup>C.","quenching and partitioning; reheating; dilatometry; retained austenite decomposition; carbides; microstructure","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Materials Science and Engineering","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","The aim of this project was to develop an automated tool which can help monitoring agents to identify abnormal building behaviour by making use of the electricity master meter data. One of the most important requirements for this project was that a regression model is the starting point of the automated tool. Therefore, it was decided that, with this requirement and the published methods from literature, an anomaly detection with a n-fold determined threshold was a worthwhile method to be researched. Based on the anomaly detection method, an automated tool was developed that uses an RMSE error measure and n-fold defined threshold. A change point was detected when the error measure jumped from below to above the threshold. If a change point was detected, the origin of the change could be researched by evaluating the regression error before and after the change point for different domains: outside temperature, hour of the day, day of the week, solar irradiance, wind speed and relative humidity. To validate the change detector, it was tested by introducing artificial anomalies in two different scenarios. The first scenario regarded a commercial building with a heat pump where malfunctioning of the heat pump lead to an increase of the electricity consumption. The second scenario considered a commercial building with a ventilation system where a schedule change lead to unwanted activity of the system outside of office hours. In total, four experiments were performed to validate the change detector. In the first experiment, the True Positive Probability (TPP) was determined for window size 1 to 30 for a False Positive Probability (FPP) &lt; 0.05. In the second experiment, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was plotted for window size 1, 7, 14 and 28 to see the ratio between the TPP and FPP for the full course. The third experiment determined the response curve. The response curve showed the TPP as a function of 30 observation points from the start of the anomalous behaviour. Last, the fourth experiment determined the F1 score curve for different threshold values. The F1 score tries to find the optimum between the `recall' and `precision'. The results showed that the developed tool can help to identify abnormal building behaviour by making use of the electricity master meter data. However, from the research it was obtained that the detector has difficulties detecting small changes (i.e. small with regards to the electricity master meter data). Though, the probability to detect a small change is higher for a large window size compared to a small window size. On the other hand, for a larger window size it will take longer for the change detector to detect anomalies since more time is needed to fully cover the window with anomalous behaviour. Last, the n-fold approach to determine the threshold did not result in the desired threshold (desired location in the ROC curve and maximum F1 score), but the abnormal behaviour was detected in most cases.","Anomaly Detection; Monitoring system; Build enviroment","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-08-30","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

EQE characterization gives deeper insights into the opto-electrical properties, current generation and recombination mechanisms in solar cells. Conventional EQE characterization of solar cells are done using a monochromator and lock-in amplifier. These measurements take a few minutes to completely resolve the spectral response of a solar cell in the visible and near infrared (VIS/NIR) region of the spectrum. Having faster EQE measurement setups will aid in faster solar cell characterization both in research and industrial production environments.<br/><br/>In this work a promising fast EQE measurement prototype called Fast Optical Measurement System (FOMS) developed by Delft Spectral Technologies (DST) is investigated. The FOMS prototype currently can operate only with a modulation scheme (a sequence of images) based on Michelson interferometer. The FOMS prototype hence cannot test other more suitable modulation schemes. To overcome this limitation a model to mimic the working of the FOMS prototype was developed by characterizing the existing setup which involved spectral distribution and intensity variations measurements. Various sub-functions were developed based on the characterization results and they were used to develop the model that could predict the spectrum on each pixel of the image loaded on the system. The developed model takes images corresponding to different modulation schemes as input and predicts the current output for each image. The model was finally validated by generating a new modulation scheme based on monochromatic EQE system. The percentage error in the current generated by the model and the prototype was around 3\% which is within permissible limits.<br/><br/>In the future the developed model can serve as a tool to quickly test new modulation schemes that can make the FOMS prototype faster and more accurate. Further research with respect to developing images based on more suitable modulation schemes can help avoid the mathematical complexities in the Michelson interferometer based modulation scheme. Developing appropriate post-processing steps to complement the modulation schemes will help in obtaining the EQE characteristics of the device under test from the current predicted by the model.","Fast EQE; Fast Optical Measurement System; Digital Micromirror Device","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","For present-day drilling operations in deep and challenging well sections, a technology called casing while drilling can be used. It involves isolating and ‘casing’ a formation while drilling, where the casing itself is used as the drill pipe, which is cemented in after a certain depth is reached. By doing this, the need for separate casing runs will be eliminated and well stability is improved. The concept has become increasingly popular since the beginning of the 21st century, due to an increase in technical possibilities and use of this technique, which makes it more profitable.<br/>To enlarge a wellbore past its original drilled size, to enable lowering of the casing, an underreamer is used. Under reaming can be performed in a reaming while drilling (RWD) configuration. To perform these operations, the bottom-hole assembly (BHA) containing the underreamer is lowered in the casing string to a depth just below the casing shoe. Afterwards, drilling fluids are used to fill the casing and pumps will be engaged to drive a hydraulic piston in the underreamer assembly that opens the cutter blades. Hydraulic pressure is used to fold the blades outward and prohibits closure of the tool.<br/>The width of the reamed borehole is not only determined by the outer diameter of the casing couplings that have to fit thru, but there also has to be a clearance for the drilling mud. The annular space between the borehole and casing is relatively small which causes relatively high friction losses during current operation. Because of this, the dynamic pressure loss of the drilling fluid along the outside of the casing becomes too high. To lower the pressure, the borehole needs to be enlarged further than possible with underreamers currently available. There are also limitations on the length of the underreamer. From tests carried out by Huisman, it is found that an increase in length has adverse effects on the steering behaviour of the BHA. Therefore, the length of the reamer should be kept at a minimum.<br/>The DRILLSTAR Z600H design that is currently being used does not allow for a diameter enlargement. New concepts must be devised to enable this. A solution to this problem can provide Huisman Well Technology (HWT) with the opportunity to perform the drilling of more and deeper wells.<br/>A solution to the problem was found by splitting the piston and spring internally. This enabled the spring to be placed in the top part of the underreamer while the piston remains in the lower part. The blocks are located in the middle and fold out eccentrically to reach a hole diameter of 228.6 mm (9 inch). The angle under which the blocks fold out has been reduced from 60 degrees to 45 degrees to allow the underreamer to be shorter by 66 mm.","underreamer; casing while drilling; drilling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-08-30","","","","","",""

This study assessed a novel multimodal brain imaging technique namely Variational Bayesian Multimodal Encephalography (VBMEG), which combines EEG, anatomical MRI and diffusion weighted imaging (DWI), to estimation brain dynamic information flow and its changes following a stroke. EEG data were acquired from individuals suffering from a stroke as well as able-bodied participants while electrical stimuli were delivered sequentially at their index finger in the left and right hand, respectively. The locations of active sources related to this stimulus were precisely identified, resulting in high Variance Accounted For (VAF above 80%). An accurate estimation of dynamic information flow between sources was achieved in this study, showing a high VAF (above 88%) in the cross-validation test. The estimated dynamic information flow was compared between chronic hemiparetic stroke and able-bodied individuals, using matrices lateralization index and activation complexity. The results demonstrate the feasibility of VBMEG method in revealing the changes of information flow in the brain after stroke. This study verified the VBMEG method as an advanced computational approach to track the dynamic information flow in the brain following a stroke. This may lead to the development of a quantitative tool for monitoring functional changes of the cortical neural networks after a unilateral brain injury and therefore facilitate the research into, and the practice of stroke rehabilitation.","EEG; diffusion MRI; dynamic information flow; VBMEG","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-08-30","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

Resource description has been under the spotlight in recent years. Educational platforms can benefit from good resource organisation and description, thereby providing a higher quality of services and attracting more learners to use their systems. Furthermore, well-described resources with metadata, promote content sharing and re-use. <br/>This work starts with an extensive literature research on metadata generation techniques and breaks the findings down to metadata types. A detailed taxonomy of metadata types, based on this research, is provided. The taxonomy takes into account properties common to these types. Second, this work analyzes the state-of-the-art metadata collection techniques in literature and real-world educational content repositories including a showcase with the TUDelft library, in order to estimate the gap of metadata employment in the field of education. Following the results of this research and based on the observation that similar steps are often performed together, a set of easy-to-follow and generic enough design patters for generating metadata was identified. These design patterns aim at assisting content authors or data professionals with filling in metadata and thereafter, allowing for feature development or improvement in the respective platforms. The patterns for metadata extraction are based on the identified taxonomy of metadata. Finally, semantic metadata is extracted as proof of concept for two of the proposed patterns. A satisfactory to a high-quality result was achieved, showing that the patterns are intuitive and the data extracted with them, can be potentially used to describe the respective Educational Resource (ER) by adding the extracted information to its metadata.<br","design patterns; metadata extraction; educational resources; information extraction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science | Web Information Systems","",""

(mentor); Fadili, Ali (mentor); Vincent-Bonnieu, Sebastien (mentor); Jones, S.A. (mentor); Zitha, P.L.J. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","In 1949, Toms (Toms B.A., (1949, 1977)) observed that small amounts of a drag reducing agent (DRA) could cause a considerable drag reduction in turbulent pipe flow. In application of polymer enhanced oil recovery, degradation of polymers in the supply lead could cause clogging. It was, however observed that surfactants at sufficiently high concentration also showed drag reduction without the problem clogging. A DRA reduces the energy loss by friction and unstable flow, thus improving injection throughput with the same pressure pump and thereby reducing the exergetic pumping costs. This study investigates experimentally the drag reducing capacity of surfactants and compares it to the drag reducing capacity of polymers.<br/>For the experiment, a set-up consisting of a pump, a coiled test tube with a length of 1.48 m and an inner diameter of 0.5 mm and pressure gauges is built. The diameter of the coil is 12.5 cm. We use a pump capable of injection up to 200 ml/min. The pressure drop is measured between the entrance and end of the tube. The injection rate is varied between 1 and 200 ml/min, roughly corresponding to Reynolds numbers between 50 and 10,000. The additives are dissolved in brine with a 33,000 ppm salt concentration. The viscosity of the solution is dependent on the concentration of the DRA. The ratio of the measured pressure drop with only brine and the pressure drop with the DRA solution was used to calculate the drag reduction (DR) factor, as from a technical point of view we are only interested whether adding DRA reduces the drag with respect to the original brine solution. From an academic point of view, we remark that for low concentrations the viscosity enhancement due to the presence of the DRA is negligible. As polymers we use xanthan (a biopolymer), and a synthetic emulsion polymer based on polyacrylamide. Maximum DR factors are 23% for xanthan at 90ppm and 32% at 90ppm for the synthetic emulsion polymer. DR only occurs at turbulent conditions.<br/>Three types of surfactants, each from a different branch of surfactants are used in this study. The surfactants used are AOS {훼-Olefin Sulfonate}, CTAB {hexadeCylTrimethylAmmonium Bromide} and APG {Alkyl PolyGlucoside} which are a cationic, anionic and a nonionic surfactant respectively. The surfactants did not show any DR at (for DRA applications) high concentrations up to 20.000ppm. Addition of Sodium Salicylate (NaSaL) to CTAB with a 1:1 ratio led to a maximum DR of 33% at 2500 ppm concentration.<br/>Several pressure gauges have been installed along the test tube in order to observe how the pressure drops along the tube, how the DRAs affect these pressure drops and at what location of the test tube the DR factor is the highest. It is found that xanthan has the same DR factor at each location of the test tube, the emulsion polymer has a decreasing DR factor as the distance from the inlet of the test tube increases and the CTAB+NaSaL DRA has an increasing DR factor as the distance from the inlet increases.<br/>The DRAs are sheared using a constriction in the flow loop while the degradation is monitored. It is observed that xanthan is less susceptible to degradation in comparison to the emulsion polymer due to its more rigid chemical structure. But xanthan and the emulsion polymer would be inefficient to use in looped flow systems as they are affected by degradation. The CTAB+NaSaL DRA on the other hand shows no degradation meaning that the micellar rod-like structures that give the DR effect are being repaired when the shear force is being removed. However, for surfactants higher concentrations (1000-2500 ppm) are required.","Drag Reduction; Polymers; Surfactants; Turbulence; Turbulent Flow","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Petroleum Engineering and Geo-sciences","",""

Though primarily used for novel gene identification, expression quantification, and splice analysis, RNA-seq is also a cheap and efficient alternative for variant calling to genome sequencing data. RNA sequencing costs less than genome sequencing. Plus, the variants discovered from RNA-seq data are expressed, which is a desired feature for researchers who want to study the relation between genotype and phenotype. What’s more, variants called in RNA-seq data can be used to validate the discoveries from whole-genome sequencing (WGS) or wholeexome sequencing (WES). The GATK team has adapted the Best Practices pipeline to be able to process RNA-seq data from raw FASTQ reads to variants. However, some components of the pipeline are not optimized to process large datasets efficiently. We have studied several scalable solutions that scale up the DNA-seq Best Practices pipeline in hopes of applying the most efficient framework among them to scaling up the RNA-seq pipeline. We select Spark and implement a parallel RNA-seq variant calling pipeline based on the GATK Best Practices recommendations. Whereas the original sequential pipeline takes ~29 hours to process a dataset of 50 GB with one thread, and ~16 hours with 40 threads on a node with 20 Hyper-Threading cores, our implementation takes only ~2 hours with 16 nodes, each of which has 8 CPU cores without Hyper-Threading. Our implementation is also 24.77% faster than the alternative solution while keeping equally accurate results.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Embedded Systems","",""

To enable this, we need objects with embedded electronics to communicate with each other in a network known as the Internet of Things (IoT). The IoT communication infrastructure is built on top of existing Radio Frequency (RF) technologies such as Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), WiFi, and cellular protocols. The RF technology is bandlimited and power hungry, making it unfeasible to support the growing demand of IoT networks. The number of IoT devices in the year 2020 is expected to be around 20 billion, making it essential to explore other areas of sustainable communication technology. Visible light communication (VLC) in the optical domain is being explored to meet the surge in connected devices and to enable sustainability in the energy consumed. The idea behind a VLC system is to toggle a Light Emitting Diode (LED) at high speed to transmit information which ensures that users are not subjected to visual interruptions. Even sunlight - the biggest source of illumination - can be used to transmit information. However, it is not possible to toggle the sun like LEDs. Hence, the objective of this thesis is to use sunlight to setup a green communication channel. In the 1800s, sunlight was used to communicate over long distances by using mirrors to reflect light to send signals. Taking inspiration from this method, I propose using smart materials to toggle sunlight and use it for wireless communication. My aim in this thesis is to analyze the behavior of smart materials, develop a modulation scheme suitable to send information using sunlight, and evaluate the system's performance.","Liquid crystal shutter; Sunlight; Communication","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-08-30","","","","Electrical Engineering | Embedded Systems","",""

(mentor); van Walsum, Theo (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","Percutaneous coronary intervention is a minimally-invasive procedure to treat coronary artery disease. In such procedures, X-ray angiography, a real-time imaging technique, is commonly used for image guidance to identify lesion sites and navigate catheters and guide-wires within coronary arteries. Due to the physical nature of X-ray imaging, photon energy undergoes absorption when penetrating tissues, rendering a 2D projection image of a 3D scene, in which semi-transparent structures overlap with each other. The overlapping structures make robust information processing of X-ray images challenging. To tackle this issue, layer separation techniques for X-ray images were proposed to separate those structures into different image layers based on structure appearance or motion information. These techniques have been proven effective for vessel enhancement in X-ray angiograms. However, layer separation approaches still suffer either from non-robust separation or long processing time, which prevent their application in clinics.<br/>The purposes of this work are to investigate whether vessel layer separation from X-ray angiography images is possible via deep learning methods and further to what extent vessel layer separation can be achieved with deep learning methods.<br/>To this end, several deep learning based methods were developed and evaluated to extract the vessel layer. In particular, all the proposed methods utilize a fully convolutional network (FCN) with two different architectures (Appendix A and Chapter 2), which was trained by two different strategies: conventional losses (Appendix A and L1 method in Chapter 2) and an adversarial loss (AN +L1 method in Chapter 2).<br/>The results of all the methods show good vessel layer separation on 42 clinical sequences. Compared to the previous state-of-the-art, the proposed methods have similar performance but runs much faster, which makes it a potential real-time clinical application. Both the L1 method and AN + L1 method in Chapter 2 achieve better background than the method proposed in Appendix A, which can remove catheter and other tubular structures well. On the other hand, the L1 method results in better contrast and clearer backgrounds than the AN+L1 method.","X-ray Angiogram; Vessel Layer Separation; Fully Convolutional Network; Generative Adversarial Network; Deep Learning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-09-30","","","","Electrical Engineering","",""

In 2017, 560 additional turbines were installed in Europe, reaching 4149 turbines in total. Currently, they are serviced with cost and time inefficient methods, such as rope access and jack-up vessels. Rope access is slow and requires the deployment of expensive technicians in dangerous environments. Jack-up vessels are overqualified, expensive and not readily available. Identifying the short comings of these methods, TWD saw an opportunity to design a dedicated tool for blade installation. This resulted in the floating Blade Installation Tool (BIT). The BIT is a state-of-the-art solution that allows for blade installation from a floating platform. By incorporating motion compensation and decoupling it can mitigate the vessel motions, thereby reducing the relative motion of the top element of the BIT. After the BIT is connected to the tower, a blade handling kart can safely transport and install the blades to and from the nacelle. The goal of this thesis is to gain insight in the dynamic behaviour of the system, with the focus on the interaction between the turbine and the BIT. For this purpose, a numerical model is created for the governing plane of motions, the vertical plane on the longitudinal axis of the vessel. Using this model, several simulations are performed under a variety of conditions to assess the BIT for the following sub-questions: Are the interface forces on the tower acceptable in conditions comparable to the operational limits of jack-up vessels? What is the relation between the vessel-tower distance and the interface forces? How much does the significant wave height affect the forces and stresses on the tower? The results show that the BIT’s motion compensation system will effectivelymitigate the first order wave force induced motions of the vessel. However, it also shows that at multiple stages of the lifting process the BIT will exert a force exceeding the allowable force limits. To satisfy the constraints imposed by the tower manufacturers, adaptations to the design of the BIT must be made. Some of the possible solutions to be explored are as follows: The increase in contact surface area between the BIT and tower. The stresses, which is the limiting factor, are reduced allowing for higher interface forces. Applying additional mechanical systems, such as winches and hydraulic cylinders, to add an additional layer of control to the system. TThis is expected to be a necessary option, although it will increase the complexity<br/>of the tool.","Dynamics; offshore wind turbine; operation & maintenance","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-08-29","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

The predominant presence of old masonry houses has further aggravated the situation because of quasi-brittle material characteristics weak in tension. A large-scale research campaign was launched after the historical seismic event at Huizinge in 2012 with an aim to assess and safeguard building structures in the region although much of the research has been focussed on behaviour of masonry houses. NPR 9998 which serves as a national guideline in the Netherlands for seismic assessment and retrofitting was published and is continuously being updated with the latest developments. However, it is equally important to address other typology of structures in terms of material and geometry. With this objective, it was decided to start with a fundamental study on the seismic analysis methods with specific regards to steel structures.<br/><br/>The present thesis provides a comprehensive review of the lateral behaviour of affected structure initially and the fundamental differences in the induced earthquakes when compared with deep tectonic earthquakes. This is followed by state-of-the-art of linear and nonlinear seismic analysis methods which forms the basis of guidelines &amp; codes presented in the NPR 9998 and EN 1998 context. Further, an understanding on the generation of seismic action in response spectrum format from recorded ground motions which is the most widely adopted one across seismic design codes worldwide. The case study adopted for this study is a steel office building preliminary designed for non-seismic actions. Global seismic demands are determined using linear-static and linear-dynamic analysis methods with verification of specific criteria to be satisfied for safety of steel structures. Modelling parameters and methodologies are discussed in detail with regards to using simplified numerical models for analysis based on recommendations from Eurocodes and Internaltional codes. A variation model to assess the likely performance level using nonlinear static pushover analysis for a specific intensity of ground motion in terms of peak ground acceleration was made. Conclusions in the form of applicability of analysis methods are made towards the end with affected structures primarily vibrating in the fundamental mode, the present study can serve as a reference guide for a practicing engineer carrying out seismic analysis. Discussions about the background of design principles is made alongside the analysis for a clear understanding.<br/><br/>This thesis is expected to fill the knowledge gap for a design engineer carrying out seismic assessment of structures in the Groningen region of the Netherlands by providing a fundamental understanding of seismic demands imposed on a structure and assessment of capacity deficiency by carrying out non-linear pushover analysis. Recommendations based on NPR, Euro codes and International codes have been made to simplify numerical modelling of the structure. Similar analysis can be undertaken for other types of structures prone to be affected by induced earthquakes by adopting corresponding material nonlinear models and considering level of interaction with the ground in terms of soil-structure interaction where the same may lead to modification of structural response.<br","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The inter- connected nature of migration means that migration problems accumulate and intensify throughout the world. To capture these effects, a data-rich model component was devel- oped for global migration dynamics.<br/>To that extent, this study has developed the following innovations on a methodological level: a technique to comprehensively implement spatial phenomena into System Dynam- ics, a method to implement multi-scale System Dynamics through subscript mapping, and a semi-automated data acquisition process to obtain and structure a great variety of data sets on a country level. The nature of the developed model component is generic. That is, the component is scalable, and resolution-independent, as it is initialized through exter- nal databases. Therefore, a significant part of this study comprised the development of a semiautomated data acquisition process. The model component was then connected to a root-causes model component to analyze future migration scenarios on a global scale. It was found that migration is expected to increase in line with population growth.<br/>Policies were implemented and tested on a global, regional, and national scale. In the global policy case, the location of additional shelter and coping capabilities was found to greatly influence migration dynamics across the world. Additional shelters in low-income countries greatly reduced the number of migrants traveling towards the more wealthy coun- tries. The regional policy—closure of the European borders when a certain threshold is reached—had significant effects on the countries near the border, but failed to significantly improve the situation in the rest of Europe. This can be attributed to the delayed effects of such policies in these countries. National policies were tested for the Netherlands. Effects of these policies were insignificant, due to the inertia of the migration system. The number of migrants in Germany—a neighboring country—did not significantly change, and even the effect on the number of migrants in the Netherlands was negligible.<br/>Therefore, the first advice from this study towards policy-makers is that it might be more effective to address the root causes of migration, rather than just mitigating its detrimental effects. In addition, the inertia of the migration system requires globally aligned, large-scale policy implementation to prevent and mitigate migration-related problems. The delay in these policies should not be neglected, so it is important to identify potential problems as early as possible and take appropriate action.","migration; multi-resolution; modeling; model analysis; data science; data analysis; python; vensim; subscripts; multi-scale; policy analysis; system dynamics; migrant; programming; Data Acquisition; Data Mining","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","",""

Research has been performed on the structural changes of the nickel and iron electrode upon charge and discharge. A lot of research can be found for the nickel electrode, but crystal structure studies are few. Much less research is performed on the iron electrode. Therefore the structural changes of the nickel(oxy) hydroxide and iron (hydroxide) electrodes during operation are further researched. Ni(OH)2 exists in the form of an α- or β-modification and NiOOH in a β- or γ-modification. The structure of the nickel(oxy)hydroxide phases has layers of edge-sharing NiO2 octahedra, where in between guest atoms can situate. Conventional nickel electrodes operate mainly between β-Ni(OH)2 and β-NiOOH, so most research focussed on this area. Upon overcharge the γ-NiOOH is formed and when discharging a direct reduction of β-NiOOH and γ-NiOOH into β-Ni(OH)2 occurs. The research on the nickel electrode published in this thesis is compared with a previous discharge study performed by Morishita et al. In their Rietveld refinement of the β-phases an ideal and fault phase model are assumed and the weight fraction of all phases present in the samples at 0, 50, 100 and 150% of state of charge (SOC) are determined. For the iron electrode four phases can be distinguished. The pure Fe in the electrode upon discharge becomes Fe(OH)2, under deep discharge this transforms even further towards FeOOH. For the deactivation process the reaction moves towards magnetite (Fe3O4). First the battery electrodes from the shelf are analysed by SEM-edx , X-ray diffraction and neutron diffraction. Then neutron powder and X-ray diffraction analysis have been performed to study the structural changes of the electrodes during charge and discharge. The nickel electrodes are measured at various states of charge from 0 to 100% and iron electrodes 0 to 90%. Preliminary experiments for the in-situ neutron diffraction test setup are performed. Different thicknesses of quartz glass, several sizes of nickel foam current collectors are tested for the amount of their background noise. In the nickel electrode are next to the carbon, 3 phases present. In the comparison with Morishita et al. significant differences are found. The transition towards β-NiOOH and subsequently γ-NiOOH occurs faster. Already at 50% of SOC the weight fraction of β-NiOOH is 58 wt% and at 100% of SOC the γ-NiOOH is 57 wt%. The c-parameter of γ-NiOOH is in agreement with Morishita et al. with a lattice distance of 20.8 Å. Morishita et al. did not specify how they determined the state of charge, so maybe they calculated the SOC in a different way. In the iron electrode three phases are identified, namely iron (Fe), goethite (FeOOH) and magnetite (Fe3O4). This is a strange result, because where Fe(OH)2 is expected, FeOOH is found. Probably discharged too far, moving the reaction into the second discharge plateau. The weight fraction of Fe increases and FeOOH decreases with increasing state of charge. The hydrogen content is decreasing with increasing SOC proportional to the background function for both the nickel and iron electrode.","battolyser; neutron diffraction; x-ray diffraction; nickel-iron battery","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-08-29","","","","","",""

How can augmented human technology contribute to the way we ski in 2025? To find an answer on this question a possible view on the future of skiing and superhuman is created. This future vision is used to come up with a game design for a revolving ski slope.<br/><br/>In the first part of the thesis a better understanding of the terms skiing and superhuman sports is created. Skiing is described as the action of travelling over snow on skis. To narrow the project there is chosen to go for alpine skiing. Because of the extended equipment of a skier there are many physical locations were superhuman technologies can be placed. Alpine skiing can be practiced on snow in the mountains, indoor skiing on artificial snow, skiing on artificial grass and skiing on a revolving slope with artificial grass. The last part about skiing shows that most used technologies are applications for a smartphone and action cameras. Wearables, virtual reality and augmented reality are also product available but they are not commonly used. Based on van Zon (2017) superhuman sports can be described as “Activities that rely on technology for human augmentation, involve physical fitness and skills and are played for fun, competition and/or health reasons.” The first part ended up with questions for further research.<br/><br/>The second phase gave answer to the research questions how the future of skiing and superhuman technologies might look like. Qualitative research resulted in five main topics on the change of skiing. There is decided to go on with playful moving and unexpectedness. Beside that there is found that a revolving ski slope could be a good location to augment skiing. From research on superhuman technologies it came forward that augmented reality, motion capture and haptics are the most promising ones to augment skiing. These findings were processed in a design brief.<br/><br/>The design brief is the introduction to the design phase. Via elaboration on existing products, individual brainstorms, a creative session and an iteration session three concepts were generated. A short user test and the framework ensured that there could be chosen for one of these concepts. This final concept is called Hit Me!. Hit me! is a one versus one ski game. It is a combination of hardware and software that is purchased as an add-on to the existing revolving <br/>Slopes. It provides unexpected digital objects that need to be hit. When the object is hit a new object will pop up somewhere else on the slope. The unexpectedness of this game will make you a more complete skier. Beside that the game creates interaction that there normally is not between skiers. This ensures it brings an extra fun factor to skiing on a revolving slope. A user test on a revolving slope showed that. All participants can see the added value of technology on a revolving slope. Everyone was very enthusiastic about the competitive and interactive aspect of the game. It makes the game attractive to play. <br/><br/>In the last part a business case proposal is used to prove the concept has added value for the buyer. The buyer is the owner of a revolving ski slope, always ski schools. Hit Me! can lead to a double turnover during summer months. Therefor it need to be marketed as fun group activity.<br","Superhuman sports; Skiing; Augmented Reality; Revolving Slope","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

In order to achieve climate goals, it is expected that wind energy will increase its importance in the electricity production. Offshore wind energy is expected to triple its installed capacity between 2020 and 2025. Several countries have expressed plans to add this kind of energy to their energy matrix. Many of these countries are located in seismic active regions, such as China, Japan and the United States of America (USA). <br/>Given that traditionally this kind of projects have been developed in non-seismic regions, there is a general lack of knowledge about how monopile offshore wind turbines (OWT) respond to seismic excitation. Two main properties of these structures play an important role on it response to seismic loads: 1) the large pile diameter embedded in the soil and 2) the nonlinear behavior during the operational stage. <br/>The analysis of this kind of structures is commonly performed in the time domain, simulating operational and idling conditions. It is known that the soil structure interaction (SSI) is frequency dependent, and therefore, it is not a straightforward task to include this dependency in a time domain analysis. Previous research developed at Siemens Gamesa, performed in the time domain (and therefore neglecting frequency dependency of the SSI), suggests that seismic loads can become design driving. <br/>This work focuses on estimating the influence of the frequency dependent SSI on the seismic response of monopile OWT. The analysis is performed in the frequency domain; therefore only idling states of the turbine is included, and aerodynamic damping is neglected.

However, a significant part of the modern energy industry still relies on fossil fuels. To combine these two contradictory targets, we investigate a strategy based on a combination of CO2 sequestration with Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) in the hydrocarbon reservoirs. In such technology, the development of miscibility is the most attractive strategy from both technological and economic aspects. <br/><br/>Modeling of this process involves solving complex nonlinear problem describing compositional flow and transport in highly heterogeneous porous media. An accurate capture of the miscibility development usually requires an extensive number of components to be present in the compositional problem which makes simulation run-time prohibitive for optimization. Here, we apply a multi-scale reconstructing of compositional transport to the optimization of CO2 injection. In this approach, a restriction operator, based on the parametrization of injection and production tie-lines, is constructed following the fractional flow theory. This operator is tabulated as a function of pressure and pseudo-composition which then is used in the Operator-Based Linearization (OBL) framework for simulation. As a result, a pseudo two-component solution of the multidimensional problem will match the position of trailing and leading shocks of the original problem which helps to accurately predict phase distribution. Applying a simple prolongation operator, based on interpolation between injection and production compositions, a compositional solution with the correct reconstruction of two-phase region can be obtained.<br/><br/>The reconstructed multicomponent solution can be used then as an effective proxy-model mimicking the behavior of the original multicomponent system. In this study, we use this proxy-model in the optimization procedure which helps to improve the performance of the simulation with the increasing intricacy of the reservoir model. In this work, the nonlinear constrained optimization function is applied to find optimal pressure values for CO2 injection process to acquire a highest Net Present Values (NPV). Starting with the limited number of the controls, the global extrema of the objective function can be determined from both full physics model and proxy model. The result shows that both models can converge to the similar extrema given various initial guesses. It is noting that for multicomponent system, the proxy model can also have salient accuracy to predict the NPV extrema compared with the original full model. <br/><br/>As a result, the reconstructed proxy model can be significantly cheaper than a full conventional compositional model. An additional benefit of the proposed methodology is based on the fact that important technological features of CO2 injection process can be captured with lower degrees of freedom which accelerates the optimization process.","CO2 injection; Optimization; Compositional modeling; Enhanced Oil Recovery; Carbon capture and storage","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Earth Sciences","",""

When a trade show is built, hundreds of stand builders work on their individual stands within their assigned floor space. In the exhibition halls, with more than 50 to 100 stands per hall, a challenge occurs—building a trade show with different stand builders, each working on their own stand, with their own design and their own schedule. During the build-up freight trucks, carrying the stand materials are parked outside the venue halls waiting to unload the materials. The problem RAI Amsterdam has is that RAI Amsterdam has limited space available for trucks to park and unload. The space is not sufficient to allow all the trucks to park at the same time. As a result, the trucks that are waiting to enter the parking space at the RAI cause traffic accumulation and obstruct roads into Amsterdam. Instead RAI being a valued part of Amsterdam, it is seen as a burden on the city. Therefore the goal of this project is to determine methods to reduce the volume of freight traffic during the build-up of trade shows at RAI Amsterdam. The solution to this problem was found in the principles of Lean manufacturing. Lean is about removing waste throughout the manufacturing process. One type of the waste is inventory. To improve the logistics of the build-up is to unburden the logistical situation outside the halls is by organising what is happing insides. By removing the materials that are stored around trade shows stand during the build-up, has impact on the volume of trucks that bring the materials. By removing the materials and only give the stand builders the materials they need at the moment they need is known in the world of logistics as Just in Time delivery. With insights gathered from interview with various stakeholders, modelling the current build-up process, case studies and organising a co-creation session in which participant played a game in where they simulated the current and new build-up process, an automated Just in Time delivery system was created. By making use of a hub (owned by logistics service company DB Schenker), between the storage facilities of stand builders and RAI Amsterdam, the materials can be brought to the hub and only when necessary shipped to the venue halls of RAI Amsterdam. The hub contains a distribution centre that receives, store, manage and ship materials when they are necessary. The result of the system is that the volume of trucks currently at the RAI are moved to the hub and from the hub only the freight trucks drive to RAI Amsterdam that carry the materials that are necessary at that moment in time.","Just in Time Delivery; Trade shows; RAI Amsterdam; Lean Manufacturing; Build-up process; Simulation games","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","Strategic Product Design","","52.34154189999999, 4.888079100000027"

Most of oils destabilize foam, the effect of which dominates foam strength when foam is in contact with oil and is key to success of foam EOR, but not yet fully understood. This study focuses on understanding oil displacement by foam in lab scale and providing insights for field-scale applications. We carry out the study from two perspectives: a) X-ray CT corefloods that give data on both saturation and pressure response in a foam displacement and b) data fitting to corefloods results.<br/><br/> Experimental studies are conducted with two types of simplified model oil to avoid confusion of the effect of multi-components of crude oil: hexadecane (C16) that is benign to foam and a mixture of C16 and oleic acid that is greatly detrimental to foam stability. CT scanning provides data on oil saturation (So) and distribution along a core during the corefloods. Such key information relates So to foam dynamics as implied by pressure response, in particular foam generation and propagation suggesting efficiency of oil displacement by foam. Specifically, foam is injected in two ways: co-injection of surfactant solution and gas with the intention to generate foam in situ in the presence of oil and injection of pregenerated foam. The co-injection serves to check the effect of oil on foam generation and propagation (anti-foaming effect) in the displacement. The second way investigates de-foaming effect of oil on foam displacement. The results show that foam generation in situ in the presence of oil is possible only when the oil is relatively benign to foam. When oil is very detrimental to foam, the in-situ generation is very difficult even at oil saturation as low as residual oil saturation. The displacement of pregenerated foam with oil consists of two stages of foam propagation due to change in So. Foam drains down So with a weaker strength due to high So in the primary propagation. In the secondary propagation, foam propagates faster with a larger strength, pushing oil forward like a piston. <br/><br/>Fitting coreflood data is then performed using a most widely used local-equilibrium implicit-texture foam model in CMG STARS™ simulator. We propose a fitting guideline for estimating foam simulation parameters based on steady-state foam flow data with oil in a recent study that does not give data on So. The model parameters estimated using this method serve as an initial guess for finding the optimal parameters to fit the coreflood data in simulation. A simulator for foam simulation in STARS is set up for this purpose. A scheme is then developed to optimize the model parameters in fitting the dynamic data. The challenges and difficulties in the fitting are briefly summarized for future work.","Foam generation; Effect of oil; CMG STARS; Foam","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In order to be diagnosed with PTSD, a person must have four typical symptoms: intrusion symptoms, avoidance symptoms, negative alterations in cognition and mood and alterations in arousal and reactivity (Friedman, 2015). <br/><br/>Currently, two therapies show a high effectiveness rate (around 70%) in treating PTSD: Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR). But they are restricted to conditions and devices. There are other self-management methods like meditation, breathing exercise and yoga. But those methods focus on regulating symptoms in the short term and the effectiveness is not well supported by studies.<br/><br/>It is envisioned that by integrating biofeedback sensors into a wearable product, verifying symptoms can be unobtrusive and stress can be monitored very often. By looking into the existing products, there are already many wearables which can detect stress by measuring some physiological signals like heart rate, heart rate variability, breathing rate or electrodermal activity. Physiological signals are more accessible to detect and are ideals measures for real-time monitoring. However, their accuracies are not high and easily compromised by the environment. The most sensible bio-signal combination is still not found out yet. And the cognitive or emotional aspects of stress is more difficult to detect. Thus a more intuitive method is decided to combine bio-signal with subjective feeling.<br/><br/>Based on those literature study and preliminary field work, the vision of the project was formulated and the mission was focused on sensing the stress and making the communication between data and users with a later aim of coping with it.<br/><br/>The embodiment of the concept was divided into two design iterations. The first design iteration aimed at selecting the right physiological sensors and validating the sensor quality and a self-reporting tool. The second design iteration focused on improving the product wearability and product style. In the first design iteration, some physiological sensors were chosen regarding different criteria. Four categories of sensors were selected including a heart rate sensor, a GSR sensor, a temperature sensor and an accelerometer. Based on the sensor sensibility on different body positions, the first prototype was decided to be a chest vest.<br/> <br/>The first user test was conducted with 11 male students from TU-Delft to identify the technological features of the prototype 1 in recognizing different stress levels and development of the stress experiences. Besides, a self-reporting method was validated in this experiment by providing a self-reporting tool to the participants. The result was that physiological sensors are able to recognize the stress but they are not accurate enough to distinguish the different level of stress. And the self-reporting tool can reflect users’ real-time perception of stress to some extent. Some design insights were collected from the interviews to apply to the next prototype.<br/><br/>In the second design iteration, an interaction vision was generalized based on the updated concept. The product style was formulated after a style study and the wearability was improved by changing some details and making it wireless. The second user test was conducted with on participant from TU-Delft. The final integrated prototype can detect the stress and body movement to some extent.

The Spaac S7 is able to reach speeds up to 70 km/h which requires a re-evaluation of comfort and safety measures. While Super-Pedelecs are not allowed on Dutch roads yet, this thesis dives into the possible future of Super-Pedelecs and how their comfort and safety are assured and increased compared to the current pedelecs.

Though different types and configurations of glass columns have been subject of academic research, a demountable glass column made from laminated components remains unexplored. This structural concept allows for modular and temporary structures with incorporated structural safety. Assembly and demounting is quick and the smaller, laminated components give the column sufficient redundancy. <br/><br/>Glass however, is notorious for its low tensile strength and brittle failure. Also, a column made from interlocking components introduces stability problems. A comprehensive understanding of this new type of glass column is necessary before application in the built environment is possible. So far, no numerical analysis has been conducted on columns made up of interlocking laminated elements, while this analysis can help understand the stability, force distribution and stress concentrations of such a system.<br/><br/>The main objective of this research is to obtain a feasible all-glass column design. This is achieved by using a Finite Element Analysis(FEA) to investigate: stability, force distribution and stress concentrations. Furthermore, a variety of design aspects and trade-offs are discussed in detail. These structural and design considerations are used to iterate the column design and to propose a combination of parameters that leads to a feasible design. <br/><br/>The FEA investigates the following structural parameters: component dimension, roof ballast load, façade stiffness and interlayer thickness. Different combinations of investigated parameters lead to a feasible, functioning column designs. The column is able to horizontally displace up to 9,1mm before becoming unstable. The heavier ballast load of 1,2kN/m2 is desired over the minimal value of 0,6kN/m2. The column is unable to take up a significant amount of the total horizontal case study load for all investigated component widths. It can take up up to 39% of the vertically applied load when a minimal amount of soft interlayers is used. The tensile stress concentrations stay within the allowable limits. <br/><br/>The different design aspects investigated include: material constraints, fabrication limitations, safety and redundancy and assembly. Each laminated component is made of up 3x15mm thick annealed float glass plates, and is fit with a sacrificial layer on either side for protection. The glass plates are water jet cut into the desired shape and then laminated together to form the component. The shape of the interlock is gradual end rounded in order to prevent (tensile) peak stresses. The risk of damage has been minimised. Moreover, the glass column has sufficient redundancy because the laminated components retain sufficient bearing capacity in case of damage. Also, the structural glass façade serves as secondary loading path in the case of severe damage. <br/><br/>This research serves as a starting point for future research and possible real-life application of a novel type of interlocking glass column. This type of column can be applied in demountable structures. Combinations of parameters have been proposed that result in a feasible, functioning column. Recommendations have been set up to improve future iterations of columns with a similar design.<br","Laminated glass; Glass column; Demountable structure; Finite Element Analysis; Diana; Design study; Interlocking geometry","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Building Engineering","",""

In this thesis work, we explored different backchannel strategies and studied their effects in terms of likability and engagement. We built a fully embodied conversational agent with three different levels of backchannel strategies and ran a within-subject study with a convenience sample of 24 participants. The results showed that the amount of emotional words in the speech of users increased if the attentive listening capabilities of the agent were improved. In addition, the capability to trigger both verbal and nonverbal backchannels with proper timing was found to be a relevant feature in terms of improved speech rate and emotional words. Contrary to our hypothesis, backchannels based on actual emotion and sentiment analysis of the speech content were not found to be significantly influential on the quality of interaction. Multi-modal approaches are suggested for future works in order to overcome limitations of this work due to potential lack in emotion detection accuracy.","ECA; Attentive Listening; Backchannels; Mental health; Human-Machine Interaction; Artificial intelligence; Virtual agent; Conversational Agent","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","Digital Media Technology",""

To help induce bone formation, the implant surface can be biofunctionalized with different agents. A promising surface modification technique used to treat titanium implants is Plasma Electrolytic Oxidation (PEO). In previous research, strontium has shown to be a bone inducing agent, both in implant surfaces and in culture by stimulating mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to form bone. To explore this technique and its merits further, the effect of strontium and PEO combined was investigated by looking at the effect of strontium and strontium-incorporated implants on the viability, metabolic activity and osteogenic differentiation of human MSCs. In these experiments a 1 hour seeding time and 2 hour seeding time group were assessed, in which the cells were able to attach to the implant for 1 or 2 hours in a cell immersion, after which the implants with only the attached cells were cultured further. The implants groups were, based on the strontium concentration in the electrolyte, NT (not treated with PEO), PT, PT + 0.3 M Sr, PT + 0.5 M Sr and PT + 1 M Sr. The effects of strontium on the mutual effects of MSCs and endothelial cells (ECs) were also investigated, since the interaction of these cells is vital in the formation of blood vessels. To investigate these two topics, firstly 5 types of implants surfaces were created and their characteristics were analyzed. Then the effects of these implants on viability, metabolic activity and differentiation of MSCs were assessed. The results showed an increasing viability of MSCs on implants with strontium incorporated into them. Metabolic activity and differentiation improved in MSCs on the two medium strontium concentration incorporated implants, although there were differences between different seeding times of MSCs. Due to differences in morphology of the strontium incorporated implants, and presumably the oxide layer thickness, these results could both be the result of these material characteristics and/or of the strontium release of the implants. In future experiments, the implant characteristics must be created more similarly, so the effect of the single variable strontium can be assessed. Concerning the effects of strontium on the mutual effects of MSCs and ECs, co-culture with MSCs decreased the gene expression of VEGF-A, a marker of early angiogenesis.","Biomaterials; Mesenchymal stem cells; bone implants; osteogenic differentiation; angiogenic differentiation; Endothelial cells; titanium; plasma electrolytic oxidation; micro-arc oxidation; strontium","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-08-31","","","","Biomedical Engineering | Tissue Biomechanics and Implants","",""

To this end, the Dutch government has very ambitious plans to create new wind sites far from shore and integrate that power generation to the high-voltage power grid in the next years. Due to the challenges of connecting future massive amounts of offshore wind power into the grid TenneT operates it becomes urgent to investigate new alternatives for this purpose. A grid topology with transmission capacities above 1 GW connecting offshore wind farms at distances close to 100 km in a standardized, modular, and cost-efficient manner is the focus of this thesis. <br/><br/>With eight point-to-point HVDC links in operation in Germany and more expected in near future, TenneT TSO is analysing new offshore grid connection concepts to achieve a reliable and secure operation of the infrastructure connecting wind energy both in Germany and the Netherlands. A solution is presented in this thesis report in which new wind farms are connected with 66-kV cables to a centralised platform with a connection capacity of 1050 MW. This platform will utilise HVDC technology based on VSC conversion techniques and MMC topology. It is expected that the 66-kV cables will not be connected to a single busbar through paralleled converter transformer, but that this will be done with at least three converter transformers connected to each other on the valve side but not connected on the 66-kV side.<br/><br/>A dynamic performance study of a test network with the novel connection topology developed in PSCAD has been done. Each component of the system was studied to obtain a complete overview and understanding of the overall behaviour. All the associated control loops for the MMC terminals and wind turbines were modelled in detail. Through several simulations based on eight cases and scenarios the performance of the offshore 66-kV ac grid and the MMC-HVDC link using the control schemes of MMC converters as in a typical grid connection topology for OWFs was assessed.<br","MMC-HVDC Transmission; Offshore Wind Energy; EMT Model; PSCAD; 66-kV Offshore Grid","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

How much load these structures can withstand however is not certain. This MSc thesis contains insight into the load capacity of the old Amazonehaven and the current SIF quay structures. Both are quay structures which use a combined sheet pile wall, a reinforced concrete relieving platform, M.V.-piles, and two rows of bearing piles. The objective of this MSc thesis was to determine the load capacity of the structures, the models should therefore be as close to the actual conditions as possible. For that reason no safety and/or material factors have been applied throughout this MSc thesis. The approach is shown below.<br/>A literature study was performed to gain insight into the areas of interest that needed to be studied. This theory in combination with a review of the structures led to the critical cross sections of the respective structures. These cross sections were then modelled with conventional design methods (Blum and D-Sheet Piling). The Blum method determined the individual contributions of several aspects (loads, water, soil) to the horizontal stress distribution along the combined sheet pile wall and calculated the reaction forces using a set of boundary conditions. Within D-Sheet Piling the relieving platform was modelled by removing it, the loads that acted on it, and the soil that rested on it. The last method that was applied was a FEM software (Plaxis 2D). The FEM models were validated in three steps: First, by comparing their results to that of the conventional methods, it was found that the results of the conventional methods were within ca. 30% of the FEM results. Second, by comparing the results to actual field data, here the results showed both deviation and similarities, these deviations could however be explained. Lastly, by critically assessing the models to ensure that certain aspects were incorporated into the models correctly, this resulted in uncertainty about drained or undrained soil conditions for the thicker clay layers. The main function of both quay structures was the storage of certain goods, for that reason the only aspect that was not constant in the test loading set up was the magnitude of the primary surcharge. Both geotechnical and structural failure were taken into consideration for the quay structures.<br/>The results of the FEM models showed that neither of the structures had failed at their design loading conditions. For the Amazonehaven it was found that the magnitude of the primary surcharge at the first failure of the model was relatively close to that of the design loading conditions, it was incited by the exceedance of the geotechnical bearing capacity of the M.V.-piles. The first failure of the SIF model occurred at a surcharge that was more than 4 times the magnitude of the design loading conditions, it was incited by the exceedance of the normal stress capacity of the M.V.-piles.","FEM; combined sheet pile wall; quay structures; relieving platform; M.V.-piles; Blum; D-Sheet Piling; Finite Element Method; Plaxis 2D; load capacity; Maasvlakte","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Structures","","51.9595317, 3.985464"

Most of them employ one central unit to solve the problem (centralized) while in others, every node/area computes for its coverage and send information to its neighbor(s) every time. The mentioned method is called Distributed OPF. In this thesis, the Distributed OPF aims for a fast and resilient algorithm to solve a DC-OPF problem based on Consensus + Innovation (C+I) method. <br/>The research focuses on developing a faster algorithm in solving an OPF problem for a DC distribution grid. The current C+I method has tuning parameters, all of which are determined by trial and error for every case. They are sensitive parameters that determine the speed of the iteration to converge to the solution. This thesis attempts to form adaptive tuning parameters by understanding their function in every equation for a variable update. By understanding the purpose of each tuning parameter and the physical interpretation, some parameters can be formulated while the other is still determined by estimating the value. The losses and congestion are also taken into account. In the results, by formulating these parameters, they are shown that the iteration number has dropped significantly compared to the previous research. <br/><br/>Regarding the resilience of the algorithm, the distributed approach relies on the information exchange between the nodes and delay on the information exchange will stall the whole iteration process. Therefore, an asynchronous algorithm is implemented to resolve the problem by setting a timeout duration. The timeout duration enables the algorithm to wait for the new information only for the desired duration, and therefore the calculation converges in faster.","Optimization Algorithm; Optimal power flow","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-08-29","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

However, this implementation comes with a weight penalty due to the morphing mechanisms. In the present study two morphing winglet cases are tested, where due to mechanisms compatibilities, only a variable Cant-Span winglet and a variable Sweep-Span winglet are proposed. For these two cases, the cant angle mechanism presents a high actuator requirement of about 750 [kg], when restricted to a winglet AR of 3.16 and a minimum cant angle of 33 [deg]. For the morphing sweep case, the weight penalty is of less than 50 [kg]. As a result, during a mission analysis, the extra weight penalty for the first winglet case increments the MTOM of the aircraft in 2500 [kg], while for the second case, the MTOM is reduced by about 1000 [kg]. The consequence of this is a higher fuel consumption for the first case, but a lower fuel consumption for the second one, where a fuel reduction of a 2.2% is achieved. Another benefit is a lighter wing structure due to the load alleviation capabilities, and a higher range of almost a 9% for maximum fuel is obtained.","Winglets; Morphing Winglets; Morphing Structures; Aerodynamic Efficiency; Load Alleviation; Actuator Sizing; Reduced Fuel Consumption; Morphing Mechanism; Range Improvement","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

To guide the catheter, Ultrasound(US) imaging is used which shows the catheter position in real time. However, some tumors are not visible on US images. To make these tumors visible, image fusion can be used between the inter-operative US image and a pre-operative contrast enhanced CT(CECT) scan, on which the tumors are visible. Several methods exist for tracking the motions of the US transducer relative to the CECT scan, but they all require a manual initialization or external tracking hardware to align the coordinate systems of both scans. In this thesis we present a technique for finding an initialization using only the image data. To achieve this, deep learning is used to segment liver vessels and the boundary of the liver in 3D US images. To find the rigid transformation parameters, the SaDE evolutionary algorithm was used to optimize the alignment between the blood vessels and the liver boundary between both scans.","Image registration; Image fusion; Ablation; 3D Ultrasound; Registration initialization; Medical imaging","en","master thesis","","","","","","Master of Science Double Degree in Computer Science and Electrical Engineering","","","","","","Computer Science","",""

Despite several previous studies, gaps in the research of target selection are still present like the lack of attention to the non-targeted entities, the presence of other potential factors and the change in the landscape itself. Seeking to address the gaps, this research is conducted to find out what characteristics related to online banking services can affect the likelihood of the malware attack to them. The research starts with literature review to identify characteristics which can potentially explain the target selection, in accordance to aspects of Routine Activity Theory (RAT). Next, data about malware attack and the list of banks as well as several external data like language and authentication factor of online banking were collected and processed for quantitative analysis. Several metrics to approach the actual attack count were proposed and other metrics were extracted from the data. Some interesting findings were captured, like, within the period February 2014 – November 2017, from 5,039 banks in the EU, 1,188 banks were without any online banking services and from 3,851 banks with an online banking service, 1,802 banks were found targeted and 2,049 not targeted. Some malware variants were also seen performing targeted attacks. Meanwhile, it is found from explanatory analysis that some characteristics maintain their significance in explaining the likelihood of attack, like the presence of English and two-factor authentication. Services offering English language were seen to be more attacked. Contrarily, services which implemented 2-factor authentication were found to receive fewer attacks, although more entities with such authentication were targeted. Meanwhile, some other variables were getting less significant when more controlling factors are taken into account, indicating that some variables were relatively more or less important than others. Future work is needed in order to enhance the model so that more plausible conclusion can be obtained, such as improving and adding more data as well as including more factors, especially those that are financial and market related.","target selection; banking malware; online banking; characteristics; cyber security","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-08-29","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

In this study a Monte Carlo based data assimilation method referred as a bootstrap Particle Filter (PF) and a time lag sampling technique are combined together to perform Sequential Data Assimilation (SDA) of borehole observation into a Seismo-Thermo-Mechanical model (STM). The aim of this study is to estimate the state of faults in subduction zones. The STM, a strongly non-linear model, is taken to be a perfect model and serves as a source for both observed data and model realizations termed ""particles"" or ensemble members. The ensemble is being generated by drawing particles out of a seismic cycle with a constant time lag. Results demonstrate that assimilation strongly depends on the choice of time lag since, small time lags provided with better results. Changing the time lag for sampling leads to a trade off between ensemble spread and resolution due to presence of trends in some of the observed state variables. Although the sampling technique in its current setup is computationally efficient, it was found to be insuficient in representing the model errors. Comparison between the current study of the PF and recent work involving the Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) suggests that the success of the EnKF is related to its error covariance matrix correlating the various state variables. Based on the results and comparison to the EnKF improvements and possible next steps are discussed.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Geophysics","",""

This is especially apparent in quasi-static applications that require the actuator to maintain a stable position over an extended period. As a solution, we propose the use of Tunable Magnets (TMs). TMs rely on in-situ magnetization state tuning of AlNico to create an infinitely adjustable magnetic flux. They consist of an AlNiCo low coercivity permanent magnet together with a magnetizing coil. After tuning, the AlNiCo retains its magnetic field without further energy input, thus eliminating static heat dissipation. To enable implementation in actuation systems, the AlNiCo needs to be robustly tunable in the presence of a dynamically varying system air-gap. We achieve this by developing a magnetization state tuning method, based on a magnetic circuit model of the actuator, measured AlNiCo BH data and air-gap flux feedback control. A measurement setup is built to test the proposed tuning method. For an AlNiCo 5 TM, we have accomplished magnetization tuning with an accuracy in the mT range and a sub mT precision. With this obtained performance, actuator heating is already almost eliminated during static periods.<br/>The second part of the thesis consists of investigating TM actuator applications. By comparing a TM actuator to a conventional actuator of similar geometry, we have derived a metric called the Break-Even Tuning Time. This can be used to evaluate what actuation applications can be made more energy efficient using a TM actuator. The results are very sensitive to assumptions made, but they do provide some useful qualitative conclusions. Actuation systems where these actuators can improve energy efficiency can be characterized by a low actuation bandwidth or only incidentally required actuation, together with large air-gaps and/or large required constant bias forces. Also, scaling analysis shows that TM actuators are more energy efficient compared to conventional reluctance actuators at small length scales.","tunable magnets; electropermanent magnets; precision actuation; magnetization state tuning; thermal stability; AlNiCo; recoil permeability","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These constructions have persuasive power and affect human behaviour, whether intended or not (Tromp &amp; Hekkert, 2018). The industrial design discipline is responsible for configuring our environment, and therefore, for the influence that they might generate in the society. Designers need to embrace the situation and aim towards a positive impact in the user. This project intended to develop the required tools for achieving that purpose. One tool that aims to embrace designers to focus in the behavioural outcome is the Continuous Behaviour Cycle, or CBC. This model focuses on developing repetitive behaviour until a habit is achieved and does it by deeply understanding the drivers of the user. The CBC model was developed as part of the Honors Programmeme Master Project, and it was well received in both the academia and the commercial environment (Arias Arias, 2018). Nevertheless, one of the conclusions of the Project was that the complexity of the model limited its use in a traditional design process. For this reason, the need for defining a project development process approach became evident. This project aims to develop a design approach for the Continuous Behaviour Cycle. To explore how designers could use the CBC model, this project started with a review of other approaches related to behavioural design with the purpose of mapping design processes. This served as a starting point for working with the CBC model. A first approach was proposed and used in three case studies. The outcome from the case studies delivered key insights that defined the final CBC model iteration. The final approach was tested by applying it to a design challenge. The case studies were mainly commercial challenges. This was done with the purpose of bridging the gap between what is developed in the academia and what is needed in the market. The innovation and strategy firm Fronteer provided the cases for the project. Fronteer is a consultancy firm located in Amsterdam. They strongly believe that true innovation can only be done in collaborative environments, therefore they work with co-creative processes. The resulting design approach is a four-stage process. Each stage focuses on different elements of the CBC model and delivers a more defined concept each time. The four stages are: situation determination, value definition, concept directions and solution requirements. During the situation determination, the designer analyzes the needs of the client and the drivers of the user for framing the scope of the solution. Then, during the value definition, the designer develops the structure of the cycle by identifying the reasons why a user would perform the intended behaviour and what could receive in return. During the concept direction, the designer identifies which resources does the user has for performing the behaviour and what are the characteristics of the environment where the behaviour could take place. Finally, during the solution requirements, the designer focuses on equilibrating the elements of the contexts by designing the last elements that could ease the execution of the behaviour and encourage recurrence. A set of tools was proposed for using the CBC model in Fronteer’s current project development process. Through these set of tools, the CBC method was finally evaluated with designers, clients and strategists.","behavioural design; habits; recurrent behaviour; design approach; Continuous Behaviour Cycle; behavioral design; Continuous Behavior Cycle","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","Increased Feed-in of renewable energy sources and an increase of sales of electric vehicles (EVs) complicate balancing of demand and supply. EVs are considered core enablers for dealing with intermittency due to their storage potential. This does however require that these EVs are charged according to smart charging protocols, which is a vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology. Options exist for designing such a system. However, due to the gathering of personal (transactional) data, and the involvement of monetary assets, ethical concerns such as privacy and trust issues are assumed to arise at or after the introduction of such a technology. This has been the case with for instance smart meters. The effects of such ethical concerns on the usage of smart charging systems are unknown.<br/> <br/>The main research question for this thesis is: “How can a smart charging system be designed which is both used on the short- and long-term and fulfils ethical values of EV owners?”<br/><br/>The purpose of this thesis was to explore and assess different smart EV charging system designs concerning factors contributing to system performance and possible ethical concerns. The research was conducted by creating an integrated framework of both the capability approach and complex adaptive systems. Agent-based modeling was used as the main research method in order to model the behaviour of EV owners within an smart charging environment. The model aims at providing valuable insights concerning which system design performs best with respect to system performance and ethical value fulfilment. Several architectural design decisions are elaborated on with respect to a decentralised or a centralised system. The research outcomes indicate possible short- and long-term ethical concerns of users with respect to the designed system. The effects of these concerns are at this point unknown, but are considered to have an ongoing effect on the performance of the system. <br/><br/>The research objectives involve the identification of four key architectural design decisions which consist of both decentralised and centralised alternatives. The conceptual framework built upon the capability approach, the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT), and complex adaptive systems is used as conceptual basis for the agent-based model. The experimental design revolves around comparing three experimental design alternatives: a (1) public centralised system, (2) public decentralised system, and (3) a private decentralised system. The public centralised system describes a system which is controlled by a single authority, and in which data is stored within an external database. Furthermore, participants are free to participate. The public decentralised system describes a system which is not controlled by a single authority, and in which transactions are validated through shared consensus. Within the private decentralised system, power is exerted towards a single facilitator, which is authorised to whitelist participants. Aside from whitelisting privileges, the platform is not controlled by a single authority. The combined theoretical framework induces a wide variety of uncertain parameters. Therefore, the experimental designs are explored through an EMA study. The main purpose of this EMA study was to assess the three designs with respect to system usage, system performance, and ethical value fulfilment across a wide range of possible scenarios. <br/><br/>The model outcomes provide knowledge regarding promising design directions as well as directions for further research. The developed model describes the interactions between EV owners and the smart charging platform. The performance of the system is based on three constructs originating from UTAUT. These constructs are: performance-expectancy, effort-expectancy, and social influence. The total performance of the system combined with the personality traits of the EV owners determine whether an EV owner uses the system. Effort-expectancy describes the degree of effort needed to participate on the platform. Social influence is rooted within the capability approach and incorporates a combination of effects resulting from direct and indirect interaction between EV owners. Electricity is traded through the use of the platform which creates demand and supply. For model experimentation the KPIs for assessment are: the number of system users, the number of transactions, the number of traded kilometers, and the selected ethical values.<br/><br/>Regarding ethical values, the experimental outcomes provide strong indications that a decentralised system scores best on privacy, security, anonymity, and confidentiality. The scores indicate that problems regarding these ethical values are less expected on the short- and long-term as compared to a centralised system. When aiming to design a decentralised EV charging platform, special focus should be placed on achieving trust, as indications are present that trust issues could arise for decentralised systems. Concerning the KPIs related to system usage and performance, the results indicate that a centralised system is highly preferred. For each of the KPIs (number of users, enabled users, number of transactions, and number of traded kilometers), a centralised system scores higher. However, due to the large number of users, centralised systems have high oscillations in demand and supply.<br/><br/>Concerning the main research question, the research outcomes indicate that when designing a smart EV charging system, one should consider both decentralised and centralised design elements. Both elements are needed as solely focusing on either centralised or decentralised systems has implications for value fulfilment as well as system performance. The optimal combination of design elements is at this point uncertain. The research outcomes clearly indicate that extended research in this field is justified. It is important to further identify which system components in both centralised and decentralised systems positively contribute to the chosen KPIs. These components can then be combined in order to work towards an optimal system design. The operationalisation of the capability approach opens new possibilities to assess these combined design alternatives with respect to system usage and ethical values. In that sense, this thesis provides a tool for assessing the designs of smart charging platforms by providing an integrated framework of the capability approach and agent-based modeling. <br/><br/>The research described in this thesis has several implications for designing smart EV charging systems. The capability approach was found to be a proper method for assessing ethical values concerned with the usage of technology. Furthermore, it was found useful to extent the capability approach with other theories and methods such as the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology, complex adaptive systems, and agent-based modeling. Using this approach for assessing smart EV charging systems helps to keep focus on the actual well-being of system users, rather than solely focusing on technological performance. Furthermore, the approach is long-term oriented. Directions for further research are presented. Essentially, these directions stimulate the further exploration of feasible smart charging system designs by extending the scope of design alternatives, further explore the integrated approach of CA and CAS, and further quantify the agent-based model.<br","Capability approach; Agent-based modeling; V2G; Smart charging; Exploratory Modelling and Analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","","51.9962559, 4.3758659"

In the past, group conversations have mostly been studied in a static setting. Inclusion of a temporal dimension would be of use in numerous applications. In order to account for temporal elements, we must understand how group conversations evolve. Leaving and joining a conversation are a vital part of social interaction and the driving factors behind the evolution of groups. Understanding group evolution has numerous applications, such as (social) surveillance, socially intelligent robotics and multimedia content analysis. In this thesis, I will focus on researching the nature of leaving behaviour in a mingling setting. A better understanding of leaving behaviour is required to incorporate this behaviour in models of group evolution.<br/><br/>By performing an ethnographic study on video material from the MatchNMingle dataset, 90 minutes of annotations of conversational leaving behaviour are collected. These annotations are subsequently combined with action annotations (either ground truth and automatically extracted) and accelerometer readings from the same dataset to describe the behaviour in each interaction. Using a sliding window approach, subsequences of these interactions are extracted using window sizes between 10 and 30 seconds. From these subsequences, pairwise coordination features are extracted between each pair present in the group.<br/>These coordination behaviours are known to be indicative of conversational involvement, which is hypothesized to be linked to leaving. <br/>These features are used in two different experimental settings.<br/>In the first of these settings, a classifier was trained on subsequences of these interactions. This classifier attempts to predict whether a sequence of interaction with result in a leave within the next n seconds, where n varies between 0 and 30 seconds.<br/>In the second experiments, the classifier is replaced with a regression model. For each of the determined subsequences, the time until the interaction ends is assigned and fit the regression model on these inputs.<br/>This is the first study that has attempted to predict leaving using these data sources. <br/>Using this approach, above random performance was achieved. In the classification setting an AUC of 0.63 +/- 0.12 is achieved, which is significantly better than random performance.<br/>In the regression experiments no satisfactory results were obtained.<br/><br/>From these results we can conclude that it is possible to predict conversational leaving behaviour from coordination features. Although there are many possible improvements, the proposed methodology can serve as solid foundation for future research. This does not only include the proposed methodology for creation of predictive models, but also the new feature sets on which these experiments were conducted.<br/><br/><br","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

With this data, citizens can monitor how and where the government spent their taxes. The activity of following and monitoring the money flow is referred to as budget expenditure tracking. Citizens monitoring the flow of money through the website or downloading the raw spending data to the tracking can be seen as online engagement.<br/>Even though ICTs have been largely deployed, an online engagement still has its challenges. In some countries, the effort to provide opportunities for engagement to take place is relatively low. Governments need to provide opportunities for citizens to engage in the BET exercises process. Open spending portal is one of many ways to achieve this goal. Through this portal, governments can publish their spending data, and the public can freely access and reuse the data. However, the realization is not that simple. One of the reasons why online citizen engagement is difficult to realize is the unavailability of guidelines for e-participation. Therefore, there is a need to formulate clear guidelines on how to engage citizens in open spending portals for budget expenditure exercises. This research aims at developing a set of design principles that can enhance citizen engagement in open spending portals.

In total, there are 22 principles that have been developed to enhance citizen engagement in BET exercises through open spending portals. Since the principles are not yet implemented in existing designs, the evaluation was conducted to see the relevance between the developed design principles and existing problems.

A dual economy is an economy in which a limited number of economic activities experience high productivity growth rates due to automation and technological progress (progressive sector), meanwhile the remaining economic activities experience almost no productivity growth because automation is barely present (stagnant sector). A dual economy develops due to unbalanced economic growth between the progressive and stagnant sector. To assure stable economic growth, it is important to slow down unbalanced growth. However, until today it is not known how to effectively target unbalanced growth, because the driving factors are not well known. This research tries to improve the understanding of unbalanced growth by finding the driving factors behind unbalanced growth. A macroeconomic modelling methodology is used to achieve this objective.

To design these efficient systems it is important to thoroughly understand the details of heat transfer in multiphase flow. <br/><br/>This thesis follows the method of Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) to provide a detailed physical insight of the fluid motion and heat transfer in the model. To accurately model the two phase flow the Coupled Level Set Volume Of Fluid (CLSVOF) method is used. The main advantage of using the CLSVOF method is that it can accurately capture the interface geometry and it has excellent volume conservation capability. The work presented here is an extension to an in-house code developed at TU Delft for Direct Numerical Simulation of two-phase flows using the CLSVOF method. The existing code has been thoroughly validated for the fluid and interface motion but the validation of the heat transfer model remains an unaccomplished task till now. Therefore, the main objective of this thesis is to validate the heat transfer model and then to study the heat transfer in droplets coalescence using this model. <br/><br/>The validation of the heat transfer model was accomplished by calculating the Nusselt number distribution over a bubble surface and comparing it to the available literature. Both the model results and the information from the literature showed very good agreement with each other. After completing the model validation, this model was used to study the heat transfer phenomenon between two coalescing droplets and the surrounding fluid. The results of the droplets coalescence are as per the expectations and are discussed in detail in this thesis. In the process of doing these analyses different ways of calculating the local Nusselt number and the global Nusselt number have been discussed.

Currently, this is done by using a matrix solver from the proprietary IMSL numerical library which requires a paid license. The problem is that this solver sometimes either crashes or gets stuck in an infinite loop when dealing with singular matrices, while the proprietary nature of the library only allows for limited troubleshooting. The solution method therefore requires a redesign which should improve its robustness and maintainability. On the other hand, no ground should be yielded in terms of solution accuracy and performance.<br/><br/>The singularity of the matrices are caused by quantities being underdetermined either due to user error in network design or phase changes such as a closing valve. In this report, a graph-theoretic approach is taken to detect these structural singularities in the form of determining a maximum size matching in a graph representing the system of equations. This approach gives information about which quantity is undetermined where in the pipeline system. As an alternative, condition number estimation is implemented. Furthermore, the IMSL library is replaced by LAPACK, which is a lightweight and versatile alternative. The open source nature of LAPACK and its permissive license ensure its maintainability. Since thematrices are banded, the band version of the LAPACK algorithms can be used. The new solutionmethod is compared to IMSL and evaluated in terms of robustness, accuracy and performance.<br/><br/>The graph-theoretic method resolves the robustness issues of the IMSL-based method, while showing great performance. The information it gives is used to either correct the matrix and continue the simulation or output an appropriate error message, ensuring a user-friendly experience. Condition number estimation is too slow while also not being useful for further matrix correction purposes and is therefore disregarded. To improve the accuracy of LAPACK, iterative refinement is used. The maximum relative error measured over all the test cases was about 2.5%, resulting from an ill-conditioned case. Overall, the accuracy compared to IMSL is good, so that users will not be able to notice large difference in solution quality between the two solution methods. To improve the performance of LAPACK, Reverse Cuthill-Mckee (RCM) is applied to reduce the bandwidth of the matrices. Using several test cases, the LAPACK performance is shown to be similar to that of IMSL when using RCM. In that respect, the transition from IMSL to LAPACK should also be flawless. A vendor-optimised LAPACK implementation did not yield any significant performance gains. It can be concluded that the new solution method is an improvement in terms of robustness and maintainability, while showing similar solution accuracy and performance.<br/><br/>Future work can focus on improving the performance by calculating the RCM permutation only once every time step, as well as keeping the Jacobian constant during each time step. As matrix bandwidth determines the performance of the matrix solver, better methods to reduce the matrix bandwidth could also yield significant improvements. This could be achieved by either ordering the components in the pipeline system a priori, or simply using matrix bandwidth reduction techniques. Optimised LAPACK libraries as well as a different numerical library such asMUMPS could improve the performance even further.","Wanda; numerical; linear; Deltares; singularity; detection; algorithm; graph; structural; bandwidth; LAPACK; CFD; pipeline; network; robustness; maintainability; accuracy; performance","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics","",""

Their infield and export cables are buried for protection against dropped or dragged objects. In sandy soils, it is common to use tracked remotely operated vehicles, equipped with two water jetting swords. These swords fluidise the seabed and generate a backward flow of water-sediment mixture, allowing the cable to sink into the seabed. The southern part of the North Sea has a highly variable seabed topography characterised by sandwaves and megaripples. These seabed features have a significant influence on the trenching process. Existing models do not allow for an accurate estimation of the influence of seabed slopes on the trenching process and are often not based on fundamental physical processes. Two separate numerical models are developed; a jet trenching model describing the cable burial process and a traction model describing the seabed trafficability.<br/><br/>The jet trenching model is divided into three parts; an erosion model describing the erosion of soil by the waterjets, a sedimentation model describing the re sedimentation process and resulting trench shape and a cable model describing the cable deflection. The erosion and sedimentation model combined describe the flow of water and sediment in the trench. The erosion model is based on a specific energy approach to determine the maximum allowable trencher velocity, limited by the eroding capacity of the jets. The sedimentation model describes the flow of water-sediment mixture through a rectangular channel, based on the shallow water equations. The channel width is able to evolve due to breaching and the bed elevation is controlled via erosion and sedimentation. The shallow water equations are solved on a staggered grid, following a one-dimensional finite volume scheme. A moving boundary is imposed on one side of the grid to simulate trencher movement. Seabed topography can be imported to model trencher performance on sand dunes.<br/><br/>Tractive performance of the vehicle is modelled by considering its driving state. A constant velocity is assumed, hereby balancing thrust and resistance forces. Resistances due to static sinkage, slip sinkage, seabed slopes, current and internal running gear friction are included. The driving thrust force is found by integration of shear stress over track-seabed contact area, including effects of slippage and constant seabed slopes.<br/><br/>A sensitivity study has been performed on the jet trenching model, where a strong influence on achieved depth of lowering was found to be caused by grain sizes and depth of the jetting sword below seabed. Influence of trencher velocity on depth of lowering was found to be associated with grain sizes. A higher trencher velocity has a positive effect on the achieved depth of lowering in coarse sand, whereas in fine sand the trencher velocity has a negligible influence on the depth of lowering. Validation of the model with field data shows reasonable agreement regarding average depth of lowering. When including sand dunes, results of the model show a similar depth of lowering trend as observed in field data. However, the amplitude of depth of lowering variation is underestimated by the model.<br/><br/>The sensitivity study performed on the traction model showed that resulting slip ratio and power demand have a strong dependency on track-seabed contact area and corresponding normal pressure distribution. Work remains to include the effect of variable seabed slopes, since the current model is based on constant seabed slopes.","trenching; traction; waterjet; cable; subsea","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-08-28","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

Unlike a traditional “predict-then-act” methods, which determine policies based on specific predictions of future behaviour, these decision support methods seek policies that are robust to inherently uncertain future conditions. Three robust decision support methods have been identified: multi-objective robust decision making (MORDM), multi-scenario MORDM, and multi- objective robust optimization (MORO). These three methods are all based on the robust decision making (RDM) structure, but search for solution alternatives in different ways. While MORDM considers a single absolute performance measure when selecting solution alternatives, multi- scenario MORDM uses multiple references to determine performance in an effort to yield more robust solution alternatives. Finally, MORO directly optimizes alternatives for robustness to determine a set of potential solutions, making the most effort to consider robustness of all three methods.<br/><br/>It has been previously assumed that the performance of each method is largely dependent on the behaviour of the problem and structure of the desired solution, but there has been no comparison made in literature to test that idea. This study proposes framework for comparing decision support methods for multiple problem and solution structures and uses that framework to compare the efficacy of all three robust decision support methods given a highly stylized problem that is commonly used in deep uncertainty research: the lake problem. Three solution implementation structures will be considered: a static structure known as the intertemporal variation, a dynamic structure known as the direct policy search variation (DPS), and a newly proposed variation named the planned adaptive DPS variation that aims to better capture real-world implementation properties.<br/><br/>The results indicate that generally, independent of policy implementation structure, the more that robustness is incorporated into the early stages of analysis, the more robust the identified set of potential solutions will be. The increase in robustness comes with a sharply increasing computational cost, with MORO quickly becoming prohibitively expensive to run. The proposed planned adaptive DPS lake problem variant was also shown to yield a set of solution alternatives that do not weigh conflicting objectives as evenly as the other two variants, leading to an extremely conservative set of solution alternatives, especially in a multi-scenario MORDM analysis. Therefore, the development of a hybrid robust decision support method that can consistently find the most robust solutions while evenly weighing conflicting objectives and minimizing the computational cost is much needed. Until that time, analysts and decision makers will be able to use this framework to compare existing robust decision support and select the method that best fits the needs and limitations of a problem analysis.<br","Deep uncertainty; Robust decision making; multi-objective evolutionary algorithms; the lake problem; wicked problems","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","",""

The technology scaling, on the one hand, has led to a commensurate performance gain for very-large-scale integration (VLSI) circuits, but on the other hand, has also made such circuits more vulnerable to ionizing radiations which can cause single event effects(SEEs). These SEEs may cause the underlying user circuitry to deviate from its normal behavior. Devices that are destined for space missions need special protection for such kind of anomalies as space environment is filled with massive amount of high energy particles and ionizing radiations. In this thesis, the design, implementation, and verification of a fault-tolerant r-VEX, a softcore processor, is presented, so that it could be used as an attractive alternative to expensive radiation-hardened processors for space-based applications. r-VEX is a VLIW based, dynamically reconfigurable processor. Keeping in line with its inherent attribute, a dynamically reconfigurable fault-tolerant mode is presented in this work, which provides the running application an option to activate and deactivate the fault-tolerant mode multiple times. In this mode, for the protection of processor pipeline, a non-traditional TMR approach that requires 3 lanegroups running in 2-way mode is implemented. For the reliability of user memories, Hamming codes are implemented as an ECC coding scheme. The functionally of our fault-tolerant design is verified by using both a simulation-based platform (ModelSim) and an on-board FPGA platform (ML605 development kit). To measure the fault-tolerant capabilities of the r-VEX core, saboteurs are used to artificially inject faults at various predefined locations in the core. The obtained results have shown that our design can mitigate all injected single faults in the pipeline and double faults in the caches, without triggering any failure. The dynamically configurable fault-tolerant feature is obtained at the cost of about 30% additional resource utilization and 20% reduction in the maximum operating frequency.","fault tolerance; Processor; VLIW; space","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In forensic science, there is currently no consensus on the formulation of the competing hypotheses. A main point of discussion is the difference between common source and specific source problems. In a common source problem, all evidence is assumed to come from unknown sources, whereas the specific source problem states that one of the sources is fixed. Since the value of evidence is affected by the choice of hypotheses, this thesis tries to shed more light on the statistical framework underlying the common and specific source problem. Both a frequentist and a Bayesian approach can be followed to quantify the value of evidence, resulting in the likelihood ratio and the Bayes Factor, respectively. The theoretical framework is put into practice through two frequently used models in forensic science, namely the continuous two-level normal-normal model and the discrete one-level Bernoulli model. Since calculation of the Bayes Factor for the two-level normal-normal model cannot be done analytically, Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods are proposed and the theoretical convergence properties of the resulting methods are discussed. An explicit expression of the Bayes Factor does exist for the one-level Bernoulli model. For both models, more conservative values of the Bayes Factor are observed within the common source problem than in the specific source problem. Two approaches are considered to calculate the posterior probability of guilt and explicit bounds are derived for the difference between both techniques applied to the one-level Bernoulli model. The opportunities and challenges of a copula-based method and permutation tests are discussed as alternatives to the models generally used in evaluating forensic evidence.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics","",""

This expanded energy demand directly affects climate change. Hence, there is an urgent need to move towards urban sustainability and to reduce our energy consumption. This calls upon a behavioral change in energy consumption by the individuals (i.e., citizens). Social comparison, in the form of comparative feedback on energy usage with others, appears to be a more effective approach to stimulate energy conservation and efficiency than temporal self-comparisons. But before we can motivate people to change their energy consumption behavior, we need to have a thorough understanding of which energy-consuming activities they perform and how these are performed. Thus, insights into the individual’s activities related to energy consumption should be gathered at a high-granular level.<br/>Traditional sources of information about energy consumption, such as smart sensor devices and surveys, can be costly to set-up, may lack contextual information, have infrequent updates or are not publicly accessible. In this research, we propose to use user-generated content - and specifically, social media content - as a complementary source of information due to its rich and semantic nature. A huge amount of social media data is generated by hundreds of millions of people every day. These data sources are also publicly available and provide real-time data which is often tagged to space and time. Social media data also contains a lot of meta data, making it a good source for the recognition of energy-consuming activities performed by individuals.<br/>This thesis contributes the Social Smart Meter framework in order to meet the aim of automatically processing user-generated content for the description of energy-consuming activities, both at individual and group level. Four different categories of energy-consuming activities are distinguished: dwelling, food consumption, leisure, and mobility. To get a better understanding of the domain of energy-consuming activities, we contribute the Social Smart Meter Ontology (SSMO). This ontology forms the base for the data processing pipeline, which is developed in order to collect and enrich the data using several state-of-the-art techniques. Hereafter, the enriched data is classified to the different categories of energy-consuming activities using a dictionary- and rule-based approach, along with a classification confidence. To find ground truth and to evaluate the framework’s performance, a user-based evaluation approach was used.<br/>Furthermore, we contribute a Web-based application to support the analyses at group (i.e., city and neighborhood) level. Case studies are performed for the cities of Amsterdam and Istanbul, for which 275K social media posts are collected. The aggregated results are analyzed, providing more insights into the energy-consuming activities identified in the collected social media content. The majority of the classified social media posts refers to leisure activities. In addition, by examining for each post whether there exists a (significant) distance to the previous post created by this user, many mobility activities are inferred.<br/>The case studies also contribute to the evaluation and discussion of the framework’s performance; by analyzing its results, the framework’s adherence to reality was discussed. Based on our preliminary results, it seems that using user-generated content has great potential as a complementary source of information for identifying and describing energy-consuming activities that are not yet captured by traditional data sources.","Energy-Consuming Activities; Energy consumption; User-Generated Content; Social Media; Ontology","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For biological sensing, however, the presence of a liquid environment is a pre-requisite. Hollow cantilevers, which allow fluids to be transported inside the resonator, often have high quality factors even when the channels are filled with fluids. This makes them attractive for both sensing mass and determining fluid properties in small volumes. This work aims at determining the density of fluids in picoliter volumes with high resolution using hollow cantilevers. In order to achieve this, we obtain the resonance frequencies of the vibrating microstructure linked to three different modes: the first two flexural modes and the first torsional mode. The first torsional mode is unique to our device and is enabled by the specific geometry of the hollow cantilever. Our approach involves filling the resonator channels with three different fluids in vacuum and monitoring the resonance frequencies and quality factors of the three modes. As the mode number increases, we observe that the shifts in resonance frequency and quality factor for each liquid also increase. This implies that as we approach higher mode numbers there is an improvement in the sensitivity and resolution of the density measurement technique. The quality factors for the three fluids for a specific mode are not significantly different. It is found that in order to achieve higher sensitivities and improved resolution in determining fluid properties, studying higher modes of hollow cantilevers in improved vacuum could indeed be an effective solution.","microcantilever; resonator; hollow cantilever; microfluidics; resonance frequency; quality factor; density","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-05-01","","","","","",""

This interaction should be motivating and encouraging. Therefore, contributing to the values and needs of users. This project demonstrates the value of gamification and intuitive design. These have a positive effect on the behavioural actions and mental state of users. Secondly, this project functions as a demonstration tool to show the possibilities of user experience. Withstanding the strategy and business aspects that are key to involved stakeholders. This project is showing the advantages of incorporating user-centred design at the beginning a project, going to iterative steps rapidly and involving stakeholders. The research is focused on warehouse employees at e-commerce companies. <br/><br/>Operators in warehouses feel underappreciated by their superiors. They have to work in unattractive environments with often heavy physical labour. The work is repetitive and not stimulating, next to this they have to work with complex software and in chaotic environments which limit the situational awareness. People value change and being in control of their own actions. However, the opposite is true for warehouses operators. It is not surprising that the percentage of people who change jobs is high. Due to these resignation rates, e-commerce companies invest in automation. That unlike humans can run 24/7. However, it can be stated that people will never be fully replaceable by robotics/automation. Especially in the e-commerce sector it will take some years before robotics can even be incorporated. Nevertheless, robotic arms are currently a hype and start-up companies are investing in the development of these robots. <br/>Consequently, the first generation of robots will have to collaborate with humans, as the robots are not able to function on their own. Currently, this interaction is not designed, engineers focus on the capabilities and functionalities of robots but forget the human factor. In this project the focus is on humanizing the machines and creating a human touch that feel sincere. An interaction that motivates the users and stimulates self-actualisation. <br/><br/>The final design consists of the layout of the new system, an automated guided vehicle and an user interface, creating a complete ecosystem. This is designed for a specific system, already featured at Vanderlande: Airpick. Opportunities arose in this project, due to the inefficiency of the current system regarding picking. Picking is performed by operators who walk in aisles and grasp item from shelves. Important to realize is that picking is often the beginning of pre-set system, making it a vital aspect of a layout. When people cannot work efficiently the whole system behind it can never reach its full potential. The design featured in this thesis is based on the desirability of the users. Effectively stimulating a workflow that is intuitive, simple and contributes to the situational awareness. Also, it can be concluded that anthropomorphism embodiment in machines stimulates desired behaviour of humans. With attention to current developments in the robotics sector, but still enabling direct implementation. In combination with a suitable business strategy that changes incentives for Vanderlande and their clients. It will stimulate innovation and iterative decision making. Although the final designs still requires validation in a real life environment, it shows its potential as the first steps for Vanderlande to incorporate user experience in early stages of a project. <br","Motivation; Automation; User Experience; Behavior; Situational Awareness; automated guided vehicle","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

One of these developments concerns the recovering house prices and specifically the strong price rises in cities. The other development is related to the growth of the private rental sector and particularly the buy-to-let market. This market consists of the private rental dwellings owned by reasonably small private landlords. These landlords predominantly buy owner-occupied dwellings to rent them out, hence the name buy-to-let. The growing buy-to-let market and the recent price rises have often been linked to each other. Some people claim that the buy-to-let landlords are driving up the house prices. Nevertheless, the relation between these two developments has not been properly studied yet for the Netherlands. Consequently, the objective of this study is to gain more insight in the Dutch buy-to-let market in general and specifically the relation between this market and the regional house price development. Mostly quantitative research methods are applied to answer this research question since especially quantitative information on the Dutch buy-to-let market is missing. House price models have for instance been made for Groningen, Breda and Zoetermeer. The research shows that the Dutch buy-to-let market is still quite small as the buy-to-let dwellings only comprise 5% of the total Dutch housing stock. By comparing the house price development of different municipalities with a varying share of buy-to-let, it can be seen that the recent house price increases are on average stronger for the municipalities with a high share of buy-to-let dwellings. It is however possible that these stronger increases are caused by other factors than buy-to-let. When comparing the results of the three regional house price models no big differences in the drivers are found. The results show that the determinants for the house price development are, despite the varying share of buy-to-let dwellings, in general the same for the three municipalities. Furthermore, a buy-to-let indicator could not explain some of the remaining unexplained variance. Based on these results, it can be concluded that none of the results actually point at an inflationary effect of buy-to-let investments. However, because only three municipalities were studied, no general conclusions can be drawn and the possible inflationary effect of buy-to-let landlords cannot be completely excluded.","housing market; buy-to-let; house price development; private rental sector","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

A new system, the active switching circuit was proposed as a means to actively sense shading and switch between three wiring configurations drawing inspiration from matrix converter theory. The active switching circuit prototype would operate for 16 solar cells arranged in a 4 x 4-cell solar panel and be able to change the wiring configuration of these sixteen cells using switches. The base unit of the solar panel is a substring composed of four solar cells in series and the circuit would switch between three wiring configurations. The shading would be measured through four current sense resistors and amplifiers, with one of these pairs in each substring and a differential operational amplifier system to measure the voltage across the strings. The current and voltage measurement helps determine the power output of the panel. A Simulink model of the system was first created and a panel with 4 x 4 solar cell arrangement ordered and then measurements made with shading to verify if the shading model was accurate. From these results a Simulink model for the active switching circuit was designed to test the theory of its functionality and if such a circuit could be controlled to switch between the three wiring configurations.

There is a clear trend to installation in deeper waters and to larger wind turbines, to maximize the energy output. The majority of offshore windmills use a monopile foundation, which due to the current trends are getting larger. Seaway Heavy Lifting (SHL) is a company that installs these monopile foundations, with their Heavy Lift Vessels (HLV). The largest HLV of Seaway can transport and install three monopiles at a time. However, with larger monopiles it is expected to be reduced to two monopiles or even less. In order to be competitive in the monopile installation market, SHL is looking for a method to transport the monopiles to the HLV, instead of using the HLV for transportation. A previous comparative study showed that floating transport of monopiles to the HLV is the most favorable method. However, SHL is unexperienced with this method and therefore requires a study on developing the best method to install the monopiles within the workability of the HLV. Therefore, the thesis goal is:<br/>""Design of a method for installation of large floating monopiles in heavy weather conditions"".<br/>To design such a method, it will first be determined what steps are necessary and which options can used to fulfill these steps.

The best two methods will be subjected to a sensitivity analysis to determine its feasibility.<br/>The method consists of five steps: floatation, towing, mooring, hook-in and lifting. A multicriteria analysis shows that using airbags is the most favorable method of making the monopile float, while using a flange clamp for towing and lifting. In order to reduce motions, the mooring can be either on the side of the vessel in a gripper frame, or by sinking one end of the monopile to the seabed. When the monopile is in moored position the pre-rigged rigging can be taken over by the main hook of the crane. <br/>Both methods are modelled in the simulation software package Ansys AQWA. A soil model has been made to assess the influence of the grounding on the motion behaviour of the monopile. Due to the soil properties it is faster and relatively accurate to model the connection between the soil and the monopile as a hinge instead of applying the soil model. The system is subjected to different waveheights and wavelengths, while varying the direction of the environmental forces, the trim of the monopile on the seabed and the orientation of the monopile to the vessel.<br/>The installation of a grounded monopile in heavy weather is a feasible option. The simulations have shown that installation is possible up till a significant waveheigth of two meters with a peak period of 8s. The least trimmed position has the best performance over different environmental forces directions. The best option for installation is in a configuration where the vessel and the monopile are facing the environmental conditions head-on, with a 42 degrees monopile trim. However, it has to be noted that other monopile orientations with respect to the HLV are performing good as well, as long as the trim of the monopile is 42 degrees. Using other trim options is possible, but limited to specific orientations.<br/>The installation of monopiles with a gripper attached to the vessel seems to be a viable option, but only once the soil model is improved. The simplification of the soil model by replacing it with a hinge gives uncertainties in the real force acting on the interface between the vessel and the grounded monopile. However, when considering the RMS force of 30 minute simulations without taking lateral forces into account, the results are well within the set boundaries.<br/>Thus can be concluded that installation of a floating monopile is feasible, when using the grounding method. It is recommended to improve the soil model for both methods, to improve the accuracy of the results. To ensure a safe installation and a safe operation during its lifetime, the structural integrity of the monopile should be investigated. Small deformations can drastically reduce the fatigue life of the structure. An end-plug to lower the monopile to the seabed and reinforce the structure could be an option to ensure the structural integrity. Furthermore, it should be investigated if a gripperframe is a realistic option due to its size. The dimension could turn out impossible for catching and releasing extra large monopiles in heavy weather conditions. Lastly, it turns out that grounding a monopile is more time consuming and difficult than anticipated. Therefore it is recommended to research the installation of a free floating monopile or mooring a floating monopile alongside the HLV.<br","Offshore; Monopile; Installation; floating; Heavy Lift Vessel","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-08-28","","","","","",""

The baseline of this work is semantic instance segmentation with discriminative loss function.The baseline work proposes a novel discriminative loss function with which the semantic net-work can learn a n-D embedding for all pixels belonging to instances. Embeddings of the same instances are attracted to their own centers while centers of different instance embeddings repulse each other. Two limitations are set for attraction and repulsion, namely the in-margin and out-margin. A post-processing procedure (clustering) is required to infer instance indices from embeddings with an important parameter bandwidth, the threshold for clustering. The contribution of the work in this thesis are several new methods to incorporate depth information into the baseline work. One simple method is adding scaled depth directly to RGB embeddings, which is named as scaling. Through theorizing and experiments, this work also proposes that depth pixels can be encoded into 1-D embeddings with the same discriminative loss function and combined with RGB embeddings. Explored combination methods are fusion and concatenation. Additionally, two depth pre-processing methods are proposed, replication and coloring. From the experimental result, both scaling and fusion lead to significant improvements over baseline work while concatenation contributes more to classes with lots of similarities.","Deep Learning; Computer Vision; instance segmentation; Intelligent Vehicles","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Vehicle Engineering | Cognitive Robotics","",""

A central focus on this process is the transition from fossil fuel based energy sources to clean Renewable Energy Sources (RES). However, the intermittency of RES (e.g. solar and wind) presents a formidable challenge to achieve a stable and reliable supply-demand balance in grid oper- ations. To achieve high levels of RES deployment, increasing the power system flexibility will be central to accommodate large fluctuations in supply and to cope with peak demand. Prospects of electricity storage technologies have emerged as a potential key technology to manage high levels of RES in the power system.<br/><br/>Recent projections on the cost of electricity storage show a high decrease in the next five years ([1],[2], [3]). As the commercial maturity of batteries might become a reality within the next decade, many questions remain on the role of batteries in the power system, where batteries should be located? What capacity will be optimal? What kind of battery services are the most valuable? How do batteries contribute to the large deployment of distributed RES installations? Significant research has been done on estimating sizing and sitting of storage in power systems. Yet, most of this research treat storage capacity as continuous instead of discrete, i.e. allocating storage by percentages of a total allowed capacity, wherever necessary in the grid. Despite these previous studies have provided interesting contributions on the value of storage in the power system, many of them lack the modelling of power flows, technical limits, or voltage considerations.<br/><br/>This thesis focuses on battery flexibility in medium voltage grids. Specifically, how to define cost-effective strategies to deploy batteries in a medium voltage grid? What is the optimal battery location in a distribution grid? And how do the technical limits of the power grid influence the allocation of storage? To address these questions, an optimization model was developed to simulate half-hourly operational decisions for a distribution grid. The model is multi-period and includes: power flows, diverse technical consideration for different battery sizes, high RES penetration levels, time of use electricity prices (half-hour dynamic prices), load data of actual customers and battery costs. To decide on the battery location, the model employs binary variables to determine the investment and sitting of the battery in a distribution grid. That is, the model is a mixed integer linear program with multi-period features which provides an investment analysis for the cost-effective sitting of batteries in a time horizon of 10 years. The model is implemented to the IEEE 33 bus test system. Results show that in general battery location and size strategies are driven by multiple factors, which can be either fixed or dynamic, like thermal limits and power load consumption, respectively. Some relevant findings are: First, flexibility in terms of power arbitrage delivers costs reductions of around 4% when RES production is low, compared to a No-Batteries case. Moreover, when RES production is high, the reductions in total costs can ramp up to 12% below the No-Batteries case. Also, this model decides to al-<br/><br/>i<br/> <br/><br/>locate batteries only if they are economically feasible for a 10-year time horizon. These results indicate a potential revenue up to 2.1 million pounds (GBP) based on the investment in batteries. And they are based on battery cost prices from 2008, together with several optimistic projections for the next decade. Furthermore, depending on battery size, RES penetration, RES generation and technical limits, batteries tend to be located for buses at the entrance of branches with high loads. Likewise, line limits and voltage limits proved to be decisive in the election of buses and the number of batteries placed.<br/><br/>On one hand, results show that optimal allocation strategies depend on grid topology features and technical limits, on the other hand, they also have a high dependency on time- varying and unsteady factors (e.g. power generation and loads). The optimal location strategies tend to change and adapt to the dynamics of the system. Moreover, with the exception of the slack bus, every bus in the system turned out to be an optimal location, at least once. These results indicate that batteries might be useful in every bus of the dis- tribution grid, but only if each battery is operated in coordination and cooperation with one another. These insights support the idea of designing local electricity markets. Based on a reflection of this work, we recommend a market design that retrieves day-ahead and intraday DSO-reports of the battery operations and the flexibility that is available in the distribution grid. And also a subsequent structure of market incentives and penalties that maximizes the value of flexibility while keeping non-optimal operations to a minimum.<br/><br/>In short, this thesis contributes with a novel modelling approach that can shed some lights on the optimal battery allocation problem for distribution grids. Moreover, it pro- vides insights on how location affects the value of storage, how optimal locations are affected by multiple technical factors. And finally, it also provide some reflections on the need to collectively, cooperatively and coordinately operate the storage resources in the grid by considering market-based solutions.<br","Energy Storage; Distribution Grid; Optimisation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","European Wind Energy Masters (EWEM)","",""

(mentor); Vuik, Cornelis (graduation committee); van Horssen, W.T. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","In the past decades, several EOR (Enhanced Oil Recovery) techniques have been developed to increase the amount of oil recoverable from a reservoir. Among these techniques, polymer flooding consists in the injection of a solution of water and polymer into the reservoir, and it is performed in order to lower the mobility of injected water. A peculiarity of a water-polymer flow through a porous medium is the velocity enhancement, or hydrodynamic acceleration, that affects the polymer molecules. Experimentally, polymers are observed to travel faster than inert chemical species. Therefore, when simulating numerically a polymer flooding, a velocity enhancement effect has to be incorporated into the governing equations to accurately predict oil recovery. The simple model that introduces a constant enhancement factor, usually implemented in commercial simulators, leads to an ill-posed problem, causing stability issues in the simulations, which further leads to a monotonicity loss in the solution: the polymer is predicted to pile-up at the water-oil interface. While accumulation of polymer at the water front is not necessarily unphysical, it should not be the result of a mathematical ill-posed problem. Hence, an alternative model, employing a saturation dependent factor, has been proposed in the work of Bartelds et al. (G.A. Bartelds, J. Bruining, and J. Molenaar. The modeling of velocity enhancement in polymer flooding. Transport in Porous Media, 26(1):75–88, 1997), and has been extended by Hilden et al. (S.T. Hilden, H.M. Nilsen, and X. Raynaud. Study of the well-posedness of models for the<br/>inaccessible pore volume in polymer flooding. Transport in Porous Media, 114(1):65–86, 2016) to overcome some physical restrictions. In this thesis, these models are re-examined through a thorough analytical study in the one-dimensional case. An analytical solution, resulting in an acceleration of the polymer front, is computed for the well-posed model proposed by Bartelds, while the extended enhancement factor derived by Hilden is shown to lead again to an ill-posed problem. A study of the monotonicity of the numerical schemes reveals that accumulation of polymer at the water front is strictly related to ill-posedness.<br/>Obtaining accurate numerical solutions is not an easy task. Commercial simulators adopt fully implicit schemes to solve the multi-phase flow, and transport of chemical agents is solved through the development and coupling of separate modules. In this case, the use of high-resolution methods for the transport of polymer is not compatible with the first order solver for the underlying flow.<br/>To investigate the interaction of the enhancement model proposed by Bartelds with other physical phenomena, adsorption of polymer onto the reservoir rock is added to the governing equations. The problem maintains the well-posedness property, but because of a raise in equations complexity, only numerical results are presented. The model is then extended to the two-dimensional case and, relying on numerical solutions, similar conclusions as in the one-dimensional case are derived.","Polymer flooding; Inaccessible Pore Volume; Velocity Enhancement; Numerical modeling; Enhanced Oil Recovery","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics | COSSE (Computer Simulations for Science and Engineering)","",""

On the national level, the economic potentials of both cost assumptions are more than enough to fulfil the total electricity demand of the country. However, Indonesia seizes an immensely broad area of land and sea. A big part of the potential lies outside the provincial boundaries, far away from demand centres. Still, when only the provincial potentials are considered, the total economic potential is higher than the demand. This does not necessarily mean that the available resource is accessible by the demand centres, though. The available resources of OTEC are not distributed evenly throughout the country. Some areas are blessed with remarkably good resources in abundance while the other areas are not so lucky with the resources. Hence, the stations are selected based on the proximity to the demand centres. It turns out that based on the results of the thesis, it is not possible to fully supply the electricity demand on the provincial level in Indonesia solely by OTEC electricity production of the selected stations. It is indeed possible for some areas to do that, but in other areas, there is no economic potential at all. However, it is not likely that a single resource will ever be used to cover 100% of supply. In this sense, there is a huge opportunity for OTEC to enter the energy landscape and become the provider of baseload electricity<br","OTEC; Renewable Energy; Economic Potential; Ocean Energy; GIS; Techno-economic analysis; Geographic Information Systems","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

Quist backcasting framework, due to it's flexible nature has been used as the main skeleton for this research. As a part of the study, 8 islands with significant populations have been chosen from within the archipelago. The current energy system in the islands is largely characterized by both technical and economic inefficiencies. The island largely relies on diesel for it's power supply. The underdeveloped nature of the economy in the archipelago, especially in the rural areas, enables the usage of large amounts of traditional fuels such as firewood and crop residue for their daily energy needs. As a part of the backcasting analysis, the desired future energy system has been envisioned for the islands and a modelling exercise has been performed to optimize the sizing of the energy sources in the future system using levelized cost of electricity as a parameter. These optimized sizings have found to be largely dependent upon the learning rates and the future costs of technologies. Transitional pathways for each of the islands have been drafted to materialize these visions. It has been observed that large amounts of infrastructure upgradation and a strong policy framework are the main interventions necessary. In order to facilitate a transition in the rural areas, drafting a separate rural energy policy would be advisable. Overall, this thesis succeeds in blending a wide range of topics into the backcasting framework and uses it well to draw tangible transitional pathways.","Backcasting Analysis; Energy Transition; Renewable Energy; Optimal Configuration; Andaman and Nicobar Islands","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

This approach has gained popularity by projects in fast changing environments, such as the information technology (IT) industry. Nevertheless, many companies that adopted agile methods are still structured according to a traditional, non-agile form of organization. Projects with an agile project management approach embedded in a non-agile organization might face numerous difficulties. What these difficulties exactly encompass is not fully understood yet and therefor this research strives to fulfil the following objective: “Explore the interaction between agile project management and its organizational context.” <br/>In this way this research aims to contribute to literature about the implementation of agile within an organization. Next to that, this research provides insight to organizations about how an organization is best aligned with agile. This research uses the term software delivery, since this includes projects as well as on-going activities. This results in the following research question: “What kind of adjustments can an organization make to better facilitate agile software delivery?”<br/>The literature study resulted in a compilation of eleven aspects that are relevant to examine the interaction between agile software delivery and the organizational context. These aspects are used as guidance during the interviews. The interaction of agile with the organizational context is discussed with the interviewees in relation to these eleven aspects, in that way creating an image of the alignment of agile within the organization. <br/>Multiple commonalities are observed over the different cases. Interpretation of the results of the cross-case analysis resulted in three patterns. The first pattern shows how organizations tend to focus on team level when implementing agile and have the tendency to neglect the organizational adjustments around teams. The organizational surrounding is in this research described as the governance structure around the teams and includes the division of tasks, responsibilities and other governance mechanisms. Several of the interview observations can be explained by an insufficient adjustment of the governance structure. <br/>A second pattern is to what extend agile is understood and how it is interpreted. Some of the interview observations can be explained by an insufficient understanding of agile. Adjustment of the governance structure around the software delivery teams should be aligned with agile concepts. <br/>The third pattern shows that several observations can be explained by the fact that change needs time. Every organization undertakes a transition when implementing agile software delivery to change the governance structure and to understand agile. Alignment of agile within the organization depends on the stage an organization is in during this transition. <br/>Based on these patterns, this research concludes that an organization could consider adjusting its governance structure to better facilitate agile software delivery. When making these adjustments, a sufficient understanding of agile is required to ensure that adjustments of the governance structure are aligned with agile software delivery. Next to that, the implementation of agile and the adjustments of the governance structure can be considered as a transition that needs to be managed pro-actively. <br","Agile; Software development; organizational design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

However, the variations of PM2.5 and visibility involve complicated physical and chemical processes, which make their accurate predictions challenging.<br/> In this thesis, methodologies to predict PM2.5, PM10, and visibility using Long Short-Term Memory Neural Networks (LSTM NN) were investigated. The first step of the proposed methodology was dataset analysis and preprocessing, which is an important step in almost all machine learning problems. Because missing data and confusing or incorrect data are common in large datasets, noise and errors were corrected and missing rates were calculated at first. Afterward, datasets were visualized to evaluate the missing phenomenon of different features. Due to the explored strong spatiotemporal correlations, for air quality features with high missing rates, linear interpolations were implemented when the missing granularity is small and k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) imputations were used when the missing interval is large. <br/> Furthermore, the PM2.5 or PM10 prediction is usually considered as a regression task and aimed at minimizing the mean squared error (MSE) between the predicted values and measured ones. However, due to the high variability and explored ‘class-imbalance’ phenomenon of visibility data, that is, most of the data we have are related to 'normal' situations and extreme conditions are rare events, its predictions can be better dealt with as a classification problem. Because the most interesting cases to be predicted are those rare extreme events, the target was adapted to minimize the weighted cross-entropy. <br/> The second step of the proposed methodology was to configure the frameworks. For PM2.5 predictions, feature engineering was employed to the select appropriate features and some model hyperparameters were set through grid searches and coordinate descent. A coarse-to-fine sampling scheme was used to determine the weights in the loss function of visibility predictions. <br/> The third step of our research was performance evaluation. For PM2.5 predictions, the proposed spatiotemporal LSTM framework can overcome the systematic underestimation that Lotos-Euros (a chemical transport models (CTMs) based system) generally produces by analyzing their scatter plots and confusion matrices. Additionally, it performs better than an LSTM-based prediction framework (Fan J et al. (2017) [9]) that also considers spatial correlations among stations and performs a similar task in a similar region when comparing their rooted mean square errors (RMSE) and mean absolute errors (MAE). Differences between the hyperparameters of these two frameworks were analyzed. <br/> As for PM10 predictions, the training efficiency can be improved significantly by transferring knowledge from PM2.5 predictions to PM10 predictions through model fine-tuning. Compared with Lotos-Euros, the LSTM framework also has competitive performance in PM10 predictions. As the first attempt at applying LSTM NN to predict visibility, forecasts are acceptable in practice. The total accuracy rate reaches 90.61%. The recall rate of the normal situation (L1) is 93% while its precision rate is 96%, indicating its superior prediction performance in the normal situations. Besides, for each visibility level, the number of correct predictions is larger than that of negative predictions. <br","PM2.5 predictions; PM10 predictions; Visibility predictions; Deep learning; LSTM; Transfer learning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-08-27","","","","Applied Mathematics","",""

However, not always biomaterial implantation is successful, and the main causes of implant failure remain implant associated infections (IAI) and poor osseointegration. In the recent years, additive manufacturing and titanium surface modification have been extensively researched in order to develop bone implants able to enhance bone formation at bone/material interface while reducing the risk of microbial adhesion. New bone formation at the implant site is an inflammation-driven process, since the implantation of a biomaterial in the human body is always followed by an immune response. Among the inflammatory cells involved in the inflammation stage following initial hemostasis after surgery, macrophages play a crucial role in regulating subsequent bone formation and remodelling secreting a wide range of factors. Therefore, in this study, human macrophage response to 3D printed Ti-6Al-4V surfaces was investigated. Ti-6Al-implants were modified by plasma electrolytic oxidation (PEO), during which an oxide layer containing electrolyte components were generated on implant surfaces. In order to generate an antimicrobial coating, silver nano-particles (Ag NPs) were also incorporated into the surface. Surface morphology and chemical composition were analysed by SEM. Human macrophages were cultured in the presence of SLM implants in a transwell culture or directly on the surface for 4 days. Macrophage morphology and viability were assessed with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and fluorescence microscopy. Cell secreted factors were analysed performing an ELISA assay while gene expression analysis was performed using qPCR. Human mesenchymal stem cell (hMSC) response in terms of morphology and viability was also evaluated after 4 days of culture. PEO modification on SLM surfaces resulted in an additional TiO2 layer containing electrolyte components (Ca, P and Ag) and interconnected porosity. The ion release from SLM surfaces did not have an effect on human macrophage polarisation, while when cells where cultured directly on the implants, they secreted and expressed different amounts of pro- and anti-inflammatory factors. SLM NT (not PEO-treated) surfaces up-regulated macrophage pro-inflammatory cytokines compared to SLM PEO surfaces. However, cells cultured on SLM NT up-regulated also anti-inflammatory factors. SLM surfaces containing Ag NPs were cytotoxic for human macrophages but not for hMSCs. In general, both SLM NT and SLM PEO surfaces expressed anti-inflammatory and tissue repair-related macrophage factors, suggesting that either implant geometry achieved by 3D printing and surface biofunctionalization may have beneficial impact on promoting macrophage anti-inflammatory secretion and subsequent osteogenesis around the implant.","bone implants; macrophages; osteoimmunomodulation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-08-28","","","","","",""

The materials that are particularly vulnerable to supply disruptions and are of high importance to the economy are called critical raw materials. The Dutch government has adopted the goal of having an entirely circular economy by 2050 to reduce the vulnerability of the economy to critical materials problems. However, the literature indicates that adopting a new economic model is not sufficient and that a sustainability transformation is essential. According to literature, both a sustainability transformation and economic degrowth are essential to reach a situation of sustainable material use and therefore resilience to supply disruptions. Moreover, the literature emphasises that governance, and especially political leadership, is indispensable in achieving a successful transformation. This research shows how governance can bring about the desired sustainability transformation to reach a social and economic system that is resilient to situations of material constraint in the Netherlands. This study presents a theoretical framework that is tested using the case of governance on material constraint in Britain during the Second World War. The results are applied to the case of the Netherlands to provide insight into the way forward towards a society that is resilient to situations of material constraint.<br/> The results show that a broad approach, including the entire social-ecological system, is essential and that the government can use selective pressures and windows of opportunity to steer and accelerate the transformation. The case study of policy on material constraint in Britain underlines the importance of planning besides the transformation. Additionally, the research has uncovered trust, and therefore the importance of equal and just distribution, as the foundation of resilience. <br/>The Dutch government should take the responsibility of bringing about sustainable development and use its authority to define a sharp vision and specific goals for the sustainability transformation. If diversity and distribution are adequately addressed during the transformation process, the Netherlands is in the position to achieve a high level of resilience to critical materials problems. Resilience does not mean that situations of material constraint will not occur, or that they will not affect the society. It does mean that the Dutch social-ecological system will be flexible enough to change according to the new situation while maintaining its function and provide its society with the basic needs for living, even in times of severe material constraint. The new system is a system that is balanced and diverse, and, therefore, far less dependent on economic growth or material supplies.<br/> Valuable research that could be done to build on this work would be to conduct a similar analysis using one or more different cases, such as the period of resource constraint during the 1970s. Additionally, further research could be done into the different phases of the framework, to provide more insight into specific actions that can be taken to transform a social-ecological system. In a practical sense, this theoretical framework that has been developed in this research can be used by government officials to test its usefulness in helping to develop a transition pathway for the government, including a timeline.<br","Critical Raw Materials; Circular Economy; Resilience; Sustainability Transformation; Governance; Material Constraint; Britain; Second World War; The Netherlands; Sustainability; Industrial Ecology","en","master thesis","","","","","","The Master's programme Industrial Ecology is jointly organised by Leiden University and Delft University of Technology.","","","","","","Industrial Ecology","",""

In this thesis, we investigate the privacy concerns of these systems arising in the process of state estimation - a well known and a widely studied concept in systems and control. Our work draws motivation from smart grids and supply chain economics, and hence, we study two different privacy problems in the context of state estimation and rely on cryptography to solve these challenges.<br/><br/>In the first problem, we study the privacy challenges of state estimation in smart grids. Smart grids promise a more reliable, efficient, economically viable, and an environment-friendly electricity infrastructure for the future. State estimation in smart grids plays a vital role in system monitoring, reliable operation, automation, and grid stabilization. However, the power consumption data collected from the users during estimation can be privacy-sensitive. Furthermore, the topology of the grid can be exploited by malicious entities during state estimation to launch attacks without getting detected. Motivated by the essence of a secure state estimation process, we propose a weighted-least-squares estimation carried out batch-wise at repeated intervals where the resource-constrained clients utilize a malicious cloud for computation services. We exploit a highly efficient and verifiable obfuscation-based cryptographic solution to perform the computations of the estimation process securely in the presence of a malicious adversary. Simulation results demonstrate a high level of obscurity both in time and frequency domain making it difficult for the malicious adversary to interpret information about the original power consumption data of the consumers and the grid topology from the obfuscated datasets. <br/><br/>Our second problem deals with the challenge of protecting a dynamical supply chain model while releasing the state sequences generated by the model for data aggregation to an external possible adversary. Releasing state samples generated by a dynamical system model with high accuracy for data aggregation and other statistical purposes can also be used for reverse engineering and estimating sensitive model parameters. Upon identification of the system model, the adversary may even use it for predicting sensitive data in the future. Hence, preserving a confidential dynamical process model is crucial for the survival of many industries. Motivated by the need to protect the system model as a trade secret, we propose a mechanism based on differential privacy to render such model identification techniques ineffective while preserving the utility of the state samples for data aggregation purposes. We deploy differential privacy by generating noise according to the sensitivity of the query and adding it to the state vectors at each time instant. We derive analytical expressions to quantify the bound on the sensitivity function and estimate the minimum noise level required to guarantee differential privacy. Furthermore, we present numerical analysis and characterize the privacy-utility trade-off that arises when deploying differential privacy. Simulation results demonstrate that through differential privacy, we achieve acceptable privacy level sufficient to mislead the adversary while still managing to retain high utility level of the state samples for data aggregation. <br/><br","systems and control; cybersecurity; state estimation; cryptography","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-08-01","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

It is also important that these coefficients provide some flexibility to the person performing the correlation to introduce artificial ties when items are so close to each other that, for practical purposes, they may be considered as tied. Accounting for these different scenarios of tied items in rankings permits performing per topic comparisons of IR systems, which was earlier limited due to the presence of ties on individual topics. Comparing rankings at the topic level, the expected variability of the rankings can be studied to potentially improve the systems on the topics for which they perform poorer than average.

A detailed finite element model is used to predict the structural behavior of the Pioneering Spirit. The finite element method is based on fundamental principles in solid mechanics. However, when using finite element models considerable differences between the predicted and observed behavior of a structure can occur, even when best industry practices are used to create such models. Because of these<br/>differences there is a need to validate the detailed finite element model of the Pioneering<br/>Spirit.<br/>Finite element model updating is a method that can validate finite element models. In this method the discrepancy between the measured behavior and the observed behavior is minimized by modifying model assumptions and parameters. Currently a number of sensors is installed on the Pioneering Spirit, which can be used to find the measured behavior. Whether or not the measured behavior is detailed enough to be used in the validation of the finite element model is the subject of this research. To investigate this a simplified finite element model of the Pioneering Spirit was created using beam elements, this model provides the predicted behavior. Then sensitivity-based finite element model updating was implemented and applied to the beam model. <br/>Simulated<br/>measurements were used to show that the beam model can be updated using the current sensor setup. When actual measurements were used to update the beam model it was found that the beam model does not correlate with the measured behavior, making it impossible to update the beam model in a meaningful way. <br/>The detailed model does correlate with measured behavior. By assuming that the method will work similarly for the detailed model as it did for the beam model, it can be concluded that the detailed model can be validated using the current sensor setup for a static case.

The wind turbines are constructed in wind farms, and are serviced with relatively small crew transfer vessels. These vessels transport repair crews from the mainland to the farms and back within a day. One of the big challenges is that these transits can cause motion sickness. If one crew member gets sick, the vessel is legally required to return to the harbour, without performing the repair. It is of interest to predict motion sickness, since both a failed repair and a broken wind turbines that could have been repaired are costly. This can be done by predicting the motion sickness incidence (MSI), which is an objective measure for motion sickness.<br/>The goal of this thesis is to predict MSI using the wave conditions measured in or near the wind farms, by means of an analytical and numerical approach using machine learning. Testing is done on two sites: the Greater Gabbard wind farm and the Westermost Rough wind farm. The analytical approach relates the recorded wave spectrum to the motion spectrum of the vessel, but proves infeasible as a stand-alone method.

Because these vessels sail with speeds up to 45 knots in inshore waters, a large amount of focus and accurate path following is needed for safe navigation, and due to large accelerations, there is a high level of physical strain. These two factors cause a high (prolonged) mental and physical workload which can heighten mental and physical fatigue, resulting in higher risks due to reduced alertness and mental performance. With this in mind, the focal point of this thesis is to increase the safety of the FRISC during high speed navigation by increasing the path following performance and reducing the level of fatigue through lowering the workload. With extensive literature research a possible solution was found to increase the safe navigation. Namely, haptic feedback which will decrease the workload and increase the path following performance. With this in mind, the following research question arises:<br/>To what extent can haptic feedback, implemented into the steering system of the FRISC, contribute to safe navigation during (nightly) high speed inshore navigation?<br/>A FRISC operates with high speeds in inshore waters, following a well prepared detailed planned route. During such an operation the FRISC is subject to performance shaping factors, factors “which inﬂuence the likelihood of an error occurring” [1]. With the use of the literature, a possible solution for almost all the factors, related to the FRISC, were found. This solution is a haptic feedback system which will lower the workload and increase the path following performance. An active guidance system is developed with two types of controllers (waypoint controller and XTE controller) to “advise” the operator with the correct rudder angle, to follow a preplanned route during high speed inshore navigation. The contribution of this thesis is tested by the implementation of a haptic shared control, and by investigating the cross track error and the workload. The results of the investigation of the XTE were unambiguous. The XTE controller lowers the mean and median XTE values by 20% and the absolute maximum value is lowered by 37% compared to manual control. The waypoint controller resulted in higher XTE values which means that manual control has the preference above the waypoint controller based on the XTE. Furthermore, the participants indicated that the perceived workload was 37% and 44% lower with the use of the waypoint controller and XTE controller respectively. The physical workload was compared between the experience of the participants and the measured physical demand. This comparison resulted in the fact that the experience of the participants was not in line with the actual physical eﬀort. The physical eﬀort was the highest with the use of both controllers whereas the experience of the physical workload was the lowest.

If empathy is so important for collaboration in design and establishing human-centered working alliances, how come, then the focus is mainly on the user research and how come designers are not taught of the related skills, attitudes and behaviors? The gap in the design education field about empathy training for professional contexts creates an opportunity for design. In this project based on knowledge from multidisciplinary literature review, the following design goal has been formulated: designing a training material which can be used in the educational setting by design educators &amp; coaches to help design students increase their awareness of the six key attention points of empathy as a design skill.’’To create the basis of the training material, a long list of skills, attitudes and behaviors related to empathy is structured from fields of healthcare, human-centered therapy, business, social and positive psychology and design. Then, in collaboration with the design educators and design students from the Delft University of Technology, the long list has been scaled down to six key attention points; willingness, active listening &amp; attending, open-mindedness, embracing differences, sensitivity and holistic view.With the inspiration of training methods used in above-mentioned fields, these six attention points are used in the ideation rounds as the basis of the training concept. After several iterations, the concept is refined and tested with design students. ‘‘Empathy as A Design Skill : Practicing Six Key Attention Points’’ is a training material set consisting of printable materials which are designed to be used during the five steps; describe, internalize, sensitize, apply and evaluate. Each attention point is described with examples, internalized with exercises and the students are sensitized with homework each week. After six of the attention points are introduced, a real-life interview is arranged as a means of applying the six attention points. This interview is asked to be video recorded which is used for the final step; evaluate in which the design students are asked to reflect on their performance. The final test for user evaluation with design students reveals that this self-reflective training material helps design students to be more conscious of the attention points then, recognize these points both in their professional life and their daily lives.","empathic designer; design education; empathic awareness; learning and teaching empathy; willingness; empathic listening; open-mindedness; embracing differences; sensitivity; detachment","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

One of the goals of the GasDrive project is to broaden the limits between knock and misfire for the gas engine. Extending the operating limit could be achieved by addition of anode-off gas. Before anode-off gas can be used in combustion together with natural gas in the GasDrive project, the combustion characteristics of anode-off gas must be known. In this thesis, a literature review is conducted in order to explore similar gasses. One such gas is producer gas, on which both experimental and numerical studies have been conducted by other researchers. To investigate the performance of anode-off gas, an altered in-cylinder model was used. The model is verified using producer gas as a fuel, with the experimental data from producer gas combustion in an IC engine. The model functions properly and is used to investigate anode-off gas combustion.<br/>In modelling the combustion of anode-off gas, multiple parameters are kept constant and similar to that of producer gas. These parameters include the Vibe parameters, engine geometry, air excess ratio, T1, p1, and stoichiometric gas mass fraction from the previous cycle. The combustion duration relative to producer gas is modelled based on the ratio of turbulent flame speeds. This turbulent flame speed is a combination of laminar flame speed and turbulence intensity. At first the SOC is kept constant as well, only altering the EOC for different combustion durations. The maximum power output is 79 kWe for anode-off gas with a 50% fuel utilization rate. The maximum efficiency is 20%. The peak pressure is 104 bar, which is higher than for producer gas, but falls within the limits of what the engine can handle. The peak temperature is 2847 K, which is more than 700 K higher than producer gas. The engine, it is believed, can not handle this temperature. The lowest peak temperature is reached for anode-off gas with a 85% fuel utilization rate and is 2652 K. This is still outside normal engine operating temperatures. Combustion of anode-off gas under stoichiometric conditions in an IC engine is therefore not feasible. Increasing the air excess ratio could resolve this issue, but can not be done in the current model without having experimental data on anode-off gas. The fuel consumption is 6-18 times higher than conventional fuels, also showing that anode-off gas combustion would not be an advantage over conventional fuels. More power at lower temperatures can be reached when retarding start of combustion, achieving MBT timing. Peak power is achieved using anode-off gas with a 50% fuel utilization rate and is 82 kWe. The corresponding peak temperature is 2822 K, which is also outside normal operating conditions of IC engines. Based on the modelling results, it can be said that combustion of anode-off gas is possible in a IC engine, but power outputs will be lower than conventional fuels and fuel consumption will be higher.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-08-27","","","","Marine Technology","",""

The project was executed in a collaboration with TU Delft and R-Go Tools and took approximately six months. RSI, CVS and technostress affect the personal as well as the professional happiness of computer workers. Among different preventions, aimed at decreasing the risk of developing these syndromes, implementing frequent breaks at work, especially macro breaks, seems to be very promising. Unfortunately, the existing anti-RSI software, aimed at facilitating breaks at work, is considered to be annoying and disturbing. Therefore, the majority of computer workers still take an insufficient number of breaks, putting themselves at a high risk of developing the aforementioned chronic diseases. The analysis of the problem included literature review, company analysis, user research and context analysis. Afterwards, different ideas addressing the problem were generated based on the formulated list of requirements. Consequently, the best ideas were developed into concepts. In the end, Break Bottle was chosen as the most suitable solution for the assigned problem. This concept is a smart bottle which encourages users to drink water, to refill the bottle and, eventually, to go to the toilet. The signals come from changes in the appearance of the object. Consequently, the users are expected to take three different macro breaks. The lights were chosen for communicating with the user. Different light sequences are supposed to trigger different responses from the user. The lights are placed inside the shell behind transparent indents. The form of the bottle enables firmer grasping and holding of the object. The grey paint and the green lights together make the bottle look either lively or lifeless depending on whether the lights are switched on or off. Moreover, the product fits well in the office environment, presenting itself both sleek and elegant. The existing anti-RSI software of R-Go Tools needs to be adjusted for controlling the bottle. The type of signal coming from the bottle depends on whether the user drinks the sufficient amount of water and takes enough breaks. A crucial part of the software is a seduction algorithm whose aim is to indirectly make users take more breaks at work. The main objective of the project has been met since the designed product facilitates taking bre¬aks at work by computer workers. The annoyance with the product is expected to be lower than with the existing anti-RSI software since the users already accept the proposed breaks. Moreover, the product facilitates taking macro breaks which increases the chance of preventing the onset of RSI, CVS and technostress. Since the bottle looks very appealing, it is foreseen that the users will be willing to interact with it. Therefore, it is expected that computer workers behaviour will change in response to the appropriate signals coming from the product.","Repetitive Strain Injury; Computer Vision Syndrome; Technostress; Breaks; Computer work","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","","",""

The position of the drill bit needs to be indirectly determined through accelero- and magnetometer measurements.

Then, a method called Minimum Curvature Method (MCM) is applied, which outputs a close idealized approximation of the actual drill bit trajectory. However, systematic and random errors in the magnetometer measurements result in error in position vectors.<br/><br/>A novel solution called Multi-Station Analysis (MSA) determines the systematic (Scale and Bias) errors in the magnetometer measurement data. Using reference measurements, a non-linear least squares error function is minimized, which is equivalent to solving a non-linear system of equations.

Reapplying survey conversion and MCM results in an improved estimate for the actual position vectors.<br/><br/>The main objective of this thesis is to derive a method that describes the uncertainty of the MSA solution. This is primarily done through the method of Monte Carlo simulation. As part of validation, the effect of MSA on final drill bit position is studied and compared with results from an uncertainty model used by the well-bore industry. Secondary, a pessimistic quantification of the uncertainty of MSA solution is given through condition numbers of Jacobian matrices from the Newton-Raphson algorithm applied to MSA, which measure the sensitivity of the non-linear least-squares error. The question whether these condition numbers are a representative measure of MSA solution quality is answered.

We argue that the blockages and unblocking strategy of DTI innovation process can be clearly identified if the innovation system is examined by looking at two levels of analysis, which are structural, related to changes in system’s structure (e.g., actors, networks, governance) and functional, related to the ability of such system to perform certain functions towards achieving its objectives. To the knowledge of the author, there is no theoretical lens which discusses activities and events happened in DTI innovation system to a detailed breakdown of its structural or functional changes. Mainly the existing studies only focus on using the innovation system analysis as the analytical tool for directing innovation policy and neglect the collective action process that is very relevant with characteristics of DI development. Therefore, the research objective is to create and apply a conceptual framework, to identify the unblocking strategy for digital trade infrastructures innovation process by looking at structural and functional analysis of the innovation system.

From the framework evaluation, this study reports that the combination of analyses concerning structural changes and functional performance of an innovation system is capable to provide richer explanation on issues that limit an innovation system to further develop the DI innovation, a strategy that can be done to mobilise the innovation process, and the DI innovation process itself.<br/><br","Data Pipeline; Innovation system; innovation management; Innovation Strategy; Innovation and Technology Strategy; Digital Platforms; collective action","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

More realistic finite element method (FEM) models are a great approach to reduce costs of the implant design process. FEM models could be used to evaluate implant performance against lack of bone ingrowth and medial tibial collapse. Failed bone ingrowth of the tibial component can result in early loosening, suggested to occur due to high micromotions at the implant interface. Additionally, post-operative misalignment, high patient BMI, and stumbling accidents cause medial tibial collapse. These phenomena have been assessed via FEM, where a realistic simulation, adequate constitutive model, loads, and boundary conditions must be selected. Also, the implantation process must be included to account for bone deformations. The purpose of this study was to investigate which constitutive model better predicts implantation and subsequent micromotions, bone ingrowth, and medial collapse. <br/><br/>A FEM model was created from a CT-scanned tibia implanted with a Monoblock and a Persona (Zimmer, Inc., Warsaw, IN) trabecular metal tibial components. Four activities were considered. Four different heterogeneous material models were used: A linear elastic (LE), a softening Von Mises (sVM) model, an ideal isotropic crushable foam (iICF) model, and a hardening isotropic crushable foam Model (hICF) model. The hardening function of the latter model was mathematically demonstrated and validated against existing data. Implantation was performed prior to every analysis. The resulting micromotions were compared to an ingrowth threshold of 40 um to estimate extent of ingrowth. The same material models were used to evaluate medial collapse under stumbling conditions. The ingrowth results of the Monoblock were compared to retrieval. Implant performance was evaluated between the Persona and NexGen.<br/><br/>The hardening function was able to predict yield when compared to experimental data. For the implantation simulations, the sVM model presented the most volume of plastic elements around the implant. The hICF and the sVM models were the best to predict ingrowth, where the latter under-predicted ingrowth and the former over-predicted it. The LE model results were incapable of predicting ingrowth, especially in the regions where press-fit conditions should be present. For medial tibial collapse, the sVM model results presented structural instabilities at relatively low loading thresholds. The iICF model results were incapable to predict medial collapse due to material instabilities. The hICF model was able to predict collapse without instabilities.<br/><br/>Implantation results demonstrate the importance of using ICF plastic models in cementless implant analysis, as it provides the necessary contact stresses around the implant interface. Bone ingrowth results of every material model were not equivalent to the retrieval data, suggesting extra modelling considerations are required. Using a sVM or a hICF model is suggested for micromotions and ingrowth research. Ingrowth results show that the complexity of the plastic models was enough to predict that the Persona implant was not going to outperform the NexGen. Differences in collapse behaviour between material models showed important instabilities that must be considered in future medial collapse studies. Further research is required to realistically simulate the studied phenomena.","FEM analysis; TKA; plasticity; ingrowth; collapse; bone","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Biomedical Engineering | Biomaterials and Tissue Biomechanics","",""

Unfortunately, gas injection has poor sweep efficiency because or reservoir heterogeneity, viscous instability and gravity segregation of injected gas to the top of the formation. Foam can improve the sweep efficiency in gas injection in Enhanced Oil Recovery. The best injection strategy to overcome gravity override in homogeneous reservoirs is a SAG process with a large slug of surfactant followed by a large slug of gas. An additional advantage of SAG injection is increased gas injectivity. Water is displaced from the near-well region where foam weakens, this raises gas mobility and increases injectivity. However, during liquid injection, the injectivity is considered to be poor. <br/>Liquid injectivity is not fully understood during SAG process. In this study several core-flood experiments were conducted to investigate how injectivity is affected by the injection strategy. Through these experiments, it has been found that the gas injection flow rate has no significant effect during the gas injection period, foam collapses after roughly the same number of pore volumes of gas injected regardless of the injection rate. <br/><br/>During the liquid injection period, liquid was injected at different flow rates following a gas injection period. The results suggested a moderately shear-thinning behaviour. Liquid injection rate was increased 10, 40 and 100 times, but the rise in pressure gradient is not proportional to the increment in injection rate.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the effect of the size slug injected was investigated on the subsequent liquid injection. Results show that during prolonged periods of gas injection after foam, a region near the inlet is formed in which the gas mobility is much greater and the liquid mobility is much greater than downstream during the subsequent liquid injection. The bigger the gas slug size, the better the subsequent liquid injectivity in the nearest region to the inlet.<br/><br/>The effect of foam quality was studied; it has been found that foam quality has no big effect during the subsequent gas and liquid injections. The results of foam injection at 0.60 and 0.95 quality followed by gas injection show that foam collapsed after roughly similar number of pore volumes injected regardless of foam quality. During the liquid injection period the trends of the pressure gradient were similar at foam initial quality injection 0.60 and 0.95.<br/><br/>Finally, in order to verify the capability of the radial model developed by Gong et al. \cite{Gong}, the experimental data was fitted to the linear-flow and radial-flow models. The results suggest that the simulation based on Peaceman equation underestimated the gas and liquid injectivity in SAG process, and furthermore, the conventional simulator cannot represent the effect of gas injection on the subsequent liquid injection.","Foam; SAG; EOR; INJECTIVITY","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Earth Sciences","",""

It can be compromised by the wave drift force that exerts a considerable amount of load due to its non-linear properties. Due to the increase in complexity of the analysis, a numerical method is often opted to conduct the simulation of the wave drift force that acts on a floating system. One of the numerical methods to simulate such a case is ComFLOW which based on the Navier-Stokes equation with a Volume-of-Fluid (VoF) approach for the free surface. The objective of this thesis is to model and analyse the specific cases of the wave drift force which were a vertical wall in a two-dimensional domain and a restrained floating sphere in a three-dimensional domain. <br/><br/>The two-dimensional vertical wall and three-dimensional restrained floating sphere simulations were executed at different frequencies from 1 to 3 rad/s with the increment of 0.125 rad/s. The produced first-order wave force, the amplitude of the wave drift force (not on the latter), and the mean wave drift force were compared. Both cases were compared with another numerical method named NEMOH which based on the far-field wave potential theory; in addition, the two-dimensional case was also compared with analytical calculation based on the direct pressure integration method of the linearised wave potential theory while three-dimensional case was compared with experimental result.<br/><br/>The 2D vertical wall simulation of ComFLOW produced less than 7% deviation for the first-order wave force, more than 50% above 1.5 rad/s frequency for the wave drift force amplitude, and greater than 20% for the mean wave drift force. Deviations in the amplitude of the wave drift force was allegedly due to some systematic errors because there was a clear trend on how it grew bigger as the frequency increased. For the mean wave drift force, the deviations possibly existed because of grid size issue as was shown in the test-run simulations. As for ComFLOW's 3D restrained floating sphere simulation, the produced first-order wave force had deviations less than 10% while the mean wave drift force deviated less than 20%; however, at higher frequencies there were overestimations up to around 30% for both cases. The overestimation was presumably due to the apparent presence of non-linearities which made the normalisation method that was used not sufficient to provide a good interpretation. <br/><br/>Based on the comparison result, it was concluded that ComFLOW was able to model the wave drift force if some issue that currently present could be solved. One of the issues was the available computational resource; it is suggested to have a better computational power so that finer grid size could be used to achieved better results with smaller deviations. A further analysis on the behaviour of the wave drift force amplitude in the two dimensional vertical wall case would also useful as the current systematic error was still unclear.","mooring system; wave drift force; numerical method; vertical wall; restrained floating sphere","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering | Floating Offshore Structure","",""

The following aspects of the joint are investigated:<br/>The resistance of the welded connection.<br/>Defining the force distribution inside the joint. <br/>Improvement of the design method for resistance of the fin plate connection. <br/><br/>Four series of controlled experiments are conducted to test the joints until failure. The series combine a S355 plate with S690/S355 column grade and matching and overmatching weld material. With the data from these experiments and coupon tests, a finite element model is created using DSS Abaqus. Results are validated to accurately follow the force-displacements obtained in the experiments.<br/>Key findings from the experiment:<br/>The resistance of the welds was found to be much greater than predicted using the nominal values from the Eurocode. The utilization of the nominal design resistance compared to the failure load in experiments was 19% following EN1993-1-8:2005 and 25% with EN1993-1-8:2020. The main reason for this was the high penetration depth and increased weld throat when welding a 3mm weld according to standard procedure, accounting for a 100% increase in resistance. The second reason was that the failure stress was 50% higher than nominal for both the matching and overmatching infused weld material.<br/>Insights from the finite element models:<br/>It was proven that for certain boundary conditions it is possible to only account for shear transfer through the weld. However it was found that when expanding the Abaqus model to a full building size the boundary conditions change such that also a moment needs to be transferred through the weld and the bolts. The ratio between the stiffness of the beam and the column face determines the magnitude of these moments. The addition to the stress in the start and end of the weld can result in a 75% lower design resistance when comparing to the same weld with only a shear load. The bolt group transfers the moment through horizontal forces, again depending on this ratio. The magnitude of this horizontal force component in the outer bolts can be equal to the vertical component. <br/>The following calculation methods were proposed:<br/>The moment transfer through the weld from bridging the bolts eccentricity can be reduced according to the stiffness ratio R between the beam and the column face. There are four stiffness factors which influence the force distribution; The column stiffness K_c, the column face stiffness K_cf, the plate bearing stiffness K_p and the beam rotation stiffness K_b. It was found that the governing influence comes from the face stiffness and the beam stiffness. The face stiffness can be calculated by integrating the resistance over the effective length of the column h_p. <br/>If there is no yielding in the beam cross-section then the problem can be simplified and welds should be calculated with taking into account the shear force V_ed and the bending moment M_ed which follows directly from the stiffness ratio R.<br","Steel; simple connections; fin-plate; ABAQUS; Experiment; hollow core sections","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","In the Netherlands most houses and buildings are connected to a gas network since the nineteen seventies to heat our houses and cook. In march of this year the new Dutch government announced that to meet the climate accord of Paris all dutch household should be of the gas net in 2030. To do this multiple alternatives to heat homes are available and one of those which has proven to be feasible over the last years is district heat. In a district heating network hot water is pumped round a city through a network of pipe lines to houses and other buildings. The network is split into a primary and a secondary network. In the primary network the heat is transported from the source, and in the secondary network the heat is pumped from a substation to the customers. The heat usually is rest heat of a STEG- or waste incineration power plant. With the increasing demand for heat due to the disconnection of the gas network, and at the same time the search for a more sustainable heat source for the district heating network like geothermal heat the prices and costs rise rapidly. This makes the heat loss in the system a more important issue also from a financial perspective. The current installed networks are all series 1 single pipe lines of ST/PUR/PE, this means the inner pipe through which the water flows is steal, followed by an insulating PUR layer which is covered by a protective PE layer. To decrease the heat loss from the pipe lines Nuon is looking at two possible options. Series 2 single piping which has a thicker insulating PUR layer and second the twin pipeline where both the steal supply and return lines are<br/>embedded into one insulating PUR layer and a protective PE shell. The heat loss calculations for the buried pipelines in the ground are done using empirical formulas found in literature. These are checked numerical using a pde-solver. Comparing both results it was the concluded the empirical formulas give a good approximation of the heat loss. It also showed the heat loss is for a great deal depended on the temperature in the pipe and the ground temperature. In current heat loss calculations done by Nuon the temperature gradient of the water entering the network and leaving the network in not taken into consideration. By using the ambient temperature and a formula formulated in literature an estimation of the ground temperature at the buried depth of the pipelines can be made. By dividing the network into a number of pieces with length 푑푥 and an individual temperature 푇 the temperature gradient over<br/>the entire network is taken into account. Collected data by Nuon concerning the user demand and the ambient temperature makes it possible to simulate what is the mass flow through the system at any given time and to analyze how the system responds to a demand fluctuation. By analyzing what happens in the networks in term of heat loss during a diurnal heat curve the results show that the heat loss stays nearly constant during a day. There are however big differences between different days in different times of the year. Analyzing what happens over the course of a year especially in the summer during times of very low demand the system under performs. A main reason for this is caused by the<br/>minimum required temperature of 70 degrees Celsius at the customers due to salmonella regulations. This causes a lot of extra mass flow of hot water pumped around the system which heats up the return flow. This is also clearly notable from the efficiency of the network which drops tremendously in the summer. Comparing the difference in heat loss for the series 1, series 2 and twin system the results where as expected an decrease in the amount of heat lost, by 14.6% for series 2 and 39.70% for twin compared to series 1. The overall image of what happens actually stays the same with high return temperature and relative high heat loss and low efficiency in summer. There are a few options to further improve the performance of the system with a few percent by changing the inlet temperature or the location of the bypass valve. Financially speaking the twin system is also the better choice of the three. Compared to series 1 for series 2 the investment costs will increase because the materials<br/>and instalment costs will increase. For the twin system the prices of the materials will increase and the placements of the welds will become more expansive however only half the number of pipe lines and joints is needed, so in total the prices will stay nearly the same compared to series 1. There is a lot of discussion on whether or not the maintenance costs will increase for the twin system, arguments for both cases are given. However the maintenance costs are so small compared to the costs of the heat loss that in every case the twin system is clearly the better choice.","District heating; operating condition; buried pipeline; Twin pipeline","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

Existing works address this problem by ensuring geometric connectivity between adjacent microstructural unit cells. In this report, we argue that geometric connectivity is insufficient to ensure the continuation of physical properties, and propose the concept of mechanical compatibility. Mechanical compatibility directly examines the effective mechanical properties of the individual cell together with its neighbour. Our approach simultaneously optimizes the mechanical properties of individual microstructures as well as those of neighbouring pairs, so that material connectivity and smoothly varying physical properties are ensured.

The fine-scale fully resolved system of equations is obtained based on a conservative finite-volume method in which the displacement and pore pressure unknowns are located in a staggered configuration. The coupling is treated through a fully-coupled fully-implicit formulation. On this fully-coupled finite-volume system, coarse-scale grids for flow and deformation are imposed. Local basis functions for scalar pore pressure and vectorial displacement unknowns are then solved over their respective local domains at the beginning of the simulation, and reused for the rest of the time-dependent simulations. These local basis functions are then clustered to form the prolongation operator. As for the finite-volume nature of the proposed multiscale system, finite-volume restriction operators for poroelastic systems are utilised. Once the coarse-scale system is solved, its solution is prolonged back to the original fine-scale resolution, providing approximate fine-scale solution. The finite-volume multiscale formulation provides conservative stress andmass flux both at fine and coarse scale. Several numerical test cases are provided first to validate the fine-scale finite-volume discrete fully-implicit simulation, and then to investigate the accuracy of the proposed multiscale formulation. Our multiscale method allows for quantification of the elastic geomechanical behaviour with using only a fraction of the fine-scale grid cells, even for highly heterogeneous time-dependent models. As such, it casts a promising approach for field-scale quantification of the mechanical deformation and stress field due to injection and production in a subsurface formation. In order to extend the fine-scale finite volume (FV) framework for fractured media, we implement a discontinuity enriched FV method for mechanical deformation. We model fracture shear failure, based on static friction law. We demonstrate the results, obtained for a single fracture test case and show convergence of shear slip solution. The discontinuity enriched FV method is a basis for promising developments within a coupled flow-deformation framework for fractured reservoirs.","multiscale finite-volume method; poromechanics; geomechanics; porous media; finite volume method; algebraic multiscale solver","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Petroleum Engineering and Geo-sciences","",""

These sensitivities help the engineers to make design decisions and reach the objectives set forth by the team. Currently, the team uses a lap simulation which uses a point mass vehicle dynamics model and thus most of the effects are not covered. This lap simulation allows to map the top-level concept of the car. However, for design of different components a full-car simulation is required that is similar to the actual vehicle.<br/><br/>In this Master’s thesis, a full-car vehicle dynamics model is developed in the Simulink environment. The chassis model is developed using a multibody approach where the different components are modelled as rigid bodies and constrained using multibody joints. The model uses torque and steering inputs and provides outputs similar to the sensors mounted on the actual vehicle. There are two models proposed for the tyre behaviour. Firstly, the tyres are tested for steady state conditions to obtain the parameters of the basic magic formula. A thermal model for the temperature of the tyres is then proposed to obtain the tread, carcass and inflation gas temperatures. The magic formula is then extended to include the effects of temperature on the force producing capability of the tyres to achieve higher accuracy in the simulations.<br/><br/>A very important part of this thesis concerns the model validation. In order to ensure that the vehicle dynamics model behaves like a real car; manoeuvres performed in the dynamic events of formula student competitions were used. The skidpad and a lap of endurance event was chosen to simulate steady-state and transient behaviour of the vehicle. Moreover, the model has been tuned in an attempt to match the actual data when performing the same predefined manoeuvres. The last part of the report includes the conclusions on the model and recommendations for future work.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Vehicle Engineering","Formula Student Team Delft",""

This early stage is defined as the Sales phase. In consultation with a designer, the look and the feel of a yacht is easily captured. The expertise of the designer will lead to a yacht fitting the vision of the client. In the current process, the lines drawn on paper restrict the design freedom of the naval architect. Next, not all consequences of decisions are known, which leads to the probability of alterations in later phases. The current design method is called a point-based method. A single starting point is chosen, which is gradually refined in a couple of iterations. This method has some disadvantages. Design exploration is a method in which many solutions are generated in a design space and no single starting point is chosen. The main focus of this approach is to postpone the design decisions until they can be made with the required knowledge. This will prevent alterations and rework in future phases. In this research, there is investigated whether design exploration could be implemented in the Sales phase at Feadship, using design drivers for the exploration method. The design driver origin from the stakeholders (client, regulatory bodies and Feadship) and are used to structure the design requirements and to evaluate the solutions.<br/>Creating the design space is done with help of a simple Design Model. Due to the limitations of the Sales phase this model is built with help of regression lines, empirical formulas and rules of thumb. The set of solutions are explored with eight design drivers which originated from the stakeholders and Sales process: Aesthetics, Usage, Performance, Rules, Costs, Space, Comfort and Safety. The design drivers are categorised into three parts: input, constraint and output. The input will follow from the client, where the constraints will follow from the other two stakeholders. The final choice for the output is made by the client, which can be underpinned with help of the output design drivers.<br/>This research concludes that design exploration could be an improvement on the current used point-base design method. Since design exploration fully utilises the design freedom available in the early stage design. The solutions produced by the Design Model show reasonable results, which lie within a 10% margin of the existing designs. Due to the limitations of the Sales phase the choice was made to use regression lines. As a result, the design space consists of solutions of which the trend is clearly visible. Nevertheless, the variety within the design space is sufficient enough to create a diversity in solutions. The results produced by the Design Model will be a good starting point in the starting phase. In order to use the results as more than a starting point, the detail level of the calculation methods should be improved. Generating a set of solutions will enable the designer and client to make well-informed decisions.

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","In the field of fatigue testing in laboratory conditions, the common practice is uniaxial testing (i.e. in tension). The real-life loads on structures are usually not limited to one direction but contain multiaxial components. For this kind of testing, the ship and offshore structures department of Delft University of Technology developed a machine that is capable of exciting stresses in a specimen that resembles real life. A preliminary study has been conducted for the feasibility of using the acoustic emission method for monitoring fatigue on this multiaxial testing machine and in specific on a tubular double-side welded T-joint in offshore applications. This method is a tool to help to understand the fatigue progress in the material during testing.<br/>Fatigue is a process by which damage is caused under cyclic loading below the yield stress. This phenomenon initiates on a microscale were dislocations accumulate and grow into a crack. The crack can grow until the structural integrity fails in complete rupture. The fatigue lifetime may be predicted; this is done with the help of uniaxial fatigue models. For multiaxial fatigue these models are not accurate and therefore a multi axial fatigue model should be developed. The crux here is to do these experiments to gain knowledge of the multiaxial fatigue to develop an accurate model for multiaxial fatigue.<br/>The acoustic emission method is a non-destructive evaluation method that can help to determine the condition of a structural component. The acoustic emission signals have features that contain information on what is going on in the material. Feature extraction can also give insight to the fatigue lifetime. In addition, the acoustic emission signals can be used for localization of the damage. The localization calculation is done by comparing different times of arrivals and with this information the source can be localized. If this localization and tracking of the fatigue crack can be achieved on the multiaxial testing machine the new prediction models that are developed at the university can be more rigorously evaluated.<br/>Combining the knowledge of fatigue and acoustic emission method, the following main research question is formulated: “Is it possible to detect a fatigue crack with the acoustic emission method, and how can the crack length and position be estimated in the tubular welded T-joint specimen multiaxial loading?”<br/>Before the main question could be tackled, the background noise of the testing machine is measured for possible interference for future test. The second sub-question is: What features of the acoustic emission signal can be acquired and processed robustly for the tubular specimen? The last sub-question is: What are the essential features of the acoustic emission signals released by fatigue cracks under multiaxial loading? This last question could not be answered because there were no multiaxial experiments during the duration of this project. However, the methodology presented here as shown on a uniaxial case is believed to be directly applicable for multiaxial loading cases as well<br/>Three experiments were performed of which one uniaxial test was used for detailed acoustic emission analysis. The data was analyzed with localization of the fatigue crack in the specimen. The localization of the crack and tracking its position is shown to be possible when the data is of sufficient quality. The difference in the estimate of the crack size by acoustic emission and the measured crack length turned out to be smaller than 10% when the crack reached its maximum length. <br","Fatigue; Monitoring system; Acoustic Emission; Hexapod; Noise","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

(mentor); van der Male, P. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","The wind energy industry is booming. In 2017 the installed wind capacity has overtaken coal as the second largest form of power generation in Europe. Costs of wind farms are driven down, and even the first offshore wind-farm contract without subsidies is a fact. Installing the Wind Turbine Generators (WTGs) more efficiently increases the profit margins in this highly competitive industry. Nowadays, WTGs are installed using jack-up vessels, but there is little known about the installation of large wind turbines using a floating vessel in offshore sea states. Installation using a floating vessel solves the problem of increasing water depths, critical leg-retrieving forces, the need of more powerful jacking systems, and the time-consuming jacking process. By installing the WTGs in a single lift, the mating operations can be avoided, resulting in shorter offshore installation times.<br/><br/>Though due to the high crane tip, already small vessel motions result in significant WTG motions. The turbine manufacturers only allow minimum accelerations and impact velocities, since the components are sensitive and damaged easily. The objective of this thesis is to identify the dynamical response and coupling of vessel-turbine, to decrease the motions of the WTG and to translate this into a lift and landing system. The focus is on studying influencing parameters, rather than to assess the workability of the proposed concept. The Bokalift 1 is used as a case study, to explore the possibilities of installing WTGs with assets of Boskalis.<br/><br/>An OrcaFlex model is built to simulate the dynamic behavior of the turbine and vessel under regular and irregular wave loads. Both the free-lift and landing phase are studied, with the use of modal analyses and time-domain simulations in OrcaFlex. The hydrodynamic properties of the vessel are calculated in AQWA. A dynamic model is also derived analytically, using the Lagrangian formalism, to validate the modal analysis of OrcaFlex and to study the coupling between the turbine and the vessel. <br/><br/>Resonance is found by the excitation of two lifting configuration modes in the longitudinal plane, namely the pendulum and double pendulum mode. For the transverse plane significant coupling was found between the turbine and the vessel, resulting in a modal shape which is a combination of the pendulum mode and the roll mode of the vessel. A second peak of resonance is caused by the excitation of the double pendulum mode for the transverse plane. <br/><br/>The motion of the WTG, as a consequence of the resonance of the double pendulum mode, is related to the natural period of this mode relative to the RAO of the vessel. Time-domain simulations in OrcaFlex showed that significant motion reduction of the WTG is possible, by lowering this natural period below the wave period excitation range of the vessel. A modal analysis of the analytical model described that the natural period is also a function of the rotational stiffness of the lifting configuration, resulting in an avoidance of resonance when adding enough rotational stiffness. Resonance of the roll mode cannot be avoided without changing the hydrodynamic properties of the vessel. Motion reduction by the usage of tugger line damping is also studied. Tuggers placed under an angle towards the vessel also proved to avoid resonance of the double pendulum mode. An improved setup could increase its potential to damp out the resonance caused by the roll mode as well. <br/><br/>The proposed landing system is modelled in OrcaFlex to assess the performance under irregular wave loads. Time-domain simulations proved to reduce the vertical velocity of the WTG up to 97% and below 0.01m/s. However, the current guiding system still allows for rotations of the WTG. These rotational motions could be significant due to the double pendulum mode and could lead to local vertical impacts of the bottom edge of the tower on the foundation. <br/>Based on the obtained results, it can be concluded that both the horizontal and vertical motions of the WTG can be reduced significantly during the free-lift and landing operation from a floating vessel.","floating; wind; turbine; vessel; tugger; landing; winch","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-08-27","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering | Bottom Founded Structures, Arctic and Wind","",""

Studies on blockchain point out that the technology has enormous potentials in the financial and real estate sector, but obviously has to overcome obstacles both business-, technological-, and adoption-wise.

A qualitative explorative case study research combined with the application of Transaction Cost Economics is used to construct a decision path that can be followed to assess the applicability of blockchain technology and subsequently determine its impact on the sources of transaction costs. Following this decision path, we found that as of now, blockchain appears not to be the most suitable technology to function as a real-time, up to date database during commercial real estate transactions.

Frugal innovation aims to provide financially poor consumers with economically effective solutions in order to deal with their problems. The idea of bringing business to the low-income groups with the intention of providing social benefits and at the same time, making profits was proposed by Prahalad. Identifying the factors responsible for the adoption of frugal innovation and understanding a consumer’s behavior is necessary for doing business in the Bottom of Pyramid (BoP) markets. The available literature on frugal innovation is majorly focused on conceptual discussions and case studies. On the other hand, there is limited empirical data and quantitative work conducted in interpreting a consumer’s behavior at BoP. Thus, the research objective is, understanding the consumer behavior for the adoption of frugal innovation and therefore this paper will address the question of “what are the factors responsible for adoption of frugal innovation in water sector at BoP?” Three countries of East Africa were chosen to study and understand the factors that had an impact on the successful adoption of a frugal innovation. In addition to having a scarcity of safe drinking water, a considerable number of the population is at the BoP in Africa. This fact serves as a suitable market for the introduction of a frugal innovation among the masses.<br/><br/>The water sector, is an area often seen by companies as a potential area for entering BoP markets with the aim of selling safe and affordable drinking water. In developed countries, clean drinking water is mostly provided by the public sector. However, this may not always be the case in developing countries where people may lack access to safe drinking water due to infrastructural deficiencies. Looking at two cases of companies providing drinking water in East Africa (Kenya, Uganda, and Rwanda), it is one of the areas where they have filled a gap left by infrastructure deficiencies by providing a frugal innovation in the form of low cost reusable bottled drinking water. In the first case, the water is purified at the central facility and the distribution occurs through the local shops in the region and the second case employs a franchise model where water is purified at the franchise location and the distributional costs are reduced by the presence of the large number of franchise and micro-franchise. Most frugal innovation focuses predominantly on the cost cutting aspect of the innovative product but in this case the two water companies fit more with the Bhatti (2012)’s definition of the frugality in all the aspects of the production and the distribution process. To understand the consumer behavior, a theoretical model is developed in this research which consists of Demographics factors (Age, Gender, Household Income, Household size), Organoleptic factors (Color and taste, Psychological factors (Beliefs and perception), Marketing factors (Brand awareness and Convenience), Experience of a free trial and role of household financial decision making, that affects the adoption of bottled drinking water. These factors give an insight about the consumer decision making process which is often considered as a black box and helps to understand the consumer behavior in a better way. <br/><br/>Factors mentioned in the theoretical model are empirically tested for the adoption of bottled drinking water in the three east African countries Kenya, Rwanda and Uganda. The method used for data analysis is Binary Output Logistic Regression using IBM SPSS Statistics software. Additionally, Spearman correlation is used to understand the correlation in-between various factors. Results from the binary output regression indicates, that the experience of receiving free sample of bottled drinking water had a significant impact on the adoption of bottled drinking water in Kenya and Rwanda. In other words, the experience gained from a free sample of bottled drinking water had a positive impact on the consumer’s bottled water consumption characteristics in Kenya and Rwanda, whereas this was not the same case in Uganda. In Uganda demographic factors like household income, house size and brand awareness had a significant impact on the adoption of bottled drinking water.<br","adoption of innovation; Bottom of Pyramid; Frugal innovation; Consumer behaviour; consumer adoption","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

Due to the prospect of large scale energy generation, wind energy has moved offshore. Offshore wind farms are relatively more complex to design and costlier to install. Since, substructure design of an offshore wind turbine (OWT) plays an important role and is one of the key drivers for capital cost, optimization of support structure design becomes imperative.<br/>Driven by the universal goal of cost saving in offshore wind industry, the main objective is set to – “reducing computational time required for a typical fatigue design cycle of OWT support structure”. From the perspective of a foundation designer, following practical challenges are identified and investigated:<br/>• Lumping methodology for correlated wind and wave scatter diagrams<br/>• Reduction in number of fatigue design load cases in time domain simulations<br/>• An alternative fatigue design method in frequency domain<br/>This thesis focuses on the fatigue design of jacket type support structure. First, a conceptual 3-legged jacket with a light weight pyramid shaped transition piece is modeled in finite element software. Subsequently, an overview of loads, dynamic properties and fatigue analysis of support structure is presented. <br/>In OWT support structure design, wind and wave loads are equally significant. For fatigue design, the combinations of loads which are likely to occur simultaneously during the design life of the structure are estimated. The correlation established between wind and wave is generally presented in the form of scatter diagrams. To reduce the computational time, common practice is to condense wind and wave scatter diagram and assess fatigue damage for the lumped states. Thus, in this thesis, an investigation is completed on commonly used lumping methodologies and comparison is established on the accuracy of fatigue results. In this study, existing lumping methods are validated for a jacket support structure and it is proven that dynamic characteristic of the structure plays an important role in condensing scatter diagrams.<br/>Traditionally, the complete fatigue load case design of OWT support structure is based on time domain simulations, which is very time consuming. Hence, an important query raised by the Company (KCI) was, whether it is possible to reduce the number of design load cases while retaining a high level of precision in fatigue damage results. A novel method is presented in this thesis, which attempts to reduce the number of design load cases. For jacket support structure, linear-quasi-static assumptions are made to estimate approximate fatigue damages due to wind load alone. Using the estimated damage, critical wind seeds are identified and are sorted for reduction. Results from this case study show that with the reduction of load cases, the accuracy in fatigue damage is also compromised. This experimental method provides good insight into the load case reduction capabilities and is recommended for preliminary design phase.<br/>Since, time domain fatigue design requires very large time records to accurately describe the random loading processes, it proves prohibitive for many finite element analyses. Thus, an alternate fatigue design approach in frequency domain is introduced in this thesis. Contrary to popular use of power spectral density functions, a different method is presented which successfully preserves the phase information of load time series. Frequency domain method offers many advantages like providing clear information regarding the environmental conditions and the dynamic properties of the structure. First, essentials of frequency domain method for a single degree of freedom system is described. Subsequently, this approach is exemplified on OWT support structure with interface wind loads. Based on the assessment of response from time domain and frequency domain analysis, it is proved that frequency domain method is an effective tool which can lead to vast savings in computational times while still producing accurate fatigue results.<br/>To summarize, this report gives an overview of the work done to reduce the computational time and effort required for a typical fatigue design cycle of an OWT support structure.

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","Smart Grid scheduling problems are characterized by quickly changing situations and multiple external factors that cannot be controlled. Most smart grid research applies stochastic models over the total power consumption of a household or system to find a schedule that achieves an optimization, a balancing, or constraint satisfaction. While these solutions are able to efficiently capture the unpredictability in the problem, they only make use of a limited amount of information. These models are not yet able to make flawless decisions, so we try to optimize this by using a model that is able to use more information. A different scheduling model that is able to do so is the Temporal Constraint Satisfaction Problem (TCSP). However, the information that this model needs requires substantial effort to obtain in smart grid environments, especially for academic purposes. For this reason, research into the benefits of doing so is scarce.<br/><br/>In this paper we attempt to use this model with detailed environmental information, specifically the activation of electric devices in households, to better optimize a motivating smart grid scheduling problem. We find that problems with characteristics typical in smart grids are difficult to express as TCSP. We discuss these characteristics and provide the concept of non-binary conditions and conditional preference to solve these difficulties and provide more expressive conditional reasoning about optimality in TCSP.","Simple Temporal Network; Scheduling; Smart Grid; Temporal Constraint Satisfaction Problem","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science and Engineering","CSE3000 Research Project",""

These initial guesses are subsequently used to initialize a 12th-order Gauss-Lobatto collocation method. The minimum altitude with respect to the Earth and the Moon are constrained, as well as the maximum rotation rate of the solar sail. Sets of feasible trajectories for both spacecraft with identical launch conditions are sought, such that the constellation can be initiated using a single Soyuz launch. Such a Soyuz launch can deliver two 1160-kg spacecraft into the found transfer trajectories.

Of the total consumption of natural gas, 51% is used for heat provision to households. Both social problems with earthquakes related to natural gas exploitation and environmental problems with greenhouse gas emissions, challenge the country to find alternatives. One of these alternatives is using district heating in combination with renewable heat generation. Where district heating is already present, public resistance highlights price and inflexibility as unjust – as perceived by the monopolistic infrastructure (Janssen, 2015; Mulder, Paping, &amp; Huis in 't Veld, 2014). While customers perceive injustice on one hand, on the other hand district heating is being considered as one of the alternatives for natural gas provision during the so called ‘heat transition’. Hence, the problem of injustice would affect more and more residents. <p>Different types of ownership of district heating networks (e.g. private, public, cooperative) may offer opportunities to overcome or manage some of these downsides and improve the perceived energy justice. Considering this, the following question was researched: what ownership structures for new district heating systems would Utrecht residents prefer? Perceived energy justice is taken as a core concept supporting the preferences of Utrecht residents. </p><p>The identified ownership types (public, private and cooperative) are comparatively reviewed by expert interviews on their strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats influencing their success in the heat transition. It was found that (1) there are external factors influencing all ownership types equally (like tax increase), (2) the institutional context often influences ownership structures contrastingly (e.g. market tradition). Also it was found that arguments in favour of private ownership often included business-oriented reasons. Arguments in favour of cooperative ownership often included influence-oriented reasons. Argument in favour of public ownership often included social-oriented reasons. Mixed ownership arguments often argue that – possibly – win-win situations occur, but at the cost of increasing transactions costs. </p><p>The design space and its insights on ownership types, are used to perform an online survey to explore energy justice within residents (N=198). Respondents having higher education level than the average Utrecht population and a lower percentage of respondents living in social housing (-32%) limit the sample’s representativeness. Also, generalisability for places and neighbourhoods where less apartments are present, is limited (52% of respondents lived in apartments). We found indication (Figure 1 Ownership preferencesFigure 1) that most respondents appreciate the role of public organisations (e.g. public electricity grid operators and municipalities). Findings also suggest that network activities are the most suited for public ownership. Energy companies were most selected (61%) for the ownership of the generation activities. While community-owned heat cooperatives offer opportunities to enhance justice, this model was selected fewer times (45%-50%). </p><p>Linking the energy justice preferences with the direct preferences on ownership it is concluded that three ownership structures are preferred (‘three streams’): integrated public ownership, competition on public network and integrated cooperative ownership. Within the context of the heat transition, we expect increasing the public influence – aiming for equal responsibility, socialised cost and benefits – would best address perceived injustice in new district heating monopolies. We also expect that in well-defined spatial communities, integrated heat cooperatives could offer perceived justice of the district heating natural monopoly. Thus far, aiming for competition was found to be limited due to the high costs. Despite being preferred, it seems to be less feasible (R. Haffner et al., 2016).","Ownership; District Heating; Utrecht; Energy Justice","en","master thesis","","","","","","The Master's programme Industrial Ecology is jointly organised by Leiden University and Delft University of Technology.","","","","","","Industrial Ecology","",""

Also for military applications, it is useful to detect anomalous behavior to provide an alert for potential threats, especially with the more recent widespread use of drones for warfare and terrorist activities. In order to provide a solution for these emerging needs, in this work, a novel method for target dynamic behavior classification by analyzing trajectories using data gathered from multiple heterogeneous sensors is presented. The aim is to develop a context-free (i.e., sensor indifferent) method to robustly classify a selected set of anomalous trajectories and present those results to a human operator in remote sensing applications. In order to track maneuvering targets, it is typically required to use multiple (dynamic) model approach to make dynamic state inferences accurately. In practice, system parameters are typically tuned manually. The approach taken here is to estimate the parameters of a set of these so-called hybrid systems, also known as jump-Markov systems (JMS). This task will be carried out using a maximum likelihood (ML) approach, via the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. To handle highly nonlinear measurement models, such as those typically present in remote sensing applications, sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) or particle filters will be used to make accurate state estimations. These methods are also capable of dealing with non-Gaussian measurement or process noise. The central question explored in this work is if jump-Markov systems are a suitable class of models for trajectory classification by learning their parameters from multi-sensor measurement data.","expectation maximization; trajectory analysis; classification; tracking; parameter estimation; maximum likelihood; time series; state-space models; hybrid systems; jump-Markov systems; nonlinear systems; multiple model; particle filters; sequential Monte Carlo; importance sampling; smoothing; joint tracking and classification; Bayesian inference; hidden Markov model; unsupervised learning; data fusion; sensor fusion; information fusion; recognition; system identification","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering","",""

Roos Oosting and the Global Health Design Lab initiated development of affordable and high-quality electrical surgery units (ESU) as a step towards improving surgical care. The ESU is used as an operating tool to assist the surgeon for a high variety of essential surgical procedures. The ESU consists of a high frequency generator with an interface to adjust power settings, a return electrode and an a monopolar handheld that is used to perform the surgery. The main advantages of electrosurgery for low and middle income countries (LMICs) settings is that it is widely applicable, helps to stop and prevent bleeding, allows for precise cutting, facilitates better wound healing in less hygienic environments and has a valuable contribution to time efficient execution of surgical procedures.<br/><br/>A few low-end devices exist that—due to their stripped down, fully analogue and simple design— do not fully meet the demands that are needed for safe global usage of the ESU. As a result, the devices are used inappropriately and this can have serious clinical consequences for the patient, even more in low-resource settings like sub-Saharan Africa (Oosting, 2018).<br/><br/><i>The design goal of the project has been the development of a reliable, safe and intuitive user-interaction with the ESU system and a tailored design for maintenance in a variety of use-contexts in LMICs. The new design of the electrosurgery unit should be understandable for all electrosurgery users, thus surgeons with limited electrosurgery experience as well as specialists and surgical assistances. </i><br/><br/>The developed ESU system is designed to capture the primary needs and functionalities to perform surgery according to the 15 essential surgeries stated by the World Health Organization (WHO). These functionalities have been integrated in a safe and intuitive user interaction with both the high frequency generator as well as the monopolar handheld. <br/><br/>For situations where existing equipment and devices cannot fulfil the unique needs of LMICs, the process of designing tailored solutions should involve extensive consultation with end-users, as this is critical to promoting correct device use and protecting patient safety (Ng-Kamstra, 2016). Consequently, substantial qualitive research has been done by interviewing 15 Dutch surgeons that work or have worked in developing countries. This created an holistic framework on the user-interactions and barriers with the electrosurgical unit prior, during and after a surgical procedure and legit assumptions on required functionalities in use and sustainable maintenance prior to designing. <br/><br/>The developed concepts have been extensively tested with the intended target group by means of an explorative study in Kenya. Even though the developed ESU system requires future improvements to create a sustainable success, the designed system empowers the future accessibility of electrosurgery for LMICs. The ESU system increases safety and an intuitive user interaction concerning the limited electrosurgery experience and enhances reliability for maintenance in the variety of use contexts in LMICs. The developed trade-off has shown the great potential this designed ESU system can have on global surgery. Hopefully, this ESU system can in all sincerity make global electrosurgery accessible for everyone and everywhere.<br","Global health; electrosurgery; surgical development; co-creation; global usage; emerging market; design for healthcare","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2020-08-23","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

Due to the non-linearity of the problem, this function has several local minima. To avoid them, it is necessary to start the optimization procedure from a good initial model. Within a probabilistic framework, Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods are used to sample a probability density function that represents the possible solutions. In high-dimensional problems, traditional MCMC methods become inefficient as random transitions are unlikely to find the regions of high probability. Hamiltonian Monte Carlo appears as a method that can efficiently find these regions without spending computation time on regions of no interest. To evaluate the probability of a sample, the least-squares error is calculated. Synthetic data is obtained through an existing 2D frequency domain full-wave<br/>modelling code and compared to the observed data. Through the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampler, the high probability regions are sampled and used to build the probability density function that represents the possible solutions. The algorithm was tested with both synthetic and real data. For the synthetic case a 1D model was inverted. The normalized least-squares error was reduced by 98%. In the deepest section the true model lies outside the uncertainty range of the estimated model. This appears as the result of sampling narrow regions<br/>of the probability density function. Then, the variance of the samples is underestimated and therefore the error. For the real dataset, a 2D model was inverted. This model lacks some of the large-scale features compared to deterministic full-waveform inversion results. However, a good model was found without any a priori information and almost any manual intervention. This suggest that, at least for the studied example, the algorithm can provide a<br/>good starting model for deterministic full-waveform inversion. The results obtained through this approach are almost identical to those obtained with more labour intensive adjustments.","Hamiltonian Monte Carlo; MCMC; Full-waveform inversion; Seismics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Geophysics | IDEA League","",""

The inversion method uses Marchenko theory. This is a recent development which enables the retrieval of Green's functions at any place in the subsurface. A non-recursive Marchenko inversion method has already been introduced but in this thesis a recursive Marchenko inversion method is implemented and analysed. A recursive scheme lies at the center of this new method. In this thesis, the new method is implemented and tested on a 1D subsurface model. The recursive scheme is first validated. This is done by computing a reflection response with it and comparing it with a reflection response resulting from forward modeling. After this, the accuracy of retrieved local reflection coefficients from the recursive inversion method is determined. This is done by comparison with exact reflection coefficients of the subsurface model. After this, several different parameters of the used subsurface model, data computation and the recursive inversion method itself are investigated for their influence on the accuracy of the inversion method. In particular interest is the effect of interval time errors because these result in errors that can build up rapidly through the recursion. However, the method has a big advantage. It is shown that the recursive Marchenko inversion method has a way to retrieve the magnitude of made interval time errors and correct for these when interval times are overestimated. In this way the error build up is stopped.

And about a new technology to detect the parasitic infections. More specifically, to detect the urinary Schistosoma type, called S. haematobium.<br/><br/>Within Africa, a large number of countries are affected by this parasite. The transmission happens via water and is almost impossible to stagnate. It influences children and adults by reducing their ability to grow, learn or work on full capacity. Both the economy and living conditions of entire communities suffer from this worm, which lays its eggs in the human bladder. Ghana is an example of an endemic country in which the entire population is at risk of infection. By the support of the government, they have established a nationwide control programme, with annual Mass Drug Administration (MDA) in all the high risk areas to control the morbidity. Ghana was therefore selected as main scope within this project.<br/><br/>The new technology detects the parasitic infection by counting the number of eggs in urine samples. This new technology is faster, easier and more reliable than current methods and able to add value for different types of users. A literature study and three weeks of user research in Ghana revealed the diagnostic needs of five user groups: researchers, control programmes, urban hospitals and rural health facilities in low and high endemic areas.<br/><br/>The greatest value can be added when designing for researchers and rural health facilities. So, a product is designed to fit the main requirements of both user groups. This resulted in one product for both, but with an additional application on a tablet for the researchers: The EC (Egg Counter). The product is easy to use and maintain for remote facilities. Those areas are confronted with a lack of resources and specialist. The EC enables lower educated people to execute diagnoses and takes away the need for specific medical equipment. For researchers, the additional application will facilitate digitalised data collection. The product is robust and portable as the researchers will take it with them on field trips, for large-scale community screening. The product will be much faster than the current procedures, saving a lot of time in the field and thereby money.<br/><br/>The EC is designed for Ghana, with a side focus on Nigeria. With some small adjustments and a slightly different implementation plan, the same product can serve these different countries. But more development and research is required until it is suitable for implementation in the other endemic countries.<br","Schistosomiasis; Ghana; Diagnoses; Research; Health facilities","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

Simultaneously, cities may attempt to ignite synergies by working together with other cities in the region. Two core concepts of the place branding domain, image and identity, are central to this situation. Cities position themselves according to a brand identity, the desired image in the mind of people. The actual image is what drives people towards places. Many studies have tried to measure the image accordingly, while neglecting the regional context of cities and a comparison with brand identity. The main research question is: What is the theoretical and empirical relation between the image and identity of cities in a polycentric context? A design approach is used to create a tool that is able to measure and analyse image networks for polycentric regions. A method from the field of marketing, the brand concept map, is adjusted to serve the nature of this research. Subsequently, a case study of the Metropolitan region Rotterdam The Hague illustrates the use of the Polycentric brand concept map (P-BCM). The P-BCM is developed in line with the traditional stages of concept mapping (elicitation, mapping and aggregation) and an additional fourth stage (analysis).

The Lower Carboniferous limestone is proposed as the main target due to its depth and wide occurrence. To investigate the potential of this formation, the physical rock properties are studied in a variety of laboratory experiments. This study consists of two parts: (1) the geomechanical and hydraulic characterization of the intact rock and (2) the permeability evolution of a fracture altered rock. <br/>Analogous rock samples from a quarry were used to determine tensile, compressive and shear strength and the elastic moduli. Further rock properties such as porosity, microstructure and mineralogy were measured by a gas pycnometer, mercury intrusion porosimetry and electron microscope analyser. The permeability was determined by flow-through experiments at different effective pressures. Subsequently, shear fractures were generated by triaxial deformation and a punch-through shear test to investigate the effect on the permeability.<br/>A high degree of heterogeneity between the samples and a clear transverse anisotropy was observed. The maximum intact rock permeability is 150 μD at low effective pressures (2 MPa) and at reservoir conditions the permeability is below 1 μD. This results in an insufficient matrix conductivity and enhancement of the reservoir is needed to improve the reservoir connectivity. Both shear experiments show an increase in permeability of one to four orders of magnitude. The fractures show to be sustainable in terms of time and pressure variations. In combination with its physical rock properties, it can be concluded that the application of hydraulic stimulation within the Lower Carboniferous limestone is a reliable technique to improve the reservoir permeability.<br","Geothermal Energy; Lower Carboniferous; Ultra-deep Geothermal; fracture permeability; fracking; Kolenkalk; hydraulic stimulation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-12-01","","","","","SURE",""

To support this intention, DPDK wanted to first focus on evaluating and developing the DTS design framework and toolkit as they are the essentials to provide this service.<br/><br/>In its first DTS design project, DPDK had used a hybrid approach derived from conventional Design Thinking models. The main uncertainty was whether the approach was sufficiently comprehensive in meeting client’s transformative needs, competitive in the market and well integrated into its workflow. As such, literature review, industry analysis and internal analysis were employed as a starting point to discuss about the potential developments that the current approach needed.<br/><br/>From these analysis, there were many potential directions that DPDK can take take to augment its DTS design approach. Together with DPDK strategists, these potential developments were evaluated, synthesized and prioritized. Additional concerns that surfaced during this discussion were also evaluated through four short experiments to get better clarity about those teething concerns. <br/><br/>Following that, a DTS service vision and development roadmap was finally created to address the strategic steps the agency can take to develop the framework and toolkit. There were three successive phases that were planned. The first phase focus on process optimization while the second phase emphasizes on process engagement and the final phase aims for process differentiation.<br/><br/>By referencing the objectives for the immediate phase, a framework was adapted from the current approach to embody three key considerations for explorative scouting, knowledge transformation and strategy bridging. In total, six new steps was added to the original framework and six new tools were also created to facilitate these steps.<br/><br/>In addition, visuals of the DTS service portal for future phases were also prototyped to provide a vision of potential subsequent developments.<br/><br/>Thereafter, a short evaluation workshop was carried out to test out the new framework and tools in practice and gather initial feedback.

Links between quantum nodes in major cities in The Netherlands are scheduled to be demonstrated by 2020. There are many things that need to be considered in the development of a quantum network, in this thesis a few of these will be examined. The first topic is entanglement generation using the EPL (Extreme Photon Loss) protocol in the presence of dephasing noise, which is an existing protocol. Novel contributions include the maximum achievable fidelities and entanglement generation rates, which are obtained using theoretical analysis and numerical simulations. Also for elementary states generated by the EPL protocol it is shown that doing distillation first and then an entanglement swap results in a roughly two times higher rate than the other way around. <br/><br/>A new protocol called entanglement tracking is proposed to keep track of the classical information about entanglement in a quantum network. The entanglement tracker is a protocol that runs locally on every node in a quantum network and can communicate with the entanglement trackers of other nodes. The goal of the entanglement tracker is to keep a database with entanglement identifiers that is continuously updated after entanglement is modified. Performance metrics of an entanglement tracking protocol and a command interface with higher layer protocols are defined. We propose a format for entanglement identifiers and show how to update entanglement identifiers after an arbitrary number of entanglement swaps. The entanglement tracker is implemented in the discrete event simulator QNetSquid, which is under development by QuTech. It is applied by simulating a repeater chain using the entanglement tracking protocol, resulting in a completion time as a function of the number of repeaters. Future applications of the entanglement tracker are to assist routing of entanglement in a (large) quantum network, in which the tracker can take care of the classical communication.","Quantum networks; Entanglement generation; Entanglement distillation; EPL; QNetSquid","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Physics","",""

Confronting the control problem of superconducting quantum processors, an experimental microarchitecture (QuMA) has been proposed in previous work. As the size of the target quantum chip continues to evolve, the complexity of QuMA scales up accordingly. This increase in complexity has led to a growing challenge in QuMA’s design, development, and verification. To solve these problems, we build a QuMA simulator which can automate the current QuMA verification process and accelerate the design phase of QuMA. We called this simulator QuMAsim. The first version of QuMAsim is based on CC-Light, an instance of QuMA for controlling a surface-7 superconducting qubit chip. Then this simulator is extended to be self-configurable for different quantum chips. Several applications are built based on this simulator. The verification platform consists of the simulator, the VHDL implementation of QuMA and a validator is designed to automate the verification procedure. In addition, we built a quantum virtual machine based on QuMAsim, which includes other quantum software and simulators to simulate the execution of quantum algorithms on each layer of the quantum computer. We demonstrate the potential of QuMAsim by performing some experiments with it and its applications, including the gearbox circuit simulation.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Microelectronics","",""

From a science communication perspective, these experiences are a fascinating laboratory about the challenges of knowledge sharing and exchange between stakeholders with very different perspectives. Little is known about those who facilitate the blending of the experiential knowledge of patients and the scientific knowledge of researchers within these initiatives. <br/><br/>This thesis explores the professional profile of practitioners within patient organizations that are responsible for patient participation in research projects. Their position is analyzed from the perspective of the theory of knowledge brokering, which puts them at the center of the flow of science communication between the stakeholders. While existing literature has studied the emerging role of knowledge brokers in the transfer of scientific knowledge to decision-makers in healthcare, this thesis offers an original perspective on the context of patient participation, and compares the activities, professional knowledge, skills and personal attributes of the practitioners with that of knowledge brokers in healthcare. The needs that the practitioners express in terms of improvement of both their own profession as well as the process of patient participation have been analyzed using the concept of professionalization, which puts the focus on the development of new professional profiles. <br/><br/>A predominantly qualitative approach was chosen to gather reflections of nine practitioners on their current and desired professional profiles. They were selected after identifying Dutch patient organizations involved in participatory research projects. The methodology included semi-structured interviews and a card-sorting exercise inspired by Q methodology in which they were invited to rank skills and personal attributes related to knowledge brokering. The practitioners emerge as “enthusiastic connectors,” who put an emphasis on knowledge brokering activities and skills that foster the interaction between stakeholders, rather than on knowledge management. Many of the aspects they report as being part of their professional profile are consistent with those reported about knowledge brokers in the healthcare sector. However, the particular context of patient participation shapes their specific characteristics mainly related to their closest stakeholder, the patient. The practitioners confirm that academia, policy makers and funding organizations are increasingly interested in patient participation, and call for organizational changes in order to face this demand: increased recognition as a partner by external stakeholders, further internal recognition within their organization, as well as adequate human and financial resources.<br/><br/>The thesis serves to gain both academic insight, useful for developing measures of effectivity of knowledge brokering and further study, as well as practical insight, useful for recruitment of knowledge brokers and further professionalization of knowledge brokering and patient participation processes.<br","Patient participation; Knowledge brokering; Professionalization; Science Communication; Patient organization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Sciences | Science Communication","",""

All these measurements would ideally be used to evaluate the effects of salinization mitigation measures and to predict water quality over time. This gives rise to this thesis for an inquiry into a fast and simple surface water flow model which eventually could even be run on a mobile phone. The water model is a first necessary step for developing a water quality model with salt concentrations. The main focus of this thesis is on developing finite volume methods for the kinematic wave equation. It is a simplification of the full shallow water equations which are the governing equations for surface water flow. Finite volume methods for the diffusion wave equation and the full shallow water equations are also developed to serve as a comparison to the kinematic wave. It is shown that the kinematic wave and the diffusion wave have comparable features. Even though the kinematic wave is not the closest representation of reality, high computational gains could be made by using the kinematic wave equation instead of the full shallow water equations. For a simple straight ditch, the kinematic wave has shown to be 16 times faster than the full shallow water equations. For a network, however, it is not as straightforward. When comparing a kinematic wave network with a network in SOBEK, a software program that uses the full shallow water equations, the latter still has lower computational times.","Finite Volume Methods; Surface water modeling; Kinematic wave equation; Networks; SOBEK","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In doing so it can be determined which discussion fields play an important part in embracing a BwN design based on its added benefits while considering its technical uncertainties.

Furthermore, this research limits itself to the project phase where flood defence options are still considered.<br/><br/>This research found that although BwN flood defence project face technical uncertainties and discussions on efficacy, there is willingness to embrace a BwN solution when involved parties can agree on shared responsibilities. The curators of a flood defence project were found to be least willing to accept a technically uncertain design as they are accountable should it fail. The curators’ concern regarding their responsibilities can be mitigated and they can be more open to alternative solution if they are ensured of proper research and shared accountability when other values are destroyed in favour of flood protection. It was also found that the effect on stakeholders in financing and taking share of the responsibilities also have a positive effect on embracement of a BwN solution when the discussions on efficacy have not yet been settled.","Building with Nature; Value conflicts; Flood Defence; Technical uncertainty","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This reachability model can be deployed rapidly and offers aid workers a situational overview in the first moments of the response, giving them relevant information to base their day-to-day decision on.

To research more deeply, we divided the task into two parts. The first task was predicting the PM2.5 concentration of next 24 hours and another one was building early warning system of extreme air pollution of next 12 hours. <br/>To solve the first task, we started from the 1-hour prediction problem, that was predicting PM2.5 of next hour based on the last hours’ data. We did parameter optimization to derive the best network architecture and we got a RMSE of 19.7863. We then successfully built 24-hour prediction model that was predicting PM2.5 concentration of next 24 hours according to the optimal 1-hour prediction model. The proposed 24-hour prediction model exhibited satisfactory performance, including the 13-24 h prediction task which is predicting the mean PM2.5 concentration among next 13-24 hours (RMSE=49.41).<br/>Although we got a satisfying RMSE for the PM2.5 prediction problem, we didn’t get accurate prediction for extreme conditions and that’s why we continued to focus on the second task. We regarded the highest PM2.5 value among 12 hours as the extreme air pollution of this period and we divided the warning level into 4 parts. Then we built the early warning system based on the LSTM to predict the warning level of highest PM2.5 value of next 12 hours. As indicated by the ACC and AUC, our LSTM model achieved sound performance (ACC=86.7%, AUC=0.837). <br/>To improve the prediction performance, we focused on several model optimization techniques for the 1-hour prediction model and each technique has effectively improved the accuracy. Moreover, we combined these optimization methods together, which leaded to the lowest RMSE of 14.1937. The combined optimization method performed better than any single optimization method, which suggested that we can use some effective optimization methods together to improve the prediction accuracy of LSTM model. In addition, we also compared our model with the random forest (RF) model and the comparison result proved that LSTM network worked better for both tasks.<br","LSTM; extreme air pollutation; PM2.5 prediction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-01-01","","","","Applied Mathematics","",""

Most of the dike has been reported to be too low in some places and plans of restoration will be implemented in 2019. A RFEM (Random Finite Elemental Method) analysis is to be done in collaboration with TU Delft and HHNK on these dikes to identify slope failure probabilities, where the input data is to be addressed in this report. Starnmeer contains thick layers of peat and clay until a depth of approximately -5 meters NAP, where a large sand aquifer begins to much larger depths. For geotechnical analysis, the first few meters are of primary concern, so only the thick peat and clay layers will be assessed. Rising water levels proves problematic for the polder, but fortunately drainage opportunities to adjacent water bodies is possible. The addition or reduction of water heavily influences soil behavior by affecting underlying pore water pressures and stress states. Parameters to be analyzed include wet bulk density, dry bulk density, water content, cohesion, and the friction angle. A statistical analysis and distribution of each parameter provide meaningful insight on probabilities and disseminations of measurement data. The clay layer was found to have a significant amount of sand and silt, affecting the porosity, sorting, cohesion, and bulk densities resulting in an uncompacted porous clay layer. The peat layer is also highly saturated, highly organic, and rather loose. The layers are hence prone to heaving and rapid primary consolidation. By classifying each of the five parameters for both regions to be normally distributed or lognormally distributed, the data can be then standardized and correlated to each other to determine linear dependencies. The relations heavily vary depending on the environmental setting and other physical aspects. For instance, the wet and dry bulk densities are found to have a strong positive correlation with each other in Starnmeer but not in Alkmaardermeer. The layers were found to be heavily saturated, which negatively influences the correlation between water content and bulk densities. Cohesion and friction angle are primarily dependent on the consistency, shape, and packing of the soil grains, so low to no correlation was established.","","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Earth Sciences","",""

In this thesis, we address these issues and propose two theoretical frameworks to handle such multidomain dataset.<br/><br/>To begin with, we extend the recently developed geometric deep learning framework to multidomain graph signals, e.g., time-varying signals, defining a new type of convolutional layer that will allow us to deal with graph signals defined on top of several domains, e.g., electroencephalograms or traffic networks. After discussing its properties and motivating its use, we show how this operation can be efficiently implemented to run on a GPU and demonstrate its generalization abilities on a synthetic dataset.<br/><br/>Next, we consider the problem of designing sparse sampling strategies for multidomain signals, which can be represented using tensors. To keep the framework general, we do not restrict ourselves to multidomain signals defined on irregular domains. Nonetheless, this particularization to multidomain graph signals is also presented. To do so, we leverage the multidomain structure of tensor signals and propose to acquire samples using a Kronecker-structured sensing function, thereby circumventing the curse of dimensionality. For designing such sensing functions, we develop several low-complexity greedy algorithms based on submodular optimization methods that compute near-optimal sampling sets. To validate the developed theory, we present several numerical examples, ranging from multi-antenna communications to graph signal processing.","deep learning; graph signal processing; sparse sampling; product graphs; submodular optimization; tensors","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One of these 'weak links' stretches from Camperduin to Petten and is known as the Hondsebossche Pettemer Zeewering; a former 'hard' sea dyke with a stone revetment. To fortify this 12 kilometres coastal area construction of a dune, beach and shoreface nourishment began in 2014.<br/><br/>A 2DH model, FINEL2D, was used to predict the development of the zone for twenty years to estimate the maintenance. However, significant deviations in sand volume losses were found when comparing measurements and model predictions. These differences may affect maintenance budgets. Especially in the Nature Zone of the HD, where the contractor must pay a fine if maintenance is needed within the first ten years after construction.<br/><br/>To evaluate the consequences of the deviations on the maintenance prognosis of the coming years, a model is required which predicts the volume losses of the Hondsbossche Dunes with sufficient accuracy. The goal of this research is to evaluate the applicability 2DH models to simulate volume losses of a mega nourishments such as the Hondsbossche Dunes. <br/><br/>An analysis of the data available for the first and second year after construction is performed to provide insight into the causes of the deviations between the measured and modelled volume losses. It focusses on finding the effect of initial processes. Furthermore, it aims to define the relative importance of cross and longshore transport. Afterwards, the model performance is evaluated by means of a hindcast, using brute forcing. Together with the data analysis this information is used to improve future predictions of 2DH models.<br/><br/>From the data analysis it can be concluded that volume losses occurring in the first year are significantly larger than those in the second year. This difference cannot be explained by the difference in occurring wave climate and coastline orientation alone, it can have multiple other explanations; winnowing, settlement of nourished sediment, settlement of the subsoil, sediment losses beyond the dunes, and losses to deeper water. The significant reduction of the volume losses in the second year indicate that initial effects are less pronounced in this year. This indicates that the losses in longshore direction of second year after construction should be predictable. It is also found that aeolian transport is an important process in both years.<br/><br/>The evaluation of the model performance showed higher model accuracy for the second year after construction than for the first year. The modelled volume losses are compared to the losses in longshore direction based on measurements. The second year models the volume losses reasonably well, especially when looking at the Nature Zone, dominated by erosion. <br/><br/>Some aspects that could further improve the model are analysed using a strongly simplified model. Those aspects are assumed to increase the sediment transport and thereby the sediment available for sedimentation in the recreation zone north. Only using a smaller grid size around the bars seems to strongly enhance higher sediment transport. The other aspects considered are the interpolation between SWAN and FINEL2D, the amount of swan calculation per tidal cycle, the change in the cross-shore profile due to lack of 3D processes in 2DH models, and the morphological acceleration factor, none of which significantly affected total sediment transport.<br/><br/>It is found that a 2DH model is applicable in a situation where initial effects are no longer present. In case of a first year after construction, a factor could be applied to account for initial effects. For the second year, the model accuracy is quite good when comparing it to measured losses assumed in longshore direction. Yet an important factor to the losses is aeolian transport which is not accounted for in a 2DH model.<br/><br/>For future projects, it is important to realise that initial effects can significantly affect volume losses, and should be accounted for in some way. Another aspect that is important to take into account when designing a mega nourishment is the contribution of aeolian transport, which is quite constant during the first and second year after construction. A third aspect to keep in mind is the way the model results are interpreted.<br","mega nourishment; Hondsbossche dunes; initial development; 2DH model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2028-08-23","","","","","","52.45, 4.39"

Early-stage autonomous vehicles are increasingly appearing on the streets, carrying the burden of transporting human-lives to their destination. Meanwhile, doctors are involving Artificial Intelligence (AI) in their medical diagnoses, basing treatment of patients on the analyses AI provides. For these services to reach their full potential, a vast amount of training data is required, often gathered from a variety of sources. In many cases, the required data is considered to be privacy-sensitive (e.g., medical data). Due to the sensitivity of the underlying information, many individuals and organizations are not willing to entrust its protection to another party.<br/>A field that attempts to limit the need to transfer training data openly is called collaborative learning, where multiple data generators cooperate to jointly train a classifier. In the proposed techniques the participants aim to limit the privacy loss of their collected training data to other collaborators. We contribute a clear overview of the current state-of-the-art and identify its limitations. Based on these limitations, we present two innovative protocol designs that pave the way towards private collaborative learning.<br/>The ECONoMy protocol is developed to suit the needs of a high participant use case (i.e., Internet of Things (IoT)), under an assumed semi-honest adversarial model. The experimental results show that ECONoMy offers the desired privacy properties while remaining competitive to the non-privacy preserving alternative with which it is compared. However, in certain environments the incentives can grow exceedingly large rendering the ’semi-honest’ adversary assumption impractical.<br/>We, therefore, created the PRECLUDE protocol which uses traceable ring signatures to protect against adversaries in the covert adversarial model. The tracing capability allows to detect malpractice and leak the identity of the deviant while preserving the anonymity of honest participants. These additional privacy-preservation properties came at a high cost to the overall efficiency, which is what we aimed to reduce by designing our extended protocol called PRECLUDE+.<br/>PRECLUDE+ manages to drastically improve efficiency by reducing the number of participants included in a single signature. Further, we created a batch-verification phase that allows us to omit several exponentiations in each execution. We provide a detailed statistical analysis showing how to balance the efficiency improvements, with the required privacy parameters. The protocols presented in this thesis significantly improve upon the privacy guarantees offered by current alternatives, and provide a clear direction in which future work can continue to build.","collaborative learning; Privacy; Cryptography; Adversarial Machine Learning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science | Cyber Security","",""

The understanding of the quantum correlations, or entanglement, between the particles in an isolated many-body quantum system may however be challenging, as the amount of interactions may be large. To be able to describe the system in a simpler way, mean field theory is often applied; the interactions of all individual particles are substituted by an averaged effect. First and second order mean field approximations are applied to the equations of motion of the amplitudes &lt;ân&gt; for each mode of the many-body system. In first order mean field, under the assumption that each mode has the same magnitude of the (constant) amplitude, the Kuramoto equation follows for the phases of the complex amplitudes. To study this first order approximation and to refine the mean field solution, the equations of motion have been extended to second order mean field. After that, numerical integration is used to solve the system of coupled differential equations for two modes. The solutions seem unstable, which is verified by defining quantum fluctuations beyond mean field. These are shown not to be negligible for a two mode system.It was discovered that the mean field equations of motion show divergent fluctuations for a system of two modes, which opens a whole set of questions on the validity of the first order mean field approximation and therefore the use of the Kuramoto model for quantum many-body dynamics. The extension to the second order mean field solution might be promising as this does include correlations between the operators.","synchronization; many-body system; mean field; quantum correlations","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics | Applied Physics","",""

Exomoons are natural satellites orbiting an extrasolar (exo)planet in an extrasolar system. By looking at eclipses on exoplanets, we can find these characteristics.<br/>We consider the reflected light signals of exoplanets with an exomoon. The reflected light signal is the intensity of light the planet reflects from the host star towards the observer.<br/>We derive the reflected light signal in a planetary system with one exoplanet and in a system with an exoplanet and an exomoon. We made the assumptions that the exoplanets and exomoons have<br/>a homogeneous surface (albedo is 1) and move in circular orbits around a star with an inclination angle between the orbital planes. Along the orbit the planet and the moon have changing phases. The moon is always close to its planet, so the phases of the exomoon and the exoplanet are the<br/>same. For exoplanets, it is not possible to spatially separate a moon from its planet. One only sees the total signal of both bodies, the light originating from the star, reflected by the two bodies towards the observer.<br/>Maybe we can find an exomoon by examining eclipses. Eclipses occur when the exoplanet and exomoon are aligned with the star, so that the body closest to the star blocks the light towards the<br/>body farthest from the star. Finding eclipses is one of the few methods to discover exomoons. The systems are modeled with the assumption that any total eclipse happens every time r = R or −r = R, we see short dips in the reflected light signal. These dips are periodic and make the complete signal quasi-periodic. That is why we also calculate the Fourier transform of the reflected light signal. This quasi-periodicity causes the Fourier spectrum to have side bands that are repeated and are copies of themselves.<br/>In this research, the orbit of the exomoon is tilted to see the effect of inclination in the reflected light signal. The result is fewer eclipses. At most twice a year for a short amount of time an eclipse<br/>can occur. In the Fourier domain, this results in more peaks, but the pattern is still repeated.<br/>From this research, we cannot conclude whether or not an exomoon is present from measured data.<br/>What we learned, is that if an exomoon is present, short dips in the received light signal occur and this results in periodic side bands in the Fourier domain with respect to the system of one planet.<br/>The duration of an eclipse is very short, so the detection of the eclipse can easily be missed. The Fourier transform signal becomes stronger when a longer time has been measured.","exomoon; eclipse; direct imaging; fourier analysis","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics | Applied Physics","",""

Solid oxide cells are electrochemical devices that are receiving a lot attention as an effective power grid balancing technology, given their ability to operate as Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFC) for electric power generation, and as Solid Oxide Electrolysis Cells (SOEC) for chemical fuel production. Solid Oxide Reversible Cells (SORC) are capable of working alternately in these two modes, thus can be used to store electricity in the form of fuel when energy supply in the grid exceeds the energy demand and can release this energy when demand exceeds the supply from generation systems.<br/><br/>The purpose of this project was to design an energy storage system that uses solid oxide reversible cells and syngas as fuel, consuming it to produce electricity during operation as a fuel cell and producing it back to store electric power through the co-electrolysis of water and CO2 when working as an electrolysis cell. The design and steady-state simulation of the system was performed using the process simulation software Aspen Plus, where a base configuration of the plant was constructed and improved using as main criteria the roundtrip efficiency and exergy efficiency achieved.

Overall, it was possible to attain improvements in system roundtrip efficiency from 29% to 44%; in SOFC exergy efficiency from 44% to 64%; and in SOEC exergy efficiency from 66% to 68%.","Renewable energy; Sustainable energy; Exergy analysis; Fuel cells; Solid oxide fuel cells; Energy storage; Aspen Plus; Exergy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

The wide range of applications include searching for victims in a search and rescue operation, detecting weeds in precision agriculture, patrolling borders for military and navy, automated census of endangered species in a forest etc. An efficient target search algorithm provides a data acquisition platform with least human intervention, thus improving the quality of life of humans. This thesis aims at introducing a general path planning algorithm for UAVs flying at different heights in an obstacle filled environment, searching for targets in the ground field. An adaptive informative path planning (IPP) algorithm is introduced that simultaneously trade off between area coverage, field of view, height dependent sensor performance and obstacle avoidance. It plans under uncertainties in the sensor measurements at varying heights, and is robust against wrong target detections. It generates an optimal fixed horizon plan in the form of a 3D minimum-snap trajectory that maximizes the information gain in minimum flight time by providing maximum area coverage, without any collision with the obstacles. The resulting planner is modular in terms of the mapping strategy, environment complexity, different target, changes in the sensor model and optimizer used. The planner is tested against varying environmental complexities, demonstrating its capability in handling a wide range of possible environments. The planner outperforms other planners like non-adaptive IPP planner, coverage planner and random sampling planner, by demonstrating the fastest decrease in map error while flying for a fixed time budget. A proof of concept for the algorithm is provided through real experiments by running the algorithm on a UAV flying inside a lab environment, searching for targets lying on the ground. All the targets were successfully found and mapped by the algorithm, demonstrating its applicability in a real-life target search problem.","Path Planning; Robotics; Unmanned Aerial Vehicle; Computer Vision; Optimization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Biomechanical Design - BioRobotics","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","Industrial robots can be found in automotive, food, chemical, and electronics industries. These robots are often caged and are secluded from human beings. A recent trend in a subclass of industrial robots named collaborative robots allows the humans to interact with the robots safely. The word “safety” mentioned above is of supreme importance. The safety is achieved in these robots by their lightweight and sleek design. Often, robots are operated under low stiffness conditions to achieve less impact force during an unavoidable collision. A severe damage to the environment may occur if the robot becomes unstable under any conditions. It is of paramount importance for the controller present in the robot to stabilize the system under all conditions. One such controller is the joint impedance controller, which helps the robot to interact with an unknown environment by causing no harm to humans. <br/><br/>The thesis marks its importance, as it is closely related to ensuring safety in collaborative robots and is mainly focused on tackling the situations whenever the controller fails. The controller in these manipulators has an Inverse Dynamics Model (IDM) and a Proportional Derivative (PD) controller. Under low stiffness and damping conditions, the PD gains are low and the manipulator is entirely compensated by the inverse dynamics model. This inverse dynamics model can become problematic in the presence of the un-modeled dynamics like flexibility, friction, dynamics of hydraulic tubes, actuators and cable drives or if the IDM model is inherently inaccurate. Consequently, the in-built joint impedance and position controller will fail to work under low stiffness and damping conditions, in-turn making the robot unstable. If this robot was to be used on an industrial platform and the problem is unresolved, it might cause some danger to the humans working closely and also damage the environment<br/>and itself.<br/><br/>Since the robot is entirely compensated by the IDM under low stiffness and damping conditions, the thesis tries to acquire the accurate IDM of the robot for control purposes. To do so, two cases were modeled in this thesis, one with the internal IDM with correct base parameters and another one with the incorrect internal IDM by adding offset in the base parameters. But in both cases, the internal IDM model failed to compensate for the un-modeled dynamics<br/>occurring in the manipulator.<br/><br/>The thesis incorporates a semi-parametric Gaussian process regression to tackle the two cases. A semi-parametric model consists of a parametric term and a non-parametric term. First, the parametric term is identified using the least squares approach. Later, the parametric term is used as mean to capture the non-parametric term using the Gaussian Process Regression. The proposed methods were tested on the PUMA 560 robot and the two-link manipulator in MATLAB. From the simulation results, the semi-parametric model was able to provide accurate feed-forward control torques to compensate for the model inaccuracies and the un-modeled dynamics at low stiffness and damping conditions. Additionally, implementing these proposed methods on a real robot will be a future scope of improvement on this topic.","Semi-parametric Gaussian Process Regression; Serial Manipulators; Gaussian process regression","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

It is theorized that the use of electrically powered machines as means of propulsion could reduce the emission impact of future aircraft through a combination of a higher energy conversion efficiency and synergies with the overall aircraft system. However, fully electric designs are not viable in the near and medium term as the performance characteristics of the electric devices are still not comparable with the achievements in terms of high specific weights of modern fuel-burning propulsive system.<br/><br/>A proposed solution while the technology maturity level of the electric devices advances, is to electrify only a fraction of the aircraft system. The use of two energy sources in the propulsive system opens the design space and allows for the experimentation with novel aircraft configurations that could lead to interesting fuel and energy consumption reductions. However, established methods for aircraft design become obsolete as the complex configurations and control strategies cannot be modelled. Without fully taking advantage of the degrees of freedom introduced by the hybridization of the propulsive system, it is expected that little improvements will be seen as the resulting designs would not differ much from the modern aircraft.<br/><br/>The objective of this thesis is to develop a conceptual design procedure that can be applied to size and analyse any hybrid electric architecture using electro-chemical batteries as the electric energy source. A conceptual design method needs to be simple and adaptable so that a wide range of designs with morphologically different propulsive system architectures can be quickly compared and improved.<br/><br/>The proposed approach distils the main components required in a hybrid electric architecture into a base building block that can be used to model an arbitrarily complex system using few control parameters. The control strategy determines the power flows inside the propulsive system contemporaneously defining the type of architecture and allowing the estimation of power and energy requirements.<br/>The electric and conventional devices are sized with these requirements using low order methods that can be applied to a wide range of power ratings. The impact of the hybridization is considered both in the energy consumption estimation and in the evaluation of point performance constraints.<br/><br/>The proposed method is validated in two steps. First, the performance estimations derived from the main components models are compared to published data or higher order method results. Discrepancies and limitations are discussed and solutions to improve the accuracy are proposed. Then, a conventional twin-engine turboprop aircraft is designed and the results are compared to assess if the integrated approach that puts the constraint analysis in communication with the point mass estimations and sizing procedures leads to valid results.<br/><br/>The method is then used for a design space exploration exercise where three different hybrid electric powertrain architectures are studied for varying technology maturity levels and mission control strategies. The most promising propulsive system operational strategy is then selected for each design and studied in more depth. The sensitivity of each aircraft to the main design parameters is then assessed in the final study.<br/><br/>The results indicate that the electrification of the propulsive system can lead to fuel and energy consumption reductions if the battery specific energy improves beyond 500 Wh/kg, a value already double of what is possible with today's technologies. The improvement of the other devices such as electric motors and electric power distribution sub-system is less critical but still necessary if large fuel load reductions are to be accomplished. Finally, the full potential of the hybrid electric powertrain can be achieved only by taking advantage of synergies with the other aircraft disciplines and by carefully selecting an appropriate control strategy.","conceptual design; hybrid electric propulsion; HEP; Electrific flight; Battery electric aircraft; system modelling; battery electric vehicles","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Their specific properties make them attractive substitutes for metals which are currently the most commonly used material in the automotive industry. Despite their advantages, their use in primary structures inside a car is still limited due to a number of factors, of which cost is the most important one. For this project, the use of FRPs as local reinforcements in semi-structural applications is investigated. The main content of the project will consist in analysing 3 different FRP design concepts with the use of Finite Element Modelling (FEM). The main objective is then to determine which design concept is best suited for the reinforcement based on a number of criteria which are defined inside the project. The main findings will consist on having one of the design concepts meeting the requirements for the reinforcement application or to prove that no design concept can be used. The integration of FRPs inside a car offer great benefits in terms of being environmentally friendly in a world where car pollution is a major problem in some countries.

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","In the past few years, considerable attention has been paid to reduce the computational time for the analysis of genome data, which eliminated critical computational bottlenecks in the time needed for the analysis of DNA information. However, the analysis of genome data is still facing time consuming challenges due to the slow speed of DNA sequencing machines. DNA sequencing is a time-consuming process that could take days to sequence even a single sample. This limits the speed of existing DNA analysis methods since they all need to wait for getting the full sequenced DNA data before they start the analysis. As a result, DNA analysis pipelines are not able to benefit from the reduced computational analysis time. Recently, a new method called early DNA analysis was introduced where the genome analysis pipeline is started with<br/>incomplete DNA data before all DNA sequencing finishes, which opens the door to decrease the total time consumption of DNA analysis including the sequencing time. In this thesis, a parallel implementation of the early DNA analysis approach based on the Apache Spark big data framework is proposed to improve its performance. Besides, using incomplete DNA data sets brings also a slight drop of the accuracy in genome analysis. The original method proposed a few simple methods to complete the unknown DNA data, but these can be improved to increase the accuracy. Therefore, a few new algorithms are also proposed and tested to increase accuracy in this thesis. Results show that the proposed scalability solution towards early DNA analysis could achieve a 7.6× speed-up with 97.48% correctness when deployed on a 4-node Power7+ cluster, while one of the advanced completion algorithms could increase the classification accuracy for unknown DNA data by 0.006%.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Embedded Systems","",""

PVD offers some benefits over HDG like multilayer structures and lower heat impact on the steel. <br/>To achieve sufficient coating adhesion strength of the zinc coating, before deposition the steel substrate is normally cleaned and activated by a plasma sputter unit. As this sputtering takes place in the vacuum chamber, like the deposition, it is prone to precipitation of sputtered material in the vacuum chamber. If the PVD process is scaled up to an industrial coating line, the volumes of sputtered material and precipitated material will become problematic for the service reliability. Therefore it has been investigated whether an acid etching surface pre-treatment step before the vacuum chamber could reduce the needed plasma intensity, and thereby decrease the sputtered volume in the vacuum chamber. <br/>A range of acid etching times and plasma sputtering times were tested, to obtain the range in which the coating adhesion was sufficient. To test the coating adhesion, two (automotive) tests were used. It was found that by pickling, the plasma sputter intensity could not be reduced. So the coating adhesion strength seemed not directly related to the pickling time, for the particular steel used in this project. <br/>After the limits of good adhesion were determined, the characterization started to identify what in the elemental composition or the surface morphology could determine whether there was good adhesion or not. It was found that (even very short) pickling completely removes the surface enrichment of the first 50 nm, while plasma sputtering only lowers the surface enrichments. It was found that plasma sputtering does not influence the morphology, while pickling smoothens the surface out, with increasing pickling. As the oxygen concentration profile did not change significantly as function of pickling time, but its enrichment thickness was about equal to the minimum plasma sputter depth, it is thought that the oxygen concentration is the major influence on good and bad adhesion. <br","coating; physical vapor deposition; pickling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

The first steps have been taken by establishing the Green Deal UDG between multiple industrial consortia, which agree to share knowledge on the research and use of ultra-deep geothermal energy . The Dinantian carbonates are of interest for the deep geothermal wells, because of their high geothermal potential. This research project provides a case study of the Californië geothermal doublets in Limburg (NL), which are currently the only geothermal wells in the Netherlands producing from the Dinantian carbonates. However, the static and dynamic model prove that the Devonian Bosscheveld formation and Condroz group are also part of the reservoir formation. Due to the tight matrix of the reservoir rocks, the permeability is believed to be fracture and karst (meteoric and hydrothermal) driven. The goal of this Thesis is to create a static and dynamic model of the reservoir that confirms the current production data (history match) and that explores the development of the geothermal potential of the reservoir in space and time. The static and dynamic reservoir model are based on a limited amount of well and seismic data, which forms the main challenge in this project. A framework of assumptions has been created to construct the model and a scenario- based approach has been applied to construct a best case scenario that matches the production data. A key element in the static reservoir model is the Tegelen fault. To estimate the impact of the Tegelen fault on the permeability distribution in the reservoir, a fieldwork in an analogue carbonate quarry has been executed. The results are applied in the static model. The dynamic results in this study show that the permeability configuration applied in the best case scenario results in BHP, flow rate and temperature values that are of the correct order of magnitude and within an acceptable error margin of the production data. Multiple sensitivities have been simulated to determine the range of parameters that may cause an inaccuracy in the results. Additional data acquisition is necessary to validate and optimize the static model, which will result in a dynamic model with an improved history match and a larger predictive power for future production and reservoir management.","Geothermal reservoir; Dinantian carbonates; Fracture driven permeability; Karst; Dynamic simulation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-08-22","","","","","",""

The phenomenon has first been discovered in a climate change model and is later observed in neuronal systems. In artificial, electronic, systems, stochastic resonance is observed in systems based on Schmitt-Triggers and comparators. The common property of all these systems is the threshold, which, when reached, causes a large transition in the system. The presence of noise in small signals can cause the system to reach the threshold or can increase the number of state transitions, increasing the quality of the output signal. Oversampling and integration are applied to reconstruct the original signal. Biomedical signals are typically affected relative high noise levels. The observations of stochastic resonance in nature, such as biological neural systems, combined with the observations of stochastic resonance in comparator-based circuits formed the inspiration and fundamental of this thesis research. The goal of this project is to investigate the potentials for using stochastic resonance in biomedical signal acquisition. In this thesis, an explorative study on the behavior, the performance, and the design of an analog-to-digital (ADC) converter fully based on stochastic resonance in a 1-bit quantizer is presented. The design and application focus on processing ECG measurements. A comprehensive analysis of the behavior, and an analytical method to determine the performance of 1-bit stochastic resonance analog-to-digital conversion in a comparator based circuit is presented.

Based on this analysis, a system level design is presented which implements a closed-loop operation of the stochastic resonance ADC. This design comprises a feedback loop to control the noise level, realizing the maximum performance over an input amplitude range from 1-10 mV, independent from noise present in the system. Furthermore, an offset compensation scheme is presented, which controls the threshold of the comparator, and a digital multi-rate filter is implemented to filter the high frequency noise, and to apply downsampling the highspeed bitstream. IC implementation of the comparator and the noise source is studied. A low-offset<br/>comparator, based on a strongARM latch, is proposed, with an offset calibration technique, reducing the offset to below 50 μV. The noise source creates a flat noise spectrum from 20 kHz to 4 MHz, using amplified thermal noise of a resistor combined with the amplifier noise. The proposed system can deliver a 27 dB SNDR in a signal bandwidth of 216 Hz, and an input amplitude range of 10×, using a sampling frequency of 2 MHz.","Stochastic Resonance; Analog-to-Digital; Noise; 1-bit processing; quantization; Signal Acquisition","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering","",""

The accident created a large gap in the weir and within 12 hours the upstream water level decreased by a maximum of 3 meters. Due to this decreased water level shipping was limited, houseboats were skewed and there was a risk of instability of the river banks and upstream weirs.</p><p>Several alternative measures were considered to close the damaged part of the weir in order to reinstate the upstream water level, and make it possible to repair the weir. Finally it was decided to build a rock-fill dam behind the damaged part of the weir which closed nearly 55% of the weir. Due to this closure, all the discharge had to pass the weir through the remaining 50 meters-wide southern opening. As a result of this upstream water levels were set-up faster than during normal operations. High upstream water levels, relatively high discharges and a low downstream water level caused extreme flow situations with even supercritical flow (hydraulic jump) over the bed protection. At weir Grave the existing bed protection was injected with colloidal concrete and an additional ballasting sill, made of 3-6t carefully placed stones and 4t rock nets was constructed, to prevent additional damage to the bed protection.</p><p>In this study the stability of the measures which were used to prevent additional damage to the bed protection are analyzed. This study focusses on the 3-6t carefully placed stones, rock net sill and the bed protection behind it. The 4t rock nets were not able to withstand discharges up to 450m3/s and flow velocities up to 7.0m/s due to the internal instability of the small rock material inside the nets. The 3-6t stones were able to withstand discharges up to 850m3/s and flow velocities up to 6.7m/s. Due to the fact that the stones were carefully placed, the stability increased. A stability correction factor (Φsc) up to 0.73 can be used instead of 1.5 as prescribed by Pilarczyk for stones on the edge of a bed protection. The 40-200kg bed protection with colloidal concrete has withstood extreme flow velocities up to 7.2m/s whereby only small damages occurred. The 40-200kg quarry stones without colloidal concrete also showed limited damages after the 850m3/s flood wave and depth averaged flow velocities up to 5.2m/s. The conclusions of the analysis are projected to the other six weirs in the Meuse and to the possible calamities which could occur here.</p><p>In order to perform the stability analysis of the bed protection measures at weir Grave, the Meuse and the seven weirs in the Meuse were analyzed. The Meuse is a controlled river in the Netherlands and is kept navigable by a seven weir system. These weirs differ in dimension, head loss and operating system. Based on the characteristics of these weirs one simplified fictive weir is chosen and tested on the consequences of various calamities. Besides, also the long-term maintenance strategy is considered in this study. Both have the similar result that part of the weir is non-operational for a longer period, discharge capacity is limited and all highly variability in occurring discharges is possible.</p><p>In this study the consequences to the water management of the fictive weir are considered. To guarantee an upstream water level to a certain target level, panels and slides are removed from a weir for increasing discharge. If part of the weir is not available due to a closure, panels and slides have to be removed earlier than in a normal situation. Therefore, the limit discharge, the discharge for which the weir is completely open, is reached earlier for the different closure situations. If the limit discharge is reached, the upstream water level starts to increase. In this thesis the discharge, according to an upstream water level equal to the flood plain level, is the maximum considered discharge. For further increasing discharge, and water levels, the flood plains start to discharge water and the flow velocities downstream of the weir will no further increase.</p><p>The flow velocities for three closure situations and three discharge situations are considered in this study. It turned out that the flow velocities which are calculated in this thesis are always lower than the flow velocities which occurred during the Grave weir calamity. Therefore it is concluded that the measures used during the Grave calamity, are all applicable to the other weirs in the Meuse. But lastly is must be concluded that due to a relative large closure of a weir (&gt;50%), severe flow circumstances like supercritical flow, can occur. In case of a future calamity or long-term closure, it is advised to minimize the closure width as much as possible.","Bed protection; Calamities; Emergency measures; Weirs; Grave","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

With the help of business partners, firms can considerably improve their levels of corporate entrepreneurship and so their levels of competition. In this research, we test whether business partner proximity and resource acquisition in alliances are affecting corporate entrepreneurship. We looked at tangible and intangible resource types and the three different dimensions of corporate entrepreneurship, being innovation, renewal and venturing. Data from 91 high tech manufacturing SMEs was collected by survey and combined with data from the SDC Platinum alliance database. On the collected data statistical analyses were conducted with the use of SPSS. Our findings indicated that for high tech manufacturing SMEs different levels of business partner proximity have no influence on the acquired tangible and intangible resource types, and also did not influence a firm’s corporate entrepreneurship outcomes. Further, indicate the findings that intangible resource acquisition is more important for a firm’s entrepreneurship than tangible resource acquisition. The practical implications of this study are that high-tech SMEs gain due to resource acquisition the most on their venturing commitments, and thereafter renewal and thereafter innovation. SMEs looking to form alliances can conclude that due to resource acquisition from their business partner they will profit the most on venturing aspects and thereafter on renewal and innovation aspects. Also, levels of business partner proximity do not show to be relevant on the outcomes of corporate entrepreneurship, although we found that alliances were most frequently among similar sized companies.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

Wearable sensing technologies, such as inertial measurement units (IMUs), may augment clinical assessments by providing continuous gait and balance data at an increased resolution. The objective of this work was to validate spatiotemporal gait features with a single IMU sensor and to examine changes in sensor-derived features with age during the common clinical tests of gait and balance. We tested the use of an IMU place in the lower back (L5) on age-ranged, healthy individuals (N=34, 20-70 years) during the 10-meter walk test (10MWT), Timed Up and Go (TUG), and Berg Balance Scale (BBS). A total of 49 features were derived from the sensors based on a novel selection of algorithms from previous works. Six spatiotemporal gait features were validated against gold standard measures to assess accuracy and bias. There was an excellent agreement for step time, stance time, swing time, and step count (ICCs 0.90–0.99), and good agreement for gait velocity and step length (ICCs 0.84–0.88). There were 33 linear correlations between age and the sensor-derived features, including a negative correlation between age and vertical displacement of the center of mass during gait. The strongest correlation with age was found for the first slope of the second turn in the TUG (r=-0.545, p≤0.001). For the features that showed moderate correlations (|r|&gt;30, p&lt;0.05), a hierarchical multivariate regression model showed that age was the most important predictor independent of weight, height, and gender. Furthermore, when looking at gender-specific differences after correcting for the contribution of weight and height, women exhibited 5-fold more correlations compared to men. In conclusion, sensor-derived features demonstrated greater sensitivity to individual differences in gait and balance, which may be of a particular interest for future implementation in a clinical setting in impaired populations. The structure of this thesis is as follows: The first chapter contains the project overview, future vision, and specific aims. The second chapter contains a manuscript that will be submitted for peer-reviewed journal publication. Finally, the third chapter is an appendix with more detailed explanations of the methods and findings of this work.","Wearable Technology; Gait; Balance; Validation; IMU; continuous wavelet transform; discrete wavelet transform","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-12-31","","","","Biomedical Engineering | BioMechatronics","",""

There is an increasing amount of projects that try to clean up this pollution. To remove the pollution efficiently, it is useful to know how plastic litter moves, degrades and sinks. Models are being developed that can describe what happens with plastic in the ocean. <br/><br/>To model the behaviour of plastic in the ocean a lot of parameters need to be taken into account. The transport of plastic particles is largely determined by processes like the wind and the current but their movement also has a random character due to dispersion. Due to this random movement, the future position of a particle can be described by a probability distribution. To find that probability distribution, the Kolmogorov forward equation (or Fokker-Planck equation), in this context the same as the advection-diffusion equation, needs to be solved.<br/><br/>It is also possible that the plastic particles sink and settle on the bottom of the ocean. One goal of this project was to incorporate the settling of particles as an extra term into the advection-diffusion equation. <br/><br/>Forward models are used to predict where particles will go to. It can also be useful to have reverse time models that can describe where particles had their origin. To make reverse time models, it is necessary to solve a reverse time advection-diffusion equation. The main goal of this project was to derive and solve the reverse time advection-diffusion equation that includes the settling of particles.

(mentor); Mestemaker, BTW (mentor); Godjevac, M. (graduation committee); Klein, S.A. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","Emission regulations applied to marine industry for amongst others the propulsion system of a vessel are becoming stricter due to governmental <br/>agreements to lower the greenhouse gas emissions. Engine manufactures<br/>are enhancing their engine designs to reduce the engine fuel consumption, which is commonly done by implementing a turbocharger to downsize the engine. One large drawback which comes with a turbocharged engine is the low torque development for the low to mid engine speed range due to limitations set to prevent unstable turbocharger phenomena. Moreover, the engine is not able to follow the power request almost instantaneously due to a time delay between the engine and turbocharger response. Formula One engineers close this gap by introducing an integrated electric machine into the turbocharger structure (hybrid electric turbocharger) to, first, take power out from the turbocharger to increase the system efficiency, and second by assisting the turbocharger to improve the engine power delivery response.<br/><br/>However, the understanding of the effects of a hybrid electric turbocharger on both the system efficiency as well as the engine loading capability is lacking. One turbocharger limit, the compressor surge, is not concerned in most literature what rises the need for further research up to which extent the engine can be assisted with the hybrid electric turbocharger. In this work, the effect of taking power from the turbocharger to increase the system efficiency, called turbocompounding, is investigated. Turbocharger assistance is investigated for both steady state as well as dynamic operation. The effect of assisting the turbocharger for steady state operation is investigated to increase the engine’s operating envelope. Dynamic operation comprises the investigating up to which extent the assisting mode improves the dual fuel engine’s loading capability for four types of engine loading. These types of engine loading are: one instant load step, three consecutive load steps from 0 - 100% load, a load ramp and, last, a sinusoidal engine loading.<br/><br/>This has been done with a simulation-based study wherein a mean value dual fuel engine model is composed based on merging two available mean value engine models, after which it is verified and validated. Thereafter power take in/out together with an air excess ratio control strategy is included by means of adding/taking torque to/from the turbocharger shaft and limiting it with eight boundary controllers to avoid impractical situations. With turbocompounding the system efficiency can be increased at the expense of a deteriorated gas exchange and increased thermal loading of the engine. The maximum quantity of recovered energy to be obtained, requires a hybrid electric turbocharger which replaces a waste gated turbocharger instead of a non-waste gated single stage turbocharger. Taking power from the turbocharger lowers the power available for the compressor which leads to reduced inlet receiver pressure and corresponding lowering of the air excess ratio and deterioration of the scavenging process.<br/><br/>Assisting the turbocharger for steady state operation leads to a smaller operating envelope due to the limitation of compressor surge. Combining turbocharger assistance with gas exchange bypass valves, to avoid compressor<br/>surge, results in a rise of the low speed torque output up to an almost constant engine torque output. The system efficiency can be improved for the low speed region when the turbocharger is assisted in combination with the gas exchange valves.<br/><br/>The load step capability, found by limiting the minimum air excess ratio during the load step event, cannot be increased with turbocharger assistance which starts to speed up the turbocharger immediately after the load step is applied to the engine. However, the recovery time needed before a second load step can be taken, is reduced with turbocharger assistance compared to the baseline engine. When the turbocharger assistance starts to speed up the turbocharger a couple of seconds before the load is applied, the load step capability can be improved. A load ramp can be taken in a shorter period of time with turbocharger assistance enabled. For cyclic loading, the hybrid electric turbocharger operates in turbocompounding mode for the lower load frequencies, and assistance is used for the higher load frequencies. With turbocharger assistance the air excess<br/>ratio does follow the sinusoidal engine load while the air excess ratio of the non-assisted engine always lags due to the turbocharger lag.<br/><br/>Further research should be done with regard to a hybrid electric turbocharger for the natural gas combustion of the dual fuel engine. Using the engine speed drop should be implemented as limitation for the loading capability determination instead of the minimum allowable air excess ratio applied in this thesis.","Turbocharger; hybrid electric turbocharger; operating envelope; Diesel engine; Dual fuel engine; turbocompounding; electrically assisted turbocharging; diesel B","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-08-13","","","","Marine Technology | Ship Design, Production and Operations","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","The Port of Rotterdam (PoR), located in the Rhine-Meuse estuary, is subject to sedimentation. In order to keep the port accessible for vessels with high drafts, maintenance dredging works are done. The maintenance dredging over the port area is executed by two parties, PoR itself regarding the harbour basins and Rijkswaterstaat (RWS) regarding the river and waterways.<br/><br/>Since 2013 a substantial increase of the yearly total maintenance dredging volume of the area under control of PoR is observed. The problem of this research is the increase in maintenance dredging volume, from an average of 5.2 mln cubic meters a year (over 2005-2012) to an average of 8.9 mln cubic meters a year (over 2013-2016). By analysis of the administrated maintenance dredging volumes database of PoR it is concluded that the problem is concentrated at Maasvlakte I. Including the maintenance dredging volumes data of RWS results in the conclusion that over the entire port area no occurrence of an increase in maintenance dredging volume is observed. A decrease administrated by RWS at the same period of time is concentrated at the area in front of Maasvlakte I, the harbour basin responsible for the increase in maintenance dredging volume of PoR. These findings lead to the conclusion that not an increase of sedimentation over the port area is responsible for the research problem, but a redistribution of the sedimentation rates from the area in front of Maasvlakte I to Maasvlakte I is. <br/><br/>An analysis of the events that are potentially of influence on the research problem is performed. Based on the correlation of time and potential impact on the hydrodynamics of the water system, the event 'Construction of Maasvlakte II' is selected for an assessment. Two simulations with an extensive hydrodynamic flow model managed by PoR are run. One simulation includes the layout of the Maasvlakte before the construction of Maasvlakte II, the other includes the layout of the Maasvlakte as it is today. Both simulation use exactly the same initial and boundary conditions. With use of the simulations, the impact on the hydrodynamic conditions within the area of interest is assessed. The results show a significant increase of the tidal filling volume of the Maasvlakte harbour basins with a factor of 1.4. This increase is associated with in particular a significant increase of the horizontal flow velocities, and strengthened by a higher horizontal density gradient as a result of higher mixing rates of fresh and saline water at the Maasvlakte. The increase of the horizontal flow velocity is in particular measured in front of Maasvlakte I and in the connection to Maasvlakte I itself. Within the Maasvlakte harbour basin, the velocities are quickly dampened by the large width of the basin.<br/><br/>The results of the assessment correspond accurately with the results of the data analysis. At the area subject to an increase of the horizontal flow velocity, a decrease of the maintenance dredging volume is observed. At the area where an increase in maintenance dredging volume is observed, no to slight changes of the flow velocity are measured. This is explained as follows. The increase of the tidal filling volume by the construction of Maasvlakte II, results in an increase of the horizontal velocities over the entire area connecting the North Sea to the Maasvlakte. Sediments that were able to settle within that connection before are now kept in suspension and transport to the Maasvlakte. The sediments kept in suspension reach the harbour basins where the horizontal flow velocities are quickly dampened by the large width of the basin, enabling the sediments to settle.<br/><br/>It is concluded that the dominant mechanism leading to the increase in maintenance dredging volumes at the Port of Rotterdam is a change in local hydrodynamics by the construction of Maasvlakte II, resulting in a redistribution of the sedimentation rates within CaBe-system. A potential reduction measure in the form of a sediment trap is recommended to improve the current situation, but is unable to bring the hydrodynamics within system back to the situation as before the construction. The research problem is one of the consequences of the construction of Maasvlakte II, and hence partly have to accepted as well. A detailed study to the design of the problem specific sediment trap is required. Other studies that are recommended to improve the understanding of the actual problem regard the used dredging strategy, the exact pattern of sedimentation and the development of the composition of the bed material in the area the problem is concentrated.","Port; Dredging; Rotterdam","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","",""

With the rapid growth of containerised trade over the past 60 years, a significant share of global trade is transported by container nowadays. This suggests there is a connection between container flows and economic activity. There is also a time delay between containers with goods being imported and the announcement of quarterly Gross Domestic Product numbers. With US container imports and exports being publicly available information, this leads to the research question of this thesis: Can loaded and/or empty container flows be used to predict economic activity?” If so, this could prove to be valuable information for economists, policy makers and, as this thesis highlights, professional traders working at investment banks or hedge funds.<br/><br/>This thesis focusses on analysing transpacific containerised trade as a potential so-called forward indicator of US GDP. To measure these transpacific flows, an aggregate of US West coast port data is produced and de-seasonalised. The container flows are separated into Loaded In, Empty Out and Loaded Out flows. It is important to understand the dynamics of container trade and the variables influencing it on this route. Variables are identified that could possibly affect the supply-side of container shipping and therefore the transpacific container flows (the demand-side is seen as an expression of economic activity).<br/>After analysing the Cross Correlation Functions (CCF) of the identified, data based influencing variables, five different GDP growth prediction models are constructed. This is done by performing OLS single and multivariate regressions of the individual container flows (together with the influencing variables) on historical GDP growth data from 2000 to 2017. The resulting models are tested against an existing, commonly used forward indicator: the Purchasing Managers Index (PMI). The results show that three models, all using a form of loaded containers, outperform the PMI when predicting the direction of US GDP growth 3-months ahead over the 17-year time period of the dataset used. The probability of large prediction errors with these models are also smaller than the PMI benchmark model.<br","Container Transport; Economic modelling; Leading indicator; GDP; Port data; Port of LA; Container; Macroeconomic","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-08-22","","","","Marine Technology | Shipping Management","",""

In the existing investigations of spatial variability of corrosion on the reliability of reinforced concrete structures, symbolic expressions are used for the structural performance. However, structural behaviors like stress redistribution and plasticity spread are not captured. In this research, a computational framework is designed to couple the probabilistic analysis with the nonlinear finite element analysis. Random fields is used with the computational framework to represent the spatial variability of corrosion.A 60 m girder of a reinforced concrete bridge is taken as the case study to explore the effect of spatial variability of corrosion on reliability of static indeterminate reinforced concrete structures. The reliability analysis is target on ultimate capacity of the beam to carry the traffic load. The girder is modeled as a 3 span continuous beam. The modelling of corrosion damages on reinforcement (area of cross section and physical properties) is based on assumption of pure pitting corrosion. In the axial direction of the beam, spatial variability is modeled with random field. In order to study the effect of different level of spatial variability, the correlation length of the random field is set from infinite large to 125 mm. Between adjacent bars, extreme cases of fully spatial correlated and totally spatial independent are studied.The case study shows:i) when corrosion develops, pitting corrosion can severely reduce resistance of the structure and localized damage may lead to a brittle structural response.ii) spatial variability of pitting corrosion in the axial direction of the beam leads to higher failure probability of the structure.iii) spatial variability of pitting corrosion between adjacent bars leads to lower failure probability of the structure.iv) the effect of spatial variability of corrosion on reliability of static indeterminate reinforced concrete structure is a collective effect of probabilistic and physical characteristic.In order to facilitate the reliability assessment of corroded reinforced concrete structures, additional efforts are also contributed to: quantification of uncertainty for the bond model of corroded reinforcement; comparison of various reliability methods with the probabilistic nonlinear finite element analysis framework.The thesis fills the knowledge gap of probabilistic nonlinear finite element analysis of reinforced concrete structures with spatial varied corrosion and quantifies the effects of spatial variability of corrosion on the reliability of a static indeterminate reinforced concrete structure.

With racial inequality and discrimination coming to the front in society, also an interest in dealing with race and race-related issues in parenting arises. A colour blind view is endorsed by Dutch white people in general and as a consequence, a colour blind approach in parenting is popular. A colour blind approach in parenting means that parents avoid talking about race and race related issues. However, children already start developing race-related beliefs and behaviour from a young age (9 months), this is referred to as the ethnic-racial socialization process.<br/><br/>The aim of this project was to come up with interaction principles / a guideline for parents to talk about a complex and sensitive life/societal topic like race and race-related issues. For parents to adopt a colour conscious approach in parenting; talking openly about race and race-related issues and take into account own biases.<br/><br/>To start the project, a literature study was conducted. Negative effects of a colour blind approach were identified as well as the reasons why parents adopt a colour blind approach. Next to that, strategies in order to act colour conscious were identified through literature study based on experiences from parents identified as colour conscious. Also, the advice of experts were combined in a guideline on how to talk about race and race-related issues with young children in an age appropriate way. From the age of 7 a more sophisticated understanding of race and ethnicity develops and more serious topics can be discussed. The cognitive, emotional and social development of children in the age category 8-12 was investigated. <br/><br/>A Concept mapping session was performed with three parents, to understand their behaviours, motives, values and needs. The session gave insights in parents drivers and barriers, strategies they use and their view on colour conscious strategies and the family context. From these insights two personas were made, both needing different triggers in order to establish a conversation about race and race-related issues. From the user research and the literature study, envisioned interaction qualities and criteria were made to use in the design.<br/><br/>Ideas were generated in different design directions. It was chosen to design for the direct interaction between parent and child in the conversation. Several brainstorm sessions were done with design students to come up with inspiration. After this, explorations were done exploring the interplay of three main elements in the design: (1) the issue to address (2) the design form and (3) the principles to trigger the conversation. Multiple ideas were explored in three explorations. It was a journey in finding the content of and a way to facilitate the parent to have, a colour conscious conversation. In the last exploration two families evaluated the tool as well as a game design expert and a child and adolescent psychiatrist. <br/><br/>The final design SPECTRUM is a conversation game that consists out of stories including social interaction where parent and child go through in a playful way. Being triggered and engaged by the stories challenges both the parent and the child to think from a broad spectrum; thinking in different perspectives by taking into account possible experiences, feelings, intentions, context, etc. Each story adresses another theme addressing race and race-related issues. <br/><br/>To evaluate the game a prototype was made. The whole game experience was provided and three stories were worked out. This prototype was evaluated with three participating families. It evaluated on (1) the impact of the conversation, (2) the experience and (3) the usability. After the evaluation limitations of the project and recommendations for future research and development were addressed.","colour conscious approach; race; race-related issues; parenting; conversation game; perspectives","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

A quantitative analysis is performed to analyze how much improvement in the current planetary ephemerides can be achieved if highly accurate laser ranging observation were to be introduced in the current planetary ephemerides generation processes. The thesis achieved this by developing an ephemerides generation model using TU Delft's Astrodynamic Toolkit (i.e TUDAT) in which planetary ephemerides are generated for two cases. Once using simulated laser ranging observations to Mars between 2020 and 2023 and once without utilizing laser ranging observations. By comparing the estimated planetary ephemerides of the two cases, it is concluded that laser ranging to Mars resulted in a more stable and close to a factor of two improvement in ephemerides uncertainty for most of planets. The ephemerides of the Mars itself sees nearly a factor of ten improvement in uncertainty which resulted in a significant improvement in the knowledge of asteroid masses. The estimated mass parameter of 11 of the most perturbing asteroids in the solar system see more than a factor of ten improvement in their uncertainty which is unprecedented. Laser ranging to Mars and its cascade effect on the orbit of Mercury resulted in providing better constraints on PPN parameter γ and Sun's oblateness parameter J<sub>2</sub> allowing γ to be determined with an uncertainty of 5.5 x 10<sup>-8</sup> which is 3 order of magnitude better than the constraints provided from Cassini experiment. An order of magnitude improvement is also observed is Sun's J<sub>2</sub> parameter estimating it to an uncertainty level of 2.0 x 10<sup>-9</sup>.","Laser Ranging; Planetary Epehemerides; orbit determination","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

The proposed method differs from the conventional approach by using thermal measurements to decouple the resistance estimation from the rest of the estimation. Conventional approaches use the voltage and current measurements to estimate all parameters at once. However the resistance estimation was often found to be unreliable and noisy due to the low-contribution in the voltage-equations. A recursive least-squares filter approach in combination with the discrete-time dynamic voltage-equations was adopted. In this way the estimator was valid in both transient and steady-state operation while providing a robust estimation over the entire operating range.<br/>The proposed estimator was validated both using simulations and experimentally. A sensitivity analysis showed the proposed estimation approach is more robust against rotor-position error leading to smaller errors in the estimation. In the experimental validation the proposed estimator showed reliable estimation over the entire operating-range of the PMSM whereas for the conventional method the unreliable resistance, caused estimation error on the other parameters. The proposed method can be adopted for online maximum-torque-per-ampere control and adaptive-torque-control in an EV-powertrain.","Parameter Estimation; PMSM; EV-powertrain","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-08-22","","","","","",""

The goal is to establish the feasibility of the Flying V as a structural concept. In order to do this a structural model of the Flying V has been created, as well as the design and structural model of a conventional reference aircraft. This paper will cover every step required to design and analyze both models, while at the same time making sure that both models can be compared to each other. By implementing a chain of 6 software packages both models started at parametric conceptual design and were developed to the point where they have been analyzed using the finite element method to obtain the (FEM) structural mass. Chapter 2 gives an overview of the entire process. Both the set-up of the thesis and its process flow are discussed here, as well as a detailed goal statement. In Chapter 3 the design mission was established. In addition, the design requirements are mentioned as well. Both the requirements and mission are the same for both aircraft. Chapter 4 describes conceptual design of the reference aircraft. Herein the used assumptions were stated and explained, and the resulting graphical and parametric model was shared. Chapter 5 does the same for the Flying V. Chapter 6 explains how the graphical models were appended in order to obtain a full three dimensional model, ready for the analysis. It was explained how ZORRO-X was applied to do this, and manual corrections were discussed as well. The loading of the models is described in Chapter 7, it describes how ODILILA was implemented to obtain the different aerodynamic loads. Ground loads and mass distributions were obtained in this chapter as well. From this, the initial C.G. ranges were established. Load cases were build up by combining aero, mass and ground loads. In total 22 load cases were used during the sizing optimization. The FEM optimization was initiated in Chapter 8. This was done by mapping the aforementioned loads and setting the design criteria and constraints. Finally, the results are summarized in Chapter 9. The results include the analysis of critical load cases, critical design constraint, thicknesses and displacements of both the Flying V and the reference aircraft. It was found that while the Flying V still has some structural problems at the kink and nose-fuselage intersection, the overall FEM mass of the Flying V is still lighter than that of the conventional reference aircraft. It is expected that the proposed solutions for the structural problems will not influence the mass to such an extent that this is no longer the case. Therefore, the conclusion, stated in Chapter 10, is that the Flying V is indeed a viable structural concept. Based on current results it is expected that after further development proposed in Chapter 11, the Flying V might even prove not only viable but even desirable compared to conventional aircraft.<br","structural analysis; Structural Concept; FEM analysis; Flying V","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-02-01","","","","Aerospace Engineering | Flight Performance and Propulsion","",""

Conventional gait rehabilitation often includes unloading a portion of the user’s weight with a vertical force. This vertical force enables people to practice stepping but makes forward propulsion more difficult. Users will adopt a compensatory movement strategy during rehabilitation that may not completely transfer to unsupported walking. It is hypothesized that including a small forward force during vertical unloading makes gait rehabilitation more similar to unsupported locomotion.<br/>This thesis presents and investigates a novel patent of a device that passively generates a forward to propel the user forward. The forward force is generated using the vertical oscillations that naturally occur during gait. This thesis quantifies the forward force, simulates the impact on human gait and details the construction of a prototype. The prototype is then used to validate the simulations of the device.<br/>Analysis indicates that the ratio between the sprocket radius and the wheel radius is the key parameter for determining the amount of forward force. Simulations in which the device is coupled with the spring-loaded inverted pendulum model indicate that the device may generally deteriorate the walking velocity, step size and maximum height difference. Experiments with the prototype indicate that friction has a big effect on the functionality of the device, and that predictions from the simulation may be quantitatively off. The device may have a favorable interaction with the neurological control strategy of human gait, which was not modeled. Human trials will have to give a definite answer.","Body weight support; Rehabilitation; Simulation; Prototyping; Passive; Gait","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-08-21","","","","","",""

Molecular dynamics is discussed using parameters such as dielectric relaxation time (τHN and τ0), transition temperature (Tv and Tx), and activation energy (Ea).<br/><br/>It is found from this project that when monomers are confined within the nanopores of the metal oxide layers, a fraction of them are adsorbed on to the pore wall. This adsorption leads to the formation of a new material morphology that has a relatively high restriction to molecular dynamics.

In this case, sample production methods and nanopore topologies have little influence on molecular dynamics.<br/><br/>From this thesis, it can be seen that BDS shows promising potential to be used to study the molecular dynamics of confined monomers and polymers.

Failure due to<br/>wave overtopping is not fully understood from a physical point of view. Existing knowledge gaps, processes that are not yet explained by physics or not even discovered, are<br/>explained by empirical relations. The fact that knowledge on the relevant processes for overtopping load and soil resistance is fragmented and limited, causes limited application of it in practice.<br/>To improve the understanding of failure caused by overtopping, a model that computes the soil stresses (soil stress is related to failure) in a dike cover, during overtopping load, is developed. It is possible that this model approach leads to additional knowledge on wave overtopping, e.g. new failure mechanisms or shift in normative mechanisms.<br/><br/>It is shown that overtopping has a large variety of appearances and so does failure due to overtopping. Literature study shows the large number of processes and characteristics, all with variable magnitude, that is relevant in the wave load and the soil strength during wave overtopping. Main wave load processes are shear stress (gradients), turbulence and impact. The considered soil strength process is the ratio between the stress (relative to the strength), for which the Young’s Modulus, Poisson’s ratio, soil weight, hydraulic conductivity and the subsoil stiffness are shown to be the main soil characteristics.<br/><br/>The developed model, a numerical 2D model with the model domain oriented parallel to the flow direction, computes the stress distribution and development in a loaded soil. For this case it is focused on dike land side slopes loaded by overtopping waves in particular, that is on dealing with clay, saturated conditions, fast varying load and a sloped surface. Stress equations in the model are derived, based on equilibrium of forces (horizontal and vertical) and motionless soil. The model is able to indicate initiation of failure for failure mechanisms that are associated with soil stresses, e.g. lifting of soil and head cut erosion. Soil in the model is loaded by normal and shear stress. The latter is, deviant from conventional methods, modelled as a shear stress gradient.<br/><br/>Test runs for verification and validation show that the model gives good results for cases with constant loads. Comparison of load cases with non-continuous overtopping wave loads shows both similarities and differences in the resulting soil stress. The most outstanding difference is the magnitude of the stress at depth. The differences indicate<br/>starting points for further research. <br/>Model employment demonstrates the future possibilities. A single wave load, computed by the model itself, is modelled. This run gives, at first view, plausible results.<br/><br/>The current model gives a reasonable representation of soil stress development. Further development is recommended to make the model useful for dike assessment and design. To do so, the model should be improved by probabilistic parameter definition, addition of soil stress damping and considering the impulsive nature and turbulent oscillations of wave load. Furthermore, it can be extended by the comparison between soil stress and strength, addition of spatial variability of the soil, enabling computations of non-planar parts of the slope and enabling the connection with other hydrodynamical models.","soil stress model; surface boundary condition; numerical model; small scale failure; conservation laws; stress gradient; dike assessment; dike design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

They do so by providing the OPRA (Osseointegrated prosthesis for the Rehabilitation of Amputees), bone-anchored implant systems for prosthetic attachment: a prosthesis can be mounted on a percutaneous abutment (‘pin’) coming from the residual limb. One of the latest developments of Integrum is the e-OPRA system, the enhanced-OPRA. The e-OPRA has implanted electrodes embedded in the bone anchored implant for the neural control of a myoelectric prosthesis. With the addition of the electronics, the requirements for the attachment of the prosthesis have changed: Along with the prosthesis being attached to the abutment, the electronics in the implant must be connected to the controller in the prosthesis. The connector in the abutment and the connector on the prosthesis side fit in only one way and must be aligned before they are connected. Misalignment can cause damage to the connectors and failure in the control of the prosthesis. The conventional OPRA attachment device is not sufficient for these changes. That is why the e-AD, the enhanced attachment device, is introduced. <br/><br/>The e-AD consist of an adapter mounted on the abutment, and a base and shaft mounted on the prosthesis. To attach the prosthesis, the abutment with adapter is inserted into the shaft. The alignment is ensured between the abutment and the base and the connection is ensured between the adapter and the shaft. The connection is made by a Bal Seal Canted Coil spring ®, according to the Lock and Quick Release (LQR®) principle: The adapter has two grooves on its outer surface and the shaft houses a Bal Seal Canted Coil spring ®. When the abutment with adapter is inserted into the shaft, the spring will lock in the first groove of the adapter and the abutment cannot be pulled out or pushed further. In this position, the prosthesis can be used in daily life. When wanting to detach the prosthesis, the user can rotate the shaft, unlocking it, and then pull it up. The spring will then snap into the second groove of the adapter, the spring is re-oriented and ‘relaxes’. The abutment can be lifted out of the prosthesis. <br","Osseointegration; Prosthesis; Attachment; Transhumeral","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","Integrated Product Design | Medisign","",""

This thesis focuses on the reduction of generator running hours and fuel consumption of Dynamically Positioned (DP) vessels. In this ship type, redundancy of the power generation system is regularly achieved by running on one generator more than strictly necessary in every engine room. Thereby, these vessels make superfluous running hours and unnecessary fuel consumption. Previous research in this field focused on installing a hybrid system in every separate engine room to replace this redundant running generator and achieve the power generation redundancy by a battery which is temporarily used in case of a generator failure. Since DP vessels normally operate on two separate engine rooms for safety, this results in two separate hybrid systems, i.e. a double-battery hybrid system. To reduce investment costs of a hybrid DP vessel, this thesis concentrates on finding a power management strategy that allows a single hybrid system to be installed on board, which is only connected to one of the engine room grids in case of a generator failure. A single-battery hybrid system cannot be connected to both engine room grids continuously -in contrary to the double-battery hybrid system- because this would cancel the independence of the separate engine rooms. Therefore, in the single-battery hybrid system, no back up power is present in case of an increase in power demand in one of the engine rooms. In present DP vessels, this back up power is supplied by the redundant generator. When using a double-battery hybrid system, this back up power is supplied by the continuously connected hybrid system. Therefore, for a single-battery hybrid system, the starting control decision algorithm of the power management system (PMS) should decide on starting an additional generator prior to a rise of the power demand.<br/><br/>Two methods for this starting decision algorithm were tested. Firstly, a mathematical-statistical method using a mathematical model for DP load forecasting and a statistical model for pipe laying load forecasting was tested. This model was found not to work properly. Secondly, a multiple linear regression model that predicts the height of power peaks based on environmental parameters like wind and waves was tested which was found to work appropriately. To assess the feasibility of using either a double-battery hybrid system in combination with a simple starting decision algorithm, or a single-battery hybrid system in combination with a smart starting decision algorithm, these two hybrid system options were compared to the current situation that uses a redundant generator in every engine room. These three system options were compared in terms of investment costs, fuel consumption, generator running hours, planned maintenance costs, and reliability. For this comparison, the DP pipelaying vessel Pioneering Spirit was used as a case vessel. To find the investment costs, a hybrid system was designed for this purpose. To find the fuel consumption, generator running hours, and planned maintenance costs, full year time domain simulations of the hybrid systems in operation were performed using measured power demand data from the case vessel during pipelaying. For this analysis, a mathematical model of the power generation system was used. The reliability assessment of the different systems was performed using fault tree analysis.<br/><br/>The single- and double-battery hybrid systems both show a significant fuel consumption reduction of 8.4 and 9.0% respectively. When also taking into account the investment costs, generator maintenance cost reduction, and battery depreciation, the payback time of these hybrid systems is 0.9 and 1.7 years respectively. The difference in payback time is mainly caused by the difference in investment costs between the single- and the double-battery hybrid system. <br/><br/>For a single-battery hybrid system for DP vessels, a multiple linear regression model based starting decision algorithm works appropriately. However, although the multiple linear regression model based starting decision algorithm was tested positively in simulations using the available power data, in case of an unforeseen power peak that was not related to one of the input parameters of the regression model, the power generation system lacks back up power. Therefore, the reliability of the single-battery hybrid system is insufficient when using it for DP applications. Especially when taking into account the minor absolute difference in payback time, for the replacement of the redundant generators in DP vessels, the robust and simple double-battery hybrid system is preferred over the small and smart single-battery hybrid system.","power management system; multiple linear regression; Dynamic Positioning; Energy Storage; spinning reserve; short term load forecasting","en","master thesis","","","","","","SDPO.18.026.m","","2023-08-01","","","","Marine Technology | Marine Engineering","",""

The computational time of the model was to be kept as low as possible so that the model could be used for quick estimations and optimizations of the process. This was done by using a simple geometry focusing on the volume curve and port sizes, that can easily be changed by scaling the process as needed. The whole model was done in Matlab, with thermodynamic properties of the ammonia water mixture implemented by Rattner and Garimella. The model was validated by comparing general trends seen in oil free twin screw compressors using different working fluids.<br/>The quick computational time allows for many different features to be examined in a short time to get a general idea of how the compressor would react to them. While using models with more detailed geometries one test can take hours compared to minutes with the model of this study. From the model search it was concluded that for this level of model a finite volume method would be the best option for this study. Various methods were explored to solve the governing equations, counting a few integrated solvers in Matlab and some numerical procedures for ODEs. The method that was chosen as the best for this system was the Euler method. All methods had in common was that the step size needed to be very small, for smaller geometries they needed to be even smaller in some sections of the compressor. To account for that the model was adjusted to accept variable steps. The variable steps allowed for smaller steps around the beginning and end of compression and thus lowering computational time. The main output of the model is the efficiency of the compressor and the Coefficient Of Performance (COP) of the cycle.<br/>The model was tested for various operating conditions to determine how it, and the compressor, would respond. The main result is that the vapor quality should be kept rather low, around 40%, to achieve the highest efficiencies. The performance is also better with higher rotational speeds, however higher speeds also mean more mas flow through the whole system and increased mechanical losses. This means that up to a certain point the rotational speed can be increased until it starts decreasing the efficiency. The ideal ammonia concentration is around 33-35wt%, at higher or lower values the coefficient of performance decreases. <br/>As some preliminary work for future experiments the experimental cycle was set up using pumps and heat exchangers to simulate the compressor. This included verifying the calibrations of sensors, confirming that correct data was read from sensor to LabView and getting the system leakproof. This cycle was also implemented in Matlab to be tested. From those tests the conclusion is that after going through the separator and the vapor and liquid streams being mixed back together the temperature decreases around 60 degrees usually, with a small increase in vapor quality around 2-3%.<br/><br","compressor; prototype; wet compression; twin screw; model; thermodynamics; twin screw compressor; ammonia; water; ammonia water","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-08-21","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

We present an energy-based control strategy augmented with a visual servoing algorithm to improve the image quality online. An impedance controller is extended with energy- and power-based safety metrics to adjust the dynamic behavior of the robot and with energy tanks to ensure passivity. The quality of the ultrasound images is represented by a confidence map that is computed online, following a model of ultrasound propagation in soft tissue. Experiments were conducted with the 7 degree-of-freedom KUKA LBRMed articulated robot. First, a port-Hamiltonian model of the robotwas created to design and test the controller in simulation. Second, the controllerwas transferred to the robot controller for experimental validation of the proposed control strategy. Simulational and experimental results have validated the controller design in interaction with the environment. Experiments with an ultrasound phantom have demonstrated that the visual servoing algorithm corrects the probe pose in case of (partial) contact loss between the transducer and the skin surface. This significantly increases the global image quality of the 3D image of the breast.

Firstly, knowledge was gained on double ended ferry design, double ended ferry operations, zero-emission energy systems and the early design stage. Research into zero-emission energy systems resulted in lithium-ion battery energy systems, hydrogen fuel cells energy systems and supercapacitor energy systems being identified as likely feasible energy systems for double ended ferries. In the second step, the knowledge was used to create the concept exploration model. This model consists of a set of algorithms that determines technical and economical parameters of double ended ferry concepts for each of the identified zero-emission energy types, for a provided transportation need. The model also does this for a diesel-electric energy system, that serves as a benchmark. Equal economical comparison of the concepts is aided by providing the net present value of the investment in the energy system, for each concept. In the third step, the model is transformed into the concept exploration tool, through implementation in the Python programming language. This step also includes obtaining results from the concept exploration tool.<br/><br/>One use of the concept exploration tool is by shipyards, in their early design process. The tool can provide naval architects with insights into which zero-emission energy systems are possible for a provided transportation need, as well as the characteristics of the corresponding concept designs.<br/><br/>A second use for the concept exploration tool is the analysis of large amounts of input. This can provide insights into how design input parameters influence the concept designs and the preferences for certain energy system types. This was done by performing a parameter variation study. The results of analysing the obtained data are expressed through 24 conclusions. These are divided into four sets, per party for which the conclusions are expected to be of the highest interest. These are Energy System Suppliers, Governments, Ferry Operators and Shipyards.<br/><br/>The most important conclusion of this thesis is that zero-emission energy systems are technically feasible and can be cost competitive with diesel-electric energy systems. This to such an extent, that they should be seriously considered for every double ended ferry. Based on the net present value of the energy systems over the vessel lifetime, battery energy systems are most frequently cost-competitive with diesel-electric systems. Hydrogen energy systems are only competitive in highly specific cases and mostly too expensive to be cost competitive with diesel systems. Supercapacitor energy systems are cost competitive when upward of 30 daily trips are sailed, over short distances.<br","Zero-emission; Double ended ferries; Ferries; Concept exploration; Supercapacitor; Lithium-Ion; Hydrogen; Fuel Cell","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-08-21","","","","Marine Technology | Ship Design, Production and Operations","",""

Efficient operation of Open Recirculating Cooling Water Systems (ORCWS) relies on controlled cooling water conditioning programs that prevent corrosion, fouling, scaling and microbial growth. Water intensive industries feel greater pressure to decrease their water demand as water resources become increasingly stressed and discharge restrictions become more stringent. Soft alkaline cooling water (SACW) might be a good alternative for the conventional water and chemicals intensive ORCWS operation. However, this type of water requires complete reevaluation of the conditioning programs. Therefore, this research focused on the corrosion processes in SACW and a beginning was made in evaluating non-toxic and phosphorus-free corrosion inhibitors.<br/><br/>The research comprised the production of synthetic cooling water (SCW) and the evaluation of corrosion of mild steel in this type of water, with and without inhibitors. The selected corrosion inhibitors were NovoTraqua® without phosphorus (NT0) and sodium silicate (Si200). PHREEQC simulation were used to validate the SCW composition. A desk study was carried out to evaluate the applicability of corrosion indices. The average corrosion rate and inhibition efficiency were determined by mass loss tests of mild steel specimens with an immersion time of up to 4 weeks. The development of passivity was followed by open circuit potential (OCP) measurements. The pitting susceptibility was tested using cyclic potentiodynamic anodic polarization (CPP) measurements. 3D digital microscopy, SEM/EDS and XRD were used to evaluate the surface morphology and the composition of the top layer. <br/><br/>The addition of NT0 or Si200 to the SCW resulted in the inhibition of uniform corrosion but no complete protection against localized corrosion was realized. Si200 was the best performing inhibitor, also for inhibiting crevice corrosion. The immersion of mild steel in SCW resulted in natural passivation by the formation of a Fe2O3 oxide layer. The SCW did not have the ability to immediately repassivate the specimens after localized breakdown of the protecting passivating layer. The addition of NT0 or Si200 reduced the aggressiveness of the environments at the pits but did not accomplish complete repassivation. <br/><br/>Lab experiments with SCW can provide initial insights in the behavior of mild steel and can contribute to the decision making in more cost intensive research on alternative operation of ORCWS. Better understanding of the protection mechanisms would be obtained when more advanced techniques like Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) and Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) are used. Although cooling water corrosion inhibition by means of silica is a mature research topic, it is recommended to proceed with research on silica as a corrosion inhibitor in the specific conditions of SACW. <br","cooling water; corrosion; cyclic potentiodynamic polarisation; mass loss","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Water Management | Sanitary Engineering","",""

Since open heat networks are a novel phenomenon, challenges arise that relate to the organisation of this market, how heat should be priced and more specifically how to deal with the unique characteristics of transmission losses with heat. In this thesis, evaluate several conventional pricing mechanisms are evaluated and an alternative pricing mechanism including a transmission loss allocation method is developed by means of an algorithm, to investigate if it improves the market performance. This alternative pricing mechanism succeeds in allocating the transmission losses to loads on the basis of fairness, but overall fails to improve the wholesale market performance compared to other pricing mechanisms. The allocation method can be improved, depending on the desirable market outcomes, by adapting several assumptions and procedures in the algorithm.","open heat networks; transmission loss allocation; district heating; pricing mechanisms; locational hybrid pricing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

However, the new feature is that this fluidised bed will be heated indirectly using radiant tube heaters installed in the reactor. These heaters are made by assembling radiant tubes with self-recuperative burners fired using Dutch Natural Gas. All tubes and burners have been manufactured by the German company WS Warmeprozesstechnik GmbH. This thesis consists of the study of two such distinct burner-tube assemblies, both of different heating capacity. The smaller capacity is of the C80 burner assembled with C100 tube while the larger is of the C100 burner assembled with C150 tube. The heat transfer and fluid dynamics inside both the tubes have been numerically modelled using CFD techniques. The models of the burners have been done using the commercially available software ANSYS Fluent version 18.2.<br/>The main objective of this thesis has been to analyse the heat transfer from both the assemblies and calculation of their respective efficiency. To this end, the temperature, velocity, species and turbulence fields have been calculated for inside both the tubes. Also, the total heat output from the radiant tubes has been calculated. However, the mechanism of heat transfer from the radiant tube to the fluidised bed was not known at the time of these calculations. Hence, appropriate boundary conditions have been used to simulate the outer environment. The total heat transfer from the combusting flow to the inner surface of the radiant tube has been calculated. This total heat input has been equated to the heat transfer from the outer surface of the tube to the fluidised bed, assuming steady state condition. The variation of all these parameters has been studied with air factor and preheat temperature. The air factor has been varied from 1.0 to 1.5 for both tubes, by reducing the fuel inlet keeping the air inlet constant. The air preheat temperature has been varied from 300 C to 700 C for C80-C100 assembly and from 300 C to 800 C for C100-C150 assembly. This has been done to calculate an optimum operating condition for both the burner-tube assemblies in terms of maximising heat transfer and radiant tube efficiency and minimising fuel wastage. It has been found that operating at lean condition of 20% excess air by mass at highest air preheat temperature would be the optimum operating condition.<br/>The last part of this thesis is the analysis of the robustness of calculations. Three grid sizes have been chosen other than the main grid and all the parameters have been checked for variations, if any. The variation is found to be within scientifically acceptable limits. Hence, it is concluded that the calculations are robust at this level.","Radiant tube heater; Heat transfer; Fluid dynamics; Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD); Efficiency; Radiative transfer; Radiant tube burner; Radiant tube","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

The presence of granular contacts gives this type of material a relatively low stiffness and provides hysteretic energy losses. These features make unconsolidated granulates suitable for railway ballast as it provides dissipation of vibrational energy from passing trains which is important to minimise vibrational disturbance. However, simulating the response of the railway superstructure under dynamic loads becomes difficult due to then onlinearity of the ballast. In order to develop better prediction tools, the elastic behaviour of unconsolidated rocks is first investigated experimentally by quasi-static and dynamic stress-strain experiments yielding the Young's modulus, nonlinear resonance shift and analysis of harmonic generation. In addition, the transmission of structural waves through granulates is investigated by assessing the transfer function for different thicknesses of granulates, different<br/>particle sizes and different materials with varying viscous damping. Three granulates are used, small-scale ballast, a gravel, and two sizes of uniform steel spheres. All three materials exhibit a combination of classical and hysteretic nonlinearity where the strain depends on the stress amplitude and history.<br/><br/>A completely new finite element approach is taken to model the hysteretic nonlinearity, based on an existing phenomenological static model. Multiple spring-slider elements with gaps are used, as opposed to implementing a homogenised material model. It is shown that only 50 elements can reproduce the hysteretic nature of the material, which is a significant advantage to a traditional material model requiring the discretisation of the entire ballast volume. Each spring-slider element is parameterised by two springs constants, a yield force and an initial gap. A distribution of these parameters across the 50 elements is found that reproduces the quasi-static stress cycles acquired experimentally. In addition, a parametric study of the model parameters during dynamic excitation reveals that key indicators of nonlinearity can be simulated. The finite element simulations prove that using a set of spring-slider elements<br/>to model the behaviour of unconsolidated granulates is viable method. With experimental tests performed on true ballast and further work on the finite element model to understand optimal parameter distributions, a more accurate and efficient railway superstructure model can be produced.","geophysics; FEM; granulates","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Geophysics | IDEA League","",""

Nonetheless, it is not always easy to pinpoint, arrange and reuse such knowledge in an effective and productive manner. Moreover, in the last two decades companies have been increasingly using serious games and simulations for the most diverse scopes. While a consequent interest has been growing in the field of knowledge management regarding how to codify and reuse the information generated by these new innovative tools, there is still no clear understanding of what are the games' requirements which are responsible for the generation of knowledge. In addition to this, many theories can be identified in the available literature which developed methods and models for knowledge conversion and sharing; however, none of this models has yet been applied to the context of serious games and simulations. <br/>As a consequence of this recognized gap in the available literature, as well as of the need for organizations to develop a series of knowledge management systems and practices for the sharing and reusing of knowledge generate through games, this thesis research aims at understanding what are the necessary requirements for games to foster the development, as well as the reuse, of tacit knowledge.<br/><br/>Primary scope of this thesis project has thus been to determine what games' elements represent a fundamental requirement for the generation of both explicit knowledge and tacit skills. In addition to this, the research has taken into consideration different groups of actors (game designers, participants/players, project team members, managers), and attempted to verify whether any dissimilarities exist among these groups in the way of perceiving games' requirements, and their impact on knowledge creation and sharing. Finally, in the light of the obtained results, suggestions have been proposed on the most appropriate knowledge management systems and procedure to use in the context of serious games and simulations. <br/><br/>The research has been carried out in the form of an embedded, single-case study: the main unit of analysis - and client - was ProRail, the government organization which manages the maintenance and extensions of the national railway network infrastructure, the allocation of rail capacity, and the traffic control. The embedded units of analysis were instead represented by different games employed within the organization (OV-SAAL, Ketensimulatie, ERTMS). Once the games have been identified, other research methods have been applied within the case study framework, in particular: semi-structured interviews and Q-sorting. <br/><br/>Concluding this dissertation report, recommendations for ProRail - the customer of this thesis project - have been outlined, by combining the obtained insights with theories from available literature. The scope has been to define suggestions for a knowledge management framework for serious games and simulations. The suggested framework, result of the joint efforts of different TU Delft researchers and ProRail's employees, is presented in the second-last chapter of this dissertation in the form of a set of recommendations for ProRail.","Serious games; knowledge management; knowledge management framework; Tacit knowledge; Q-sorting; Simulations; railway; knowledge management system","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

By constructing these dams the Grevelingen was separated from the North Sea, which created the largest salt water lake in Europe. Several decades later it was discovered that during hot summers the deeper areas of the lake were leaking oxygen. This leads to a massive mortality of the fauna and flora living in these depths. Since this area is spreading to the shallow areas it was decided by Rijkswaterstaat to bring back a reduced tide into the Grevelingen lake. <br/>The idea is to bring this reduced tide back by constructing a sluice caisson or tidal power plant into the Brouwersdam. This tidal range was determined in a way that the fauna and flora on the islands could remain. Another problem that arises with this reduced tide is that it is unknown what the consequences are for the harbours around the Grevelingen lake and their structures. Brouwershaven specifically gets its income from the harbour and its tourism. This made the Gemeente Schouwen-Duiveland ask to investigate the consequences of a potential reduced tide in its harbour. This led to the following research question:’ Is there a necessity to adapt the harbour constructions in the harbour of Brouwershaven, or to secure them against the reduced tide in the Grevelingen lake?’.<br/>This research was started by investigating the different boundary conditions such as:<br/>• Wind 1,54 m/s Southwest<br/>• Occurring water levels +0,7 m NAP and -0,5 m NAP<br/>• Not exploded explosives Not taken into account<br/>• Soil structure Exists mainly of clay and peat, with a thick sand layer at -16 m NAP<br/>• Profile of the harbour bottom Design level of the harbour bottom at -2,75 m NAP<br/>• Shipping Limiting factors: ship draught of 2 m and length of 14 m<br/>• Flow rate through the guard lock In case of tidal power plant: 0,154 m/s In case of sluice caisson: 0,0719 m/s<br/>The new part of the harbour was designed after the closure of the Grevelingen. This is why the option was to check the stability of the structure in this part of harbour. At the end of the calculation it turned out that there was no danger for the structures to become unstable by the reduced tide. However, there is a statistical probability that the scaffoldings as well as the quay wall will be flooded once in a hundred years. The bigger problem that was found was the accessibility of the harbour. The harbour is now only accessible for ships with a draught of 2 m at a water depth of 2,5 m. Which at a lower water level would cause problems to safely enter and manoeuvre in the harbour.<br/>In the search for a solution a brainstorm session was held with the construction company ‘Aquavia’. With the help of a multi criteria analysis (MCA) it was found that the best solutions were:<br/>• Construction a new harbour in front of the guard lock<br/>• Creating a new function for the existing harbour and shifting the harbour function to a new location in front of the guard lock<br/>• Demolition of the sills in the guard lock and dredging the harbour to a deeper level<br/>In consultation with ‘Gemeente Schouwen-Duiveland’ it was decided to design the first and the last bullet in more detail.<br/>The first variant that was dealt with was that of the demolition of the sills in the guard lock and the dredging of the harbour. The idea here was to lower the bottom of the harbour and the guard lock to at least a level of -2,75 m NAP, which produces a volume of 5143 m3¬ of material such as silt to be dredged away. Which includes the possibility of:<br/>• Finding not exploded explosives<br/>• The quay walls of the oldest part of the harbour becoming unstable.<br/>Also the stability of the guard lock construction after removing the sills had to be checked. This unfortunately was not executed due to the lack of technical data and drawings of the reinforcement. Finally an estimation of 300.000 EUR was made to realise this variant.<br/>The idea for the second variant is to leave the harbour behind the guard lock in the state it is currently in and to construct a new harbour in front of the guard lock. In this way smaller ships can still use the old harbour whereas the ships that cannot enter the harbour anymore can moor in the new harbour as well as even larger ships. In this new harbour then there would also be a place to moor the fishing boats as well as a river cruise ship. Because of strict time scheduling it was decided to only design one of the important structures of the harbour, namely the harbour mole. For this design there were 2 variants to take into account. In the first variant the total mole construction (breakwater + the pier) was made of wood, whereas in the second variant only part of the breakwater was made of wood. The pier, however, was made of concrete. Finally it was estimated that the construction of the new harbour would cost 7 million EUR. Which is a big difference compared to the price estimation of the demolition of the sills in the guard lock. Both variants have their pros and cons. By demolishing the sills and dredging the harbour to a lower level the problem of the harbour is resolved while a smaller/ more optimised version of the other variant could enable more future prospects to be worked out for the harbour by increasing the capacity and attracting new functions to the harbour. This could of course increase the harbour profits.<br","Grevelingen lake; Brouwershaven","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","","51.728725, 3.913595"

These parameters can be set through a graphical user interface (GUI). When the output signal is nulled by changing the amplitude of the excitation signal, the unknown capacitor value can be calculated. A simple test impedance bridge has been fabricated to measure a fixed impedance value of the capacitor sensor using the LIA measurement approach. The obtained results (capacitance and resistance values) are in good agreement with what we obtained using an alternative approach (AH2700A, is an ultra-precision capacitance bridge with 0.16ppm resolution at 1000Hz).

In the past decades the shore protections did gently shift to concrete element protections. An example of an often applied concrete armour unit is the Xbloc. This element is quite strong and well investigated. BAM Infraconsult has developed a uniformly placed armor unit, the XblocPlus. The new XblocPlus is placed in a regular pattern, which is easier for contractors to construct. A design detail of a XblocPlus armor layer which still needs some attention is the transition from the slope to the crest. The elements are placed in horizontal rows, locked in place by two elements in the row above and two elements in the row below. However, the upper element is not supported by any element above it, leading to less interlocking. This study focusses on the physical processes which lead to (in)stability of the upper element and tries to increase this stability.<br/><br/>First, physical laboratory tests were performed with the main aim to visually observe the failure methods of the upper XblocPlus element. After the initial tests, a computational fluid dynamic model was built with the aim to get a better insight in the load distribution on a single XblocPlus element under wave impact. <br/><br/>To increase the stability of the element as much as possible, several increments to the stability of the upper element are proposed. The first method which increases the stability of the element is to cover the back of the element with rock, this changes the rotation point of the element backwards which increases the wave load required to initiate rocking. A second possibility is to face the top of the upper element downward, this does decrease the drag on the element. A third possibility is to face the top of the upper element upward, this leads to a higher drag on the upper element. However, this orientation makes it possible to bury the element in a rock backfill, increasing the weight of the element.<br/><br/>This thesis did slightly research the applicability of CFD models to concrete armor design. The main conclusion for this trial is that it is possible to apply numerical models for the design of breakwaters, however physical model tests are still required to validate the obtained data from the numerical model, since the flow around a coastal structure is that complex, it only estimates the loads in the right order of magnitude when not validated. The validity of the model can be increased by calibrating the soil parameters using measured pressures in the different layers of the breakwater. To increase the accuracy of a numerical model, one could construct a three dimensional structure, which requires much computational grid cells, making the computational demand of the system quite high. <br/><br/><br","XblocPlus; OpenFOAM; Crest; Breakwater","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Demand of these resources will increase as global population increases. By 2050 it is expected that combination of population growth and economic development will lead to 50% increase of global water and food demand, while energy demand will be doubled. Addressing sustainable water, energy, and food consumption has also been emphasized in United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals; among others, this applies to consumption at household level. Sustainable household consumption of water, energy, and food here implies not only the objective to improve the resource durability, but also to reduce environmental footprint. The unsustainable management of these resources will potentially harm the climate objective addressed in the Paris Agreement in which The Netherlands, among other countries, have been participating.<br/><br/>Acknowledging the importance of household consumption on the environment, a joint research team funded by the National Science Foundation named INFEWS (Innovations at the Nexus of Food, Energy, and Water Systems) is commissioning this research project to investigate policy measures to sustainably reduce greenhouse gas emission concerning Dutch household food, energy, and water consumption sector. The main objective of this research is to obtain insight on the dynamics and interrelations of Dutch household water, energy, and food consumption; and to develop policy recommendations based on the insight toward reducing the direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) level associated with the household consumption over time in the Netherlands. <br/><br/>To achieve this objective, this research mainly utilizes data-driven exploratory modeling approach in which the interrelations of water, energy, and food consumption system are modeled and simulated over time, while acknowledging the plausible parametric and structural uncertainties natural to the state of modeled subsystems. System Dynamics methodology is used to conceptualize the causal relations among the relevant subsystems and to computationally develop the model in a form of stock-flow diagram. Based on the developed model, the Exploratory Modeling and Analysis methodology is used to explore the model within the associated uncertainties. Through these methods, two types of policy frameworks can be respectively tested and explored. The first one consists of the policy approaches within household consumption domain. The second one consists of the plausible policy options outside of the household consumption domain which are relevant to improve the GHG indicator.","System Dynamics; Exploratory Modeling; Water-Energy-Food Nexus; Households; Sustainable Consumption","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","Innovations at the Nexus of Food, Energy and Water Systems (INFEWS)",""

As the trend predicted by Moore's law is nearing its end, the focus of designing processors has shifted from high-frequency single-core systems to the medium frequency multicore system to a relatively lower frequency many-cores system, in the hope of extracting more performance while keeping power consumption in check. To satisfy a spectrum of applications, modern processors employ central processing units (CPUs) for serving a wide variety of general-purpose applications, while general purpose - graphics processor units (GP-GPUs) are used for highly parallel applications. This thesis provides an alternative, called dynamic platform, by switching between a sequential processor for serving sequential applications and parallel processor for serving parallel applications on a Zynq FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array). The first part of this thesis analyses and designs the model with suitable simulations to know the trade-offs. From the model, it is clear that towards the extreme ends of the application spectrum where either high level of parallelism exist or high level of sequential operations exist, GPU and CPU respectively outperform the dynamic platform. However, there exists a region suitable for the dynamic platform where the applications are neither too parallel nor highly sequential. To implement the model on FPGAs, suitable open-source softcores are researched and selected. ρ-VEX dual-core and Microblaze softcores are implemented for catering to sequential applications, and ρ-VEX many-core softcore is implemented for serving parallel applications. These softcores are evaluated against three benchmarks-- Image processing (parallel), CRC (sequential) and Hash (sequential). Finally, the dynamic platform analysis is done, and the results prove that on average the performance on the dynamic platform is better than considering either the sequential (ρ-VEX dual-core) or parallel (ρ-VEX manycore) platform alone. The speedup of the dynamic platform ranges from 1.45 to 2.9 (average: 1.61) with respect to sequential platform and from 1.02 to 1.60 (average: 1.44) with respect to parallel platform. In the current state of FPGA technology, the dynamic platform does not perform better than CPU and GPU on average for the considered benchmarks. The result is a fully functional open-source dynamic platform, which can switch between two (or three) architectures at run-time, depending on the application characteristic (sequential or parallel).","Dynamic Reconfiguration; Multicore Optimization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Engineering","",""

Auscultation today is usually still performed with an acoustic stethoscope, in which the cardiologist tries to recognize abnormalities concerning the patient’s heart through attentive listening. <br/><br/>The efficiency driven practices of modern healthcare have forced cardiologists and other medical professionals to become even more economical with their time. Currently, doctors only have a timeframe of 600 seconds to see a new patient. Since the stethoscope is almost always the first tool used for diagnosis, it can be seen as the first factor that determines if the patient reaches the “further testing threshold”. Therefore it is paramount for the general quality of healthcare that auscultation is performed in the best way possible, since this can determine whether further testing is done on the patient, or the patient is sent home. The relevance of this auscultation success is backed up even more by the fact that heart-disease is responsible for 45% of European annual deaths alone.<br/><br/>The problem, which is a concoction of the efficiency driven practices in healthcare combined by the neglect of auscultation in medical education and the available tools at hand, was attempted to be improved and solved by the design proposal in this report. <br/><br/>Together with doctors, a product-service system was created that makes use of Artificial Intelligence, seamless automation, improved ergonomics and feedback loops in order to facilitate the cardiologist during auscultation.<br/><br/>The design proposal aims to increase medical effectiveness and diagnostic potential, facilitating cardiologists in their auscultation responsibilities by creating a new and improved diagnostic tool in the form of an electronic stethoscope that harmonises with the efficiency of the auscultation process in an unobtrusive way; benefiting both the cardiologist and the patient.<br/><br/><br/>The main part of the design consists of a physical product in the form of an electronic stethoscope supported by a system consisting of a simple Bluetooth Forwarding Application and Desktop Application.<br/><br/>The design proposal was qualitatively evaluated with several cardiologists during a presentation at Maasstad Hospital.

The continued demand for cleaner air, especially in the inner-city, has produced multiple experiments in sustainable transport.Some of these solutions can be seen as radical innovations; however a guideline on implementing radical innovations does not exist. Innovation in the transport sector has predominantly been incremental. Radical steps in the transport regime have also been met with resistance of incumbent stakeholders. As such, the current regime needs a radical change if future goals of improving air quality should be achieved within the desired timeframe. A method to introduce radical innovation in a regime is to set-up a strategic niche, a niche that has the ultimate goal of changing the current regime. This thesis has reviewed experiments done with large electric trucks in the cities of Rotterdam and Amsterdam. These experiments both originate from the FREVUE project that strives to introduce electric freight transport in urban Europe. The main approach of this thesis has been conducting desk research on grey literature, open data from the FREVUE project, and by conducting interviews among prime stakeholders of the projects. This study finds that stakeholders possess little knowledge on Strategic Niche Management, however the three main elements in setting-up a strategic niche occur in more than one occasion in the experiments that were predominantly of a technical nature. All elements are endorsed by actions, or experiences of the stakeholders in the experiments. In addition several stakeholders stated that the enrolment of OEMs and Banks could have been helpful in building a business case and propose the use of a champion or agent of change to aid the stakeholders in their efforts.Learning can be subdivided in first order and second order learning. First order learning comprised of pure technical learning elements, such as reliability and operating range, was the main goal of the FREVUE project. Second order learning, interaction and policies, also occurred for both experiments.Even though second order learning was not the main purpose of the experiments, stakeholders verified that second order learning occurred. The contributions this study makes are practical, scientific and managerial.The building of social networks and the enrolment of more actors, led to the addition of champion theory as a method to gain access to the necessary network and to convince stakeholders to participate in the project. It also became clear that the stakeholders that were currently participating did not do so out of purely monetary reasons.","strategic niche management; Electrical Vehicles; Transport; Electric Trucks; FREVUE; Electric Urban Freight Transport; adoption of innovation; radical innovation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

(graduation committee); van der Zaag, P (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","Nature-based water management is rising as an alternative approach to engineered water management. Nature-based water management makes use of ecological, hydrological, and morphological processes of natural rivers in designing river management policies. Furthermore, it helps conserving or restoring these natural processes for environmental purposes. Next to changes in water management, changes in the earth’s climate are occurring, which decrease the water flow in summer and autumn and increase the flow in winter. These changes will affect river uses and might cause conflicts between them. The river uses studied in this research are environment, navigation, and flood protection and an integrated model is developed to answer the research question: What conflicts arise between environment, navigation, and flood protection when nature-based water management policies are implemented under different water flow scenarios and how can insights in these conflicts be used in the policy-making process?<br/><br/>The system dynamics (SD) modelling method has been used, because SD enables integration of physical, social and economic factors influencing water resources while addressing inter-sectoral, long-term problems. The scope of the model has been set to analysing a side channel as a nature-based water management example. The model has been built up of four sub-systems that are interrelated: the river system (including a main channel, side channel, and floodplain), the environmental system, the navigation system, and the flood protection system. The model results show that no conflicts arise during high water inflows. Furthermore, environment and flood protection or navigation and flood protection can find a solution that is beneficial (0r neutral) for both during low water inflows. However, the environment requires a side channel that is connected on both its ends – and therefore has a year-round water flow –, while navigation prefers a side channel that is only connected on its downstream end in order to prevent lowering of the water level in the main channel during low water inflows.<br/><br/>Insights for policy-makers are found in five ways. First, the conflicts between river uses do not necessarily arise regarding the side channel per se – but concern the configuration of the side channel. Secondly, the conflicts strongly depend on the changes in water inflow due to climate change. Third, attention should be paid to compromises that are made. The side channel connected on one side can be seen as a compromise between nature and navigation and it indeed eliminates the negative effects on navigation, but it strongly reduces the benefits for nature. Fourth, for nature-based water management to be truly effective for environmental purposes, integration of several measures is required. Finally, the model showed that system behaviour is strongly dependent on fixed standards (e.g. maximum amounts of vegetation and presence of summer dikes). The model that was developed in this research can also be used to study the effects of river channel widening, floodplain widening, summer dike removal, and changes in floodplain vegetation management.","Nature-based water managemen; river use; conflicts; integrated modeling; Rhine River","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","br/>In order to address the need for a mechanically strong, self-healing thermosetting polymer for fiber reinforced composites, a novel dual network epoxy containing reversible disulfide bonds has been developed recently. This hybrid epoxy had the ability to heal multiple times when incorporated into fiber reinforced composites along with easy processing routes. However, one of the problems faced by this system was the instability of thiols, which were used to prevent phase separation of the components and promote healing by increasing the S-S bond content. These thiols, however, undergo side reactions which reduce the mechanical properties of the final network along with reduced long-term healing ability.<br/>The goal of this thesis was to study the effect of eliminating thiol from this dual-network epoxy on its mechanical and healing properties and to explore the effect of CuCl2 as a catalyst in case there is a reduction in the healing efficiency. The hybrid epoxy without thiol has been synthesized and its microscopic and macroscopic reversibility have been studied using stress relaxation and mode I opening of Double Cantilever Beam (DCB) specimens respectively. <br/>Eliminating thiol lead to an increase in Young’s modulus and strength of the hybrid epoxy. The same epoxy without thiol shows higher stress relaxation than the epoxy with thiol at 80°C. Given that in a crosslinked network, the ability to relax stress depends on the reversibility of the disulfide bonds, this indicates that the disulfide bond reversibility in the epoxy without thiol does not decrease in the absence of thiol in spite of having a stronger network at room temperature. Macroscopically, however, the epoxy with thiol had higher healing efficiency compared to the epoxy without thiol which showed almost no healing. <br/>To address the loss in healing efficiency, the effect of CuCl2 as a catalyst to promote disulfide exchange reactions was studied. Stress relaxation experiments indicated greater relaxation in the presence of CuCl2 along with a small increase in the stiffness of the hybrid epoxy. CuCl2 can thus be used as an alternative for thiol to promote disulfide exchange reactions at higher temperatures.<br/>Given that there is a dearth of literature comparing thiol-disulfide reactions with disulfide exchange reactions, the effect of thiols in this systems was unclear before. From these experiments, it can be observed that in the absence of thiols, disulfide bonds undergo stress relaxation most likely using a thermally triggered radical mediated exchange mechanism. However, the polymer architecture and the amount of disulfide content plays a key role in the macroscopic healing and this could be tuned to increase both healing and mechanical properties simultaneously. <br","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Computer Numerically Controlled (CNC) milling techniques is the main production method of single or double-curved concrete elements, creating astonishing shapes with high accuracy. However, these techniques are also accompanied with high costs and large material waste. Skilled carpentry or curved steel formwork are other techniques used for the production of concrete shells. An alternative to the aforementioned techniques is the “Flexible Mould” method being developed at Delft University of Technology. This method is based on mass customization of the produced panels, due to the adaptability of the formwork's shape according to the specified geometry. The concept of the “Flexible Mould” will be used as a starting point for the current thesis.<br/><br/>Concrete shells are mainly used for decorative reasons such as claddings and facade elements. Their structural capacity has still to be improved so that they can be applied as load-bearing elements and avoid sub-optimal or even “bad” designs. Several researches are being conducted in order to analyze and improve the load bearing capacity of concrete shells produced with the adjustable formwork technique. Applying conventional steel reinforcement to take up possible occurring tensile stresses in concrete shells produced with the Flexible Mould, has been proved to be possible only with limited diameters due to construction requirements. <br/><br/>In the first part of the thesis, a research was conducted on possible improvements in the production of concrete shells with the flexible mould, so that they could be considered feasible to be applied in real life structures. Having conducted a literature review on production parameters related to the “Flexible Mould” concept, Computer Aided Design (CAD) was used as the main tool to create the digital geometry of double-curved concrete elements. Dimensional limitations imposed from the existing test set-up of the adjustable formwork at TU Delft laboratories, as well as the inherent geometry of shell elements, had to be taken into account. As a next step towards the implementation of double-curved concrete elements in real life structures, non-load-bearing laboratory tests took place. These tests were performed for illustrating reasons with sand to be the main material used instead of concrete. During these tests, a steel wire mesh diamond shaped was applied as the elastic layer of the flexible mould, being a different material in comparison with the previous studies on the flexible mould. Grid distance between the actuators was the main parameter investigated during this part of the research.<br/><br/>In the second part of the thesis, a study was conducted on possible improvements in the flexural tensile capacity of concrete shells via prestressing steel reinforcement. CAD design and Finite Element Modeling (FEM) were the main tools used. Due to shell's complex geometry, the research was conducted first for simple geometrical shapes under linear static analyses. Two and three dimensional elements were investigated being modeled as plane stress elements and solids respectively. Linear or single-curved prestressed concrete elements were analyzed with regard to their deflection and stress field. The number of concrete elements as well as the influence of an intermediate element in-between them simulating a joint, was an additional investigated parameter. <br/><br/>Subsequently, a four-point bending that will take place at TU Delft, was simulated with Finite Element Modeling (FEM), investigating its structural response under both linear and nonlinear static analyses. The created (FEM) comprises of two centrally prestressed concrete elements connected with a mortar joint in between them. No bond interaction between the post-tensioning steel reinforcement and the concrete is incorporated in the FE model. The type and size of the applied reinforcement is investigated in this model. The main goal of this part was to analyze the structure's response for loads exceeding the cracking load of the concrete, taking into account a brittle concrete failure at joint's location. <br/><br/>In the final part of the thesis, a post-tensioned arch structure segmented in a series of concrete elements and joints, was first designed with CAD software and then analyzed under a linear static analysis via FEM. Although more complex, a three-dimensional (3D) modeling was conducted, aiming at describing the three dimensional state of stress and deflection field of the arch. Based on a draft CAD model, several geometrical parameters had to be adjusted in order to meet construction requirements of the final concrete shell structure. Modeling and meshing requirements imposed from the Finite Element Analysis (FEA) software were also taken into consideration for the final shape of the arch.<br/><br/>The current thesis is a part of a research program that is being performed at TU Delft, aiming at developing the Flexible Mould with regard to construction and structural application of concrete shells in real life structures.","Flexible mould; Concrete; Unbonded post-tensioning steel","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

There are two key principles that lead the exploration of machine learning techniques and algorithms in this thesis, namely, the applicability to imbalanced data, and the interpretability of predictions. The dataset used for model training and evaluation contains only 0.3\% fraudulent claims compared to 99.7\% non-fraudulent claims, which can therefore be considered highly imbalanced. Furthermore, prediction interpretability is of great importance, since fraud experts are directly interfacing with the output of the machine learning models. With the key principles in mind, this thesis considers four algorithms, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, LightGBM and a Stacking classifier. The algorithms are trained on the imbalanced learning problem by using a combination of undersampling (random and Edited Nearest Neighbors), oversampling (SMOTE) and class weighting. Conclusively, each trained model meets the objective, with the Stacking classifier combining the best performance with the lowest variance. By benchmarking the baseline for two different parameters, the models can be evaluated for two boundary conditions, which leads to tunable performance between the two conditions. Ultimately, the performance of the Stacking classifier is tunable (by moving its classification threshold) to roughly a 70-80\% increase in extra fraud caught or a 75\% reduction in effort. Extra fraud will increase the amount of real fraudulent claims that fraud experts get to see, and effort reduction leads to an increase in capacity, which enables fraud experts to spend more time on other more relevant tasks.","Insurance; Machine Learning; fraud detection; fraud; imbalanced","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-08-17","","","","Computer Engineering","",""

The research topic was derived from an assignment given by Studio Roosegaarde, a social design lab based in Rotterdam. The major problems this project aims to solve is that a designer has no systematic guidelines to follow when designing a pedestrian tunnel with mirrors. The context this work selects is Maastunnel in Rotterdam for the reason of simplicity, accessibility and its history between Studio Roosegaarde.<br/><br/>The keystone to the problem raised is reckoned to be the understanding of the space perception in a pedestrian tunnel and how the mirrors can alter the perceived space. A dozen of visual elements in space perception are identified through the literature survey. With the understanding to mirror perception, a handful of visual cues are selected for further step evaluation. The evaluation includes a questionnaire showing 24 photos of pedestrian tunnels to be rated. Through the survey, the correlation between the perceived visual cues and the sense of spaciousness is analysed. The visual cues correlate with the sense of spaciousness from strong to weak are the width, the height, the cleanness, the brightness of the tunnel and the reflectivity of the wall.<br/><br/>Thanks to the lighting simulation software Dialux, several attempts of using mirrors to alter the visual cues were made readily. The exploration reveals two most promising ways of using mirrors in a pedestrian tunnel: mirrors as the Space Doubler and mirrors as the Light Splasher. These two ways of mirror usage are put to test in scale models. Regarding the Space Doubler, it is firstly found that putting mirrors on the ceiling, referred as catoptric-heightening, may significantly enlarge the perceived space, resulting in a more open and spacious tunnel. A similar but less potent effect is also found when putting mirrors on the lower part of the walls (referred as catoptric-widening) to extend the perceived width. The observers reported feelings of disturbing and dirtiness when perceiving the catoptric-widening mirrors in a pedestrian tunnel. Regarding the Light Splasher, the experiment reveals that the mirror-induced brilliance, or reflected-brilliance, can effectively increase the brightness of the space. Contastly, the complex lighting pattern created by reflection ( reflected-deflection) is not beneficial. However, it is found that the associability plays a more significant role in the perception to a space with brilliance. The observers are likely to associate the reflected-brilliance with the starry sky henceforth they perceive a higher ceiling.<br/><br/>According to the above findings, a list of design guidelines is formulated. The design guidelines lists almost 19 dos and don’ts, corresponds to a dozen different aspects such as openness, spaciousness, aesthetics, privacy, security, etc. This project has made a self-evaluation to the design guidelines by making a design according to which. The prototype of the design has shown the strength of the guidelines meanwhile revealing the inadequacy of the current version. The guidelines are considered useful in the early stages of design process while it lacks of guides related to the size and variation of mirrors. To further develop the guidelines into a more comprehensive version, a dynamic or fully-immersive environment is suggested as the necessary future works.<br","Space Perception; Pedestrian Tunnel; Mirror; Catoptric augmentation; Tunnel Design Guidelines","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","Integrated Product Design","","51.900236, 4.468109"

It was decided to focus on only one origin for the this project which resulted in millennials who are living in the now as the target group. Among other things, this group is characterized by yearning for instant gratification. <br/><br/>A small research on their spending behaviour showed that feeling overconfident and misinterpretation of one’s balance leads to various ways of overspending. Therefore a design goal was formulated which would serve as the foundation for the creative process:<br/><br/>“I want people to feel self-conscious and composed while spending money and/or making financial decisions”.<br/><br/>As a result from several design and research activities, it was decided to revolve the design concept around strengthening delayed gratification as opposed to instant gratification.<br/><br/>The challenge was in doing this without trying to change the users’ lifestyle completely.

Everyone has a different perspective on what a ‘’good death’’ would be, but many patients consider a sense of completion important for a good death, attaching value to maintaining their dignity, and to the affirmation of their whole person. Enabling people to make one last wish come true during their final stage in life therefore heavily contributes to their quality of dying. This thesis focussed on optimizing the wish ride experience facilitated by WensAmbulance Brabant, whose aim is to grant the last wish of terminally ill patients (and their loved ones) to visit a special place.<br/><br/>In order to establish an understanding of the complex context of the different stakeholders, literature- and field researches were executed simultaneously. These respectively provided insights regarding aspects to take into account when designing for End of Life, and problems currently occurring during the wish event. This allowed the creation of a comprehensive example of a wish ride and the establishment of a Patient Journey Map. The journey map revealed multiple aspects that could be improved regarding the wish journey. The aim of the design project then became to provide terminally ill patients with a more comfortable and re-assuring experience, without compromising patient- and volunteer safety, in order to increase the likelihood of them meeting their set wish goals.<br/><br/>The concept which was created, the Patient Wrap, decreases the patient’s anxiety prior to engaging in the wish ride and when the first goodbyes are being said, is envisioned to improve the patient’s ability to rest or even sleep during the wish ride, and provides an accessible solution for WensAmbulance Brabant to ensure patient- and volunteer safety.<br/><br/>To whom it may concern, I hope this thesis will have the ability to inspire you.","Design for End of Life; Wish ride experience; Patient Journey; Medisign","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","Integrated Product Design / Medisign","",""

This competition forces incumbents to innovate if they want to sustain their competitive advantage. Large enterprises start to adopt methodologies pioneered within the startup world, like the lean startup methodology, the innovate. The adoption of this methodology has proven to be difficult, and incumbents face a lack of control with regards to these ventures. <br/><br/>The practical objective of this thesis is to enable large enterprises to control and steer internal lean ventures (ventures following the lean startup methodology) effectively. The theoretical objective is to bridge the knowledge gap concerning the understanding of internal venturing and the application of the lean startup methodology in large enterprises. <br/><br/>To reach the objective, a case study within a large enterprise was conducted to answer the research question and reach the research objective. 16 in-depth interviews with relevant stakeholders were conducted to collect data. Finally, the results were validated through relevant literature and by comparison to the results of six additional interviews, conducted with two other large enterprises. <br/><br/>The study found that two elements influence the success of the venturing process: First, the implementation of the venturing process itself (Section 5.1). Especially the alignment and coordination of different stakeholders as well as the quality of the employed metrics. Secondly, a set of additional factors arising from the context in which the process is embedded (Section 5.2). This context is made up of the mindset and culture of the company, the organizational environment as well as the quality of its adoption of the lean startup methodology. The analysis of resulted in the identification of the five recommendations to improve internal lean venturing within large enterprises. Details can be found in Section 5.4. <br/><br/>In conclusion, implementing the lean startup methodology can help navigate this uncertainty surrounding innovation. This implementation requires reliable metrics, company-wide alignment, and the commitment to the methodology. Additional to the implementation, company and industry specific factors mediate the success of a venturing initiative. Large enterprises are advised to take an honest self-assessment and follow a searching and learning approach to iteratively and successfully optimize their process for maximal venturing success.","Corporate Entrepreneurship; The Lean Startup; Internal Venturing; Innovation; Ambidexterity; Effectuation; Innovation Accounting; Case Study","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

To tackle this problem, the share of renewable energy use has been increased by up to 14% in the Netherlands. Moreover, the number of electric vehicles (EVs) on the road also reaches a total of 120,000 EVs in 2018. However, the high penetration of renewable energy sources (RESs) such as solar &amp; wind power and the EVs charging in the distribution network could result in a severe problem. One of the solutions to avoid this problem is that switching the uncontrolled charging of EVs into a controlled charging or called as smart charging. Further, an integration between the EVs, RESs and the distribution grid could potentially lead to technical and economic benefits. The focus of this thesis is to develop an optimal power management system (PMS) between the EVs, PV system, and the distribution network. The goal of the power management system is to obtain the minimum operational cost while also considering the technical grid constraints, which subsequently could avoid the grid violation. The proposed power management system will be modeled in a mixed integer non-linear programming (MINLP) optimization problem and executed in General Algebraic Modelling System (GAMS) software. To evaluate the performance of the proposed power management system, a comparison between the with-grid and the no-grid constraints case will be performed through several case studies. This study shows that by implementing the proposed power management system of EVs charging from PV system considering the grid constraints, it could decrease the total operational cost remarkably by 18.16% - 214.08% when compared to the uncontrolled charging scheme. Besides, the grid problem caused by the uncontrolled charging process such as exceeding the allowable voltage deviation and the transformer rated power could be prevented. However, in comparison to the smart charging without considering the grid constraints, the operational cost is increased by 1.43% - 113.20%.","Smart charging; Electric Vehicles; Optimization; PV systems","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

The current estimation is that around 40 million people live in slavery today (International Justice Mission, 2015, 2018b, 2018c). Slavery, together with other forms of endemic violence, are propagated by impunity. Justice systems exist to provide rule-of-law, but impunity thrives when these are non-existing, broken or dysfunctional. A justice system consists of several parts. When one of these links fails (due to corruption, poverty or historic reasons), the entire system will produce negative effects. Justice System Transformation is needed to then reinstate rule-of-law and to reduce impunity and violence (Haugen &amp; Boutros, 2014). International Justice Mission (IJM) uses a three-phase model to engage in Justice System Transformation (JST) in local communities. Summarized, these three phases are: 1.) collaborative casework: finding, rescuing and caring for victims and prosecuting perpetrators. This is often done in collaboration with local partners. 2.) system reform: assessing and improving justice systems by training, cooperation and capacity building. 3.) sustaining gains: while decreasing casework activity measurement and evaluation takes place, local ownership is used for sustained justice system improvement. These steps together enable (and measure) Justice System Transformation (International Justice Mission, 2016). JST can only be performed at scale and measured successfully when supported by an effective information system. The vast number of cases, the intricacies of each individual story, and the nuances of strategies applied to address issues in the public justice system make it too complex for individuals to track manually. Reporting on achievements and data analytics performed to measure the success of transformation strategies is best performed by a system. This information system is used by various people in field offices across the globe. Inherently, much cultural diversity is present. In order to design the system in such way that it can optimally support the work of people with various national and professional background, a culture sensitive information system should be designed. Culture is a concept with many definitions, a structured approach is therefore preferred to be able to analyze background diversity. Combining these elements led to the following main research question: How can a systematic approach to culture be translated into design guidelines for a culture sensitive information system design? Multiple models aiming at structuring cultural diversity are discussed in this report. Hofstede et al.’s (2010) national background dimensions and Curry &amp; Moore’s (2003) information culture model are used to structure culture. The case study is performed using a questionnaire based on these models. In-depth interviews and an analysis of how IJM aims at improving justice systems and how the information system should facilitate this provided additional insight. An adaptation of Value Sensitive Design (B. Friedman et al., 2009) has been developed, called the Culture Sensitive Design methodology. Cultural value conflicts that show resemblance with issues mentioned in in-depth interviews are further researched. To solve these, design guidelines have been developed and validated. These results show that a systematic approach to culture can be translated into design guidelines for a culture sensitive information system design by performing a case study and applying the Culture Sensitive Design methodology.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This is believed to be caused by stress concentrations in the bone that take place at the location of the edges of the plate. Various implant parameters are known to affect these concentrations of stress, but we further hypothesized that the material of the plate has the most significant influence in reducing these concentrations, here referred to as ‘peak stresses’. Moreover, it was reasoned, based on relevant literature, that minimizing the peak stresses was not the only criteria that should be considered for the design of an optimal implant, the effect of the Interfragmentary strain on the healing outcome in the early stages after implantation is also crucial for the success of the implant. Otherwise the bone will never heal in the first place.<br/><br/>Thus, by assuming that different regions of the plate have a different influence in the peak stresses, it was suggested that a stiffness graded plate could minimize the peak stresses while still allowing for an acceptable interfragmentary strain at the early stages of healing, through an optimization. In order to prove or disprove all the hypotheses mentioned above, a Finite Element model of a fracture fixation construct was developed. For the selection of many of the modelling assumptions, a literature study was carried out. For the selection of the contact properties to be used, a graphical comparison study was done. For choosing an appropriate mesh, a mesh study was implemented. <br/><br/>Using this Finite Element model, it was possible firstly to show that while the material properties of the plate do in fact appear to be very influential in reducing the peak stresses, the thickness seems to be even more influential. For the latter a parametric study was carried out using the Taguchi method. Secondly, it was shown that different regions of the fracture fixation plate do have a different influence in the peak stresses of the bone. The outer most sections of the plate seem to always be the most influential. Lastly, optimisations were carried out in three different ways and although they all reduced the peak stresses, the method thought to be the simplest, yielded the most useful results. This consisted of dividing the plate only into three sections and assigning one material to the outer sections and another to the inner section.<br","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | BioMechanical Design","",""

Nevertheless, without innovation, public tasks and services become inadequate, resulting in stagnated and eventually decreased effectiveness and efficiency of service delivery. The need for innovation approaches; the inconsistency in sustaining innovation by the public sector; and the unprecedented pace of technological, demographic and social changes, require a systematic approach.

The primary and best treatment option for oral cancer is surgery. In order to have the best prognosis and quality of life, international guidelines prescribe that the tumor should be removed including a margin of healthy tissue from at least 5mm. However, it is essential not to remove too much tissue, because this will negatively affect the quality of life of the patient.<br/><br/>Most of these procedures are very difficult due to the complex anatomical and functional structures in the oral cavity. Currently, surgeons can only judge the surgical margins by visual inspection and palpation, without much support of technology or other diagnostic techniques. Research has shown that this subjective method results in a very low percentage of successful surgeries. So there is a need for clear and objective information about the resection margins during the surgery.<br/><br/>SurGuide is therefore developing the MarginGuide system. This device uses an optical technique to distinguish healthy tissue from tumorous tissue. It will be used to inspect the margins directly after the tumor has been removed from the patient, which enables the surgeon to remove additional tissue if needed. The MarginGuide should therefore increase the success rate of oral cancer surgeries.<br/><br/>This project focusses on the workstation of the MarginGuide system. The workstation should support the operator in correctly (and easily) measuring and reporting the margins during the surgical procedure. During this project the importance of correct information flow became clear, shifting the focus to software, protocols and the workflow of the workstation.<br/><br/>To establish the different needs and requirements for the workstation, the desired workflow, information flow, and communication of the measurement results are investigated. The research has been verified with surgeons, pathologists and researchers from the Erasmus-University Medical Center.<br/><br/>Based on the results, a software design has been developed.

It therefore attracted considerable attention from geologists over the last decades. The PETM occurred 56 million years ago and is characterized by a sharp negative δ13C isotope excursion which has been observed in terrestrial and marine sediment records the world over. The PETM global warming led to a significant alteration in regional climate and to an enhanced hydrologic cycle which triggered an increase in weathering and sediment discharge from catchments to basins. <br/>The sedimentary, biotic, and climatic responses to the PETM have been studied intensely on the American and European continents. However, detailed analyses of the impact to the PETM on the Asian continent remain rare. Here, a detailed analysis of the sedimentary and climatic response to the PETM in the Hengyang Basin, Hunan Province, China, is presented. High-resolution isotope measurements of pedogenic carbonate nodules reveal the characteristic isotope excursion of the PETM and strongly improve the previous low-resolution isotope series. Pedogenic features and clay types of PETM floodplain deposits indicate oxic conditions and a climate with pronounced seasonality in which intensive dry periods alternated with wet seasons. Grain size analysis of the paleosols support the hypothesis of coarsening deposits as a response to the PETM even though the coarsening is not strongly pronounced. Sediment bypassing and a depleted regolith in coarse material is suggested as the main reasons for the only minor pronounced coarsening in the PETM units. A generalized PETM model, which was simulated in PaCMod, a spatially lumped numerical model developed at the University of Delft, Netherlands, predicts an increase in net precipitation and erosion in the catchment area during the PETM. As a result, the simulated water discharge increases and lead to increased bedload and suspend load transport within the river system.

Together with the increasing interests on EV, the motor drive with higher efficiency and lighter weight also becomes more attractive. To reduce the time and cost for the development, the project is aiming for the modelling of the motor drive, with which the voltage and current stress, power loss, thermal and electromagnetic performance can all be evaluated.<br/><br/>In the meanwhile, the Nuon Solar Team is also interested in designing a new motor drive with a higher efficiency and less weight. A promising solution is to apply the wide band gap (WBG) components including gallium nitride (GaN) and silicon carbide (SiC) in the motor drive. Thus, the characteristics of the WBG components especially the GaN MOSFET is investigated as well to clarify the feasibility of applying the WBG components to the application.<br/><br/>In overview, a systematic approach for the design of a GaN-based 4-parallel MOSFET motor drive is presented. The development of the motor drive is divided into 3 parts that are the 1-D modelling, hardware design and 3-D modelling. 1-D or 2-D model is sufficient to simulate the voltage and current stress, power loss, and highly simplified thermal and the electromagnetic performance. Only by using 3-D model the thermal and electromagnetic distribution can be thoroughly studied.<br/><br/>As the beginning, the load profile analysis is done to clarify the design requirements. Based on the requirements, several design candidates are proposed. Then, the 1-D modelling on the control system, power loss and thermal performance are done for each design candidates respectively. Built on the modelling and load profile, the efficiency and temperature of the motor drive in the competition WSC are predicted for each design candidates respectively. Among all the design candidates, the one with the highest efficiency and acceptable maximum junction temperature is selected. Based on the selection, the hardware design proceeds. Among all the hardware design, the layout design of the power stage is most important because it is used as the geometric shape in the 3-D modelling. Three different types of layout of the power stage are proposed. <br/><br/>To make the simulation closer to the reality, in the 3-D modelling, the thermal performance is coupled with the electromagnetic performance and the computational fluid dynamic (CFD). Through the 3-D electromagnetic modelling, the current distribution on the power stage with a certain layout is simulated. Based on the output result, the heat transfer is coupled with the CFD to analyze the heat transfer coefficient on the surface that has the forced convective cooling. Built on the output result, the stationary and time dependent heat transfer study are carried out to evaluate the temperature distribution when the car is cruising and the maximum junction temperature occurring when the large surge current comes. Finally, according to the simulated multi-physical performances, one of the three types of power stages is selected for the PCB construction.","GaN MOSFET; 3-D multi-physical modelling; motor drive","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-08-16","","","","Electrical Engineering","",""

Wind farms become larger and therefore the field becomes more complex. Turbines will experience the influence of the wake of multiple wind turbines. The interaction of these wakes can be modelled using different approaches. Using numerical solvers is very computationally costly and accordingly, there is a need for simple engineering wake models which represent the wind field in a good way. <br/>The focus of this MSc Thesis project is to find a superposition method in combination with the Jensen/Park model, which is in good agreement with a representative reference for mixed wakes in reality. <br/>This reference could be either Large Eddy Simulations (LES) or large-scale measurements data from the BEACon campaign, carried out by Ørsted. Comparisons between some datasets showed that more research is needed to identify the discrepancies between the wake fields of both datasets.<br/>Studies have been carried out in literature, but mostly focussing on wind speeds below rated wind speed. Therefore, cases with an inflow wind speed just above and below rated wind speed are considered. The superposition methods looked at are linear superposition, quadratic superposition and the maximum deficit method. The modelling of the wake boundary, rotor averaged wind speed and power are discussed. Some superposition methods are in good agreement with the LES results, but because a uniform profile is modelled, more research is needed to assess if these conclusions also hold for sheared inflow wind profiles.<br/>Apart from examining the combination of superposition methods and the Park wake, a study is also carried out to examine if single LES wakes can be superposed to mimic LES wake fields with multiple wind turbines. Based on the available single LES wakes, there are still essential differences in the results, but these might be overcome if more single LES wakes can be used.<br/>As the proposed superposition methods are not necessarily ""true"", a preliminary study is carried out in which the superposition method is optimized. This gives an insight in the number of upstream wakes that need to be included and the possible scaling or improvement of the superposition methods.","wind energy; wakes; wake superposition","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering | Aerodynamics and Wind Energy","European Wind Energy Masters (EWEM)",""

In marine operations there are different operations with each having their own characteristic. Different trades for example include containers, tankers, bulk, or passenger vessels. But in the end, all of them have to enter a port, this is the place where many actors come together to service a vessel. Due to the many actors involved in the port call, which could run up to around ten actors, planning a vessel stay can get very tedious. Planning the port call can get especially hard if sequential services are not aligned with each other or if relevant information appears to be inaccurate or even missing. <br/>Major complications in port calls are therefore the lack of information sharing. Often parties have a very poor insight in when a vessel is arriving or departing. In general actors in the port environment have been striving to optimise their own processes not including others affected. Very few research has been done in port operations to see what the effects are of data sharing and collaboration among actors. The question is therefore how information sharing among actors in a port call can affect the situation and to what extent. And in particular what information should be shared and with what interval.<br/>To quantify the effects of data sharing three major components are included in the research approach with the port of Rotterdam as use case. The first part of the research focusses on qualitative aspects exploring actors and the port call event. Through this part of the research a better understanding of the port call process is gained which will be useful for the next steps. Also understanding which actors have a dominant role, benefit, or have a lot of power is important for further steps in the research. After a clear overview of the port call and most important actors a combination of data analysis and modelling is done. In this research a discrete simulation model is used to make an abstraction of the real world and use this for testing. Through a simulation parts of the port call process can be tested under different circumstances or inputs of interest. Outputs will then give an indication how the system will respond to particular changes. To get the model correctly running data from the Port of Rotterdam will be used for a correct parameterisation. Parameters would include statistics of port operations such as the number of vessels, handling time, and speed of the vessel. <br/>After going through the previous mentioned steps results show that vessels can reduce their waiting time at anchorage by 35% and therefore their fuel consumption as well. One of the biggest gains would be realised if captains and terminals would start sharing information with each other about arrival and departure times. Ideally this would be done on an interval smaller than 2 hours. When vessels are aware of delays in the berth they can slow down to arrive just in time at the anchorage, or perhaps they can sail straight to the terminal. This information towards the captain is crucial as it can be used to adjust speed and thereby realise fuel savings. In the most optimal case the waiting time at anchorage could be reduced by 35%. Furthermore throughout the whole process more accurate information is required which will support actors in making a more robust planning and be able to plan farther ahead. <br/>Two things need to be done from here, one is further research to consolidate these outcomes and see effects in other operations such as bulk or on more microscopic level such as inland shipping. Also research with regard to the implementation will be required to get everyone on board such as actors with fewer gains that are required to make this a success. the second is to get stakeholders together and make them realise that cooperation and sharing of data will have tremendous implications not only for the waiting times but also for CO2 emissions and robustness of operations.<br","Port Logistics; Simulation; Communication","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","",""

The relative position of the objects will heavily influence the vehicle control strategy. This thesis work aims to find out a solution for the 3D object detection by combining the Lidar point cloud and camera images, considering that these are two of the most commonly used perception sensors of autonomous vehicles. Lidar performs much better than the camera in 3D object detection since it rebuilds the surface of the surroundings by the point cloud. What’s more, combing Lidar with the camera provides the system redundancy in case of a single sensor failure. Due to the development of Neural Network (NN), past researches achieved great success in detecting objects in the images. Similarly, by applying the deep learning algorithms to parsing the point cloud, the proposed 3D object detection system obtains a competitive result in the KITTI 3D object detection benchmark.","3D object detection; Lidar; Camera; sensor fusion","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Vehicle Engineering","",""

In this thesis, novel conditions are proposed, aiming to examine stability of the learned dynamics for two important model classes; namely Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) and Locally Weighted Learning (LWL). For the former method, a theoretical and computational framework is developed by establishing an equivalence between ReLU DNN models and Piecewise Affine (PWA) systems. This allows to leverage well-known tools of PWA system analysis, and consequently compute, characterize equilibria and determine their region of attraction for ReLU DNNs. Due to their increased complexity, a structured search for appropriate stability conditions was performed for LWL methods until the optimal trade-off between conservativeness and computational efficiency was obtained. These stability conditions are given as Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI) problems and they consist the first stability results in literature for these two model classes. Their efficacy is assessed in numerical and real-world dynamical systems and it is shown that the proposed LMIs are not unreasonably conservative, as they can evaluate accurately the stability properties of these two representations.

Apparently, it ended up with the victory of AC. However, the growing use of the renewable energy sources that mostly are DC supplier, and the advancement of power electronics lead to the reconsideration of using DC power by public in these decades. In the residential sector, which is a highly energy consuming sector, an increasing number of home appliances operate with DC internally. By installing DC residential system, it not only removes the AC/DC conversion stage by the load side, but also offers the potential to use DC directly from the locally installed renewable energy sources without the requirement of the inverter stage. Therefore, the potential benefits from altering traditional AC residential system to DC version and the impact of the sizing of the renewable energy sources on the performance of the residential systems are of interest.<br/><br/>The main objective of this study is comparing the AC and DC residential system with the varying levels of the penetration of the PV and battery storage. Starting from the overview of the original AC and adopted DC residential system with the presence of the PV and battery storage, the main difference between AC and DC system architecture is investigated. Then, the various components such as converters, cables, PV and battery storage system in the residential system are modeled. Based on the modelling, a power management strategy is propsed.

During each time step, this information is projected to the grid, on which the equations of motionare solved and a corresponding acceleration field is constructed. Then, the material points undergo motioncorresponding to the acceleration field and the particle properties are updated accordingly. MPM uses a finiteelement method to solve the equations of motion over a triangular grid, but in current versions, the basisfunctions used are only piece-wise linear, which results in low-order spatial convergence for function reconstruction.Furthermore, the piece-wise linear basis functions have discontinuous first derivatives, which causeso called grid-crossing errors when amaterial point crosses between elements, where these discontinuities areoccur. To solve these problems for 2D MPM on a triangular grid, this study investigates the possibility to usehigher-order basis functions with the properties of C1-continuity and non-negativity. B-spline basis functionswould be very suitable for this purpose and earlier studies for 1D have already shown the potential of B-splineMPM. This thesis shows that it is also possible to use B-splines on a 2D triangular grid, which has led to the useof quadratic Powell-Sabin (PS) spline basis functions, which are piece-wise quadratic, C1-continuous, nonnegativebasis functions on triangulations. In this thesis, we have implemented these basis functions inMPMand investigated the performance of PS-spline MPM. Although Constructing and evaluating PS-splines hasproven more cumbersome than the piece-wise linear basis functions classically used in MPM, but PS-splineMPM shows higher-order spatial convergence for function reconstruction and completely erases grid crossingerrors. For these reasons, PS-splineMPM would be very suitable for application in engineering in which largenumbers of basis functions are necessary: due to the higher-order spatial convergence of PS-splineMPM, thenumber of required basis functions could be significantly reduced.Before implementation in engineering application can take place, however, two issues still appear in PSsplineMPM, which should be further researched. The first issue is that PS-spline MPM shows instabilitieswhen elements become nearly empty, as the mass matrix becomes ill-conditioned when this occurs. A way tomitigate this problems is by lumping the mass matrix, however, this leads to the second issue. When the massmatrix is lumped, the accuracy of the solution drops significantly, far more than when classical MPM withpiece-wise linear basis functions is lumped. If these issues are resolved in further research, PS-spline MPMmay prove very suitable for engineering applications.","Material Point Method; Powell-Sabin refinement; Triangulation; Finite Element Method; higher order describing function; grid crossing error","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics","",""

The interaction of feedbacks between hydrodynamics, sediment dynamics, and eelgrass can be described with a feedback loop. At locations where eelgrass is present, it favours its growth by modifying the local hydrodynamics (both waves and currents) and the sediment transport. Sediment resuspension is reduced by eelgrass presence, the light availability is subsequently increased, and growth is stimulated, i.e. further reducing the sediment resuspension. However, when eelgrass is absent, its growth is adversely affected. Sediment resuspension and, therefore, turbidity is enhanced, the available light is reduced, and eelgrass growth (or invasion) is hindered. Therefore, these systems are vulnerable and prone to external factors that influence the environmental conditions to become adverse. Especially hindered light penetration or changes in water temperature can push the system to an alternative ecological state, i.e. from dense eelgrass cover to a bare sediment state, with a little chance of return. Climate change effects, such as sea level rise, water temperature increase, and increased storminess, can increase these threats to the seagrass ecosystem and are, according to the literature, able to push the ecosystem into the bare seabed state. Because of its vulnerability and valuable benefits, conservation of and prevention of damage to the ecosystem are strongly demanded. To this end, the shallow coastal (eco)system response to possible adverse conditions of a changing environment due to the mentioned climate change effects is assessed in this research. The Rødsand lagoon in Denmark was found to be an ideal study site, as it is characterised as a sheltered, shallow microtidal coastal system that accommodates eelgrass and that has been intact for many years. It is a good example of a thriving eelgrass ecosystem in a temperate climate, and a low-nutrient environment, where anthropogenic influences are limited. The environmental conditions of the study site could be assessed by means of the available literature and the data that was provided. In general, the hydrodynamic conditions are primarily dependent on wind, as this is the main forcing of both flow and waves. The flow- and wave conditions are, in general, relatively calm, which means that only for dynamic (storm) events sediment resuspension is induced. In order to assess the interaction of feedbacks between hydrodynamics, sediment dynamics, and eelgrass, and the impact of climate change effects on the coastal system, a predictive tool in terms of a numerical model that includes these feedbacks was developed. This resulted in the coupled model: an interactive coupling between a physical model and a growth model was established. The physical model, developed as an online coupling of Delft3D-FLOW with Delft3D-WAVE, includes the effects of flow and waves on the sediment entrainment and therefore on the vegetation. The growth model simulates the eelgrass development over time based on the environmental conditions computed by the physical model and the subsequently calculated light climate. The simulated eelgrass development by the growth model was subsequently used as an input for the physical model for the next simulation period. The developed coupled model was used as a predictive and pragmatic tool: simulations comprising idealised singular climate change effects of relative sea level rise, water temperature increase, and increased storminess were performed. The results of the coupled model and the provided data of DHI showed the same behaviour in terms of eelgrass development, hydrodynamic conditions, and sediment transport at most locations, except in the deepest depth zone (4-6 m). This indicates that the general performance of the coupled model is adequate. The environmental conditions in the coupled model are apparently more benign than in the model of DHI, i.e. more beneficial for the eelgrass growth, as the eelgrass biomass was far higher at the shallow depths than that the data of DHI showed. Two reasons can be given for these more beneficial conditions: 1) the sediment import from the offshore boundary and spreading into the domain is underestimated, resulting in more beneficial light conditions at the bottom and 2) the model only takes into account the forcings and, therefore, the hydrodynamic processes in the direction of the transect, whereas processes (related to hydrodynamics and sediment transport) acting perpendicular to the transect are omitted. The results showed the impact of these climate change effects on the coastal system, especially on the eelgrass development. Decreased growth could be observed for all simulated climate change effects compared to the results of the baseline case with dense eelgrass cover. As the eelgrass at the deepest locations is the closest to its light-/depth-limit, it was found to be more susceptible to changes in the environment than eelgrass at shallower locations, leading to increased decay at larger depths. However, no indication or no clearly defined threshold of the system shifting to the alternate and undesired bare state due to the studied climate change forcings, i.e. relative sea level rise, water temperature increase, and increased storminess, could be derived for this specific study site. This means that a large-scale die-off of eelgrass in a shallow microtidal coastal system such as the Rødsand lagoon is unlikely to happen due to the studied forcings.","Eelgrass; Ecosystems; Alternative stable states; Climate change; Delft3D; Sediment dynamics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","","54.624186, 11.701625"

In this context, the European Customs Authorities experienced an explosion of small parcels coming from e-commerce websites, often from China, and faced difficulties to detect fiscal frauds and security threats using their conventional risk management systems. To address this problem, the European project PROFILE brings together the customs administrations of Netherlands, Belgium, Sweden, Norway, and Estonia, aiming to provide the EU with a shared platform for: (1) accurately assessing customs risks; (2) optimizing operation and logistics by integrating multiple sources of information; (3) developing a shared data platform to share customs risk management (CRM) practices.<br/><br/>As part of this project, the Dutch Customs Administration (DCA) and International Business Machines (IBM) Corporation are collaborating to deploy the cutting-edge technologies of artificial intelligence to automatically cross-check the customs declarations coming from Chinese e- commerce against online information. Through a Design Science approach, I carried out this research for the Delft University of Technology, written in collaboration with IBM Netherlands, aiming to deliver a preparatory study for the developing team before the PROFILE project begins. This includes knowledge brokering between the Dutch Customs Administration and IBM Netherlands so that a more precise problem scope can be defined, and the requirements elicited. In particular, this research focuses on the first part of the project: the development of an adaptive web-crawler for e-commerce, able to compare the declarations documents against online information.<br/><br/>According to the Dutch Customs Administration, the web-crawling system should gather the description of the goods from declarations, search the product on the web, find its price of sale on the e-commerce platforms, compare it with the value declared in the declaration, and return a risk indicator of green/red flag to the targeting officer. The design process of this system follows approaches coming from the systems engineering discipline, starting with the requirement analysis, addressing them with the state-of-the-art big data analytics, and finally deriving the logical components of the system, whose design is presented through a logical architecture.<br/><br/>First, the application domain is investigated. When goods entry the Netherlands need an entry declaration. These goods arrive at the harbor of Rotterdam or airport of Schiphol, where some of these are imported into the country and become import/export, and others stop temporarily as transit waiting to be shipped somewhere else. The Dutch Customs Administration monitors these processes through risk management systems aiming to stop non-compliant goods. This research describes these practices, with a higher focus on the e-commerce risk targeting. About the e- commerce world, a study of the e-commerce processes behind an online purchase is also carried out through a real purchase on Chinese e-commerce. This was used to observe how the Chinese sender described the item, and how the Dutch Customs assessed the risk and decided on the duties to be paid. This led to reflect on the possible frauds scenarios and how to address them. Finally, the Dutch Customs also reported that the products descriptions are often vague and ambiguous, and a more accurate formulation of the problem is described.<br/><br/>Secondly, an in-depth literature on the fields of web-crawling and big data analytics techniques is carried out. The possible technologies that could be useful to address the requirements and the problem formulation are investigated. Starting with an analysis of the existing literature on the field of big data analytics, this research also covers the recent trends of machine learning and artificial intelligence. To avoid reporting a too big literature, the topics reported have been accurately chosen, for instance describing only the techniques for web analytics and text analytics.<br/><br/>This literature on big data analytics is further broken in two sub-topics, one more theoretical, which classifies the types of analytics methods and defines the technology of machine learning and natural language processing, including the last paradigms of deep learning and reinforcement learning, and one more practical, where guidelines for the design, development, and implementation of machine learning techniques are proposed. It is here that a theoretical framework to systematically reflect on the challenges of the field of big data analytics has been identified. This framework is then used to systematically collect the main technological challenges of the use case under analysis and translate them into non-functional requirements.<br/><br/>Finally, the last part of the literature describes what a web-crawler is and what web- crawling/web-craping means. This later extends to the concepts of focused web-crawling and smart, intelligent, adaptive web-crawling, where machine learning techniques are deployed to improve performance. The literature concludes by providing related works of machine learning techniques implemented in smart web-crawling of the e-commerce websites and stating the knowledge gap that needs to be bridged to address the use case under analysis.<br/><br/>After the application domain and the literature review, the knowledge from these previous phases combines in a continuous iterative process according to the design science methodology (Hevner, 2014). Through unstructured interviews with the DCA and IBM experts, the requirements elicitation is carried out. The approach by Armstrong and Sage (2000) deriving from the field of systems engineering is used. The main objective of the system to be developed is broken down into a series of sub-activities that must be carefully structured to formulate the requirements. About the non-functional requirements, instead of reflecting on the different domains – technological, environment, law compliance, etc. – as it is proposed by the same systems engineering approach mentioned earlier, this research uses the framework identified in the literature review about the main challenges of big data project (Sivarajah, 2016).<br/><br/>To derive the components of the architecture from the requirements and customer needs, the methodology proposed by Suh (1998) called Axiomatic Design has been used, mapping the requirements into architectural components in a rigorous manner. In this way, the design domains proposed by this methodology – customer, functional, physical and process domains – are taken as the reference point for the design process: first, the business needs are identified, then these are translated into requirements, which are mapped into design features. The process domain is left out of this research and will be addressed by the IBM development team in Ireland.<br/>The design cycle leads to the design of a web-crawling system represented through a service- oriented architecture (SOA). Its block diagram and black-box description of each application service are provided. Furthermore, the architecture functionality is described with an architecture walk-through and a sequence diagram in the unified modeling language (UML). The result is an innovative real-time web-crawling system to identify the value of a given product on the e-commerce websites. It deploys natural language process models to filter the non-relevant search results, and other machine learning models to best matching the remaining relevant results with a given item description.<br/><br/>The design and architecture description of this innovative web-crawling system is the main artifact of this research, while the mixed methodology of systems engineering methodologies and big data frameworks is another important scientific contribution.","Web-crawling; Machine Learning; Artificial Intelligence; Service Oriented Architecture; Systems Engineering; Risk Management; E-commerce; Customs Administration","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","PROFILE",""

HSC uses assistive forces on the master device to guide the operator's control input towards a reference trajectory. However, the reference trajectory might be incorrect due to inaccuracies in the sensed or modeled environment and thus not match the intended trajectory of the operator, resulting in force conflicts that can potentially reduce performance. This paper describes the design and evaluation of a haptic shared controller whose reference trajectory adapts in real-time to resort force conflicts. Different adaptive controllers have been designed and compared in simulation. The final controller is built on a Task Parameterized Gaussian Mixture Model and adapts using an Incremental Gaussian Mixture Model. The controller is evaluated in an experiment (n=16) where subjects performed a planar teleoperation task that involved moving the slave through a narrow corridor. The subjects were assisted by HSC with a correct reference (cHSC), HSC with a wrong reference (wHSC), HSC with a wrong reference that adapts in real-time (waHSC) and a manual condition. <br/>The waHSC condition was expected to result in lower control effort, compared to wHSC, and induce better performance compared to wHSC and the manual condition.<br/>Within-subjects results showed that waHSC decreases control effort compared to wHSC, while the performance remained similar. Manual control had better performance than wHSC and waHSC, and cHSC outperformed all other conditions. <br/>Even though the conditions were tested in a balanced order, we observed a strong effect of the order of the conditions: between-subject results showed improved performance, lower control effort and better subjective results for waHSC over wHSC when wHSC was executed first. Upon first execution of waHSC, improved performance and self-reported satisfaction were realized for wHSC over waHSC. The results show that, in the event of a force conflict, an adaptive controller is a promising alternative to temporarily adjusting the HSC stiffness.","Teleoperation; Haptic Shared Control; Reference adaption; Task Parameterized Gaussian Mixture Model; Incremental Gaussian Mixture Model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

Li6PS5Cl is a promising electrolyte with an instability in the active material and electrolyte interphase which causes an increase in impedance and capacity loss. <br/>Doping with stable salts of LiCl and LiF could affect the stability. It is found that doping LiCl reduces the specific capacity retention despite having higher ionic conductivity from EIS. With the ex-situ XRD analysis, it is found that the decomposition is less than of pristine argyrodite. This could be due to poor interphase contact. In the case of dopant LiF, small doping of the argyrodite decreases the specific capacity retention of the active material which may be due to lowered ionic conductivity. The higher amount of LiF doped argyrodite improves the specific capacity retention despite the lower ionic conductivities. This could be due high decomposition rate. Alternatively, another doping method was used, but it was found to have higher chemical decomposition despite having good specific capacity retention.

However, long-term depending on wheelchairs has intensified the burden on the social economy and brought enormous challenges to wheelchair users health. Physical issues such as body pain, pressure sore, muscle injury and weakness, and cardiopulmonary weakness happen quite often among wheelchair users because of various poor long-term habits including, improper sitting postures, prolonged sitting, upper extremity overuse, and lack of exercise engagement. To solve these problems, wheelchair users have to change their habits.<br/>Self-tracking based on emerging sensing technologies combined with the personal informatics might be a promising way to motivate behavior change. Such products have been applied in sports and monitoring chronic diseases such as migraines, diabetes, and allergies. The abundance of commercial smart trackers can also prove that self-tracking is competent to help users to self-understand, make plans, and finally, change habits. However, there are no available self-logging products specifically designed for wheelchair users. Furthermore, because of the limitation of their bodies and different needs from regular people, wheelchair users can hardly find suitable commercial products.<br/>To solve these problems, a smart connected wheelchair system is designed which applies emerging self-tracking technologies and machine learning. The wheelchair can monitor postures, sedentary time, upper extremity muscle load, exercise level, and energy expenditure. The App associated can record and report this data for users' better self-understanding. Various strategies for motivating behavior changing, including goal-setting, reward, self-monitoring, and sharing, are also integrated into this system. In this way, wheelchair users can make new plans according to their data and keep moving toward a healthier lifestyle.<br/>An agile design approach in combination with technology-driven rapid prototyping, which includes multiple iterations of technology experimentation, prototype development, and user test, was adopted throughout this project. In the prototyping phase, the concept was divided into three parts including sitting, muscle, and cardiopulmonary. Three generations of the prototype were then built, focusing on validating the sitting aspect of the concept from the technical perspective. By utilizing a simple machine learning algorithm, the function has been realized with a relatively satisfying accuracy. It turns out that the concept has potential to benefit wheelchair users in the future.","Quantified wheelchair; Internet of Things; Data driven design; Rapid prototype; Self-tracking","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

Traditionally, global phases are used to obtain subsurface information up to 1 Hz. A recent study, however, found that signal present in the coda of strong, distant earthquakes contains higher frequencies. Quantitative analysis of the coda of earthquakes, of at least magnitude 6, shows that frequencies of, on average, 3 Hz can be found, with the most promising results coming from P- and PKIKP-phases. By autocorrelating the coda of these phases an estimate of the zero-offset reflection response below a seismic station can be retrieved.<br/>The method allows to successfully delineate basins in both Argentina and the United States. Even higher frequencies, up to 8 Hz, are used at specific stations, that have been active for an extended period of time (~ 8 years). Again the method succeeds in retrieving structural information below these stations. The results of both studies are confirmed by existing literature as well as Ambient Noise Seismic Interferometry (ANSI) studies. ANSI is a method, which retrieves the reflection response below a station by applying seismic interferometry to ambient noise.<br/>Advantages are that the method is computationally cheap and fast and that it is a passive measurement thus requiring low-effort. A disadvantage, however, is the unpredictability of earthquakes, which means that the exact duration the stations have to be active is unknown. Instead, the station will have to record over a prolonged amount of time, during which suitable earthquakes should occur. Research into the upper crustal structure, in particular, may benefit from the method. For example, the depth of a sedimentary basin can be discovered and imaged using this method.

For arbitrary wave shapes, function generator and HV amplifier setup are available up to 50 kV and few kHz signal bandwidths. Superimposed signals (impulses or transients on a sinusoidal or DC) are generated from a careful design of superposition of two voltage sources. The demand of these unconventional test sources is increasing as new electric stresses are introduced in the current electrical power network due to the rise of power electronics. This motivates the search for a novel high voltage test source which can generate arbitrary wave shapes with larger signal bandwidth at higher voltage level. Modular multilevel converter (MMC) topology is a promising solution for high power applications because of its high efficiency, modular structure, and reduced filter requirement. Hence, the idea of a MMC-based high voltage test source is proposed for arbitrary wave shape generation. Such a converter-based test source can also be adapted as a mobile test system for site acceptance and diagnostic testing and opens an entire new high voltage research area. <br/><br/>This master’s thesis demonstrates the proof of concept of a MMC-based high voltage test source using a mathematical and simulation model. The first step is to identify critical differences between existing MMC applications versus high voltage testing applications. Based on this analysis, control methodology and converter parameter design are adapted for high voltage testing application. Since a power electronic converter generates an output signal with harmonics, a filter is required to obtain a smooth signal that can be applied to the test objects. The quality of the generated signal is measured in terms of the peak value and the slope of the output voltage. Also, the protection system and DC source requirements are investigated briefly for a comprehensive picture of the MMC-based high voltage test system. The thesis demonstrates the feasibility of the MMC-based high voltage test source with a proof of principle on paper and with simulations.

Its creation was inspired by natural adaptation and selection mechanisms that evolve from one population of chromosomes to a ﬁtter population by means of an artiﬁcial natural selection dictated by the operators of elitism, crossover and mutation. An advanced Genetic Algorithm (aGA) was proposed by Sun et al. [2017], and this algorithm seeks the global maximum of n-th dimensional non-convex functions. However, convergence speed is a key factor for the success of a global optimization algorithm when it comes to scalability; in production even a slight eﬃciency improvement matters as it can easily takes weeks or even months to process a huge data set. Therefore, the goal of this project is to improve the convergence speed of the currently available aGA by simultaneously enhancing both its global and its local search capabilities. To this end, two solutions were proposed. The ﬁrst is a modiﬁed version of the well known Island model GAs and the second was named Self Adaptive Diﬀerential Evolution (SADE) ﬁne tuning scheme.<br/>After a successful demonstration of its improved performance on several multi-modal test functions, the enhanced Genetic Algorithm (eGA) is used to tackle two common non-linear geophysical problems: static correction and Common Reﬂection Surface (CRS) stacking. In the former, the near-surface related time-shifts are estimated without resorting to an explicit velocity-depth model; instead, the events of interest are aligned in a data-driven fashion by maximizing the stacking power. The latter is a novel alternative to the traditional Common Midpoint (CMP) stacking that has proven to yield higher quality images, specially when applied to low Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) data or data with challenging structures like the anomalies encountered in the subsurface. This improvement in the quality of the stacked image is attributed to a non-local mean mentality, which enables using traces from diﬀerent CMP gathers to the CMP gather being resolved.

Since computational resources are limited, the inversion for large field surveys can require immense computing times. One approach for reducing the computing times of forward simulations is the reduced basis method. It splits the problem into a parameter-dependent and parameter-independent part, which allows a precomputation of the parameter-independent part to speed up the calculation. Since the method of reduced basis has not been applied for the problem of electrical resistivity tomography so far, the question arises if and how it is applicable for this problem. Therefore, I performed forward simulations of the electrical potential distribution using the finite elements method and simulations using the reduced basis method for comparing the results. The methods give similar results, but unfortunately deviations above 1*10^4 occurred, while the error tolerance of the reduced basis method is set to 1*10^5. Since the reduced basis method has been successfully applied on other applications, I assume that the problem is in my reduced basis simulation and can be solved by more fine tuning. By comparing the computing times of the simulations, a speed-up of 109.512 is achieved by using the reduced basis method. Furthermore, the pay-off is reached after 8.803 simulations. During the project, I noticed that only considered the resistivities of the subsurface as a varying parameter in the reduced basis is not sufficient. The source position needs to be a variable parameter in simulations of the electrical resistivity tomography, as well. This is necessary to tap the full potential of the reduced basis method in the application of the electrical resistivity tomography. The reduced basis method gives significant speed-ups and therefore, it has the potential to reduce the computing times of electrical resistivity tomography inversions.","Inverison; Electrical resistivity tomography; Reduced basis method; Finite element method","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper, the development of a new rotational to linear transmission technology, called the ring screw, is described, and its real-world performance is evaluated experimentally. The ring screw consists of freely rotating rings that constrain a rod to a screwing motion. The line contact between those rings and the rod allows for perfect rolling, resulting in a highly efficient screw transmission. The theoretical performance of the ring screw for the metrics maximal velocity, maximal thrust force and mechanical efficiency <br/>are explored analytically. Based on these performance metrics, this paper presents a method to find the optimal design parameters when the desired properties are provided. A prototype was evaluated in a custom developed test rig. In these experiments the ring screw is proven to be able to operate at 15,000RPM and deliver 750N with an efficiency of 90%.

One of the primary steps in constructing offshore wind farm is the pile installation which is a high-risk activity due to the expensive offshore installation vessels requirement. Any factor which can result in delaying the pile installation process will lead to financial losses. Therefore, a comprehensive driveability analysis using an efficient pile model is favourable. From the driveability model, the suitable pile equipment can be selected consider the underlying soil condition. The selected equipment must be capable of installing pile into the target depth without overstressing the pile within the design time. <br/><br/>An essential component in driveability model is to estimate the static resistance to driving (SRD). The SRD in analogues with axial static pile capacity approaches. These approaches use the Cone Penetration Test (CPT) data to determine the axial pile capacity. Factors such as the friction fatigue effect, stress equalisation and soil plugging are related and affect axial pile capacity. These factors are integrated into driveability analysis in this study to provide a more reliable result when using CPT-based approaches to calculate static axial capacity.<br/><br/>Pile installation data records from Blessington, Ireland are used as a part of the axial static load test programme. Pile load tests have been performed on open-ended steel piles with a diameter of 0.34m. The site condition consists of glacial deposit dense sand. From this database, the performance of driveability models by using the available and modified CPT-based approaches (e.g., the UWA-05, ICP-05, and Fugro-05) are assessed in this study. The modified model considers the friction fatigue effect, the pile ageing effect, the soil plugging condition, the pile tip mobilisation and the base residual stresses while the SRD is calculated by using the available CPT-based approaches.<br/><br/>The recent CPT-based axial static capacity methods are investigated to see if they can be used as a reliable method to determine static resistance to driving (SRD) profiles. The SRD profiles are comparable to the axial static capacity approach which account for the pile ageing effect, the soil tip displacement, and residual stresses during driving. The pile ageing effect that is incorporated in the model as installation resistance is set for the time equals to zero, unlike with the static capacity load test which is derived after a certain time after end installation. The total resistance that is recorded for open-ended small diameter piles is calculated to model the pile tip mobilisation which is associated with the base resistance. The residual base stresses are modelled for each hammer blow during driving. The wave equation analysis uses a combination of the SRD profiles and dynamic soil components, pile properties and installation equipment resulting in total resistance as the blow count prediction. <br/><br/>This study provides information on how to model driveability analysis from the recent CPT-based axial static capacity approaches. The models one modified to include related factors that affected pile installation process. The performance of predicted blow counts result from unmodified and modified CPT-based methods are appraised and compared to the recorded blow count as a model verification. The UWA-05 modified model can be considered as an appropriate model to estimate pile driveability from CPT-based axial static capacity approach.","Pile Driveability; Static Axial Capacity; Sand; Base Resistance - Displacement","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

To compute these operators an estimate of the first arrival of the redatuming operator is required. This can be done using the same model as is used for traditional migration. We then propose to delay the need for such a model and remove free-surface and internal multiples in one step while retaining the primary reflections at the original two-way traveltime. We modify the amplitude by removing the transmission effects at both sides of the equations. The resulting data becomes full focusing functions in terms of pressure and velocity at two-way traveltime, respectively.

Moreover, Bayesian inference is increasingly utilized to model geological data, enabling the consideration of all available information and a quantification of uncertainties. In order to combine unsupervised segmentation of well data with 3D geological modeling, a fully automated approach to directly create threedimensional structural models from raw well data is intended and, further, tested on synthetic data with different standard deviations.<br/>For this purpose, unsupervised segmentation, which considers the statistical nature as well as the spatial correlation of the data, is combined with a zonation method that extracts interface information from clustered data by maximizing probabilities within continuous zones. This data is then screened to automatically obtain geological information and, furthermore, is inserted into the structural modeling algorithm, which is based on implicit potential-field interpolation while at the same time honoring the geological spatial continuity.<br/>It is shown that unsupervised segmentation is capable of segmenting raw well logs and that the zonation appropriately determines boundaries between stratigraphic units. Model reconstruction demonstrates that the fully automated process is proffcient at recovering several common subsurface structures. Moreover, the implementation of a three-dimensional model in the segmentation process, filling the empty space between boreholes, reduces uncertainties in the geological modeling routine. The combination of unsupervised segmentation and 3D geological modeling, resulting in a fully automated process, taking all available information into consideration, is found to be a suitable method in order to build structural geological modeling directly from raw well logs.","Well logs; Segmentation; Modeling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Geophysics","",""

Urban vegetation as a feature in these models, however, is neglected overshadowed by the focus on buildings, so its inclusion in 3D city models is often symbolic. On the other hand, urban vegetation improves the comfort and social well being of a city’s inhabitants and is a resource for sustainable urban growth and an environmentally friendly resource for mitigating the negative effects of climate change, e.g., frequent heat waves, floods from storm downpours and extended dry periods. Trees also mitigate Urban Heat Island (UHI) effects. Urban vegetation’s ecosystem services (ecoservices) as mitigation functions of pollution and negative effects of climate change have propelled research, studies, applications, and simulations that need data and 3D models of existing vegetation e.g., for spatial simulations, to assess the canopy cooling impact to surroundings or to identify areas prone to UHI. In view of these needs, urban vegetation in 3D city models is underrepresented. Guidelines for modelling vegetation are already provided in CityGML, the 3D city modelling standard, but they are insufficient for today’s needs because it has vagueness and focuses mostly on built infrastructures.<br/><br/>In this research, 14 Single Vegetation Object (SVO) Levels of Details (LOD) and four root LODs are proposed. They target to meet different adherence requirements and scales. Their formulation is based on LOD specification approaches, and on a needs analysis that identified the vegetation models and data most commonly required in applications in the urban environment. Vegetation LOD description approaches include semantic 3D modelling standards, industry, and common practices of municipality users which are also GIS data providers.<br/><br/>Current vegetation LOD descriptions approaches fall into two different groups based on the geometry they adopted for their specifications: implicit or explicit, and no one approach fulfills identified needs. Acquisition techniques and demand in IT resources have influenced the definitions of vegetation LODs, the adoption of one geometry type or the other, and the wide use (or not) of certain LODs. <br/><br/>Refined SVO LODs specifications of this research combine the strengths of each group with descriptions that cover beyond geometric specifications. Refined LODs incorporate implicit components, underground representations and reconstruction LODs not defined by any approach. With them, most datasets can be represented by at least one LOD, and modelers can tell what LOD is possible to implement based on the data they already have. For acquisition, it is possible to tell what data is required for a particular LOD, and which LOD can be used to obtain data needed for an application. The broad spectrum of refined LOD allows them to meet different requirements.<br/><br/>A shadow analysis case study was done with implementations of refined SVO LOD specifications. Acquisition from aerial and mobile LiDAR data was done in a workflow that brought the 0D tree inventory of the municipality of Rotterdam to 3D models using mainstream and open source tools. The case study confirmed a quantitative impact in shadow duration and extent by each LOD indicating that each is independently differentiated. Volumetric and non-volumetric models had different shadow over and underestimation impacts. The study further highlighted the properties of the crown of the real-world object that help in choosing a LOD and gave insights offered by lower LOD models. <br/><br/>The implementation of the assorted LODs revealed that while much research has been done in acquiring vegetation parameters from LiDAR data, the many options, methods and algorithms are scattered necessitating a unifying process or tool.<br","Vegetation; Level of Detail; 3D; Model; CityGML; point cloud; parametric; climate change; UHI effect; underground; Canopy; Reconstruction; Shadow; Ecosystems; ecosystem services; Root System; LiDAR; 3D city model; Modelling; Modeling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geomatics","",""

Thus, finding realistic stress-strain behaviour models has been one of the main fields of research in Geotechnical Engineering. However, constitutive equations have become increasingly complex featuring 10 or more parameters as inputs with sometimes small correlations to physical properties (Beaty &amp; Byrne, 1998; Bauer, 1996). Thus, a more data driven approach can be determined to account for that issue. In this thesis, that data driven approach will be attempted by using Neural Networks. The main goal of the thesis is to access if Neural Networks can be used to model constitutive soil behaviour. Specifically, two approaches are used to model stress-strain behaviour of soils.<br/>The first approach is classified as a generic approach because the investigation is mostly focused on which techniques of the Neural Network can help with the modelling of stress and strain behaviour. In that way the Network can be thought of as a “black box”. The prediction after the training of the Neural Network is achieved by dataset retrieved inputs and from inputs that are retrieved from the last step of the prediction. The latter has the objective of replicating the prediction as it is achieved from a typical constitutive model. The aim is the minimisation of errors after training. The feedback and the non-feedback predictions do not produce the same results which imply that the network is sensitive towards a certain input. This is further validated by conducting a sensitivity analysis and by looking into the activation of each node for certain loading cases. Dropout and reassessing the inputs and outputs are attempted to resolve this issue but the results remain erroneous.<br/>The second approach is to create a component based Neural Network. In this case a link is created between the function of the neural Network and typical soil behaviour. The linear elastic model is modelled with a linear activation function. In this case the network is successful in reproducing the full linear-elastic matrix. The linear elastic perfectly plastic model is modelled by connected the linear elastic matrix with a ReLU layer as it is seen in continuum mechanics. The Neural Network accurately predicts the stress-strain relationship. And it can be used to also predict the stress path of “noisy” datasets. However, when trained with noise the signal added to the training dataset is recognised as a pattern from the Neural Network. Finally, the work hardening model does not successfully model the stress-strain relationship as it tends to exaggerate the contribution of the stress input versus the strain input. All in all, this is an effort towards the development of a Neural Network constitutive model with the final aim of producing data driven constitutive models.<br","Neural Networks; constitutive modeling; material model; Artificial intelligence","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-08-08","","","","","",""

As a designer of experiences, I will first research how the Cultural Historical museums currently hold up to that goal of creating authentic experiences. My goal, then, is to design meaningful interactions between the visitors and the island’s culture that will lead to the intended authentic experience.<br/>AnalysisMuseumsAfter visiting 15 museums, a selection was made of the 5 museums to focus on for this project. This selection was based on their potential for experiential travel, and their availability for this project. By conducting interviews with the museums staff, experts and visitors, and by observations of the staff and visitors the research goals were reached. The result is an overview of all museums, their challenges and their potential. The main challenges of these museums is a lack of resources, both financial and human.<br/>VisitorsMany useful visitor insights were collected, and these were used as a base for creating 5 personas. These personas represent different types of tourists; repeat visitors, first time day tourists, both young and old, cultural tourists and the locals, as these are also a significant group of museum visitors. <br/>Cultural ElementsThe relevant Cultural Elements have been identified, and can be divided into 6 main categories and 8 subcategories. For this project mainly the social and cultural elements will be considered to share with the tourists, which include: Language, Religion (Spirituality), Traditions (Cultural Ecology, Food, Music &amp; Dance), Community Life (Pop Culture, Social Behaviour, Ethnicity) Local art (Architecture) and finally History to bring it all together. As all museums have their specialization, and these elements are be a fair way to categorize the museums. Sharing the cultural elements will be the focus of the design.These insights will together facilitate idea generation. An interaction vision and a design vision were the main inspiration during the ideation phase. Brainstorming and brain writing were used as the main methods. The result is an overview of ideas that were based on the analysis, and a few scenarios.DesignTo develop a concept some basic requirements were decided on, and a main scenario was developed based on the scenarios in the ideation phase.<br/>The Curaçao Museum ExperienceThe Curaçao Museum Experience is a multi layered concept that includes both a service, and a product which together will enhance the visitors’ experience. This service has been designed as a base for every museum, with the requirement of some minor customizations per museum. The product is a part of this service to enhance the visitors’ experience. The design will extend the museum experience beyond the actual visit, to start before and go on after the visit. Visitors will get to know Curaçao through the cultural elements, and can identify these inside a museum, and between museums. The main goal is to connect museums and their collection to the cultural elements of Curaçao so the visitors know what these cultural elements are, and what the museum has to offer in each category. The product will add to the current experience, by allowing the visitor to choose their museum experience more consciously. It is also a way to bring the museums of Curaçao together.The product is the physical manifestation of the idea, and serves as a medium for richer experiences. It will improve the visitor experience, and elevate all museums to the same basic level. Involving visitors in the creation of their journey, relating the themes to their own interests and connecting cultural elements.<br/>How it worksWhen preparing for a visit, the visitor can find information about the museums in the brochure, which can be found at several locations, such as the information booth in the city, hotel lobbies and the museums. On the way to the museum the visitor will find visual cues that announce the arrival to the museum. When they arrive at the museum and when paying for a ticket the visitor could take a look at the wooden panel, as the staff member will point it out to them while sharing the usual information and code of conduct. The visitor can take the cultural element cards with them inside the museum. While walking around in the museum they will encounter items with cultural element marker stickers that have the same themes as on their cards. This way some parts of the collection can be highlighted. The information on the cards should be relevant to the collection. After the visit, there is the possibility to reflect/give feedback on the reflection sheet, which replaces the customary guest book.<br/>EvaluationThe design was tested in a simulated context as the museum are not in the same country as the test was being conducted in. The parts that were the easiest to simulate have been tested.The final design triggers excitement, especially the brochure and the cultural element panel. Instructions are a good trigger for the shyer visitors, but absolutely not necessary. The visitors are able to figure it out, but not because of the instructions.There isn’t enough time to see every aspect of every part, but because of repetition of the colors, logos and information, the message is still conveyed in other phases of the visit. The categories and colors are easily recognized through all phases if they have been seen before. The information in the form of a trivia, as it is now, is seen as being sufficient; visitors don’t mind looking up the information themselves.","Experiential; Tourism; Culture; Curaçao; Museum Futures Lab; Museum; Museum Experience; Visitor Behaviour","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

Ultrasonic measurements are one tool for investigation of concrete stability. The goal of those measurements is the derivation of damage sensitive parameters. The way ultrasound diffuses through concrete is affected by cracks in the specimen, so the description of diffusion can show potential damage indicators. Furthermore, the velocity of the wave propagation changes in damaged specimen. With the analysis of the late part of the seismic signal, small velocity changes can be detected and possibly linked to damage. When concrete is loaded, stress and strain change. This is linked non-linearly to velocity changes with the acoustoelastic theory, defining classical and non-classical non-linear parameters as possible damage indicators. In this work, the aforementioned methods and measures are applied to data from loading experiments on specimen of the size and structure of reinforced bridge girders. Ultrasound measurements with embedded sensors, as well as strain measurements were conducted until the girder failed. The analysis shows, that, while the diffusion of ultrasound can be approximated and parameters can be extracted, those parameters are only damage sensitive to some extent and at stages the specimen already shows damages. The velocity changes calculated with coda wave interferometry show a better response when damages appear and local anomalies give information about the location of damaged and extensively strained areas. A link between strain and velocity change shows that the non-linear relation between both measurements can be approximated with a second order polynomial according to the acousto-elastic effect. The parameters of this polynomial are the classical non-linear parameters and accord with literature values. A combination of all three applied methods shows good potential for the setup of a monitoring framework.

They undergo dynamic loads characterized by unsteady aerodynamics. Predicting these unsteady aerodynamic loads has been very difficult due to the non-linear nature of unsteady aerodynamics. Especially when operating near the stall region, these turbine are prone to increased loads because of dynamic stall. Dynamic stall is typically observed when there is a turbulent inflow, yaw misalignment, or severe wind shear causing periodic variations in angle of attack. Nonetheless, the nature of dynamic stall phenomenon is still a topic under investigation. The aim of this research was to investigate the performance of dynamic stall models in yawed and standstill conditions by using current state-of-the-art engineering models and validating the results with the New MEXICO (Model Rotor Experiments under Controlled Conditions) measurement campaigns. The first part of the research dealt with a detailed analysis of the New MEXICO experiments in standstill and yawed flow conditions. This part also encompassed extracting 3D polars from pressure measurements and a spectral analysis to characterize any vortex shedding phenomenon in standstill conditions. The second part of the research was concerned with validating dynamic stall models implemented in ECN’s in-house aeroelastic tool Aero-Module. Three different dynamic stall models namely: Snel, ONERA, and Beddoes Leishman model, were extensively validated and improved using New MEXICO measurements in standstill and yawed flow conditions. Finally, a case study was performed on the AVATAR rotor, using afore-mentioned dynamic stall models, to access their effect on aerodynamic damping and, consequently, in predicting the onset of aeroelastic instabilities. The research was able to shed light on our current understanding of dynamic stall phenomenon and the way we model it, hoping to improve the dynamic stall modeling capabilities in the future.","dynamic stall; New MEXICO; vortex shedding; standstill conditions; AVATAR; WInd turbine; aeroelastic instabilities","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering | Aerodynamics and Wind Energy","EWEM (European Wind Energy Masters) | Rotor Design Track",""

After removal, the residual parts are connected by means of a suture. A leakage of such connection is a severe complication and potentially life-threatening for the patient and associated with a poor healing of this surgical wound. Adequate blood perfusion plays a key role in this healing process and thus lowers the risk of such leakages. Understanding the tissue perfusion is therefore of the utmost importance. By means of a contrast dye, a special light and camera, this perfusion can be made visual, even underneath tissue. This imaging technique can provide the surgeon with essential information via screens that is not visible by the naked eye during an open surgical procedure. However, these images are still subjected by, amongst the perception of the individual surgeon, various external factors. Ideally, we could provide objective information that is not susceptible to these factors. To do so, software and hardware developments are needed. This project contributes to the development of the hardware. Factors that affect this objectification are allotted and it is researched how design can control or even eliminate them. The project focus on two of the major factorial influencers namely; external light and the manner of acquisition. The proposed design includes the means to exclude this external light and a manner to standardise distance from laparoscope to the surgical site. The design serves to assess if controlling these factors truly improves the objectification of the imaging technique in a pre-clinal setup.","Indocyanine Green; Fluorescence Angiography; Gastro-intestinal open-surgery; Objectification; Medical; Product Design; Anatomotic leakage; Anastomosis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-09-07","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

In this technique water is pumped into the rock salt layer through a well and dissolves the halite in situ. Subsequently the brine is pumped to the purification plant at surface level where the NaCl is extracted from the brine after several impurities have been removed. <br/>Near the city of Hengelo, the Hengelo Brine field has been exploited by AkzoNobel since 1933 and based on the technological progress during the years it can be divided into five phases:<br/>1. 1933-1958, 53 wells, 42 caverns; <br/>2.1959-1975, 226 wells, 94 caverns; <br/>3.1976-2005, 213 wells, 72 caverns; <br/>4.2006-2013, 37 wells, 36 caverns; <br/>5.2014-present day, 31 wells, 31 caverns. <br/><br/>The area corresponding to the first phase comprises 42 caverns which have been developed from 50 production wells. The production wells have been drilled between 1933 and 1958 and during later stages 3 appraisal wells have been drilled.<br/>Present-day AkzoNobel pursues stable caverns at the end of their production life. This is achieved by leaving a sufficient thickness of salt in the roof above the cavity. The result is a ductile boundary between the void and the overburden material. The directly overlain anhydrite layer is much stiffer and shows brittle behavior. When this anhydrite layer is not supported by a sufficient amount of rock salt underneath it can potentially collapse. This roof failure occurs when the span of the exposed anhydrite is large enough. The fragments of the collapsed roof layer will deposit on the bottom of the cavern leaving the next roof layer exposed. With each roof layer collapsing the cavern top and bottom attain a new depth. This process is called cavern migration, which continues until the cavern reaches a status where the roof layer is stable either by sufficient support or strength. <br/>Most of the 42 caverns of the phase 1 area have migrated and in five cases this led to significant surface subsidence. Currently AkzoNobel prepares abandonment of the last open wells in the phase 1 area. In order to proof long term safety after closure, the caverns have been examined, simulated, reconstructed, and modelled. By analyzing the available data and scrutinizing a few caverns where extensive migration did occur, the cavern migration behavior and its influential parameters were identified. This report clarifies how the caverns have been reconstructed and how the maximum migration potential is determined with the model. <br/>The phase 1 area comprises the oldest part of the Hengelo Brine field. The wells were drilled between 1933 and 1958. During this phase some of the wells were positioned close to each other, intentionally allowing interconnections. The motive was to complete these wells as doublets, while the rest were setup as single completion caverns. Despite these intentions, the leaching during this phase was performed in a less restrained manner than what is acceptable today. The majority of the caverns in the phase 1 area have established unintentional connections and were completed as series of caverns. Due to this lack of control overmining occurred at some of the caverns and as a result most of the caverns have migrated upwards through the overburden and some induced significant subsidence at the surface. <br/>As the amount of data and especially measurements of these phase 1 caverns is scarce, the caverns needed to be reconstructed to enable a comprehensive analysis. In order to reconstruct the cavern development and final dimensions, the caverns have been simulated based on their historical production and on interpretations of the geology and logbooks. After cross-correlating the dimensions with the available data, the dimensions are used in an analytical model. Considering multiple influential parameters the post-production ‘residual’ volume and dimensions of the caverns are deduced. Thereafter the maximum potential migration is determined using a migration model.","cavern migration; solution mining related subsidence","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-08-07","","","","Applied Earth Sciences | European Mining Course","",""

Assistance systems such as Active Rear Steering (ARS) or Torque Vectoring (TV) are developed to modify the lateral acceleration response such that the vehicle has an improved stability and an extended linear handling region. With this extended linear handling region the vehicle abruptly reaches tyre friction limitations (representing an entry into the vehicle handling limits (VHL)), this can potentially lead to dangerous situations. This thesis aims to quantify driver behaviour when being forced to drive near the VHL, in terms of how often the VHL is entered and what happens after entry. To assess this, a human factors experiment (N = 18) in a fixed base driving simulator was performed. In this experiment three different vehicle configurations were compared: (1) a conventional vehicle (Passive) (2) a vehicle with an extended linear handling region (Active) (3) a vehicle with an extended linear handling region and increased yaw response (Active Sport). In these configurations, the drivers need to drive with a fixed velocity on an oval track with Electronic Stability Control (ESC) switched off. It was expected that a conventional vehicle enters the VHL more often compared to the vehicles with an extended linear handling region. However, when entering the VHL, the vehicle with an extended linear handling region was expected to be more difficult to control due to the abrupt change in vehicle dynamics and corresponding steering feel. The results indicate that the Passive vehicle entered the VHL more frequently compared to the Active and Active Sport configurations. However, when the Active Sport configuration entered the VHL, significantly more road departures and an increased steering reversal rate compared to the Passive configuration resulted. Therefore, it can be concluded drivers enter the VHL less frequently in a vehicle with an extended linear handling region (caused by systems such as ARS or TV). However when the VHL is entered it is more difficult and dangerous for a driver to control compared to a conventional vehicle.","Active Rear Steering; Torque Vectoring; Vehicle dynamics; Lateral accleration; Human factors driving simulator Experiment; Extended linear region; Abrupt change in dynamics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

AerData was experiencing similar problems to the ones that many other Agile companies have when dealing with user integration. The research of this project explores user involvement in Agile environment from several perspectives. The phases of the research comprise: A) a literature review of Agile and User-Centered Design, the main problem of their integration as well as the current existing solutions where Agile and User-Centered Design are successfully combined. B) an analysis of how AerData is applying Agile, and how they are involving users for the creation of the Product Backlog, and how the users experience the involvement. C) An exploration of which information is gathered during the involvement, and how this information is being integrated in the Sprint activities. D) an overview of what areas a high-quality user involvement should address. <br/><br/>After the research was performed, several ideations were made, that were targeting different phases of the user involvement process. These ideas were followed by evaluation sessions with the team members and with the end-users, where the process, the tools needed, the interaction qualities, the steps and the stakeholders were refined.<br/><br/>With all these information, a final design was proposed to AerData: The User Coach for Agile Companies. This process and set of methods comprises all the phases that the company should follow in order to plan and prepare the customer event, gather feedback during the customer event, and analyse the feedback so it can be shared with the end-users and with the development team, until it is finally implemented. The User Coach provides with an explanatory booklet of the process, the templates needed for each phase, and consultation cards that will coach the team members in giving the information needed to achieve the goal of each session. Ultimately, the goal is to allow the team members and end-users to keep track of the feedback and create a connection among them. <br/><br/>In general, the process allows AerData and Agile companies to improve the experience regarding the user involvement, and the relationship with the end-users. Further research should be done regarding the dynamics revolving around the categorized and online feedback, its maintenance and prioritization.

The earliest estimation of lighting show high degrees of noise, leading to grainy images before convergence is complete. Exposure Render is planned to be turned into a web-service, where clients can upload volumetric data to view and interact with it. This necessitates a streaming service, which encountered difficulties regarding efficient compression. Using only JPEG compression to send still frames showed poor compression performance.<br/><br/>To answer this question, it was established what the noise characteristics of the frames produced by Exposure Render are. In addition, a survey was done on recent advanced in screen-space de-noising techniques to see which image-filtering techniques would be effective. This survey concluded that most of the state of the art could not readily be applied to Exposure Render, because the methods either are not designed for real-time Monte-Carlo rendering, or because they rely on additional rendering data, such as surface normals, which are not available in Exposure. <br/><br/>Three experiments were executed, namely a region-experiment on single image regions, where the best filtering methods were selected for local regions only. These were integrated in proposed enhancements to Exposure Render. The second experiment tested the similarity of a converging image sequence, before and after filtering.

The presented controller is implemented in HAWC2 and high fidelity load measurements are produced using the DTU10MW Reference Wind Turbine. Lifetime equivalent load reductions were seen in both rotating and fixed frame components under extreme turbulence, inverse shear conditions and in normal operating conditions. A novel implementation of IPC is also presented where the blade tips are guided along a fixed trajectory to maximise blade-tower clearance. The motivation of this implementation is to reduce the chance of blade-tower interactions for large diameter turbine rotors. The theoretical background used in this study is presented first along with details of controller discretisation methods.

Whilst driving, control is shared between the driver and the controller by translating the controller's desired steering input to additional torques on the steering wheel.<br/>Literature provides several guidelines for the tuning of these torques but not for the tuning of the interaction stiffness around the controller's desired steering input: the Level of Haptic Authority (LoHA), this is usually kept constant.<br/>High LoHA tunings have beneficial effects on the driver performance but result in high conflict torques and negatively impact the driver acceptance.<br/>In this study two adaptive LoHA algorithms are proposed based on Time to Lane Crossing (TLC). By increasing the LoHA in critical, low-TLC, scenarios these should improve performance while also allowing for a larger steering freedom and low conflicts in safe scenarios. <br/>The adaptive LoHA is applied symmetrically (bi-directional) and asymmetrically (only in the direction of the low TLC).<br/>The adaptive algorithms are compared to manual driving, a low and a high static LoHA tuning in a within-subject driving simulator study. Fourteen participants performed a lane keeping task in which lane width varied to influence the safety margins and TLC.<br/>While driving with adaptive LoHA, the mean conflict torque was significantly lower for the adaptive algorithms than for the high stiffness controller and participants experienced lower workloads. However, no difference was found between the symmetric and asymmetric LoHA controller. These results show that adaptive LoHA based on TLC is an effective way to achieve a similar performance as with static LoHA but with lower conflicts and a lower workload.","Haptic Shared Control; Adaptive; driving simulator; Level of Haptic Authority; Human-Machine interaction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This test is originally designed for DB pension schemes. Nowadays DC pension schemes are getting a more prominent role in the Dutch pension system. Therefore an improved design of the feasibility test for DC pension schemes would be beneficial. In this research we search for a new definition for the pension result in DC pension schemes. The pension result is an important part of the feasibility test. We prefer to stay close to the concept of pension result in DB schemes and we conclude that a pension result based on indexed pension entitlements is an appropriate definition for DC pension schemes since it measures the maintenance of purchasing power similar to how it is done in the current feasibility test. We investigate how robust this new definition of the pension result is by considering an alternative premium policy, an alternative investment strategy, an alternative pension payment policy and an extension of the financial market model. All factors have an influence on the pension result. The pension result is calculated using economic scenarios which are based on the financial market model from Koijen, Nijman and Werker (KNW model). The pension result is highly sensitive to the interest rate and inflation rate development during the pension accrual period and the retirement period. Historical data give a motivation for the use of a jump diffusion model for both the interest rate and inflation rate. These variables are modeled as diffusion only in the KNW model. An extension of the KNW model is proposed in which jumps are added to the interest rate process and the inflation rate process. The addition of jumps influences the pension result in DC schemes.","Pension Result; Defined Contribution; Feasibility test; Pension; Jump diffusion","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics","",""

Liaoning, the biggest economy entity in the northeast, even negative growth in 2015. Two facts should be blamed for, including single industrial structure and rigid governmental and economic system. Main industries in the northeast are resource-based heavy industry and manufacturing, which almost account for half of its GDP. This single economic structure can hardly maintain economic growth when its secondary industry is stagnating and even recession. And that is the situation in the northeast. Another problem is the lack of innovation caused by rigid governmental and economic system. Governmental institution still dominates the allocation of market resources.

This goes hand in hand with the increased demand for well-functioning container terminals. The speed at which containers can be handled on the container terminal is an important performance indicator for container terminals. In particular, the productivity of the Quay Crane (QC)s is used to determine the performance of a container terminal. To achieve a high performance, a well designed schedule of operations is required. This research investigates to what extent a coordinated planning can contribute to increasing the QC productivity. Currently, an uncoordinated scheduling heuristic is used to dispatch the equipment operating on a container terminal. With a coordinated schedule, operations of all equipment working on the terminal can be considered at once to achieve optimal QC productivity. A Hybrid Flow Shop (HFS) model with revolutionary features is used to model the waterside of a container terminal in a coordinated way. The revolutionary features are called: bi-directional and job-pairs. The former enables jobs to move through the HFS in both directions, the latter constrains certain jobs to be performed simultaneously by a single machine. Subsequently, a tailored Simulated Annealing (SA) algorithm is used to obtain a heuristic solution to this mathematical model. The performance of the HFS model in combination with the SA algorithm is evaluated with a sophisticated and validated container terminal simulation model developed by TBA. Therefore, the SA algorithm should balance between both quality and computational time. Computational time should not be excessive since the schedule has to be adjusted frequently since operations on a container terminal vary quickly and predictions with regards to processing times are unreliable. To evaluate the performance of the coordinated schedule, it will be compared with the uncoordinated scheduling heuristic of TBA. Based on the results obtained during this research, the QC productivity whilst using TBA's uncoordinated scheduling heuristic cannot be increased with a coordinated schedule that uses a HFS to model the container terminal and a SA algorithm to solve that model (p-value 0.2731). On the other hand, it can neither be concluded that TBA's uncoordinated scheduling heuristic results in higher productivity compared to the coordinated schedule. Therefore, the coordinated schedule is a solid alternative to TBA's uncoordinated scheduling heuristic. However, it is expected that with certain changes to the coordinated schedule the QC productivity could be increased.","Scheduling; Hybrid flowshop; Coordination; Simulated annealing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The mitigation of uncertainty, which imperils the balance between generation and demand, urges the search of new sources of ancillary services, traditionally provided by bulky synchronous generators. In particular, the coupling of the electricity and gas sectors reveals promising flexibility solutions for power systems through energy conversion and hydrogen storage. The conversion of electrical energy into hydrogen, commonly known as power-to-gas, is enabled by water electrolysis in electrolyzers. Specifically, the Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) technology can react very quickly to demand variations and thus it holds a strong potential for the procurement of ancillary services. This thesis investigates the viability of the integration of large scale PEM electrolyzer capacity into ancillary services markets in the context of the European initiative “Synergy Action TSO 2020”. The current framework of Dutch frequency balancing markets, voltage control and congestion management is reviewed, as well as the future European plans for the implementation of a harmonized and common frequency market. The conducted research includes the assessment of the technical adequacy of PEM electrolyzers with respect to existing prequalification requirements and the proposal of recommendations for the optimal participation in these markets. To illustrate the value of PEM electrolyzer support for electrical networks, a case study based on a realistic representation of the transmission grid of the Groningen-Drenthe-Overijssel (GDO) area in the north of the Netherlands for the year 2030 is presented. The case study is principally intended to examine the effectiveness of the provision of primary frequency control with PEM electrolyzers. The obtained results highlight how this technology can improve the frequency stability of the power system in comparison with synchronous generators, and more importantly for the future, how it can help alleviate the negative effects attributed to the reduction of inertia in the system.","power-to-gas; PEM electrolyzer; ancillary services markets; frequency control","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

Bend-twist coupling effects can prove to be an effective way of reducing fatigue damage and root bending moments for a wind turbine blade. However, how can bend-twist coupling be incorporated into a wind turbine blade considering the many structural requirements? This thesis investigates the optimal design for bend-twist coupling in wind turbine blades. Gradient based<br/>numerical optimization algorithms are applied to obtain composite material layups favorable for bend twist coupling. The thesis work builds a framework that allows for the selection of fiber angles at several sections along the blade, while considering structural constraints. This involves the use of a cross section analysis software and a finite element beam formulation for the evaluation of responses, while an aeroelastic software is used for load mitigation validation.<br/>The structural constraints include tip twists and deflection, eigenfrequencies and material failure criteria of which the analytic sensitivities are calculated, implemented in the framework and validated against central finite difference gradient values. A simple cantilever sandwich beam is considered first as a trial for the framework and four problem formulations are defined to test both the framework and the considered optimization algorithms. A full scale wind turbine blade for a 10MW wind turbine is then subject for the optimization. A converged design for the full scale blade is obtained and subject to aeroelastic simulations in a steady state and turbulent inflow. From this, the load mitigation effects are observed and discussed. With the work done in this thesis project, a step closer to an effective framework for aeroelastic tailoring is achieved.","Optimization; Wind Turbine Blade; Bend-twist coupling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""
