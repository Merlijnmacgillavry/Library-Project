This study tries to increase the understanding of this decision-making process, and how organizational factors and individual perspectives influence this process. The Global Information Security Survey has been subjected to a latent class analysis to find investment strategies and organizational factors that influence these. Four different investment strategies were identified and mainly differ in their initial investment and change in the coming twelve months. Organizational factors that influence these investment strategies are size, revenue, type (public/private) and budget and other factors as regulation, management awareness, incidents and type of risks. We used the q-method to investigate underlying perspectives from decision-makers. Four different perspective were found and differ in their focus on concerns, resilience, hierarchy and flexibility.","cybersecurity; investment; decision-making; perspectives; risk-management","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Value is allocated by the business model that is used to bring it to the market. A business model describes the value creation and capture mechanisms of the firm. In a dynamic world, businesses face potential disruption when confronted with trends like servitization, digitation, Internet-of-Things, or changing consumer behaviour and competitive pressure. This makes that managers and business owners in all kinds of industries are increasingly forced to innovate their business models. <br/>To support managers and business owners in understanding business models and the innovation thereof, tooling has been developed, for instance to assist in mapping a business model, or helping in the transition from an old existing one, to a new business model. <br/>However, most of the tooling has been developed based on what large corporations to; it has not been developed in the context of small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs). Considering the fact that 99,8 % of the enterprises in the European Union are SMEs, and that they combined employ almost two third of the working force, business model innovation tooling is just as relevant in its link with SMEs as in its link with large corporations. Secondly, tooling has rarely been tested by independent researchers. As a consequence, it is unknown how business model innovation tooling, designed for SMEs, is used in a natural setting without direct involvement of the developer. Moreover, it is known that the BMI literature stream emerged from e-businesses. Therefore, it is argued that BMI literature, and consequently BMI tooling, is better applicable to companies from that sector. <br/>The purpose of this study is to test business model innovation tooling with SMEs, without direct involvement of the original developers. In addition, cases are selected from two dissimilar sectors: e-business and non e-business. <br/>To materialize this research, the business model stress test tool is chosen. This tool allows businesses to assess the robustness of their business model, under influence of certain future trends. Results from using the tool are insights in vulnerable business model components, and actions aimed at increasing the robustness. In this context, robustness is defined as the long-term feasibility and viability of the business model.<br/>Based on the literature, it is expected that tooling in general leads to business model experiments. These experiments in turn allow for new insights in the robustness of a business model to be generated. Eventually, those insights are turned into actions, that are aimed at improving the business model robustness. On the long term, actions should be successful in the realization of this goal. Also, barriers are identified in the literature, which could hamper the juncture of the identified steps. Barriers lie outside of the influence of the researcher and include market uncertainty, entrenching, reluctance to change, dominant logic, cognitive capability, bounded rationality, company leadership, etc.<br/>Research design <br/>The stress test tooling has been developed, and is later tested under guidance of one of the developers. Now, this tool is ready for testing by an individual researcher. The research questions questioned in this study is How does the business model stress test contribute to improving the robustness of a business model? This question refers to both if and how the tooling results in an improved robustness. <br/>To answer this research question, a qualitative multiple case design is chosen, which follows a combination of actions design research principles, and a traditional case study approach. The stress test is used in a workshop setting with four different case companies from both the marine (as a representation of non e-businesses) and ICT industry (as a representation of e-businesses). <br/>Workshops are facilitated by experienced creative facilitators, and took place at an external location. Participants included a group of 3 – 6 employees of the case company, with varying backgrounds. During the workshop, instructions of the stress test itself as designed by the developers are followed. However, for the purpose of this research some intermediate steps were added. <br/>During the workshops, the research observed the group and took notes. Apart from the observations, data was also obtained from the results of the workshop, sound recordings of the evaluation afterwards, and two questionnaires that were held with the participants both before and after the workshop. <br/>Findings <br/>Major findings of this study include that business model innovation tooling indeed leads to thought experiments, which in turn results in insights, which results in actions to improve robustness. If eventually the robustness of the company increases cannot be concluded based on this research. A longitudinal study should be held to further investigate the long-term results of this tooling.<br/>During the workshops, the following barriers were found to be present: bounded rationality, cognitive capability, company leadership, dominant logic, organizational culture, and entrenchment. Also, disturbing factors were identified, which include: the role of the researcher and the creative facilitator, focus and involvement of the participants, group composition, incorrect use of the tooling, and the inability of participants to express their opinion. Within the results of the tested hypothesis, and the identified barriers and disturbing factors, no differences were found between e-businesses and non e-businesses. <br/>Based on this research, many recommendations are given on how to improve the business model stress test. Apart from that, also general recommendations are given for designers of tooling. It was concluded that guidance is an important driver of results when using tooling. Guiding of both an experience facilitator and guiding questions are very important to establish the goal of the tooling. <br/>Practical Implications <br/>In this instance, it was observed that the stress test allows manager of technology to be aware of technological trends, before it’s too late. This tool, but also tooling in general allows for a structured process through which insights at various levels of the company can be gained. In that sense, it can be put to work to increase internal support for changing and adapting business model in a dynamic and competitive environment. <br/>Originality and Value <br/>The novelty of the study lies in the testing of BM tooling in a real-life setting without the involvement of the developer of the tooling. Based on the literature it was found that this is hardly done to date. <br","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While developing financial models to price these services it is important to include the impact of Vehicle to Grid operation on the power-delivery components of these Electric Vehicles. Considerable amount of academic research has been focused on understanding the impact of Vehicle to Grid operation on Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs). However, information about the impact of Vehicle to Grid operation on the fuel cells (FCs) of Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles (FCEVs) and Fuel Cell Range Extender Electric Vehicles (FCREEVs) is scarce.<br/><br/>Long term tests are required to asses the impact of Vehicle to Grid operation on these fuel cells. The fuel tank volume limitation of the TU Delft Hyundai FCEV does not allow for long term Vehicle to Grid experiments using the operational Vehicle to Grid set-up at the TU Delft Green Village site. Furthermore, there exist limited control over the power management strategy programmed in the Hyundai FCEV; the power management strategy defining the load cycle it’s Fuel Cell undergoes in Vehicle to Grid operation. This study therefore proposes a method to conduct simulated long term Vehicle to Grid experiments on a laboratory test bench. The method has also been applied, and the impact of simulated Vehicle to Grid operation on the Fuel Cell of the PEMFC test bench estimated. Most importantly, the experimental conditions simulated on the laboratory test-bench were derived from data recorded in the Hyundai FCEV during actual Vehicle to Grid operation. Simulated Vehicle to Grid operation under three aging cycles: high constant load (CC1), low constant load (CC2) and cyclic load (CC3), was found to cause a performance loss in the range of 31.4 μV h 1 to 40.9 μV h 1, 62.5 μV h 1 to 63.9 μV h 1 and 36.1 μV h 1 to 92.4 μV h 1 respectively.","Vehicle-to-Grid; Fuel Cell Electric Vehicle; Fuel Cell Performance; Degradation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Increasing globalization and market competition have forced companies to expand their business networks, moving from local to more complex and vulnerable supply chains. As the key pain point to supply chain management organizations, demand volatility has become a priority to deal with for the years ahead. The phenomenon is commonly referred to variable and unpredictable changes in demand, causing companies risks as excessive capacity and inventory costs. Supply chain leaders are concerned over demand volatility and the often inability to perceive its causes and proactively manage and mitigate them.<br/><br/>Although the recent attention given to the challenge, most literature research in the field fail to deliver a comprehensive picture of the phenomenon and its major drivers. Often, demand volatility is given for granted without digging into its nature, being the focus directly on ”how” rather than ”why” volatility exists. Increasing transparency and visibility on the issue has called the need for the study, performed on the assignment of a leading European semiconductor company, Infineon Technologies AG. Demand volatility has been always a challenge to the sector, whose unique characteristics enhance the complexity of the industry. The management of the company is willing to increase the awareness and responsiveness towards the phenomenon once having a clear picture of the issue and its relevant sources. Therefore, the present Thesis Project aims at exploring the nature of demand volatility, determining and analyzing its causes as well as root causes. The study looks at the challenge from a more holistic view, taking into consideration factors outside and inside the business, either at macro and micro level. As outcome of the research, a volatility model is designed able to measure the extent of volatility, understand and access its causes, and possible counteractions.","Demand Volatility; Root Causes; Model; Supply Chain; Infineon Technologies AG","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Through a collaboration with waste collection company Zanrec a monthly volume of 17 tons (15500 kg) of glass is brought to the bottle-up workshop. From this volume only 160 kg is used to make accessories that are sold to tourists visiting the island. For the remaining 15000+ kg a solution needed to be developed. <br/><br/>Unfortunately the waste glass cannot be remelted in Zanzibar. The significant capital investment required to build a melting facility, paired with the lack of steady electricity supply, and the relatively small amount of glass waste on it island, make it unfeasible to develop in the short term of this project. The search for an alternative solution is the starting point of this project. <br/><br/>Conducted context research led to the desire to transform waste glass bottles into cullet to serve as aggregate replacement in bricks. The bricks with glass aggregate should compete on durability, strength and price with the locally produced bricks.<br/> <br/>Material research was conducted to establish the feasibility of this idea. A lot of scientific research is found on the topic, mainly because of a risk-factor caused by using glass as an aggregate replacement. It causes the chemical alkali-silica reaction (ASR), an expansive reaction that occurs in the mixture when cement paste and reactive aggregate become humid. The expansion causes an increase in volume that generates internal pressures sufficient enough to disrupt and crack the fabric of the concrete. It can decrease strength down to 85% compared its initial strength.<br/>Luckily data reported in literature also shows success mitigating the potential risk of ASR. A fitting solution was found for Zanzibar. The usage of low-alkali cement lowers the pH value and does not trigger the reaction. With the use of this low-alkali cement different sample bricks are made on Zanzibar. These bricks were brought to the Netherlands to conduct compressive strength tests on. The results are compared those of local Zanzibari bricks to find the right balance between economical and mechanical feasibility. <br/><br/>From this research the bottle | brick (bb) was born. The bb is made from the chupa (bottle) mix, containing 35% aggregate replacement with glass, which accounts for 42% of its weight and is at least twice as strong as the local brick. It is slightly more expensive to produce due to the complex set up. A production cost overview is provided outlining the required investments and costs. <br/><br/>A business implementation and process plan was made with which bottle-up could take the bb into production. The initial bottleneck of the recycling process was glass cullet production. To improve the system a glass bottle crusher is created: The farasi machine. This low-tech and cheaply produced machine can process up to 10.000 bottles a day, which is 8 times as much as the current supply of bottles. The machine is designed, prototyped and built on Zanzibar. It is still being operated every day to process glass. bottle-up is considering to further develop the bb and the recycling process next year.","ASR; Sustainabily; Africa; Construction; Waste glass","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","","",""

News articles are created and deleted continuously with a very short life cycle. Users' preference is also hard to model since they can easily be attracted by things happening around them. With all those challenges, traditional recommendation approaches, such as content-based filtering and collaborative filtering, do not work well in the field. Simple recency-based or popularity-based recommenders do work well. However, even the recommender with the highest performance has its restriction. In this work, we build an ensemble model to combine the power of different recommenders. We build up a delegation model on top of several news recommenders based on various contextual bandit algorithms (a combination of multi-armed bandit algorithms and context information). The delegation model is responsible for delegating recommendation requests to the appropriate recommender with the purpose to maximize the Click Through Rate (CTR) from the recommendations and can update continuously with users' feedback. We evaluate the performance of our delegation-model-based recommender in both online and offline scenarios with the evaluation methods provided by CLEF-NEWSREEL Challenge 2017. Furthermore, we also evaluate the response time of our delegation model to see whether it is feasible to run online. The results show that our proposed delegation model can choose the appropriate recommender to serve the incoming requests each time, improve its performance regarding CTR and is feasible to run in real-world settings. Additionally, we also evaluate our delegation-model-based recommender with another evaluation metric, catalog coverage. In our future work, we would like to combine more recommenders and explore more context features to further improve CTR.","News recommendation; Contextual bandit algorithms; Multi-armed bandit; Context; Recommender systems; Online evaluation; Offline evaluation; Ensemble recommender","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These scans are assessed visually, and the fractions are scored according to a 'traffic light protocol'. Based on the magnitude of change, a green, yellow, orange or red colour, in increasing order of severity, is assigned to the fraction. The goal of this work was to ascertain if the colour of the traffic lights, which were assumed to be indicators of anatomical change, correlate to changes in dosimetry for H\&amp;N VMAT treatments, as well as lung IMRT treatments. The in-vivo EPID dose was reconstructed in the patient for each fraction, using a back-projection algorithm that is used clinically at the NKI. Calibrated CBCTs of each fraction were obtained using DIR or anti-scatter grid methods researched at the NKI, which were then imported to a TPS to obtain the fraction dose. These two modes of dosimetry were compared against each other, as well as against the traffic light colours for H\&amp;N treatments. For lung treatments, due to unavailability of CBCT based dose data, only EPID dosimetry was used; two different models of the back-projection algorithm were compared in this case. γ index and DVH metrics were used to express deviation in the dose distributions. Deviations over successive fractions for 18 H\&amp;N treatments were studied. The traffic light protocol correlated poorly with CBCT based dose and EPID reconstructed dose (ρ = 0.33 and 0.35 respectively). The CBCT and EPID dose correlated with each other quite strongly (ρ = 0.72), however the EPID dose was more sensitive in its fluctuations. Deviations for 98 IMRT lung fractions were studied. The traffic light protocol correlated even more poorly with the EPID reconstructed dose than in the H\&amp;N study (ρ = 0.18). The calculated transmission model of the EPID was found to exaggerate the deviations in comparison to the measured transmission model. Since VMAT innately uses the calculated transmission model, this explains the sensitivity of the EPID results seen in the H\&amp;N study. We have shown that the traffic light protocol does not correlate with dosimetric changes, due to differences in assessment criteria. 15 out of 18 H\&amp;N treatments showed moderate (ρ ≥ 0.4), if not strong, correlations between deviations of EPID reconstructed dose and CBCT based dose, strengthening the EPID's applicability for in-vivo dosimetry.","Radiotherapy; epid dosimetry; cone beam CT","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Decreasing the price difference between fossil fuels and bio-fuels remains a major constraint. With 98% of the transportation sector now depending on fossil fuels (oil) as the primary fuel, methanol produced from CO2 and other greener sources is now growing in interest as a more sustainable fuel. This thesis focused on investigating the process biomass gasification, its challenges and its integration with methanol and power production. A number of gasification technologies were studied and the Indirect gasification technology was identified to be technologically advantageous to conventional gasification technologies. The Fast Internally Circulating Fluidised Bed (FICFB) gasification technology of the University of Technology, Vienna was modeled in Aspen Plus®. Different sets of kinetics were studied to improve the accuracy of the developed model in comparison with the data from the 100kW pilot plant at Gussing. The composition of the product gas from the developed model was then validated with the experimental data from the pilot plant if the FICFB gasifier, and found to be accurate up to 3.5%. The principle of Absorption Enhanced Reforming (AER) was then simulated in the developed gasifier by changing the bed material used to dolomite. With dolomite-CO2 sorption kinetics validated with literature, the AER principle in the gasifier predicted a 4% increase in hydrogen composition in the product gas obtained in addition to a slight increase in the cold gas efficiency of the system. <br/>Different processing steps required to convert biomass to methanol were then identified and modeled in the same Aspen Plus® model. The identified blocks, Gasifier, Gas Cleaning Unit, Methanol Synthesis and the Energy network were optimised by performing a number of sensitivity studies. The now optimised model was then used as a common tool to study the effect of choosing different technologies and parameters within the blocks on the overall process behaviour. Four different case studies were defined, each varying from each other by a difference in technology of one of the blocks. Sankey plots for each of these cases were drawn to visualize the energy losses in such complicated systems. Results of incorporating AER on the end methanol yield and the overall efficiency of the process were studied as one of the cases. Dolomite (AER) although very encouraging as a bed material during gasification, was shown to be detrimental to the methanol synthesis process when used as a common catalyst/bed material for the water gas shift reactor. Two different cases of IGCC (Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle) systems were modeled and studied by varying the gas turbine technology employed. A new technology Inverted Brayton Cycle (IBC) gas turbine was simulated against a standard IGCC system. The Inverted Brayton Cycle system was shown to closely efficient to a standard gas turbine system working on product gas from the gasifier. The scale of biomass gasification was then identified as a significant parameter, which would determine the suitable choice of gas turbine technology to be employed. The thesis concluded by discussing some of the more influential parameters observed during the course of this study and recommending further optimization and mitigation steps corresponding to each of these identified losses. The thesis served its purpose by developing a quantitative tool to compare and validate different technological solutions to improve the process of producing methanol and power from biomass.<br","Biomass gasification; Indirect gasification; Methanol synthesis; Integrated gasification combined cycle; Gas Turbine; Kinetic modeling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Wastewater treatment plants need to be upgraded to reduce OMP contamination. Recently, the combination of pre-ozonation and granular activated carbon (GAC) filtration has been proposed as a potential OMP treatment method. The aims of this study are to examine the treatment efficiency of selected OMPs, the effects of an ozonated feed water (second clarifier effluent) on GAC adsorption, effects of ozonation on GAC bed life and to identify the dosages of ozone for the design of a pilot plant. Batch adsorption experiments were conducted. The results show that combining the two treatment methods lead to higher elimination/removal rates of the target compounds. The data obtained in the study was used to plot adsorption isotherms and breakthrough curves to investigate the effect of ozonation on GAC bed life. The study found that ozonation reduces the adsorption capacity of the GAC for the selected compounds. Increasing the ozone dosage from 0.2 to 0.4gO3/gDOC further lowers the adsorption capacity. However, at 0.8gO3/gDOC, the adsorption capacity improves. Consequently, according to COMSOL simulations based on the LDF model, ozonation of the feed water at dosages 0.2 and 0.4 gO3/gDOC results in the breakthrough point occurring earlier than without ozonation. However, a later breakthrough point is obtained with a dosage of 0.8gO3/gDOC. This is likely due to the effect of low post-ozonation concentrations outstripping the effects of a poorer adsorption capacity. Therefore, an ozone dose of 0.8g/gDOC is recommended for the pilot plant while a lower dose could be examined to confirm the findings in this study. Further research is recommended to assess the behaviour of the oxidation by-products and their removal efficiency by GAC filtration.","organic micropollutant; ozone; activated carbon; O3GAC","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Currently, no restorative treatments exist for individuals that suffer from such an injury. However, recent studies have shown epidural spinal cord stimulation (ESCS) to be a potential option for re-establishing some voluntary control. Further research is required to increase our understanding and allow us to investigate the neuronal response to different stimulation parameters. For these purposes, experiments have been conducted in spinal cord injured rats but they suffer from limitations due to the difficult criteria that an electrical stimulation device has to fulfill.<br/>In order to investigate the effect of different stimulation parameters, the system needs to offer full programmability to the researcher. Furthermore, since it is desired to investigate the natural behavior patterns of the animal, they should not have to be tethered to a setup during experiments. Ideally such an experimental setup would be fully implantable, which greatly limits the acceptable size of the system. Moreover, an implantable device needs to operate on a minimum amount of power in order to extend the lifetime of the implant.<br/>Current controlled stimulation (CCS) devices are favored in electrical stimulation applications due to the accurate control that they offer over the injected charge. Nonetheless, they are known to suffer from poor power efficiency due to the highly variable and dynamic range of electrode-tissue impedance. A high voltage compliance is required to provide stimulation to high impedance loads and most devices include a system block to boost up the internal voltage. Therefore, during operation with lower loads, a lot of power is wasted within the system as the excess voltage is dissipated across its current source. Furthermore, high-voltage compliant devices often exhibit large current spikes at the output when driving lower loads, compromising the overall charge control.<br/>The aim of this work was to design and fabricate a fully programmable control unit for epidu- ral spinal cord stimulation in freely moving rodents. The control unit would provide rectangular current pulses to an active electrode array, that was previously designed to be implanted within the spinal canal of the rat. It proposes a novel approach that implements an adaptive voltage compliance in order to reduce the unnecessary power consumption of CCS. Instead of providing a fixed voltage value at its output, the boost converter can be controlled and adjusted to the required value across the load. Moreover, lowering the voltage compliance of the device both enhances the speed of the system and reduces the generated current spikes when operating on lower loads or generating smaller stimulation currents. Thus, it provides safe, charge-balanced stimulation pulses to the tissue.<br/>The fabricated version of the system is 13.5 cm3 and therefore fulfills the size restrictions of a system to be implanted in a rat. Because it is battery-operated, animals can move freely during stimulation, which allows the experimenter to investigate the effect of electrical stimulation during natural behavior patterns. Results indicate that a total power efficiency up to 35.5% can be achieved. Compared to a fixed compliance, the adaptive procedure has been shown to save around 60 mW when operating on lower loads. Finally, the overall system was fabricated using discrete components, which results in an inexpensive product that can easily be manufactured and batch produced.","electrical stimulation; adaptive compliance; freely moving rat; spinal cord injury; implantable; stimulator","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Biomedical Engineering | Bioelectronics","",""

This also applies for the offshore wind energy sector. For current offshore wind energy development locations with monopile-based support structures the fatigue limit state is the driving design criteria. These analyses are connected with long time domain evaluations to cover non-linearities. Model, statistical and data uncertainties lead to a combined fatigue damage prediction uncertainty. The former are either covered by a design fatigue factor or a material factor, which are stated in certification standards, e.g. DNVGL-ST-0126. The influence of mass changes regarding different lifetimes and the impact of this design fatigue factor has not been published yet.<br/><br/>Based on this, within this graduation project, the monopile support structure is optimized for different lifetimes in order to identify mass changes and influences of the design fatigue factor. Literature shows that automatized optimization using genetic algorithms in offshore wind energy is possible but limited, due to the algorithm methodology including a large number of design evaluations. This graduation project shows the applicability of Importance Sampling for load case reduction in a genetic algorithm optimization for offshore wind. Compared to previous approaches Importance Sampling assists to use a full certification procedure for fatigue limit state computations in a feasible amount of time with high fatigue life estimation accuracies. Subsequently, the fatigue limit state load case table is reduced by 93%. By optimizing the monopile with this reduced amount of load cases the algorithm is computationally feasible for the industry. <br/><br/>Rambøll simulation software for offshore wind turbine support structure design is used in combination with the genetic algorithm function in Matlab®. The combination of the software leads to the optimization of monopile based offshore wind support structures for different lifetimes. The algorithm runs with a reduced amount of load cases. Resulting critical fatigue damage values of converged designs are showing deviations from actual fatigue damage values using full fatigue limit state load case tables at maximum 6.6% and minimum 1.7%. This high accuracy leads to an optimization of monopile structures for desired lifetimes and consequently to the mass versus lifetime curve. A mass increase of approximately 22% is observed from 25 to 100 years lifetime. After reaching 75 years lifetime the curve shows a flattening behavior. Besides, parameter evolutions of optimized monopile designs are discussed in terms of different fatigue life. The design variables are embedment depth, cone angle, and corresponding wall thicknesses of monopile sections. <br/><br/>Summarized, this thesis proved the implementation of a full state of the art fatigue limit state computation in the genetic algorithm by Importance Sampling with reduced load cases and also visualized the impact of mass changes for different projected lifetimes. As a conclusive remark, the application of Importance Sampling for load case reduction in the design process opens new possibilities of optimization in the offshore wind energy sector.<br","Genetic Algorithm; Importance Sampling; Monopile optimization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","European Wind Energy Masters (EWEM)","",""

In response to the growing interest in offshore wind in the Baltic Sea and in further validating a state-of-the-art numerical model for ice-structure interaction, the Ice-induced Vibrations of Offshore Structures<br/>(IVOS) project has been coordinated with the Hamburg Ship Model Basin (HSVA) and many academic and industry partners—including TU Delft and NTNU—in order to enhance understanding of the topic via a comprehensive laboratory testing campaign.<br/>In this thesis, specific data are selected fromthe extensive IVOS Phase 2 tests such that a comparative analysis is performed between two different model-scale structures, one with circular cross-section and another with rectangular cross-section, that were subjected to ice-induced vibrations in the frequency lock-in regime. Preceding the comparative analysis, the data from the IVOS Phase 2 tests are organized into a database and post-processing tools are developed to facilitate further research by supplying analysis-ready data sets. Included in the post-processing tools is an attempt to determine ice-induced global loads from uncalibrated tactile sensor data, which offers insight into the relationship between the relative pressure distributions along the ice-structure interface and the ice-induced global forces on the model structure.<br/>The comparative analysis garnered qualitative information about the frequency lock-in regime and buckling failure of ice. It is observed that frequency lock-in vibrations usually persisted regardless of buckling events. For the frequency lock-in regime, the ice-induced global loads on the circular cross-section structure are generally lower than those for the rectangular cross-section structure. It is unclear whether the difference in global loads between the structures is caused by the difference in cross-sectional shape, other structural properties, ice properties, or combinations thereof. The analysis of the energy of the system is intriguing but does not offer lucid conclusions. However, the quasi-figure-eight pattern from the x-direction and derived y-direction structural displacements is an enlightening discovery that may explain inconsistencies in the energy of the system. Based on the general configuration of the test apparatus from the IVOS Phase 2 tests and the results from the comparative analysis, it can be concluded that ice-induced vibrations of the model-scale structures in the frequency lock-in regime should be regarded as a two-dimensional problem.","Ice-induced vibrations; model-scale; vertically sided; cross-section","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2017-10-23","","","","European Wind Energy Masters (EWEM)","Ice-induced Vibrations of Offshore Structures",""

However, applications exist, for example in satellite communication, where a symmetric pattern is not needed or even unwanted. This angular selectivity can be achieved using asymmetric elements.

Although designs of under-sampled antenna arrays achieving an asymmetric active element pattern have been presented in literature, the fundamental properties of this type of arrays in terms of radiation characteristics have not been investigated in detail. This thesis studies the asymmetry in the active element pattern of a finite linear array of asymmetric elements. To this end an in-house method of moments code is developed in Matlab to simulate tilted dipoles in free space and in the proximity of a ground plane. The dependency of the asymmetry of the active element pattern on the inter-element distance, the skew angle of the elements and the number of elements in the array is analyzed and design rules are derived.

The Z-shaped dipoles are analyzed using a method of moments code based on horizontal and vertical dipoles.

However, this trend comes with a cost: the on-board software complexity of the space missions has increased. The complexity has origins in the requirements of the missions where in general, these are coordination and control-related processes. As the coordination and the control of the satellite's activities are not trivial tasks, the Multi-Agent Systems(MAS)-approach has been proposed as a new architectural style due to its distributed nature. There are several existing frameworks for implementing MAS-based applications, however, most of them are neither designed to satisfy real-time requirements nor designed to be implemented in highly-constrained embedded systems. Therefore, the purpose of this thesis is to develop a new tool for MAS-based applications: A Multi-Agent Framework for Embedded Systems (MAES).<br/><br/>The framework was implemented on top of a Real-Time Operating System: TI-RTOS, therefore, applications implemented with MAES have realtime characteristics. Experiments have shown that the execution time of an Attitude Determination algorithm is consistent on each call with a variance value of the order of 10^5 [s^2], demonstrating the predictability of the framework. Furthermore, the user coding effort is reduced as several routines are standardized and encapsulated into MAES' API. However, the predictability and ease-of-use come with a slight cost: experiments have shown that MAES-based applications lead to an increase of 6.7 KB in average in Flash memory and 4.5 KB in average in SRAM memory with respect to its non-agent implementation. Also, the CPU utilization increases as inter-agent communication requires additional processing time, also increasing the power consumption. However, the increase is low as the results have shown that is less than 1% in average.","MAS; embedded systems; real-time; agent; multi-agent; mapping","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The foundation accounts for up to 35 % of the total installation cost of the wind turbine. The monopile foundations are the most commonly used support structure with diameters up to 6m and Embedded length/depth (L/D)&lt;7. Proper modeling of the soil-structure interaction (SSI) is important for safe and efficient design. With the introduction of large diameter rigid monopile foundations, the applicability of the current design standard is in question. The current industry standard model for SSI for laterally loaded monopiles is the Winkler foundation model. In this model, the soil is idealized as a row of one dimensional discrete springs spanning along the beam. The stiffness of these springs is obtained using empirically derived p-y curves, which gives the relation between the soil-pressure (p) and deflection (y). The p-y method describes the construction of the p-y curves for any arbitrary set of soil parameters. This method has been applied in the oil and gas industry and is based on field tests conducted on slender piles with diameter 2m. Various studies on the applicability of the model have shown to give erroneous results for large diameter monopiles. Since the soil is idealized as a row of discrete (local) springs, it neglects the continuous (non-local) nature of soil. Additionally, monopiles with L/D &lt;7 exhibit a more rigid behavior and hence industry standard assumptions for laterally loaded piles with respect to vertical tangent criteria and 'zero-toe-kick' do not hold on. A plane strain semi-analytical model is developed which considers the continuous (non-local) nature of soil as well as the soil below the pile toe/tip, which could be significant to the dynamic behavior of the monopile foundations. In this approach, the pile is modeled as an elastic rectangular plate which is discretized using modified Euler-Bernoulli beam elements. and the soil is modeled as an elastic continuum waveguide. The two entities are combined via the discretized interface. Assuming wave motion in soil, semi-analytical solutions satisfying homogeneous and inhomogeneous boundary conditions are obtained for the waveguide, which are used to derive the frequency dependent soil stiffness matrices at the interface. These are then coupled to the plate. For the current study, the L/D ratio of the plate is restricted to the flexible regime, due to the availability of a comparable reference solution in this regime. It is shown that, with L/D ratio of 12.5 already, the dynamic behavior of the plate is sensitive to the soil below the tip. Therefore, with smaller L/D ratios, it is expected that the tip will have a significant influence on the dynamic behavior of the pile.","Soil-Structure Interaction; Monopile; Hybrid Method; Offshore Wind","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-09-25","","","","","",""

However, the designs of existing ultra-thin (diameter &lt; 1 mm) steerable needles require axial rotation of the needle to steer in 3D space causing needle twisting, which results in difficulties in needle trajectory control. Therefore, the goal of this paper is to design and experimentally evaluate an ultra-thin steerable needle, which can steer omnidirectional without the need of axial rotation.This study describes a new way of ultra-thin needle steering by a retractable steering mechanism inside a flexible cannula. The steering mechanism prototype consists of three Nitinol wires with a small custom-made curvature at the tip to increase the internal bending moment. Pulling one or multiple elements results in reorientation of the tip , thereby allowing to steer without axial rotation of the needle. An experimental prototype was made, which includes the needle together with a control unit. The final needle prototype has a total of three elements to steer in three-dimensional space and has an outer diameter of 0.5 mm.The prototype was tested in porcine gelatine phantoms (10 wt%) to evaluate the performance of the needle in terms of steering direction and curvature. The needle was able to steer towards the direction of the retracted element. Increasing the level of element retraction resulted in a higher steering curvature.The maximal median deflection was 62.76 mm for an insertion of 65 mm into the gelatine. The proposed needle showed good potential in omnidirectional steering with high curvature and it is able to follow multi-curved trajectories. Future improvements can be done to refine the design and make it user-friendly. Possibly, this will allow the proposed needle to compete with ultra-thin standard bevel-tip and pre-curved needles.","steerable needles; percutaneous procedures; medical needles; thin needles; soft tissue steering","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-11-29","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2017","Introduction: High Dose Rate (HDR) Brachytherapy is a radiotherapy modality that involves temporarily introducing a highly radioactive source into the target volume with the use of an applicator. With respect to HDR brachytherapy for prostate cancer, an 192Iridium source is driven into the target volume through catheters implanted into the prostate. The dose delivered to a point in the prostate depends on the time the source dwells at a given position. Treatment planning for brachytherapy involve the optimization of dwell times and dwell positions. The aim of the treatment plan is to deliver the prescribed dose to the target volume, the prostate, while minimizing the dose to the organs at risk (OAR), namely the urethra, bladder and rectum. In current clinical practice, the process of treatment planning involves the manual manipulation of the parameters of an optimizer until the desired dose distribution is achieved. This implies that the plan quality depends on the experience of the planner, and there is variation in plan quality between planners. The aim of this project was to develop an automated treatment planning system that would able to generate clinically acceptable plans with minimal human intervention. The brachytherapy treatment planning module is named B-iCycle and may be integrated in the future with the treatment planning software suite, called Erasmus-iCycle, developed at the Erasmus MC.<br/>Materials and methods: At the core of the treatment planning system (TPS) is a precise and fast dose engine that is able to simulate the dose to be delivered. In this project, we employ the TG-43 dose calculation formalism as it is the most widely implemented method in dose engines for brachytherapy treatment planning systems. The dose engine is then verified against the dose engine of the clinical treatment planning system. B-iCycle uses the 2-phase ϵ-constraint (2pϵc) algorithm to optimize the dwell times and positions. The 2pϵc algorithm requires a ‘wish-list’, which encapsulates the treatment protocol as goals and constraints for each critical structure. For this project three treatment protocols were chosen, four fractions of 9.5 Gy, single fraction of 19 Gy and single fraction of 20 Gy, and wish-lists were generated for each protocol. Three patient groups with different catheter geometries were selected. Treatment plans were generated for each patient and compared against the plans that were generated, for the same patients, in the clinic. The treatment plans that were generated in B-iCycle were then exported to the clinical treatment planning system (Oncentra from Elekta) to obtain the dose characteristics. The plans were compared based on the dose characteristics and the Conformity Index (COIN). The plans were also verified by a radiation oncologist.<br/>Results: The TG-43 dose engine was successfully verified against the clinical dose engine. The Gamma analysis showed that only 0.68% of the voxels failed the gamma analysis and these voxels were located within the catheters therefore they can be ignored as no tissue lies at these positions. With regard to plans that were generated, the physician confirmed that the clinically acceptable B-iCycle plans are very comparable to the clinical plans. The B-iCycle plans are better at minimizing the dose to the urethra. When comparing B-iCycle plans to the clinical plans using COIN, B-iCycle was found to be better than the clinical procedure. B-iCycle can generate a treatment plan in approximately 10 seconds, which is much faster than the clinical procedure, which averages at 10 minutes. It is also able to avoid the issue of treatment planner variability and is able to generate consistent, high quality treatment plans.<br","brachytherapy; Treatment Planning; prostate cancer; HDR","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-09-29","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

This can lead to high savings on fuel costs, productivity, CO2 emission and engine life, but is associated with limitations on mine planning. The purpose of this thesis is to determine how trolley assist can be accommodated into strategic mine planning, in view of optimizing the Net Present Value (NPV). This was investigated by assessing the impact of relocating the trolley infrastructure on the mine schedule and NPV, using GEOVIA Whittle for a theoretical case study concerning a Ghanaian gold mine. The outcome of the case study was that a diesel only scenario yielded the highest NPV, meaning that the operational savings of trolley assist were not high enough to offset the required capital investment. The comparison between two trolley assist scenarios with a different time period of trolley line relocation resulted in a slightly higher NPV for the scenario with a delay in movement of one period, relative to the original trolley assist scenario. To account for the trolley infrastructure in the scheduling process, increased mining cost adjustment factors (MCAF) were used on the trolley line locations. This methodology was found adequate for the Ghana Gold case, but it requires detailed knowledge on the planned (re)location of the trolley infrastructure. It was found that delaying the trolley line relocation by one period only caused minor changes in the mine schedule and operating costs of the Ghana Gold case, justifying the slightly increased NPV for the delayed trolley assist scenario. However, considering the proportion of the total project value, the difference between the NPV's of the assessed scenarios was negligible. The results of the case study did not deliver enough support for the hypothesis that incorporating trolley assist in the long-term mine plan is key in achieving an increased NPV with trolley assist. Nevertheless, it is clear that the feasibility of trolley assist is not a simple offset between capital investment and operational savings. Most limitations of this research resulted from the complexity of the Ghana Gold block model and the poor availability of detailed cost data.","trolley assist; strategic mine planning; haul trucks; open pit mines; scheduling; Whittle; NPV","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-09-29","","","","","",""

It’s universally acknowledged that as- quenched martensite possesses poor ductility and impact toughness, which should be tempered before putting into application. During tempering, as-quenched martensite changes from a hard and brittle microstructure to more ductile and softer microstructure, leading to improved mechanical properties for manufacturing. Bainitic microstructures is less sensitive to tempering in the improvement of mechanical properties, while the explicit tempering effects are still unknown.<br/>The primary goal of the current research is to study the effect of tempering on the microstructure and properties of martensitic and bainitic microstructures developed in the same low carbon steel with high content of silicon and manganese (0.2wt.%C- 2wt.%Si-3wt.%Mn). Results show that for tempered martensite, the hardness, yield strength and tensile strength have a decreasing tendency with higher tempering temperatures. Through tempering, martensite became more ductile at the expense of strength. Based on the literatures, transitional carbide precipitation is expected to take place instead of cementite at early stage of tempering due to the retarding effect of high silicon content. Investigations also show that bainite is less sensitive to tempering compared to martensite. The yield strength and elongation firstly increase due to the TRIP effect of retained austenite and then decrease with higher tempering temperature. Hardness and tensile strength have a similar decreasing tendency as martensite during tempering. The fracture modes of tempered martensite for all temperatures show a typical ductile fracture, while for bainite, a morphology of quasi-cleavage fracture is observed.","Tempering; Martensite; Bainite; Silicon effect","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

An important condition for optimal operation of container terminals is that Quay Cranes (QCs) maximize their productive time, which requires a minimal lateness of Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs) that bring and pick up containers at the QCs. In this research, the AGV driving strategy is investigated in order to reduce the time QCs are waiting for an AGV.<br/>A route plan scheduling module for AGVs is developed, in which the central system plans the driving positions of AGVs in advance, and determines in what order AGVs should cross intersections. For priority determination, a first-come first-served strategy is compared with an advanced priority strategy that gives priority to AGVs that are late or have an important job, like bringing a container to a QC. Furthermore, the impact of AGVs' greediness for crossing intersections is investigated by comparing a greedy strategy with a non-greedy strategy.<br/>By testing the priority and greediness strategies in a state-of-the-art simulation environment that was extended with our route plan scheduling module, it is found that advanced priorities reduce QC waiting time and improve QC productivity compared to the first-come first-served priority strategy. The non-greedy strategy gives a small decrease of the AGV driving delay compared to the greedy strategy. To investigate the full potential of using advanced priorities in a system with route plan scheduling, the route plans should better predict the AGV driving behavior, for which we suggest to use a more detailed AGV planning strategy. Finally, we discuss that AGV driving with reduced inter-vehicle distance is a promising approach to improve terminal performance.","Container terminal; automated guided vehicle; scheduling; planning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-09-21","","","","","",""

During the past century, urban expansions took place without any special regard towards existing cultural heritage expressions. Despite the significant role of heritage in shaping societal cultural identities and the extensive space that occupies within the built space, it is not taken into consideration in strategic planning. As a result, a great amount of cultural heritage remains unrecognized and ignored. Meanwhile, the urban transformations have been immense and largely unsustainable, in ways that consumed the natural environment and endangered the future development of the city. The aim of this research and design project was to highlight the latent potential of cultural heritage as a driver of urban redevelopments focused on sustainability. To explore this argument, the project took as case study the periphery of Piraeus in Athens metropolitan area, Greece and examined the relevant concepts and proposals at the metropolitan and local scale. The process of research, analysis and design was a continuous dialogue between two basic lines of narrative, namely the cultural heritage and the sustainable urban development. The research and design process employed various methods, according to the needs and challenges of each topic. The findings led to the elaboration of a strategy for the periphery of Piraeus comprising guiding principles, design solutions at the local scale and governance arrangements. The final structural and design proposals included: i) the recommendation of a new definition and a two-level system of official designation of cultural heritage elements; ii) a set of guiding principles for sustainable urban development at the metropolitan scale; iii) a design solution for Apollon neighbourhood, which acted as a showcase of the principles’ applicability; iv) the development of a national inventory and the implementation of pilot projects, as counteraction to the governance challenges.","cultural heritage; new heritage definition; urban sustainability; sustainable development; governance and heritage; Agios Ioannis Rentis; Piraeus; Athens; Greece; strategic planning; urban planning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Urbanism","","European Post-Master in Urbanism","",""

The massive integration of renewable energy sources, the operation of the current grid close to its limits and the need to facilitate the power trade are some of the reasons driving the research on HVDC grids. Towards HVDC grids, there are still some obstacles and technical limitations to be confronted. To address these problems, the idea of a DC hub is introduced. A DC hub is a multiport DC-DC converter, which serves as an actively controlled DC node. The basic parts of the DC hub are the ports, where AC/DC converters are used and the intermediate AC link. Until now there is no standardization of HVDC grids and thus, if different projects need to be interconnected a DC-DC conversion is necessary. A DC hub can offer solutions in the connection of HVDC lines with different voltage levels and different configurations. Moreover, it can facilitate the power exchange between any two HVDC lines connected in the DC hub. This thesis deals with the development of a DC hub model and its study under transient phenomena. More specifically, the ability of the DC hub to aid in the protection of HVDC grids is examined.<br/>The first step to address this problem is to propose the most suitable multiport DC-DC converter topology. A literature review over different DC-DC converter topologies took place. The advantages, disadvantages and the ability to upgrade into a multiport DC-DC converter are examined. The most promising is the front-to-front topology where either a transformer or an LCL filter is used. Although the LCL DC hub offers small footprint and fault ride-through capability, its efficiency depends on the level of active power flow and its expandability is limited. In the current thesis, the front-to-front topology with an intermediate AC transformer is studied.<br/>Before studying the DC fault response, the basic attributes of the DC hub must be acquired. A three-port DC-DC converter is designed where the state of the art modular multilevel converter is used in every port. The model operation is validated through step reference changes in the AC voltage, DC voltage, and active power. Moreover, the control role distribution is suggested, where the port with the higher power rating operates in AC voltage control mode. Being one of the main attributes, the connection/disconnection of a line without disturbing the operation of the DC grid is presented. For a smooth transition, the suggested steps are presented. The next step is to study the natural DC fault response of the DC hub. In the case of pole-to-ground faults, a design methodology is presented in order to acquire fault ride-through capability. Finally, the pole-to-pole fault contingency study leads to useful conclusions. A design methodology of adding large phase reactors between the converter and the transformer is suggested in order to limit the large fault currents. <br/>The main contributions of this thesis are the following. First, a DC hub average model, using three modular multilevel converters in front-to-front configuration is provided. Moreover, the DC hub response to line connection/ disconnection is studied and steps are suggested for a smooth transition. Finally, after studying the natural DC fault response of the DC hub, the design requirements are provided in order to acquire fault ride-through. <br","MMC-based; MMC,; DC Hub; protection; HVDC","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Taking the best from machines and humans and joining them together can produce results which exceed each collaborating partner performing separately. A common belief is that the<br/>key for good cooperation is an excellent communication. Some important aspects of communication are self-evaluation processes. When applied to humans these processes improve the communication quality between humans. Therefore, we believe that employing self-evaluation processes at machines<br/>advances the human-machine communication, and cooperation quality. Accordingly, this thesis is exploring communication strategies between machines and humans. More precisely, it examines possibilities for the communication improvement through an exploration of self-evaluation processes of classifiers.<br/><br/>Firstly, we introduce a baseline framework, an interactive visual category learning architecture, called Tubby at Honda Research Institute in Germany. For simplicity we consider in a first step the classification of objects rather than the more difficult task of learning multiple categories per object. We then introduce theoretical foundations used in the thesis. The background on classification, neural networks, outlier detection and assessment of classifiers is explained in depth. We outline the critical importance of self-evaluation in classification. Therefore, we propose two self-evaluation measures which are incorporated within a testing and a training strategy. The first measure captures a confidence<br/>in predictions during classification and it is used within the proposed testing strategy. The second measure denotes the quality of each training sample with respect to the generalization performance of classification and it is used within the proposed training strategy. The quality of the training sample essentially represents how different the current training sample is from all of the previously acquired training samples of the object. The confidence and the quality measure are communicated through a graph to the user of the system. Depending on whether the system is in the testing or training phase the value of the corresponding measure is provided to the user. Two ways of deriving each<br/>of the two measures are presented. Essentially, we offer two testing and two training strategies. Furthermore, we consider each proposed strategy separately and a combination of those. We then evaluate all of the considered cases against a baseline strategy. The evaluations are performed in different dimensionalities of the feature space for different numbers of training and testing objects. We present an offline simulation of the interaction between Tubby and the user. Results of the simulation provide additional insights into the working mechanisms of the proposed strategies and measures.<br/><br/>The proposed strategies improve the baseline performance. The absolute improvement of the average classification accuracy varies between 1% and 25%, depending on the dimensionality of the feature space and number of training and testing objects. The best results are achieved when a combination of the proposed training and testing strategy is used. The biggest improvement is observed when a lot of objects are in the learning process (≈ 100), and the dimensionality of the feature space is high (≥ 10D).

It is sufficient for a stationary discrete formulation to comply with the differential equation and the interface jump conditions. However, to apply this approach to solve unsteady flow problems the influence of the reformulated operators on the stability properties of the system should also be investigated.<br/>The properties of the individual operators are analyzed as well as their behaviour when they are embedded in the complete solver algorithm.

The protocol state fuzzing technique resulted to be the most promising approach since it is well-developed and has recently revealed a few abnormal behaviours of SSH [6], moreover it is also actively used in several cryptographic protocol implementations (i.e. TLS). Consequently, we applied this method on an real SSH implementation, the OpenSSH library (OpenSSH6.7-p1). The results are analyzed against the source code and RFC standards. To solve the readability problem of the results caused by the complex architecture of the SSH protocol, we combined the obtained SSH state machine with D3.js data visualization technique.

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2017","Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are unmanned vehicles that operate underwater. These vehicles can be used for various operations, including scanning the ocean floor in order to search for objects. In such operations, the AUV navigates close to the ocean floor, using its sonar systems to map this ocean floor. Before an AUV is launched on a search operation, usually very little is known about the underwater conditions at the search location. Currently, the AUV’s coverage path is often defined before the start of the operation. However, the coverage path depends on the quality of the sonar images, which in turn depend on the unknown and varying underwater conditions. Therefore, it is unlikely that the predefined coverage path is optimal. In this final thesis project a coverage path planner is developed, which autonomously adapts the AUV’s coverage path to the changing underwater conditions during an operation. Since the radio waves carrying the global positioning system (GPS) signal do not travel far in seawater, the AUV needs to keep track of its location using an inertial navigation system (INS). Unfortunately, the error on the location measurements obtained from an INS grows over time, causing the AUV’s believed trajectory to differ significantly from the AUV’s true trajectory. As a result, parts of the search area might be believed to have been covered, while these parts have in reality not been visited. Taking the AUV’s uncertain trajectory into account thus increases the complexity of the coverage path planning problem. In order to keep track of which parts of the search area have been covered, and to which extent, a coverage map of the search area is maintained during an operation. This coverage map is constructed such that it takes the uncertainty on the AUV’s location measurements into account. Three different coverage path planners have been developed that use this coverage map to autonomously plan the AUV’s coverage path during an operation. The three different coverage path planners have been implemented in MATLAB, and they have been evaluated in a simulation framework developed by TNO. The simulation results show that all three coverage path planners consistently achieve the required coverage of the search area, in a scenario where no large changes in the underwater conditions occurred. Furthermore, one of the coverage path planners has been evaluated in three scenarios where large changes during the operation did occur. Halfway during these scenarios, either the strength of the underwater currents increased, the required coverage of the search area increased, or one of the AUV’s sonar systems broke down. In all of these scenarios, the coverage path planner successfully adapted the coverage path such that the required coverage of the search area was still achieved.","AUV; Coverage Path Planning; Location Uncertainty","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

It is estimated that about 500,000 migrants cross Mexican border every year. Most of the population is escaping from the extreme violence in the countries known as the Northern Triangle of Central America - Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala. The highest homicide rate indicates the traumatic experience the migrants have been through such as torture, kidnap, gang-related crimes and extortion. Yet, it is ironic that the migrants go through even more violence on the route seeking for safety. On the journey, the people on the move are easily targeted for organised crime, theft, torture and sexual violence. This leads to a serious health condition that challenges both mentally and physically. Meanwhile, a vulnerable status of the undocumented migrants prevents them to actively seeking a protection let alone the access to the healthcare. Since 2012, Medicines Sans Frontiers (MSF), the international medical humanitarian organisation, has been providing medical and mental health care to the migrants in Mexico. Their aim is to address the needs of the displaced people in Central America, who escaped from violence, conflicts or life-threatening policies or practices. These migrants are traveling in order to seek for refugee status in the destination country, mostly the United States of America.MSF has already implemented emergency health posts where the patients can reach out during their migrant journey. However, it provides only a limited access to the medical support which cannot be more than one-time intervention. Consequently, it seems timely and necessary to understand the current situation and the MSF approach and come up with a new and innovative way to provide support and extended intervention.This project has started exploring this challenge with MSF Displacement Unit. The literature research has provided a good understanding of the societal and medical background of MSF operation. In order to understand the context better, the field research has been conducted in Mexico. This led to explore four opportunity areas and start ideation with the field team. In the field, the solutions were briefly tested to determine the final direction. After coming back to the Netherlands, the idea was developed further into the concept. Communicating with the field team, the design was evaluated and iterated. The final design is a card-set “Taking care of your emotions.” It is consist of information about MSF and self-facilitated psychological exercises to serve mental health needs of the migrants during the journey in Mexico. The concept serves these two different objectives; (i) to support the current consultation and (ii) empower the resilient ability of the migrants. The final design was received positively by MSF field team and some of the migrants who participated in the evaluation study.","Mental health; refugees; Mexico; Central America; Design; Medesign","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2017","Maritime hydrodynamics involves strong inertia-driven flows, including free-surface waves, and with Reynolds numbers as high as 109. Numerical modelling of these flows is therefore a true challenge. Especially for the optimization of the design of the aft part of the ship, where viscous effects cannot be discarded. At MARIN, the viscous flow solver PARNASSOS has been developed for this purpose. Over the years, this solver has been optimized with respect to robustness, accuracy and efficiency, which has resulted in a tool capable of doing fast viscous flow computations. However, if the ship's generated wave pattern has to be taken into account, a complete hull form evaluation can still take hours, or even days. For automatic optimization purposes, where hundreds or thousands of calculations are needed, it is thus desired to further accelerate the computing time of this solver. Most of the CPU time for a computation with PARNASSOS is spent on solving the large sparse linear systems of the form Ax=b. These are currently solved using an iterative solver such as GMRES, in combination with a preconditioner to improve convergence rates. Due to the increase in computational capability of modern computers, the performance of the linear system solver could be further improved through use of high performance computing. Especially the Graphical Processing Unit (GPU) seems to have great potential for speeding up such scientific computations. The aim of the work is therefore to investigate whether it is possible to achieve reasonable speedup of PARNASSOS' linear system solver by making use of GPU computing. This investigation was done using both model- and full-scale test cases, both for increasing size of the systems to solve. Performance of different iterative solvers has been analysed on different GPU cards and has been compared against the performance, currently used on the CPU.","GPU computing; Preconditioning; CFD; Krylov solvers","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

The specific cost required to place a spacecraft in LEO is between 10 and 25 k€/kg. Consequently, trajectory optimization plays a major role in the design of a launch mission. Universities, companies, agencies and research centers have their own optimization software and continuously try to improve the existing methods. In this context, the main objective of the presented research is to assess advantages and disadvantages of using a pseudospectral approach for launcher trajectory optimization in an industrial context by applying it to the Vega launcher family, namely Vega, Vega C and mini-Vega E.<br/>The software GPOPS is chosen for the transcription of the continuous optimal control problem and SNOPT for the solution of the associated non-linear programming problem. The launcher ascent problem is formulated considering all the main constraints: angle of attack, pitch rate, aerodynamic loads and heat flux. In addition, the dynamic model includes thrust profiles and drag curves of the aforementioned vehicles. The control to be optimized is the direction of thrust and it is formulated in two different ways, allowing to select the most suited for the specific application: Cartesian x-y-z components or pitch-yaw angles.<br/>After numerous tests with all kinds of target orbits (Sun-synchronous, polar, equatorial, escape, etc.), it can be concluded that the PS method and the software composed by GPOPS and SNOPT are suited for practical ascent trajectory optimization: first, all the typical constraints are included and fulfilled; second, the problem formulation is general enough to be easily applied to all kinds of configurations (number of stages, types of motors, etc.) and number of phases (single/multiple boosts, coast, etc.); third, problem formulation allows for both payload mass maximization (preliminary studies) and propellant reserve maximization with fixed payload (industrial application); finally, the obtained performances do match perfectly with the performance maps of ELV.

In addition on how to apply process mining, MoD wants to learn the requirements for starting a process mining project.</p><p><br/>The thesis starts with a literature study on eight business process improvement methodologies (BPIs), viz. Lean, Six Sigma, Lean Six Sigma, Total Quality Management, Lean MRO, Total Productive Maintenance, Business Process Reengineering, and Business Process Improvement. These BPIs are compared with each other in an overview based on nine characteristics. Then, a ninth BPI is studied: process mining. The literature on this topic is scattered, but a study is conducted on several element. After that, pros and cons are discussed and process mining is placed in the overview of BPIs.</p><p><br/>A combination of desk and field research leads to the improvement of the best practise methodology PM<sup>2</sup>. And this improved methodology, called PM<sup>3</sup>, is further within MoD. Next to that, a process mining decision framework is developed according to the waterfall model. This framework can score business process models on several characteristics. The resulting total score determines whether process mining can successfully be applied to improve the process.</p><p><br/>For MoD, process mining can be a valuable instrument for improving processes. It can convert a gut feeling into clear numbers and models, which can form the start of an improvement project. It is thus recommended to make process mining available to the organisation.</p><p><br/>The thesis gives a good insight in the possibilities of process mining, but it also comes with several opportunities for future research. For example, PM<sup>3</sup> has demonstrated itself in the field, but this have not yet led to measurable improvements (only important insights in the processes). Future research is required to verify its true potential. Second, the decision framework is tested by assessing fourteen of MoD’s processes and evaluated by discussion it with ten system experts. Yet again, empirical research is probably the only way to truly verify it, but this was not possible during the thesis. Third, both PM<sup>3</sup> and the decision framework focus on MRO within MoD. It is unlikely that a change of domain or organisation makes a significant difference, but the possibility should be taken into account and further investigated. And finally, a significant limitation of the framework is that it only scores on process mining. So, if it presents a very low score, it does not suggest an alternative BPI. This fell outside the scope of the thesis, but is nevertheless an interesting research opportunity.<br","Process Mining; Business Process Improvement; Defence; PM3; Logistics; Big Data","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

Trust is necessary for effective collaboration between customers and providers and reducing transaction costs, however, in practice this trust is often lacking. From the scientific literature, it becomes clear that there is still a lot of ambiguity about trust in cloud services and that it is unclear which factors influence this trust. Hence, the research question is defined as: which factors influence the trust of an organisation in a cloud service? In order to answer this, first, an analysis of the concepts of cloud computing and trust, and the integration of those concepts in scientific literature is performed. From this analysis, a conceptual model is derived. This conceptual model is then evaluated with a Q-method study on the potential factors influencing trust in cloud services. In general, security, privacy, transparency and the willingness to change the organisation are found to be important factors. Besides the general viewpoints, there are also viewpoints specific to the three perspectives. Techno-optimist perceive technological advantage and interoperability as important, responsibility-shifters perceive contracting and accountability as important and the operational-conservatives perceive technological advantage and reliability as important. The OPF Framework as proposed in this thesis uses these perspectives in combination with the different parts of the organisation: strategic apex, cloud service management, operational IT department and cloud experts. By addressing the main concerns of the specific part of the organisation, in combination with the relevant perspective, it is possible to improve the trust of an organisation in a cloud service. <br","Cloud Computing; Trust; Q-method","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Systems Engineering, Policy Analysis and Management (SEPAM)","",""

Approximately 1,2 million people were known to have the disease in the year 2015. Although most joints affected by osteoarthritis have a eminent treatment, the treatments for OA in the trapeziometacarpal joint (TMC) aren’t proven superior to one another. Because there isn’t a superior total joint replacement for the TMC joint, various implants are on the market, based on different techniques and kinematics. For this reason, Reinier de Graaf Hospital feels compelled to develop a new implant to meet the requirements and design an implant that has a similar durability as current hip and knee replacement. Therefore the main assignment was to design a customizable implant for TMC joint replacement, that restores the anatomical and biomechanical functions of the TMC joint. The process of this graduation project was divided over three phase: the analysis phase, the concept development phase and the concept evaluation phase. To find the parameters to build a customizable implant, the variation of the trapezium, the metacarpal and the trapeziometacarpal joint were analyzed. Statistical shape modelling seemed to be a proper method. During this project a statistical shape model was acquired in cooperation with to Marco Schneider and Ju Zhang, whom developed a Statistical Shape model for the trapeziometacarpal joint. Furthermore, the kinematic characteristics were analyzed in cooperation with the Academic Medical Centre in Amsterdam. 4D CT technology, can visualize the motion of bones in-vivo after segmentation. The TMC joints of three healthy subjects were investigated. The transformation matrices found in this research, could be used to evaluate the concepts afterwards. During the conceptualization phase a customizable implant was designed in Rhinoceros in combination with the Grasshopper Plug-in to generate personalized implants, that resurface the trapezium.

Then design ideas and concepts were focused on “Freestyle working“ behaviour, which had a statement(design goal) as “make passengers see aircraft as means to optimise working and relaxing balance“. Four main activities of “Freestyle working”behaviour are also distilled: working, relaxing, connecting with others and learning.

These two parts must work together to achieve the effect of the statement. The seat part consists of a re-designed tray table and suggested seat headrest change. The tray table has privacy boards, drawers and other functions to support working and relaxing on the seat. The seat headrest helps passengers in Economy class to sleep better and connect or disconnect with others.

However, handcrafting these probabilistic models is usually a daunting and error-prone task, requiring expert knowledge on the domain under consideration. Therefore, it is desirable to automate the process of obtaining these models by means of learning algorithms presented with a set of execution traces from the system. Although some work has already been done on crafting such learning algorithms, the state of the art lacks an automated method of configuring their hyperparameters, so to maximize the performance yielded from executing the derived plans. <br/>In this work we present a method that employs the Bayesian Optimization (BO) framework to learn MDPs autonomously from a set of execution traces, optimizing the expected value and performance in simulations over a set of tasks the underlying system is expected to perform.

It is a 325 km submarine cable which will have the ability to transfer 700 MW. The importance of the interconnector is manifold: to facilitate the exchange of renewable energy coming from the onshore Danish power system. Since electricity demand and supply of wind energy is geographically spread an adequate transmission capacity is essential for the growth of renewable energy. The link will also provide a strong connection that will enhance the security of supply in the Northwestern European region. That is in line with the ambitions of the EU for a stronger interconnected European electricity transmission grid and it will be a backup in case of breakdowns. <br/>Moreover, it will enhance the internal European electricity market. COBRAcable will contribute to the development of the internal European electricity market and specifically contribute to the further investigation of the Northwest European electricity market. Lastly, COBRAcable has been granted a European subsidy for researching and developing activities necessary for the connection of wind farms to the cable. <br/>The main focus of the present thesis is to create a RMS model of the COBRA cable project in PSSE software. The starting point of the master thesis project was a basic model of a VSC station which consisted of the basic VSC converter controllers: the active power controller, the reactive power controller, the AC voltage controller and the DC voltage controller. Gradually, the active and reactive power controllers were upgraded in order to support the special functions of the COBRAcable project. Also, an equation regarding the injection of reactive current was added to implement the fault ride through capability of the converter. In the end, the responses of the final model created throughout this master thesis project were compared against the responses of the model built in Powerfactory, which was created in more detail and was already compared against the results of the EMT model in PSCAD.<br/>The modelling framework for VSC – based HVDC transmission system was initially developed and tested in a benchmark system consisted of two areas. Both areas had three buses connected in a meshed configuration and the performance of the controllers mentioned above was evaluated there. Following the benchmark system, the modelling framework was then tested with a reduced model of the Dutch power system around the Eemshaven region. <br/>Different tests were defined in order to evaluate the suitability of the model and in more details to evaluate the performance of the controllers. To evaluate the performance of the active power controller several cases were introduced associated with the special functions of the COBRAcable regarding the regulation of active power. The reference of the reactive power was changed and the performance of the reactive power controller was tested while using different ramping rates. Moreover, the voltage at the point of common coupling was changed in order to assess the performance of the AC voltage controller. Finally, the equations regarding the injection of reactive current were used to evaluate the fault ride through capability of the converter.<br/>From the simulation results, it was observed that the active and reactive power controllers were able to follow the changes of the reference power quite stably regardless the different ramping rates that were used. The reference changes created a dynamic behavior regarding the performance of the AC voltages of the buses in the Dutch power system. The investigation regarding the AC voltage controller led to the conclusion that there is a limit on how much you can increase and decrease the voltage at the PCC. The equations associated with the fault ride through capability have shown that the converter is actually trying to inject reactive power when the voltage has dropped below certain levels. In the end, the creation of a user – written model of the COBRA cable project in PSSE added an increased level of complexity. The absence of block diagrams with their respective signals as well as the required knowledge of the software made the translation of the control structure of the VSC station from the Powerfactory model difficult.<br","HVDC technology; Interconnector; COBRAcable project; Dynamic Analysis; Modelling; Controller; North Sea; Fault ride through; Active power; Reactive power","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2017","The direct measurement of discharges in rivers can be time-consuming and costly. The discharge is commonly estimated indirectly by means of a curve, relating water level to discharge. This so-called rating curve is traditionally determined by fitting a curve to a number of observations, which induces several uncertainties and difficulties: 1) the curve is approximated by a function type, 2) in general there are no observations for high flow conditions and 3) it needs to updated regularly due to cross sectional changes.<br/><br/>In this research a physics-based rating curve is developed and evaluated that is more reliable and easy to update. By the use of a photogrammetry techtnique 3D surface maps of river banks are generated by pictures obtained from an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). The topography of the main channel is determined by using an Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) or it is approximated by the making use of expert judgement and the method developed by Lane (relates the water depth of the channel to the width and natural angle of repose). By knowing the geometric profile of a river reach, only the roughness coefficient and water surface slope are the unknown parameters to derive the rating curve, where the Manning’s formula acts as the basis of the rating curve. In this way, the rating curves can be made physically substantiated and the calibration parameter is the combination of roughness and water surface slope.<br/><br/>Instead of using the power law function as a approximate function of the rating curve, it is used as approximation of the conveyance-water level relationship. Therefore, the exponents in the power law function are physical substantiated and reduce uncertainties in the extrapolation zone of the traditional method, because the profile during high flow conditions is also known. Further more, the local invariabilities that are specific to single cross-section analyses are minimized by analysing river reaches. It is demonstrated that local invariabilities arises easily in natural rivers that are causing non-uniform flows, which make in general the the open-channel flow analysis much more complex. However, the average conveyance of a reach may led to the a valid assumption of a uniform flow (which is part of the assumption in the Manning’s formula), depending on how the local variabilities behave. The calibration of rating curves are much easier compared with the traditional way. Instead of collecting new discharge<br/>measurements during dispersed flows, you just have to visit the area ones with a drone and surveying equipment. During this visit, the new new geometric profile can be captured and the rating curve can be updated, assuming that the roughness and water surface slope remains constant.","","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","","Additional thesis",""

Extensive knowledge exists in relation to its construction technique as well as its crucial components, but due to considerable cost pressure, continued optimization is essential for the future competitiveness of the concept in the offshore wind business. Their joints along with their complex welds are of special interest in terms of cost reduction. The design of tubular joints is generally driven by fatigue resistance. Due to the size, complexity and cost of these joints, this is assessed by using detailed FE models.<br/>Several aspects that have an impact on the results of the models are found to require further research and are investigated within this project: (1) influence of using solid versus shell elements in the modelling of the joint members; (2) degree of accuracy of the Efthymiou equations; (3) influence of the carry-over effect in multiplanar KK-joints; (4) differences in the fatigue life predictions between the hot-spot and the effective notch stress methods.<br/>Guidelines recommend the use of both solid and shell theories for the definition of the FE models used in the hot-spot fatigue assessment. Both options are compared in terms of accuracy of the results and computational time. Generally speaking, significant differences are found between both models. The background of the differences is studied.<br/>The employment of the Efthymiou formulae is common in practice. These equations provide the SCF at the locations around the weld where they are found to be maximum. The output of this approach is compared with the results of numerical models. The validity of its use is quantified.<br/>Offshore wind jacket joints are mainly multiplanar KK-joints. Loading in the braces of one face of the jacket may yield significant carry-over effects on the out-of-plane braces connected to the same joint. A parametric comparison is carried out to study the accuracy of modelling the joint as a planar K-joint. In general, it is found that the carry-over effect cannot be neglected and the assumption is not accurate.<br/>The fatigue assessment of tubular joints by means of the hot-spot method is subjected to several assumptions that limit the optimization of the members. The notch concept is a more realistic method that is presented as an alternative. However, this method is not widely used in engineering practice due to the difficulties in building the numerical model and the high computational requisites. An algorithm to carry out the effective notch stress assessment, based on the sub-modelling technique, is proposed. A comparison of the fatigue life prediction, between the hot-spot and the effective notch methods, is presented. The latter method is found to predict a higher fatigue life for many of the situations tested. Furthermore, since this method allows for a more detailed modelling, the weld profile can also be designed in order to optimize the fatigue resistance. The weld slope is found to have a significant impact on the results.","Offshore; Wind energy; Jacket; Fatigue; FEM; Hot-spot; Notch","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","European Wind Energy Masters (EWEM)","",""

These new steel grades are produced at one of the hot dip galvanizing lines, “Dompel Verzinklijn 3” (DVL3), at Tata Steel IJmuiden. The annealing furnace in DVL3 consists out of a number of consecutive sections. One of these sections is the Slow-Cooling Section.<br/><br/>The Slow-Cooling Section, a so-called hybrid furnace, is installed with both heating and cooling capabilities to effectively adjust the temperature required by the metallurgical prescription of a specific steel strip product. The required temperature and associated cooling or heating demand can vary from strip to strip, depending on the desired mechanical properties and strip dimensions, which complicates the control of the Slow-Cooling Section. This is further complicated by process variations in production speed and system delays in control instrumentation. It becomes apparent that in order to produce these high quality steel grades, an improved solution to achieve precise temperature control in the slow cooling process has to be found.<br/><br/>In this research a Model Predictive Controller (MPC) is developed for the control of the Slow-Cooling Section of DVL3. This advanced control system is based on a mathematical model, developed in the first part of this research, incorporating the heat transfer from and to the steel strips inside the Slow-Cooling Section. The nonlinear furnace model is validated with historical furnace data, showing good agreement for various process conditions. MPC is applied using two different methods. The first method is based on one linear internal model. The second method approximates the nonlinear mathematical model by the use of piecewise affine models. Case studies are performed to test the performance of the new controllers. The performance of the new controllers are compared with the current temperature control of DVL3.<br/><br/>A critical discussion is presented based on the results of both Model Predictive Controllers. It is shown that the predictive ability, especially in transient conditions is improved with the newly developed MPC and more accurate temperature control is achieved. Recommendations are given to further improve the control performance.","Model Predictive Control; Annealing furnace; Heat transfer; Hybrid","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-09-27","","","","","",""

The simulation mechanism to be developed, begins at the structural solver part of a partitioned FSI solver, upon which the unique functional characteristics of the turbine are embedded. The modelling is carried out to account for the turbine’s functional characteristics like, multiple nested rigid body FSI dynamics, non-smooth dynamics and lamella partial torque contributions. The solver is built to resolve the turbine dynamics in two dimensions and re-scale the final result with respect to the turbine core height. <br/>The results of the simulation show the predicted torque to be of similar trend as that of the experimental data collected by MARIN, while being an over-prediction by a factor of two. The optimal performance range of the turbine is predicted within an error bound of 0.1RPS. The overprediction of the torque is considered to be a result of the 2D solution not accounting for the flow leakage in the third and unaccounted for direction. The time variant fluid solution is found to be unstable due to the spikes observed in the torque time signal and is a consequence of the perfect momentum sink assumption employed in the modelling of the lamella’s non-smooth dynamics. The lamella dynamics are observed to not convergence to fully periodic behaviour and the sensitivity of the lamella’s dynamics is considered to be the root cause. The velocity Verlet based structural solver does not provide fluid-structure coupling iterations, the inclusion of which, could improve the stability of the fluid solution.<br/>This endeavour establishes a foundation for the predictive numerical simulation of the OWM in the form of baseline numerical simulation results and a developed simulation framework.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-09-27","","","","","",""

Instead, prostheses replace missing body parts and compensate for lost functions [1]. However, most designs do not allow the natural arm swing based on their transmission design or the devices use multiple actuators to achieve a compliant mode [2]. Consequently, the Scuola Superiore Sant’Anna (Pisa, Italy) developed an elbow module, which can switch between two transmission stages resulting in three selectable elbow modes (locked, free, compliant). Furthermore, it uses only one controlled input leading to a reduced power consumption. Yet, the design contains major problems regarding its selecting mechanism (based on involuntary created moments), weight and dimensions. Here we introduce a new design with the potential to outperform the previous design regarding its unlocking torque, weight and dimensions based on the retrieved results. Hence, the unlocking torque decreased by a factor of 9.2±4.1 to 124.1±35 Nmm and 606.2±97.6 Nmm when 450 g - 600 g were applied. The weight is reduced by ~280 g reaching ~410 g. The diameter and depth are reduced by 7 mm and 5 mm leading to a final size of 78 mm and 32 mm, considering the first stage in combination with a second stage concept. Yet, to prove that the entire introduced design surpasses the previous mechanism, the second stage needs to be finalized, manufactured and tested. However, we provide a successful<br/>design of the first stage that can be used for further investigations.","orthoses; prostheses; elbow joint; bidirectional; non-backdrivable; roller clutch; rehabilitation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-09-27","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

By applying controlled topography on the surface, the behavior of stem cells and bacteria can be influenced. In this study, early interactions between bacteria and osteogenic nanopatterns were investigated. Five different nanopatterns were produced by electron beam induced deposition. The nanopatterns were then incubated with E. coli K12 strain for 18 hours.

Based on the experimental results, most of the nanopatterns exhibited a positive effect in reducing bacterial cells adhesion. Moreover, two nanopatterns with heights of 130 nm and 60 nm exhibited bactericidal properties. Possible bactericidal mechanisms have been proposed based on closer examination of the bacteria-nanopattern interface and computational analysis of the interfacial forces.

Besides wind energy and solar energy, another alternative renewable energy is biomass. Seaweed is seen as one of the most promising marine plants that can produce the biomass needed to partly satisfy of our future energy requirements. Seaweed cultivation is deemed as sustainable and environmentally friendly because it does not need fresh water, fertilizer and agricultural land. Furthermore, it converts greenhouse gases into oxygen and uptakes inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus from the seawater to avoid eutrophication.<br/><br/>Stichting Noordzeeboerderij and MARIN (Maritime Research Institute The Netherlands) are working together to develop floating seaweed cultivation platforms for offshore. For this project, the loadings on the cultivation platform is interested. To accomplish this, this thesis will study the hydrodynamic characteristics of the seaweed, as they are the main contributors to the loading on the cultivation platform. Then the loading on the single blade of the seaweed is required to be predicted. In this research, two most common and highly economic value seaweed species are chosen, Undaria pinnatifida (Wakame) and Laminaria saccharina.<br/><br/>This thesis describes an experiment that was conducted in the TU Delft Environmental Fluid and Mechanics laboratory. In this experiment, a current flume was used to investigate the hydrodynamic coefficients for the chosen types of seaweed. Before this, the physical and mechanical features such as density, geometrical and the flexural rigidity for the algae of interest were tested in MARIN workshop. Based on these feature parameters, an accurately designed surrogate (has the same or similar magnitude of parameters with the prototype) was constructed in order to imitate fresh algae for the flume experiments. During the experiment, the behavior of L.saccharina was found to be characterised by complex three-dimensional movement that is heavily influenced by the chaos pattern of the surrounding flow. Because the motions of Wakame are more<br/>planar so that easier to be simulated, Wakame was chosen to be the species to be studied in detail.<br/><br/>Two numerical models, were written in MATLAB language, were computed for two movement phases in order to predict the loading and movement of an individual Wakame plant in a current. The first model is suitable for low velocities (0 to 0.57m/s) and simulates a swinging motion of the seaweed in the current. During this process, hydrodynamic force, hydrostatic force, friction and gravity are taken into account. The steady-state position that is predicted by the model in steady fluid is well matched with the results that were measured in the experiment in the same situation.<br/><br/>The second model is used for large velocities (0.57m/s to 2.5m/s) when the structure is designed to have a horizontal position as its initial position and equilibrium position. A stable motion was simulated when the velocity varies from 0.57m/s to 0.81m/s. Furthermore, when the velocity exceeds 0.81m/s, the structure experiences a flutter instability and larger loading. In this procedure, a nonconservative inviscid force that is applied on the structure tip and its influence is discussed in detail. Based on the second model, the ultimate of the total moment of the individual Undaria pinnatifida thallus is predicted for five typical growing phases (with different length, density and stiffness) for accomplish the purpose of this thesis.<br/><br/>These two numerical models could be further used on other engineering time-domain simulation software as a package to simulate and predict the movement of Undaria pinnatifida (Wakame) and the loads that work on it. It could be also used for other seaweed species with similar morphology by inputting stiffness, size parameters and the number of sections that separate the whole seaweed blade in the model. In this way, the motions and loads of other, similar species could also be predicted by the models.","Undaria pinnatifida; Hydrodynamic; Dynamics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-09-27","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

Conventionally, Intraoperative Localization techniques rely on intraoperative imaging guidance, radioactivity guidance, and fluorescence guidance together with local markers. These techniques can assist the surgeon by accurately finding the lesion in the operating room. In this article, an idea of using wireless powered LED marker as a more intuitive alternative is proposed, mainly inspired by the rapid developments in microelectronics and wireless power transfer techniques. This paper presents a complete system using a wireless powered LED marker that can be used for intraoperative localization. The operating frequency and source current density distribution were determined based on the Mid-field wireless power transfer theory. The results were simulated with muscle and multilayered breast tissue model in FEKO. During implementation, the transmitter is approximated by using a two-port antenna which operates at around 2Ghz. The size of the LED marker was minimized by using a double layer PCB design. The energy harvesting component is a 5-turn coil, which reduces the resonant frequency of the entire marker when it is wound around the PCB. The PCB is coated with biocompatible material. Finally, the system is tested and verified using media of air, tissue simulating liquid, butter, and swan lung tissue. It can be concluded that this system can potentially increase the convenience and accuracy of intraoperative localization.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-09-27","","","","","",""

Nevertheless, due to embedded culture and other social factors, people are still strongly influenced by the ‘old way of working’. For instance, project problems between employer and contractor are often settled too late, which leads to excessive amount of costs. As a result, parties begin to blame each other, and vicious cycle starts. From a legal point of view, it is deemed that the duty to warn obligation of UAV-GC 2005 does not necessarily play its role in facilitating problem solving between the employer and the contractor. While in an international level, the early warning of NEC3 ECC originated from U.K. construction industry is catching increasingly attention all over the world, which is known as its ‘proactive risk management’ approach in dealing with project problems. Under early warning obligation, parties are obliged to inform each other of any matter which could affect costs, completion, progress or quality of the project. It is even praised as ‘jewel in the crown’ by many. Therefore, it is inspired that whether the duty to warn of UAV-GC 2005 can be “substituted” by the early warning of NEC3 ECC, so as to improve problem solving on Dutch Design and build construction projects. Nevertheless, the NEC3 ECC contract has not been extensively applied in the Dutch construction industry, so that it is both legally and culturally alien to the “Dutch approach”. Therefore, problem in this respect is twofold, which is the deficiencies of the duty to warn of UAV-GC 2005 on one hand while the unfamiliarity of the early warning of NEC3 ECC to the Dutch construction industry on the other. Accordingly, the primary research objective of this dissertation is to investigate the deficiencies of duty to warn of UAV-GC 2005 and the added value of early warning of NEC3 ECC in terms of facilitating construction problem solving between the employer and the contractor.

The reference geometry for this study is a plate with longitudinal stiffener, since a lack of knowledge about this shape has been noticed in literature.<br/><br/>In order to better understand the current knowledge in the topic of fracture mechanics, an extensive literature review has been performed. <br/>Considering a plate with longitudinal or transverse stiffener, the crack always appears at the weld toe, and propagates with a charactheristic semi-elliptical shape. The empirical solutions needed to compute crack propagation are presented in the British Standard 7910 (BS7910), but additional correction factors have been described in literature Anderson, 2005, Bowness and Lee, 2000, Han et al, 2014 and Newman and Raju, 1981.<br/><br/>An additional research has been performed about the 3D modeling using the finite element method. The standard FEM can be used to compute the Stress Intensity Factor (SIF) along with a dedicated ""spider web"" mesh around the crack front. A valid alternative is marked by the newly introduced XFEM method, which uses an element definition with additional terms; these terms are able to consider the crack discontinuity and the stress singularity at the crack tip.<br/><br/>The empirical equations and the correction factors have been merged in 14 sets of equations. The objective of this first study is to assess the conservativeness of the solution proposed in the BS7910. A MATLAB empirical model has been created with the equations and the Paris law crack growth. The results of these models are compared to tests from literature and to the experiments from LR. An high accuracy is achieved using the set of equations from the BS7910 and using the correct load ratio.<br/><br/>The FEM model has been created to define a new XFEM meshing technique able to supply accurate SIF results; finally, as demonstration of the accuracy of the XFEM models, the empirical equations has been compared with the 3D finite element models.<br/>An extensive mesh convergence study was performed, reaching a good agreement for the crack in a simple plate, both using the standard FEM method and the newly introduced XFEM solution. Finally, a comparison between the new XFEM mesh and the standard mesh in a plate with transverse stiffener was performed. This latest comparison highlighted a big discrepancy in the SIF solution for the surface point of the semi-elliptical crack. This difference was demonstrated to be the consequence of an erroneous stress distribution in the standard FEM model.<br/><br/>The research has brought to the conclusion that the empirical model using the BS7910 is able to deliver accurate results, if the correct load ratio is considered. While in the FEM model analysis, it has been demonstrated that the empirical equation from Bowness and Lee, 2000 is not accurate at predicting the stress intensity factor at the surface point.

This evaluation has been done by means of a dataset. The dataset contained information on failure tests performed on four different types of micropiles, and was initially used for research on relations between logged installation aspects and the final capacity of the piles; such relations were however not found. This was mainly caused by the shape in which the data was logged, and the lack of details in the data. During this research, significant differences between raw data and data adapted according the limit values stated in CUR 236, were found. This led to a change in research direction towards the evaluation of the limit values. <br/>Limit values are values that are used to build in additional safety in a design, and thus, to prevent unsafe situations. The values are based on the shape of data in which in general a linear relation between maximum mobilized shear stresses (τ_(mob;max)) and cone resistance (q_c). This relation continues up to a certain cone resistance level, after which τ_(mob;max) does not increase significantly anymore. The point where no significant increase in τ_(mob;max) over q_c was seen, was used as the limit value for the cone resistance. The limit for α_t was chosen to be 2.5% and the limit for τ_(mob;max) 2.5% of the cone resistance limit. Data with values above these limits, has to be reduced to the limit values. (CUR236, 2011)<br/>Differences were thus found between raw data, the same data but then adapted according the limit value method stated in CUR 236, and values stated in CUR 236 Table 6.1. For further investigation on how these differences were caused, the available dataset was combined with data from the appendix ‘Bijlage A. Proefbelastingen’ of CUR 236. This showed that the current limit values did not suit the shape of the data very well. Investigation on the usefulness of the limit values showed that they are useful for the design process by preventing under- and overestimations of the capacity. Limit values are thus useful, but not in their current form. New limit values were therefore proposed based on a statistical analysis of the available data points. Next to limit values, also design values (expectancy and lower bound) are added.<br/>Because no detailed data for all micropile types was available, it is advised to re-elaborate the limit- and design values for the types that were left out of the proposal given in this thesis, in a similar, statistical way. Furthermore is it advised to investigate a different method to estimate the shear stresses that can be mobilized along the anchor body of a micropile, based on a more fundamental approach. Currently are those stresses often based on full-scale tests from which τ_(mob;max) is derived, but bounded by the limit values. A different approach to this might be more time- and cost-effective.<br","Micropile; CUR236; limit value","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geo-Engineering","",""

Besides accommodating a wide range of currently available systems, the method successfully deals with modelling the effect of non-zero infinity velocity at departure and/or arrival.<br/><br/>The methodology that has been applied consists of a first phase of generation and characterization of the transfers, and of the subsequent selection of the model variables, model functions and architecture. Regarding the generation of the transfers, it is assumed that the transfers are coplanar and that the initial and target orbits are circular. Hundreds of transfers are optimized in a semi-automatic way and characterized in terms of thrust profile and transfer performance parameters. In the investigated design space, different regimes are identified, but approximately 90% of the acceleration range of interest falls into the thrust-coast-thrust profile for any combination of departure and arrival infinity velocity. For a proper description of the underlying trends in the transfer parameters, three key variables have been identified, namely the average acceleration, the total infinity velocity and the infinity velocity at arrival (expressed as a function of the total infinity velocity). By means of curve-fitting, analytic relations are derived that successfully describe those trends, limited to the thrust-coast-thrust class of transfers. <br/><br/>The method that is presented computes near-optimal transfers in terms of ΔV cost, transfer time, transfer angle and departure date. While the first three parameters are the outputs of the mentioned curve-fit model above, the departure date is computed by solving analytically the problem of the phasing with Mars, in a subsequent step. The fit functions that are derived model circle-to-circle planar transfers with an accuracy in the order of 0.1% with respect to the ΔV , 1.5% to the transfer time and 1.2% to the transfer angle, successfully dealing with the dependence on the departure and arrival infinity velocities and generating instant estimates for all relevant transfer parameters. When the model performance is considered in relation to transfers derived in the full ephemeris model, the errors are within 1% for the ΔV , within 15% for the transfer time and within 12% for the transfer angle, which, together with the demonstrated efficiency and simplicity of implementation, make it suitable both for early-stage assessments and for generation of suitable first guesses.","Trajectory Design; Solar Electric Propulsion; Optimization; Mars; Curve Fitting","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-09-18","","","","Aerospace Engineering | Astrodynamics & Space Missions","",""

Despite this, the electrophysiological and pathological mechanisms associated with AF largely remain a mystery, encouraging the use of ever more sophisticated techniques to extract vital information for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. Contamination by signals of ventricular origin is considered the main artifact present in high-resolution epicardial electrograms (EGMs) that hinders the accurate and efficient analysis of AF EGM datasets. Furthermore, the complexity and dynamism of AF signals calls for robust data analysis tools that can effectively reduce or remove ventricular activity (VA) while preserving the texture and morphology of atrial activity (AA). Multiway component analysis, specifically block term decomposition (BTD), proves useful for the decontamination of epicardial EGMs as demonstrated in this project by enabling the automatic estimation of VA on an electrode-by-electrode basis, which is thereafter temporally and/or power spectrally subtracted thus retaining AA at a relatively high accuracy. The performance of BTD compared to average beat subtraction (ABS) and the more restrictive canonical polyadic decomposition (CPD) is visually verified and numerically confirmed based on a set of key performance indices. Additionally, the technique is entirely data-driven i.e., does not depend on any statistical properties, but if/when available, can contribute to enhanced performance via the imposition of appropriate constraints in the tensor decomposition.","atrial fibrillation; multiway component analysis; tensor decomposition; electrograms; block term decomposition","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Circuits and Systems","",""

The need for this overview arose during research for the N2kWh project, where one step in the process focused on increasing the ammonium concentration of (anaerobic digestion) reject water. The research presented some knowledge gaps. As available reports focused on the ammonium removal from the solution, the concentration in the residual stream was barely mentioned. Even when concentrations were reported, the conditions between the discussed technologies made it hard to make a comparison between the three technologies. Even less was reported on the energy that was needed to achieve the various concentrations.<br/><br/>To compare the three technologies, a 1.5 g NH4+/L solution was used as feed water for all three technologies. The technologies used different techniques to increase the ammonium concentration (using zeolites, electrical current over a membrane or high pressure through a membrane). This made comparing the technologies, very difficult. By using the same feed water for all experiments, the achieved concentrations and the energy that was used in the process could be used to compare the three technologies.<br/><br/>The highest ammonium concentration that was achieved during the experiments (7.1 g NH4+/L) was produced by Electrodialysis. Ion exchange achieved a concentration of 6.0 g NH4+/L, while a laboratory scale Reverse Osmosis achieved 4.5 g NH4+/L. The amount of energy used by the three technologies to produce 6 g NH4+/L was: ion exchange = 0.24 kWh, electrodialysis = 6 kWh, reverse osmosis = 4 kWh (per m3 of produced concentrated NH4+ solution). ROSA software was used to estimate energy use for Reverse Osmosis to achieve 6 g NH4+/L (as the laboratory scale Reverse Osmosis was unable to provide sufficient pressure to achieve this concentration). So ion exchange was the most energy efficient, but the maximum achievable ammonium concentration was the lowest of the three technologies. Electrodialysis was able to achieve the highest ammonium concentration but was less energy efficient and used more energy in the process. <br","Ammonium; Reverse Osmosis; Electrodialysis; Ion Exchange","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-09-26","","","","","N2kWh",""

Herein, a monopile is one of the most frequently used foundation-types. This monopile is a high steel cylinder, over 60 meters high, which supports the wind turbine to the seabed. Currently, monopiles are lifted with large boom cranes on jack-up ships. SeaState5 has developed a more efficient method for monopile installation by using the Grasshopper-T (GH-T), a new crane which skids the monopiles from the deck and places it onto the seabed. The system reduces the weight and footprint for jack-up ships.<br/><br/>This thesis consists of mechanical modeling the GH-T for the purpose of estimating the forces within the lifting system. A non-linear modeling method; Euler-Lagrange<br/>(EL) method with constraints is used to capture the systems dynamic, non-smooth and non-linear behavior over the entire range of motions of the upending process. Secondly, for the purpose of simplification, yet capturing the mentioned behavior, the system is linearized around several areas of operation, analyzing local detectablity and observability. Thirdly, attempts are made to design linear observers and disturbance estimator to both estimate the states of the system and any disturbance applied on the monopile, like hydrodynamic forces. Finally, a non-linear observer is proposed to estimate the states along the entire upending process of the monopile. Experiments for model validation are performed on SeaState5’s 1:25 scale prototype for which a sensor setup has been designed.<br/><br/>Simulations show that linear observers based on the linearized model are able to estimate the states, and compute forces of interest, within a very small area of operations. The designed linear disturbance estimator proves to be ineffective in estimating disturbances and is only valid for the same small neighborhood around the equilibrium point. This motives the need for an observer capable of estimation over a broad range of motions. Therefore, a non-linear observer is designed. For the non-linear observer, the state recovery proves to be efficient and robust enough to cope with sensor noise and the high range of motions of the upending procedure. Experimental results show the model is able to capture the non-linear behavior of the real system and estimate forces of interest within acceptable margins, showing promises for an online state estimation using the non-linear observer.<br","Euler-Lagrange modeling; non-linear systems; linear observer; non-linear observer; state estimation; force estimation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

Throughout the engineering phase of a (dual crane) heavy lift, dynamic lift models are generated by combining bodies with their hydrodynamic properties, inertia and spring-dashpot elements. The models represent the mass-spring system of a heavy lift over the different lift stages during a topside installation. These stages characterize the free floating, load transfer, free hanging and set down<br/>phases.<br/><br/>Hook load fluctuations are governed by the relative vertical motion of the load and the crane boom tip. At the load transfer phase this motion is governed by both the motion of the vessel and the barge, whereas for the free hanging phase it is mostly effected by the motion of the vessel. To achieve safe and successful projects, an accurate prediction of the load and motion responses is essential while advising offshore personnel about the lift to perform. At the moment an inconsistency exists between predicted load fluctuations and offshore<br/>crane measurements. This is the main reason for this research. <br/><br/>Until now a simplified spring-damper system is used to incorporate the hoist wire reeving system of a crane.This simplification is not fully justified and three goals are set up to model this in a more detailed manner. Firstly, the driving parameters of the load-crane-vessel system are assessed. Secondly the dynamic behavior of the wire reeving system is captured in a numerical model in Simulink. Finally, the dynamic load fluctuations of the model are compared with offshore measurements to both validate the model and analyze the results.<br/><br/>The dynamical model of the load-crane-vessel system is solved in the time domain and it consists of two parts. The first part considers the sheave and wire system of the crane. An equation of motion is derived for each sheave where dry friction is taken into account and leads to a stick-slip effect. This friction originates from the sheave bearings and from the bending friction of the steel wire rope that runs over it. When a load is raised, the stress in each rope part increases from the winch to the dead end. With a lowering operation the effect is the opposite. Due to stick-slip this force difference remains in the crane wires after the operation. The friction factors of the sheaves in the numerical model are tuned with steps observed in offshore load measurements during crane operations. <br/><br/>The second part of the model imposes the measured vessel motions to calculate the motion of both crane boom tips and the topside. This is performed by applying their influences as external forces on the free bodies. With the relativemotion the response of the hoist wire forces is determined. A coupling of these two parts can be made by removing the element of the hoist wire in the imposed motion model and replacing it by a pair of two nonlinear forces determined fromthe sheave wire model. These forces have an opposite sign and<br/>are equal in absolutemagnitude and phase.<br/><br/>The effect of friction on dynamic hook load fluctuations is also consideredwith inputs of different amplitudes and frequencies. The hook load fluctuations at the measuring sheave are lower than applied fluctuations in the model when friction is taken into account. The simulated force at the measuring sheave is better represented with higher load fluctuations as the stick condition is exceeded earlier.","Thialf; Hoist wire; Dynamics; Topside Installation; HMC","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2017-09-26","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

Traditionally, centralized optimization techniques are used by such operators to plan for economic dispatches of power tominimize the overall operational costs and increase system social welfare. Due to the dispersed nature of renewable energy sources as scattered nodes in a system, it can get difficult to accommodate them in a centralized optimization problem. Also, sharing of complete information for such nodes can create privacy issues. This motivates research in the field of distributed optimization techniques. This thesis aims to develop a distributed optimization algorithm for a DC distribution system which would take into account network congestion and line losses and ultimately provide a more precise optimal solution. Based on past research for distributed optimization approaches for AC systems, the Consensus and Innovations approach was used to model an algorithm and provide nodal optimization for a DC system with minimal data exchange. The developed model was implemented on various DC network topologies like meshed grids, single line networks, T Shaped networks, etc. and a converged output of system variables was accomplished. The results were also compared with a centralized optimization approach to check for deviations. The decision variables for the developed approach were found to be well within the deviation range of 2 percent.

First, the core concepts of QRM were investigated. If a company wants to apply QRM, they have to change the performance measure from delivery performance to MCT reduction (manufacturing critical path time). The company needs to switch from a functional to a cellular organization and needs to improve the flow by reduction of the variability in job arrivals and by increasing the spare capacity to a minimum of 15%. IHC Vremac plans against infinite capacity. There are four releasing points at the office and there is waiting and safety time planned for the production. This leads to 17.5 times more work in progress than necessary. There is a functional separation of machining, welding and assembly. The routings of the orders along the work centers were very diversified. In the future state, the process times and routings must be standardized. The performance measure should change from delivery performance to MCT reduction. There has to be a new strict schedule that is planned with less safety and waiting time and with a minimum spare capacity of 15%, where re-planning should be taken into account. Two QROCs (quick response office cells) need to be created and three QRCs (quick response cells). A priority buffer should be used as work load management. It is recommended to reduce the variability of the job arrivals and to investigate investment in extra machines. Last, there has to be a feedback loop to keep a continuous improvement of the accuracy of process times (CPIs) and routings.","Delivery performance; Hydraulic cylinder production; Quick Response Manufacturing (QRM); Discrete Event Simulation; Standardization; Lead times; Manufacturing Critical path Time (MCT)","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-09-26","","","","","",""

This has a significant negative effect on the environment. For a sustainable future, people’s behaviour needs to change. Changing children’s attitude towards toy ownership has been identified as an opportunity to create this behaviour change. This lead to the following design challenge: How can I create an experience that engages children to change their behaviour towards toy ownership to inspire environmental stewardship? One of the most efficient ways to make products more sustainable is by extending product life. Extending product life is put into practice by having children pass on toys they have outgrown. By studying children using the context mapping method it was found that they find it difficult to let go of their unused toys. Extending product life and difficulty to let go are conflicting statements. For children below the age of five this is unavoidable, therefore the target group is children aged 5 - 6 as this is the youngest group possible to set in motion the desired behaviour change. Solution directions for the desired behaviour change were generated. The Toy on adventure concept was selected to further develop as this concept uses a narrative which allows for a perspective shift to occur with the child. A shift from a negative association (losing your toy), to a positive one (allowing your toy to go on adventure). In order to convince the child to participate in the concept, action tendency needs to be recognised. Multiple in-context interventions with the users were performed to find effective action tendencies that facilitate behaviour change. The following design elements were established: the power of growth, storytelling, negative emotions &amp; pride. Using and integrating these design elements, the final design was created: Olli Play. Olli Play is an episodic storybook including action items and supporting props (play mat/bag &amp; headdress) to make it easier for children to pass on toys they have outgrown. The design elements are embedded as follows: Episodic storytelling engages children with the experience of Olli Play. The concept of the power of growth is used in the narrative to make the letting go of toys part of growing up. Negative emotions are used to create a rich experience according to the theory of design for emotion. The use of pride provides the after the fact gratification necessary for the experience to have a lasting effect in order to inspire environmental stewardship. The interaction with the final design was tested in a three day testing session. The results showed that the intended effects were accomplished. As expected, the child experienced great difficulties with the thought of letting go toys at first. But as the interaction progressed throughout the days, the attitude of the child was transformed and the overall experience was perceived to be very enjoyable and the toys were gladly given away. The interaction also sparked interest in environmental stewardship. This way, Olli Play creates immediate sustainable behaviour and inspires the intended attitude of environmental stewardship.","Sustainability; Circular Economy; Children; Toy; Plastic Soup Monster; storytelling; ownership; education","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

With a growing demand in train movements, the railway infrastructure is subject to changes. These infrastructural mutations are a collaboration between NS, as Train Operating Company, and ProRail, as infrastructure manager. Various complexities arise due to the close relationship between the railway infrastructure, the timetable of the train services, the deployment of rolling stock and crew scheduling. This thesis discusses the complexities in the process of infrastructure mutations from the viewpoint of NS. This is done by means of a process analysis and the assessment of a tool that is used within NS for the creation of rolling stock circulations.<br/>The process (of infrastructure mutations) can be seen as a system, in which the subsequent planning processes for the timetable, rolling stock and crew are regarded as subsystems. This system is analysed by means of a reconstruction of the normative situation (the as-is situation). This normative situation is then compared with a real-life situation. Next to the reconstruction of the process, bottlenecks in the normative process are identified. These bottlenecks can be subdivided in the following categories: problems with information management, unclear definition of the process and its roles, and a lack of top-level management for (larger) mutations.<br/>Subsequently, a similar analysis is done for a real-life situation. In this thesis, the DSSU project is used for this purpose. The DSSU project is a comprehensive renewal of the shunting yards at the central station of Utrecht, in the heart of the Dutch railway network. Looking at the planning process at NS, the following bottlenecks can be identified: Unclear definition of the process and the definition of its roles, time limitations, a lack of planning resources, a lack of top-level management and issues with the realisation of the train service after the completion of the construction works. For these bottlenecks, various improvements are suggested in this thesis, based on experience from within NS, as well as from literature. The key finding of the process improvement is that using a more integral approach in the process of infrastructure mutations, both in information housekeeping and collaboration between actors, can avoid bottlenecks and result in better solutions in terms of timetable products and rolling stock deployment.<br/>As a solution to the bottleneck of limited overview of the impact of mutations, an evaluation of rolling stock circulation tool ‘TAM’ is performed. To evaluate the use of TAM in practical situations, three cases were assessed. From the assessments it can be concluded that the tool indeed can give useful information on the effects of an infrastructure mutation on the rolling stock planning, but the results are highly dependent on patronage-prognoses and inputs from other parts of the planning process, like the (altered) timetable. Besides this, the tool is (in its current form) not able to make optimal solutions, due to pre-defined turn-around patterns that constrain the model. Since TAM is a made to generate circulations, the (microscopic) shunting planning is not part of the tool. Conclusively, TAM is a useful tool to obtain insights in the impact of infrastructure mutations, but it does not cover all effects and does not necessarily provide optimal alternative circulations.","Railway Planning; Infrastructure Mutations; Rolling Stock; Circulations","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The objective was to decrease the series resistance, which would lead to an increase in FF and thus efficiency. Three different cell structure are examined; i) a poly-poly cell with SiN¬x as an ARC, ii) a hybrid solar cell and iii) a silicon heterojunction (SHJ) device. Last two structures have a conductive TCO layer as a top layer.<br/>For the poly-poly device four sorts of front metallization were examined; Al e-beam evaporation, DC Cu-plating, pulse Cu-plating and Al sputtering. Because Al evaporation was the most commonly used metallization method within the group, this will be the reference cell. The best reference cell had as external parameters a VOC of 689 mV, JSC of 38.3 mA/cm2 and a FF of 73.0%, resulting in a efficiency of 19.3%. With DC Cu-plating fingers with significantly higher aspect ratios (up to 0.28 compared to 0.02 of reference), but unwanted growth of Cu was also detected. Nevertheless, it gave an average increase of 2.3% absolute in FF, which resulted in a higher efficiency of 19.6%. In order to remove the unwanted Cu-growth, pulse Cu-plating was done. When pulse plating was done, no unwanted growth of Cu was detected. The efficiency of the pulse plating device was slightly lower than the other two devices. An efficiency of 18.7%. Sputtering of Al proves to have the same result as Al e-beam evaporation, when the same thickness is used.<br/>Regarding the hybrid solar cells the best results was achieved with Al e-beam evaporation, with a VOC of 704 mV, JSC¬ of 40.7 mA/cm2 and FF of 73.8%. This results in a device with a efficiency of 21.0%. With Cu-plating technique and Ag-paste screen printing, these results were not reached. The Cu-plating technique did show an average increase in FF of 1.8% absolute, due to a lower series resistance. Cu contamination however lowered the VOC and JSC.<br/>For SHJ solar cells the reference solar cell had a maximum efficiency of 17.7%, with an average FF of only 61.0%. Cu-plating on SHJ solar cell had de same contamination problems (low VOC and JSC), but because of the 10.9% absolute increase in FF, it showed higher efficiencies (with a maximum of 18.4%. Ag paste screen printing showed a smaller increase in FF (3.4% absolute).<br/>Optical measurements for the rear reflector were done as well.

Also, it is often claimed that structures fromFRP have lower life-cycle costs and eco burden compared to constructions madefrom steel, concrete, or wood; this can be attributed to the low amount ofrequired maintenance and longer life span of FRP. Therefore, FRP seems a verysuitable material in the harsh environments where hydraulic structures residecompared to conventional materials.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height: normal;mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none"">No actual commercial jetties, besidessmall pedestrian jetties, are yet constructed from FRP: knowledge regarding thepotential financial savings or the environmental impact of such jetties are notwell known. Also, specific consequences of constructing a jetty from FRP areunknown, as well the ability of FRP jetties to maintain their structuralcapabilities over their entire life-time. Therefore, this thesis investigatesthe feasibility of FRP jetties and judges whether FRP jetties are betteralternatives than jetties constructed fromtraditional materials. In the scope of this thesis, the research is narrowed down to comparing FRP withreinforce concrete (RC).</p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height: normal;mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none"">The main design challenge of FRP incivil engineering related structures is coping with the relatively lowstiffness of FRP, as this presumably determines the dimensions of thestructural elements and restrictions of the structure as a whole. Governingstructural safety criteria in steel and concrete are more often strengthrelated. The research rests on a case study of an RC jetty, which provides boundaryconditions and a program of requirements. An FRP jetty is designed whichcomplies with the structural criteria. These criteria were both extracted fromthe case study and provided by the CUR96, a Dutch design guideline for FRP incivil engineering practice. Most structural elements are designed from scratch:laminates are designed for the flanges and webs in a composite calculator namedeLamX2. The finite element method (FEM) software program SCIA Engineer is usedfor the structural analysis. One dimensional structural elements were firstvalidated before utilizing them in the FEM model. The pile properties anddimensions are based on contemporary literature and commercially availableproducts. The driveability of the FRP piles is researched by means of Wave EquationAnalysis of Piles (WEAP), for which the program AllwavePDP is utilized.Furthermore, sustainability aspects of both jetties are researched by means ofa Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). The LCA determines how much equivalentgreenhouse gases are expelled over the life-time of the jetties for a set ofimpact categories. These results are normalized by calculating the respectiveshadow costs for each impact category; this makes the total environmentalimpact of the structures comparable. The financial feasibility is the lastinvestigated topic; under various scenarios, life-cycle costs of both jettiesare investigated. The scenarios contained different variables such as estimatesof FRP raw material costs or assumed share of maintenance costs; end-of-lifecosts were not included in the analysis.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height: normal;mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none"">The structural analysis of the FRPjetty indicated that both Serviceability Limit State (SLS) criteria and UltimateLimit State criteria (ULS) determine the dimensions of the structural elementsand the jetty design in general. The most crucial parts are partially embeddedFRP piles, which are prone to buckling. Initially, the FRP piles in thedetailed design were to be installed to a depth of 13 meter below ground level,but the results from the WEAP indicated that the piles refused duringinstallation before reaching this level. An analysis indicated that drivingshorter piles to a depth of 8 meter is possible: at this depth, the piles donot refuse and have accumulated sufficient bearing capacity by shaft frictionto support the superstructure. The eco burden of the FRP jetty was foundsignificantly higher compared to the RC jetty: in the base case LCA, therelative difference is 365 percent higher for the FRP variant. After asensitivity analysis, the relative difference is still 59 percent higher when comparingthe best-case scenario of the FRP jetty with the worst-case scenario of the RCjetty. The RC jetty also performed better than the FRP jetty regardinglife-cycle costs in various considered scenarios. The relative difference inlife-cycle costs for the most favorable scenario of the FRP jetty is still 28 %higher compared to the life-cycle costs of the RC jetty.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height: normal;mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none"">Due to the poorer performance of theFRP jetty regarding the life-cycle costs and environmental burden, it isconcluded that FRP jetties, for the time being, are not better alternativesthan RC jetties. Regarding the type of jetty, the conclusion can begeneralized. The jetty is designed for the turnover of liquid bulk; imposed loadsare generally lower than loads on Ro-Ro, solid bulk, or container transfer jetties.It therefore seems unlikely that FRP does seem to be a better alternative forthose cases. Regarding the material choice, the conclusion cannot begeneralized. The FRP jetty was compared to an RC jetty. Jetties made from steelor wood are likely more vulnerable to degradation in harsh conditions. Thedurability properties of FRP might be more beneficial to the assessment of FRP jettiesin these cases. Certain future developments might affect the conclusion.Innovation in manufacturing techniques and an increase of market demand for FRPcould lower the price. Besides, biodegradable FRP materials are being developedwhich potentially may reduce the environmental burden of FRP.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height: normal;mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none""> Keywords: FRP, composite design,hydraulic structures, jetty, pile driving, LCA, life-cycle costs","FRP; composite structure; hydraulic engineering; WEAP; FRP hollow pile; Life Cycle Assessment","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To optimize the installation of power cables in high currents a better understanding of the dynamic behavior of the cables is needed. During installation of subsea power cables in high ocean currents, significant vibrations might occur. These vibrations are called vortex induced vibrations (VIV) and they are result of the vortex shedding behind the cables. Significant forces may arise due to VIV which can compromise the cable's integrity limits and further introduce problems to the installation procedure. The main objective of this research is to assess the effects of the VIV on the cables and provide solutions to improve workability. In this thesis a coupled wake-structure model was created in order to study the interaction between the vortices and the cable. The model is based on the phenomenological model of the wake oscillator which can capture well the self-exciting, self-limiting behavior of VIV, therefore estimating accurately enough the lock-in region and vibration amplitude. A wake oscillator with acceleration coupling is used and different sets of tuning parameters tuned to 1DOF and 2DOF free vibration experiments are examined. The structure has been modeled in the finite element software OrcaFlex and the wake oscillator model was implemented as an external function in the programming language Python. To confirm the validity of the above mentioned model two experiments were used. Firstly, the model was tested against the Delft flume experiment where the case of a vertical riser is examined and further the São Paulo experiment where the case of a steel catenary riser (SCR) is studied. The model was also compared with the Milan wake oscillator model from OrcaFlex's VIV toolbox. The model showed good agreement with the experimental results and found to be superior of OrcaFlex's VIV model. Next, VIV analysis was performed for a case study. The analysis was done for different current speeds and directions and the effects of the VIV on the tension and the bending radius of the cable were determined. For lower current velocities, lock-in response and standing waves along the cable were observed, while for higher velocities multifrequency response, beating behavior and traveling waves were observed. An important conclusion of this research is that the coupled wake-structure model used in this thesis is suitable for assessing VIV effects on catenary shaped cables. Furthermore, the analysis showed that catenary shaped cables with remaining length on the seabed exhibit smaller crossflow vibration amplitudes than straight cylinders.","VIV; Vortex induced vibrations; wake oscillator model; VIV on catenary shaped cables; cable integrity limits","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-09-25","","","","","",""

This calcification is irreversible and affect the functionality of the heart valves. The only treatment is an aortic valve replacement. The trend in heart valve replacement is moving from open heart surgery towards minimally invasive techniques where a heart valve prosthesis is placed over the native aortic valve, called the TAVI procedure. <br/><br/>A crimped stent that contains a heart valve prosthesis is pushed upwards through the femoral access route with a delivery catheter. This prosthesis is placed in the aortic annulus and wedged over the native valve. The positioning of the heart valve prosthesis is important for the success of the procedure and durability of the prosthesis. A coaxial placement to the aortic annulus in the center of the aorta lumen is the target during this positioning of the prosthesis. <br/><br/>The Medtronics and Edwards delivery systems, that are currently used, only have the possibility to be steered with a maximum of 1 rotation, providing an alignment with the aortic annulus in the frontal plane of the body. The rotation to provide the alignment in the sagittal plane is lacking. This report will focus on the question if extra steerability of the delivery system will provide a better positioning of the tip of the delivery system, which in the end, will position the heart valve prosthesis. <br/><br/>The Edwards delivery system will be reverse engineered to look at the current mechanisms that are used to provide the rotation in the frontal plane. Subsequently, two experiments are performed to select the best configuration for the modification on the tip of the delivery system.

Moreover, the prototype provided a better alignment in the sagittal and frontal plane with regards to the reference point. <br/><br/>The research only focused on the positioning of the tip and didn’t take the deployment of the heart valve prosthesis into account. Further development of the prototype is needed to make it useful for the TAVI procedure. In addition, more research is needed to validate the prototype in a dynamic environment that represents the reality with blood flow and more tortuosity in the access route.

More effective and efficient structures are needed in order to achieve sustainable projects. Steel construction industry is not outside this modifications and advances. To keep steel construction competitive in the market, the industry needs to adapt to these changes by optimizing its manufacturing and erection processes. In a steel structure, joints determine almost 50% of the total costs (Bijlaard, 2006). This percentage can drastically decrease if some details are avoided, like stiffeners. Nevertheless, the only way to eliminate these components is through a deepest analysis of the joint. This kind of analysis can be slow and expensive hindering the design process. In this context new numerical tools are appearing in the market in order to improve productivity and facilitate the work of structural engineers. These new powerful tools that come from the hands of the world technological advances, must be taken with care and their results must be validated to be able to realize their efficient, but above all, their safety.<br/><br/>In this project, the improvement of the design of steel joints is addressed. This goal was achieved through two major tasks. First, an experiment was performed in order to deepen in the knowledge of simple joints when they are used between “I” shape beams and a flexible element like a hollow section face. The use of high strength welds and its implications were tested in the experiments and at the same time the real behavior of the joint was addressed. The new Eurocode 1993 1-8 (2020) contemplates the use of high strength steel and welds in steel practice. Hybrid welds can lead to a more efficient production process. Secondly, numerical analysis, hand calculations following the Eurocode Rules and previous documented experiments (SERICM II) were compared to validate the use of a finite element tool for daily practice structural engineering. The comparison was made in terms of strength and resistance of the joints and it proved that specialized finite element tools can be used in a safe and efficient way. These tools are able to predict in an accurate manner the joint’s resistance according to the Eurocode Rules.<br","Steel Joints; Steel Structure; Component Method; Experimental validation; numerical analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To remain competitive, KLM has recently launched its new strategy - a more customer centered approach by creating memorable experiences for the passengers and employees. Thus, the last product and service innovation developments focus on creating customer intimacy. <br/><br/>Within the context of an increasing digitalization, KLM is exploring and testing with different exponential technologies to innovate and deliver personalized service. One such technology is Augmented Reality (AR). Augmented reality is a technology that enriches the real world with over layered digital information, objects and media. Although not a completely new technology, AR has been gaining traction and popularity in the last couple of years. Mayor digital companies like Microsoft, Google and Apple are currently developing and introducing new AR products to the market. <br/><br/>The project goal is to explore the possibilities of the recent AR developments in the context of the airline industry. This project presents an in-depth analysis of three main areas: AR technology, company resources and user needs. Augmented Reality systems, unique valuable features and limitations are described. Industry regulations and company resources are analyzed. Latent user needs and human factors are uncovered. From these insights a design goal and an interaction vision were developed. <br/><br/><br/>To assess user needs along the customer journey, an analysis of previous KLM documentation was made. The insights from the company’s reports were analyzed by using a context factors framework proposed for creating pervasive AR experiences from the literature review. The human factors were investigated using context-mapping method. The generative research was conducted with seven participants from different nationalities. After completing a sensitizing booklet, they took part of in-depth follow up interviews. <br/><br/>The insights of the context mapping research provided information about mobile device usage onboard. Hence potential touch points along the customer journey were selected. Emotions and attitudes and space semantics were found from the user research. A key finding was related to the multiple constraints characteristics of the using an airline service. Protocols and regulations stipulated by the airline and the industry impact the comfort and attitudes of the passenger. From the research it was found that some passengers are more vulnerable to being “captive” at the gate or in the cabin. The customer experience is affected by the lack of autonomy during different moments of the journey. <br/><br/>The group of passengers affected by constraints was selected for this project.

The large amounts of information stored in the DNA makes it costly to store and to process. In this work, a fast and efficient implementation of a Field Programmable GateArray (FPGA) based, streaming multicore architecture for accelerating variant calling algorithms will be designed. We focused on the HaplotypeCaller which is the variant calling software part of the Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK), which is one of the most widely used DNA analysis tools in the field. The most time consuming part of the HaplotypeCaller is the PairHMM algorithm. PairHMM is a probabilistic algorithm that executes pairwise alignment of two sequences. Starting from an existing single core PairHMM accelerator design, which was implemented using the POWER8 Coherent Accelerator Processor Interface (CAPI), we designed three extra cores of thePairHMM algorithm that can work independently and increase the performance of the overall system. The new accelerator achieves a 2.2x speedup in comparison with the single core. The accelerator is integrated with the HaplotypeCaller and uses CAPI to access a shared processor-accelerator memory for direct communication. A JNI call is used to send the memory addresses to the accelerator, which reduces the communication overhead between the HaplotypeCaller and the accelerator. Results show that the application is not able to saturate the accelerator with data, resulting in accelerator idle time and under-utilization. The accelerator presented idle time for the 26% of the different data sets that were used. It would be beneficial to implement a faster version of the HaplotypeCaller which can load data sets to the accelerator as current data sets are being processed.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Engineering","",""

The project covered in this report investigates how solar adsorption refrigeration technology can be used to achieve a higher level of food security in West-Africa. More specifically, the study aims to conceptualize suitable product proposals that integrate the technology in order to improve food security, be profitable and provide a more environmentally sustainable alternative to current food conservation practices. To this end, the principle of food security is explored. Technological and contextual research<br/>is subsequently executed. Findings are incorporated in the design phase during which 3 concepts are proposed and evaluated. The most promising concept, the Solar Stall, is detailed in the embodiment phase.<br/><br/>“Food security, exists when all people, at all times, have physical, social and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food that meets their dietary needs and food preferences for<br/>an active and healthy life” (US Global Change Research Program et al., 2015). Solar energy based refrigeration means can improve food security in two manners. Firstly, solar powered refrigeration presents the opportunity to adequately preserve produce, extending shelf life and therefore reducing produce loss due to spoilage. A reduction of produce loss in turn provides a higher level of food security. Secondly, solar powered refrigeration can enable an<br/>increase in domestic food production, which has a major impact on food security. These two components are leading parameters throughout research and conceptualization.<br/><br/>Solar adsorption refrigeration utilizes the processes of adsorption and evaporative cooling to provide refrigeration. These processes are driven by temperature fluctuations within the system, which are instigated through solar heat capture. The main advantage of solar adsorption refrigeration is that it has the potential to be very cost effective, making it particularly suitable for low income coutries. Its main disadvantage is a relatively restricted efficiency caused by poor utilization of heat to trigger <br/> adsorption. The underlying reasons are<br/>addressed within the technology section of this report. <br/><br/>The state of food security differentiates among all nations in West-Africa. The contextual research that was performed during this project therefore looks at both Ivory Coast, which is considered to exhibit a high degree of food security, and Liberia, which is considered to exhibit a low degree of food security. An understanding of these extremes allows to establish a spectrum of data that is representative for the entire West-African region. The value chains of perishable goods of both countries were analysed. Based on early findings, the research<br/>is narrowed to specifically consider the retail link of the value chain, where produce is sold in open-air markets. The research concludes that the stimulation of domestic food production in countries with a state of food security similar to Liberia, should be the main objective of<br/>the product proposal. Furthermore, the research points towards fish and meat retailers in the open-air markets, which supply the general public with their daily groceries, as the most beneficial target group.<br/><br/>Three suitable concepts have been developed and evaluated based on their impact in terms of food security, profitability and environmental sustainability. The Solar Stall substitutes the current market stall and incorporates a cooled compartment for produce conservation. This concept was considered to comply best with the specified requirements and was therefore<br/>detailed during the final stage of the project.","Solar Adsorption Refrigeration; West-Africa; Cooling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

Partial discharges in power cables is a pervasive phenomenon that over time may lead to failure. For this reason, their monitoring has become increasingly sought after by asset owners. Nevertheless, the symmetry in the structure of a coaxial cable makes the isolation of the discharges in power cable more complicated when compared to other power components. In addition to this, there are added limitations to a given system with regard to the sensitivity of measurements and the maximum length of cable monitored, due to the increased attenuation towards high frequencies. Therefore, this thesis investigates the possible methods that could be used for online-monitoring of sensitive partial discharges (10 pC) in long cable systems ( &gt;10 km), by means of new techniques or new applications of existing techniques. In this thesis a comprehensive feasibility study is followed by a thorough evaluation of the most promising methods and a demonstration of proof of concept of the parts thereof. The prime focus of this thesis is to investigate distributed measurement over a long cable system with the help of built-in sensor units. A built-in capacitive sensor type is modelled analytically, and simulated to check its performance before being tested experimentally in the last phase of this project. The final results indicate the feasibility of its implementation. Furthermore, the possibility of communication between such distributed sensor nodes is explored. One such method of communication proposed in this thesis is the wireless communication inside a cable using antennas. This thesis proves and quantifes to a certain extent the performance of an antenna (transceivers) inside a coaxial power cable paving the way for other tailor-made applications using `RFID-like' (Radio Frequency Identication) technology in the future.","Cables; Partial Discharge; feasibility study; Feasibility; Measurements; Sensors","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-09-22","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

The curiosity to know if we are the only ones in the universe or not has driven the development of many engineering projects. This Master Thesis is meant to do its bit in this research field. Europa, a moon of Jupiter, is thought to have an ocean made of water underneath its icy surface. This ocean could be the perfect environment to find life. The hypotheses of the existence of an ocean gained more strength with the discovery of a water vapour plume in the southern hemisphere of Europa. This plume could be expelling particles from the underneath ocean. The main idea of the project is to design a mission of a pseudo-orbiter (a spacecraft orbiting Jupiter and doing flybys of Europa) which could collect particles from this plume during its flyby trajectory. <br/><br/>The objective of this thesis is to determine the maximum number of particles that can be collected with a pseudo-orbiter strategy. To achieve this, first, a plume particle model has been simulated. The outcome of this simulation is a 3D density profile of the water vapour molecules of the plume. The results of this part are needed in order to be able to determine the number of particles that the spacecraft can collect when crossing the plume. After this, the trajectory of the pseudo-orbiter has been designed. The Graphical Method for Same-body Transfers has been used in order to select potential trajectories that could lead to a maximum number of collected particles. This method allows the engineers to identify resonant orbits such that the ground-track of the flyby crosses regions of potential interest. Finally, coupling the two parts of the project has led to the determination of the number of collected particles for the selected trajectories.<br","Trajectory Design; Galilean moons; Plumes; Resonant Orbits; Astrodynamics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Comprising the shallow subsurface of the Dutch offshore sector, these sediments have<br/>been deposited by Eridanos fluvio-deltaic system, draining the Fennoscandian and Baltic shield through the present Baltic Sea. Three successful producing fields - A12-FA (2007), F02a-B-Pliocene (2009) and B13-FA (2011)- and<br/>five under development have triggered the conduction of several studies in the offshore area. However the deltaic environment has been characterized as highly complex owing to its influence by the onset of Northern Hemisphere<br/>Glaciation and thus the processes that governed the system have not become entirely understood. Enhanced cooling followed by the waxing and waning of the glaciers during warmer periods had an immediate impact on sediment<br/>supply, accommodation space and mineralogical input. Although the sediments have been studied in terms of chrono-biostratigraphy, no systematic investigation with respect to the three main aforementioned factors as well<br/>as the regional sequence stratigraphy and its link to the reservoir deposits has been made up to date. Therefore, this study employed sequence stratigraphy as a method to examine Eridanos conditions of deposition, investigate the<br/>interplay between accommodation space and sediment supply and explore the nature of the gas-bearing reservoir sediments. The adopted methodology is comprised of two basic pillars, observation and interpretation. The first<br/>records as clearly as possible the observations arise from the sequence analysis while the second extracts the meaningful information and interprets it in terms of temporal and spatial concepts. Using 2D seismic and well log data the basic observations were the stratal terminations, stacking patterns, seismic facies and the shoreline trajectory.<br/>Seismic and well log interpretation showed that the delta experienced multiple events of sea level fall which forced the shoreline to regress basinward and caused sediment erosion or non-deposition. These events are bounded<br/>by nine time-significant surfaces of subaerial unconformities which constitute the depositional sequences. Normal regression comprised the dominant depositional trend, combined with aggrading-prograding patterns, leading to<br/>characteristic alternations of highstand and lowstand system tracts. Three main depositional environments which correspond to open marine turbidites (submarine lobes), delta front and delta top were identified from well logs,<br/>core descriptions and the seismic facies analysis. The study suggests that the shallow gas is located in the alternations of silty-sandstones and claystones of the delta plain which comprise the vertical stacking of parasequence<br/>topsets within the highstand- lowstand system tracts. Reconstruction of the relative sea level changes and sedimentation rates was made based on a technique introduced by this study. It uses the average thickness of each seismic<br/>unit in order to interpolate time between the three known absolute ages obtained by the literature. The graphs showed that the accommodation space was generated by a low rate of sea level rise while sedimentation rates were<br/>increasing over time. However the scarcity of time constrains in combination with the uncertainty in the estimation of seismic volumes resulted in a low resolution outcome. A comparison between the findings of this study and<br/>those of the existing literature was made. The overall depositional trends and conditions seem to be in accordance with the other surveys. Nonetheless the proposed interplay between accommodation and supply can be assigned as<br/>local since the examined area is limited compare to areas studied in literature. Limitations are traced in the quality of the 2D seismic data hampering the observation regarding the relation between the reflectors and the surfaces.<br/>Consequently, the study offers an insight into the conditions under which the gas-bearing deltaic sediments were deposited and tries to place them in the established sequence stratigraphic framework. Also it provides information<br/>regarding the distribution of the deltaic environments and identification of the reservoir rocks within each setting. The resulting interpretation can be used for prediction of the reservoir formations since the genetically-related<br/>packages where they were identified are distributed in a predictable manner within a sedimentary basin.","Seismic interpretation; Sequence Stratigraphy; Shallow gas sediments North Sea; Sediment supply; Accommodation space; Eridanos Delta; Applied Geology","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This thesis attempts to quantify attractiveness of a place in a more efficient way and develop a model which can automatically predict attractiveness based on Street-View data (i.e. from Google Street View).<br/><br/>As a study case, 800 Google Street View images from 200 locations in Amsterdam have been extracted, and their attractiveness perceptions have been evaluated via crowd-sourcing to get the ground-truth information. The other attributes which are presumed to have a relationship with attractiveness are also assessed, such as familiarity, uniqueness, friendliness, pleasure, arousal, and dominance. The research and analysis revealed several insights related to the attractiveness of places. Attractive perception when seeing a place is positively correlated with perception of uniqueness, friendliness, pleasure, and dominance. Moreover, pleasure is possibly multi-collinear with attractiveness. It was also found that attractiveness perception has low spatial auto-correlation, which means that nearby places do not necessarily have similar attractiveness. Some visual features related to attractiveness were also investigated. The result indicated that scenes related to roads and residential buildings are less attractive, meanwhile, scenes related to greenery, blue sky, and water environment are more attractive.<br/><br/>A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model has been developed via machine learning approach which could automatically predict attractiveness perception of a place based on its representing Google Street View image.

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2017","Freight transport is an essential component of the economy, as among other things it ensures the availability of finished goods to consumers. Synchromodal transport is a new transport method that aims to use real-time and flexible switching among different modes of transport according to the latest logistics information, to utilise the different modes of transport efficiently. But what are the effects of disruptions of the infrastructure used by synchromodal transport on freight transport? As some recent disruptions in the Netherlands have shown, the negative effects can be considerable. The effects of disruptions on the functioning of multimodal transport networks have scarcely been researched. This research gap is addressed in this thesis, by analysing the robustness of the Dutch synchromodal freight network, comprising of the inland waterway, road, railway and container terminal infrastructure.<br/><br/>First an overview is given of the elements of the synchromodal transport infrastructure. Apart from the infrastructure elements of each mode of transport, two important characteristics are identified: the interconnection and the interdependence. Container terminals are the interconnection between different modes of transport, as they facilitate the transshipment of containers. Infrastructure elements whose functioning influences multiple modes of transport (e.g. bridges) are the interdependence between different modes of transport. Subsequently, this overview of infrastructure elements is used to make a macroscopic graph model in which all relevant infrastructure elements are represented. Using the random removal of graph elements, the robustness of the synchromodal network is analysed. Three case studies are used to study the Dutch synchromodal network: the corridor between Rotterdam and Antwerp, the corridor Rotterdam and Duisburg, and the domestic freight transport in the Netherlands.<br/><br/>The robustness analysis of the three case studies lead to the following conclusions. Of the three modes of transport, the modality road is the most robust. The inland waterway modality is less robust and the rail modality is the least robust. It should be noted that the rail modality provides a relatively cheap alternative and offers the capabilities to transport containers further into Europe than the inland waterways. The ability to transship containers between different modes of transport (i.e. interconnection) has a significant positive effect on the robustness. The interdependence has a smaller negative effect on the robustness. Generally, the new alternative paths offered by the addition of a mode of transport (even without interconnection) outweigh the negative effects of the interdependence.<br/><br/>These findings make it clear that the use of the synchromodal transport method, increases the robustness of the freight transport network. During this research, many possibilities for future research were identified. As the research gap for analysing the robustness of a synchromodal transport network was very large at the start of this research, many things can still be researched after this research. The importance of freight transport warrants additional research on this topic. According to this research, due to mode-free booking and the real-time and flexible switching among different modalities, synchromodal transport offers a robust freight transport method.","Robustness; Synchromodal; Freight Transport; Multimodal Network; Simulation; Disruptions; Macroscopic; Graph Model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Network Architectures and Services","",""

The focus will be on the force resulting from the filling jet through the levelling door in the lock, with the main point of interest being the interaction between the ship and the flow resulting from the jet. To understand more about this interaction the following methods are used: the one-dimensional software model Lockfill, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and scale model tests. The study was initiated in the context of improving the accuracy and applicability of the software Lockfill. Lockfill is based on the conservation laws of mass and momentum, while schematising the flow using a two-dimensional parameterization of the filling jet. A two dimensional situation was created for the scale model, neglecting variations over the width. The scaled situation was tested using a CFD model to prepare for the scale model measurements. This preparation revealed that the jet attaches to the bottom for the chosen geometry. The flow measurements consist of multiple point measurements and particle image velocimetry (PIV) measurements just downstream of the gate. The longitudinal forces on the ship were measured for variations in: keel clearance, downstream position of the ship with respect to the gate and water level difference over the gate. The presence of the ship reduces the deflection of the jet towards the bottom. The reason for the reduced deflection is the interference of the ship’s bow with the upper eddy limiting the fluid motion, resulting in a reduction of pressure and therefore a deflection of the jet in the upward direction. This means that the momentum flux in the jet for the situation without ship decreases faster because it attaches to the bottom closer to the gate. The measured forces were compared to the forces Lockfill would predict for the same situation. Both CFD and PIV predict the forces with a small relative error. Lockfill determines the force on the ship accurately as long as the momentum flux can be determined successfully. Determining the momentum flux comes down to a correct schematisation of the filling jet. Variations in keel clearance and discharge are covered quite well by Lockfill. However an increase in distance from the gate reveals big differences compared to the measurements. This is caused by an overestimation of momentum flux dissipation in the Lockfill jet schematisation. The reason for this is that in reality the jet stays more attached to the bottom, therefore maintaining a higher momentum flux. Taking into account the results from this study, the improvement of Lockfill should start with the schematisation of the filling jet. A start can be made by implementing the tendency of the jet to attach to a boundary.","Lockfill; CFD modelling; Scale model; Locks; Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV); Force measurements; Flume experiments; Flow measurements; Ships; Star-CCM+; Jet","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","Natte kunstwerken van de toekomst",""

In previous work, variable frequency trains (VFT) have been suggested to take advantage of a tension enhancement property in muscle. The varying of other parameters in stimulation trains, such as amplitude, was found to be lacking in literature. Here, the effect of various VFT and variable amplitude train (VAT) configurations on muscle fatigue were investigated. Methods: Ten different stimulation trains were tested in fatigue trials in the left tibialis anterior of 21 healthy rats. The state of the muscle was measured before and after each trial. Results: The VFT starting with two high frequency pulses caused significantly less fatigue (p &lt; 0:001). The force-time integrals of the VAT starting with 8 high amplitude pulses are significantly larger (p &lt; 0:05). Conclusion: The results of the VFT agree with previous studies; VFTs with two high frequency pulses are the optimal stimulation patterns in reducing muscle fatigue. Compared to conventional trains, VATs starting with 8 high amplitude pulses had a beneficial influence on muscle fatigue. The opposite pattern, a VAT ending with 8 high amplitude pulses produced a significantly larger force-time integral. Although a small significant difference was established in muscle fatigue for these VAT conditions, VFTs with two high frequency pulses performed better. A combination of amplitude and frequency variation should be explored in further research.","FES; stimulation pattern; muscle fatigue; variable frequency trains; variable amplitude trains","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As one of the important research branches of self-driving cars, this thesis focuses on the motion planning problems in dynamic and uncertain environments. The challenge of motion planning in uncertain and dynamic environments is that the ego-vehicle or the robot needs to intelligently reason about the interactions between itself and the other traffic participants. In order to successfully make decisions to guarantee the safety and users' comfort, it requires the motion planner to account for the future motions and the uncertainty of motion intentions associated with the obstacles to avoid the ego-vehicle ending up with inevitable collision states. This thesis presents three approaches to solve the challenge from manifold perspectives. The first approach, multipolicy MPC, introduces the uncertainty of motion intentions into the traditional optimization framework by modeling the multiple hypotheses of future trajectories as mixture Gaussian distributions. The second approach, centralized MPC, computes the motion plans for all vehicles including the obstacle vehicles by assuming the obstacles are controllable and broadcast their motion intentions. The last approach called joint behavior estimation and planning is a novel algorithm, which takes the interactions into account. It leverages the strengths of online POMDP to model the interactions through anticipating the future trajectories of obstacles under different motion intentions. The predicted trajectories are then utilized in the multipolicy MPC motion planner to compute the optimal actions for the ego-vehicle. A parallelized structure of joint behavior estimation and planning is also presented to scale up in cluttered environments. Simulation results demonstrate the benefits of the proposed approaches, particularly the joint behavior estimation and planning, in uncertain and interactive environments.<br","Motion planning; Trajectory generation; Interaction; MPC; POMDP","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-09-19","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

Over 80 sleep disorders have been classified and of those sleep apnoea is one of the most common, having a prevalence of at least 20 percent in the general population. Sleep apnoea belongs to a family of disorders called Sleep-Disordered Breathing (SDB) which are characterized by breathing difficulties that occur during sleep. The underlying causes for SDB can be difficult to pinpoint making it important to develop effective and efficient detection methods. Sleep disorders are detected in sleep studies using one of two standard setups, Polysomnography (PSG) or Polygraphy (PG). A sleep study involves measuring physiological signals such as ventilation, heart rate and brain activity over a night of sleep. Recent studies have suggested that respiratory effort and the associated increase in negative intrathoracic pressure is a key variable for diagnosing and determining the optimal treatment for SDB. This variable is difficult to measure non-invasively and is not a part of a standard PG or PSG sleep study. The purpose of this MSc thesis was to explore and develop methods to infer respiratory effort from the non-invasive sensors used in a standard sleep study. <br/>A model-based approach was proposed to create a mapping between respiratory movements, measured by Respiratory Inductance Plethysmography (RIP) and the intrathoracic pressure. A grey-box model of the respiratory system was constructed based on the underlying physiology and the existing lung model literature. The model parameters were identified for each patient using a novel two step identification procedure, fitting the model to recorded sleep study data. The resulting model was used to simulate a system response where the desired intrathoracic pressure could be estimated. In addition to the model-based method two alternative methods were put forward, to explore the relationship between RIP and respiratory effort in the frequency and entropy domains. <br/>The modelling method and the two secondary methods were applied to recorded PSG data. Respiratory effort was observed via esophageal pressure, measured with esophageal manometry. The maximum performance of the modelling-, frequency domain- and entropy-method, evaluated as the Spearman correlation to the measured respiratory effort, were 0.53, 0.61 and 0.43 respectively. The performance of different methods varied greatly between patients in the dataset and at this point no method can conclusively be said to outperform another. This MSc thesis constitutes preliminary work in the development of non-invasive respiratory effort estimation methods. The results seem to validate the premise that there is a connection between respiratory movements and intrathoracic pressure. The modelling method is the most complicated of the three but has the most potential for improvements.","Sleep-disordered breathing; Upper airway physiology; Control of ventilation; Personalised medicine; System modelling; System identification; Respiratory effort; Esophageal pressure; Respiratory inductance plethysmography; Sleep apnoea","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-10-06","","","","","",""

Furthermore, their spatial characteristics have been associated with the shoreline position in the form of shoreline perturbations, indicating morphological coupling between them and in turn affecting the beach width. As changes in the beach width affect coastal infrastructure and user functions such as recreation, understanding the bar dynamics is crucial for coastal zone management. The present work intends to improve this understanding by means of a case study at Anmok beach located at the South Korean East coast. Data analysis is used to estimate the long-term changes of the sandbar characteristics in time, under the influence of the ambient environmental conditions and human interventions. Additionally, this study investigates how to account for these features in modelling frameworks. <br/>Available in-situ bathymetric surveys and high resolution aerial photographs are complemented with freely available satellite images in order to extract an estimate of the horizontal position of the sandbar crest line at Anmok beach. The introduction of satellite imagery observations dramatically increases both temporal coverage and frequency of the dataset resulting in 27 years of bar observations. The sandbar characteristics are found to change mainly in response to high wave energy events, while the initial sandbar position seems to be an important factor e.g. the closer the sandbar to the shore the more prone to changes it is. Furthermore, the results indicate that the alongshore migration of the sandbar features and the alongshore component of the wave energy flux show an agreement between their long-term (5-10 years) trends. This highlights the potential of the alongshore wave generated current to migrate the sandbar patterns in the alongshore direction. Moreover, the magnitude of the crescentic length and amplitude in an area 600-700m away from the port decreased after its construction. <br/>The use of coastline models that assume alongshore uniform bathymetry can be questioned in cases of pronounced alongshore morphological variability. To this end, the impact of the alongshore variability of the sandbar on net annual sediment transports is investigated with the process based morel Delft3D for a selection of schematized bathymetries, created based on the natural variability of the sandbar at Anmok. It appears that for the symmetrical shaped crescentic sandbars, which are mostly present at Anmok beach, the influence of the alongshore variability on the net sediment transports is not large (~10%). The shoreline response to different sandbar configurations is investigated by computing alongshore incoming and outgoing sand volumes in cells specified close to the shoreline. It is found that the cross-shore distance between the sandbar and the shoreline is critical for the intensity of the erosion and accretion patterns formed at the coastline. Moreover, according to the predominant direction of the wave climate the alongshore location of these shoreline patterns can vary. <br/>After highlighting the importance of the sandbar location for the beach width, an attempt to model the sandbar mean cross-shore location in response to the wave forcing is realized in pursuit of predictive capability for future changing wave conditions. As process based numerical models have shown limitations in producing any predictive skill, two empirical models selected from literature are used. The calibration and validation of the models is unsatisfactory, possibly connected with the spatial accuracy and varying temporal resolution of the dataset or the simplification of the models themselves.<br/>From the present work, the use of satellite imagery for studying of long-terms sandbar dynamics and the derivation of its characteristics is proven to be quite promising. It allowed us to increase the number of observations and hence, study the sandbar dynamics beyond the time-frame of in-situ surveys and aerial photography. Therefore, we could study the effects of human intervention on the long-term sandbar characteristics. This technique is believed to be useful for other sites with crescentic sandbars around the world.<br","Satellite Imagery; Crescentic Sandbars; Nearshore morphology; Delft3D; Human interventions; Sediment transport; Coastline position; Empirical models","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","","37.78000, 128.94000"

The game is mostly used by adults aged 50+ with hemiparesis, weakness at one side of the body, due to stroke. Design Assignment:<br/>The goal of the HandsOn redesign is to include training vertical reaching movement and motivate stroke patients in starting, enduring and repeating the game.Design method:<br/>The Persuasive Design Method is used to structure the redesign process (Siriaraya, n.d.). First the “transfer effect’ is determined, being the therapeutic effect to be aimed for by the game. Second, the “user real world” is analyzed involving the user, its motives and values and its context. Thirdly, in the game design phase the persuasive game will be iteratively designed with the aim to increase an experience of a game world in the player. Subsequently, this game world experience is designed in such a way that it facilitated realization of the transfer effect (phase 1). Finally, an ‘evaluation’ is conducted on whether the game design causes the ‘transfer effect’.Transfer effect:<br/>To determine the transfer effect regular arm and hand therapy exercises are analyzed, therapists are interviewed and a literature study is conducted.

In this thesis a microscopic routing model is proposed that adjusts the route plan in a station area while minimising passenger dissatisfaction. The model also finds new rolling stock connections, implements shunting movements in a station area and considers shorter rolling stock formations. To increase the quality of the route plan, its robustness is increased iteratively and small time shifts of arrivals and departures are applied to resolve small conflicts that would lead to cancellations. Several case studies demonstrate the high performance of the model. Finally, a feedback mechanism to a macroscopic model is proposed.","Train Routing Adjustment Problem (TRAP); Possessions; Planned maintenance; Mixed integer linear programming; Railway routing; Feasibility; Robustness; Blocking times","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","Rail Annotation",""

The E-bike dynamic consumption is modelled to calculate the driving efficiency of an E-bike, and thus this model is used to compute the state of charge of incoming E-bikes in order to determine the daily consumption of charging station. Furthermore, for maximizing the energy yield of the PV system, the optimal orientation of module is analysed. The mounting and placement of these optimally oriented modules beside the road is decided such that the overall effect of shading is minimal. Moreover, as it is a Roadside PV, the system is compared with the solar road technology to see the difference of how the system behaves when placed optimally beside the roads on poles instead horizontally on roads.

(mentor); Palensky, Peter (graduation committee); Rodrigo Mor, A. R. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2017","Wind constitutes a dominant form of sustainable energy that is expected to grow rapidly in the years to come. Increased inverter-based wind power penetration may however endanger grid stability and reliability, if not enriched with the capability to provide crucial ancillary services to the grid, such as frequency regulation. In order for the wind turbine technology to participate in the ancillary service provision, a more in depth understanding of the wind turbine dynamic behavior is acquired. Therefore, this Master Thesis Project was formulated to study how the wind turbine technology can assist in providing ancillary services under increased renewable penetration levels with a concentration on the frequency support. This project proposes the frequency controllers both at the single wind turbine level and the wind farm level to facilitate the provision of ancillary services. The power system transient simulation package PSCADTM/EMTDCTM V4.6.2 is used for the controller design and the simulation study. The single wind turbine frequency controller enables the provision of the necessary positive or negative active power reserves in proportion to the measured grid frequency, via the kinetic energy stored in the rotating masses and pitch control. Thus, the wind turbine generator power output is enabled to increase or decrease respectively. The full potential offered by the technology is exploited, while the limitations associated with the provision of active power reserves are identified and respected by the implemented controller. The wind farm controller allows for the coordination and control of the available wind turbines within a wind farm, despite several barriers identified in this project. A list of parameters is used to this end, which can be varied to achieve a more sustained frequency response, despite the barriers introduced by the available limitations of the electrical and mechanical components of the wind energy conversion system. An offshore wind farm case study was performed to test the performance of the implemented controllers and investigate the impact of the wind farm frequency response on the grid frequency, in various scenarios. The successful response of the implemented controllers is proven, while no violation of physical or safe limits is identified thanks to the frequency controller designed in this project. The allowable ranges within which the controller parameters can be varied without unwanted situations are analytically discussed and summarized as important lessons learned. Finally, the active power product that can be provided within the Ancillary Service Market is quantified and described, while recommendations are made at the Ancillary Service Market level that reflect the capabilities of the wind turbine technology, if enriched with the designed controller. Overall, a positive effect of the frequency response provided by the wind turbine technology on the grid frequency is observed. Significant improvements have been achieved on the frequency nadir and the rate of change of frequency by the wind farm controller parametrization under different severity of the frequency deviations. In general, the frequency response that can be achieved through the wind turbine technology is in any case proportional to the amount of power that is generated by a certain wind farm (i.e. proportional to the wind speed conditions). The response provided can last for several seconds, thus constituting a “Fast Frequency Response” service the most appropriate option for the wind turbine technology. A trade-off between the maximum reserves provided and the duration of the response provided is seen. However, in the cases that a certain wind turbine needs to recover following a period of reserves provision, a compromise between the aggressiveness and the duration of the recovery period is also observed.","Wind Turbine; Ancillary Services; Frequency Support; Wind Farm","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2017","One of the novel configurations that could revolutionize the aviation industry is the PrandtlPlane. The closed-wing design features a low front wing and a high rear wing, connected by a lateral surface. In this research, the rear wings of the configuration are attached to a set of fins. Previous conceptual closed-wing design studies have failed to accurately predict the wing weight of the configuration, by using empirical relations or semi-analytical methods designed for conventional wings. These methods fail to capture the three major structural characteristics of a closed-wing design: an over-constrained structure, significant secondary bending moments and shear forces, and a different lay-out of the constraints definition. Therefore, a semi-analytical closed-wing weight estimator was developed. The primary weight is estimated analytically, while the secondary weights are defined by empirical relations. The primary structure is sized using an equivalent beam method, which is designed to withstand the aerodynamic, inertial and fuel loads applied to the structure. The aerodynamic loads are estimated with a vortex lattice method, at a 2.5g pull-up manoeuvre. For the PrandtlPlane configuration, the fin is modelled as a support to the rear wing. Due to the over-constrained nature of the structure, a stiffness iteration loop is implemented in which the internal loads are determined using the displacement method and all cross-sections are sized. The cross-sectional design features four booms, which are cross-coupled and four skins, which are sized independently. A total weight estimation of a closed-wing design takes 20-30 seconds. Sensitivity analyses are performed to establish the main drivers of the total wing weight and its distribution. Wingspan, wing sweep angle, fin sweep angle and longitudinal center of gravity position were determined to have the most influence on the total wing weight and its distribution. The new tool was implemented in the conceptual design workflow of the Initiator. A comparison between a design study in the Initiator with the closed-wing weight estimator and the previous methodology showed large discrepancies. Three design studies were performed with missions varying in payload weight, number of passengers and range. The total offset in the wing weight between the two methods ranged from 4.5\% to 30.4\%, leading to discrepancies in the required fuel mass of 1.6% and 5.7% respectively. Apart from the large offsets in total wing weight, the previous methodology also failed to accurately predict the distribution of the weight between the front, rear and lateral wing. Furthermore, the offsets between the methodologies are case-dependent and no clear relationship between them can be distinguished. Future conceptual design studies should thus include a closed-wing weight estimator. Finally, a parametric study was performed to identify the effect of altering the wing area ratio between the front and rear wing on the required fuel mass. For a single aisle, medium range mission, a design with and area ratio of 1.25 is 2\% more fuel efficient compared to a design with an even area distribution between the front and rear wing.","Weight-Estimation; Closed-Wing; PrandtlPlane","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

The expansion and contraction of glaciers can be observed by outlining glacier boundaries or measuring snow lines with optical Earth observation satellites. New satellites, such as Sentinel-2A/B, provide high spatial resolution images and short revisit times that can be used to make ample measurements to accurately determine glacial variability. Likewise, ever increasing volumes of satellite data make automated boundary and snow line detection a desirable solution for researchers. <br/><br/>Clouds, however, present a challenge to obtaining useful optical image data. Mountainous regions are often surrounded or covered by clouds. And clouds can be a menacing phenomenon in remote sensing because they greatly attenuate and reflect the short wavelengths used by optical Earth observation satellites. Thus, prior to snow cover or glacier analysis, clouds must be separated from cloud-free pixels. Currently, many techniques exist to automatically detect clouds and classify them. However, they are not perfect. Many techniques have encountered difficulties in cases where snowy and icy landscapes share similar properties with clouds. The mountainous topography also adds to the challenge. Steep slopes and topographic shadows have a profound effect on surface reflectances and can lead to misclassifications. <br/><br/>To address these issues, this study presents an assessment of multiple cloud detection techniques. Several sentinel-2A scenes were acquired at various times between 12/07/15 and 31/12/16. The scenes are centered on the Bara Shigri (glacier), a large 11 km long glacier in Himachal Pradesh, India. Eventually, 6 scenes were processed using 6 different cloud detection techniques: Default L1C, Sen2Cor, Fmask, Temporal Averaging, Maximum Likelihood Classification, and a human-based manual mask which was used as a reference mask. <br/><br/>This study found that automatic cloud detection methods over mountainous terrain performed poorly. Results showed that Maximum Likelihood Classification was the most accurate automatic technique, followed by Sen2Cor. Cloud detection methods often misclassified mountain peaks and glaciers as clouds. At lower altitudes, cloud detection often missed marking known clouds by classifying them as cloud-free instead. Furthermore, it was found that a majority of snow and ice pixels are relatively easy to distinguish from clouds using Sentinel-2's band B3 and B11, or NDSI feature. However, a minority of snow and ice pixels, particularly near cloud edges, are almost indistinguishable from clouds. Results also strongly suggest that mountainous topography negatively affects cloud detection performance. Finally, this study came to the conclusion that cloud detection methods have the potential to improve, but currently are not yet beneficial to glacier research.","cloud; clouds; mountain; mountains; himalaya; glacier; glaciers; snow; ice; satellite; sentinel-2; assessment; fmask; sen2cor; detection; classification; india; himachal pradesh; tibetan plateau; landsat 8","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Two DC grids operating at different voltage levels could be interconnected using a DC-DC converter. The role of the DC-DC converter in meshed DC networks is similar to the role of a transformer in traditional AC systems. The DC-DC converter could take a range of functions in DC grids. The DC-DC converter should prevent the propagation of DC faults and should also have the ability to isolate DC faults. Because of its high cost, the DC-DC converter cannot be used as DC breaker in meshed DC grids, but it can be strategically placed in the DC grid to provide protection zone separation. In case multiple HVDC (High Voltage Direct Current) lines need to be interconnected, a multiport DC-DC converter should be used. The DC hub is a multiport DC/DC converter which consists of an inner AC circuit and AC/DC converters interfacing each HVDC line. The main goal of the DC hub is the interconnection of multiple HVDC lines operating at different voltage levels and with different DC grid configurations.<br/><br/>In this thesis, the operation of a DC hub based on the MMC (Modular Multilevel Converter) converter was investigated. A three-port MMC-based DC hub was simulated using Matlab/Simulink. An important contribution of this thesis is a comparison of different DC hub topologies which could be used for the interconnection of multiple HVDC lines. Several designs for the inner AC circuit are suggested and the advantages and disadvantages of each recommended design are described in detail. Furthermore, a methodology is presented for the clearing of AC faults within the DC hub and the protection of the system during the fault. An AC fault within the DC hub should be cleared by opening the AC circuit breaker of the faulted port. A methodology is also presented for the safe connection or disconnection of additional ports from the DC hub. Any port should be easily connected or disconnected from the DC hub without affecting the operation of the other ports. The DC hub should also offer connection points to allow the interconnection of more ports. Finally, the operation of the DC hub is investigated when generation or consumption units are connected to its inner AC circuit. In case the DC hub is used for the interconnection of multiple offshore HVDC cables, the loads of the offshore platform or a nearby offshore wind farm could be directly connected to its inner AC circuit. <br/><br/>With the concepts analysed in this thesis, HVDC network system designers will be able to select the most suitable DC hub topology for the interconnection of multiple HVDC lines, use a methodology for the clearing of AC faults within the DC hub, use a methodology for the safe connection or disconnection of ports and understand the design limitations of the DC hub when generation or consumption units are connected to its AC side.","DC-DC power converters; HVDC transmission; Modular Multilevel Converter (MMC); DC Hub","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-11-01","","","","","",""

This makes it hard to obtain experimental data to expand our knowledge about them. Even doing small scale experiments is hard, since most techniques that are used to investigate fluid flows use visible light. Therefore new techniques are being developed. One of them is Radioactive Particle Tracking using Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography, better known as SPECT. SPECT is already used for medical purposes, like locating tumors.<br/>In this research we investigated with what accuracy a radioactive tracer particle, emitting gamma rays, can be tracked while moving in a stirred tank filled with 2.5 L of water. Therefore we did some experiments using a 2 mm polystyrene sphere with a golden core. The gold is activated in the reactor of the Reactor Institute Delft (RID) of the TU Delft, after which it will start to emit gamma rays. The gamma rays are detected by three gamma cameras placed around the tank. Each has a collimator with a cross slit in front of the detector plate, to obtain information about the location of the particle, such that by combining the information from the three detectors, its position can be reconstructed. First we did an experiment with a cobalt source, with a low activity, at multiple fixed positions in air, to test the setup. After that we did some experiments with the particle with gold, with a high activity, at multiple fixed positions in air,moving along a known circular trajectory in water and when moving freely in a stirred tank. The last two experiments are also carried out with the tank being aerated.<br/>We found out that the inaccuracy in the reconstructions increases when: the tracer particle is positioned farther away from the center of the setup, the frame rate that is used is increased or the velocity of the tracer particle increases. The error ranges from 0.5 up to 4 mm depending on the settings. The injection of air<br/>bubbles at the bottom of the tank with different air flow rates, did not seem to influence the accuracy. Although the accuracy is not that high, there are still a lot of improvements that can be made in order to increase the accuracy.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This thesis focuses on the IPT system with multiple pickups in the lighting application. A multiple pickup system can power more than one pickup at the same time and the power consumption varies with a different number of pickups connecting in the circuit. A problem with the multiple pickup system is that at light load the power supply consumes a large amount of reactive power for a small active power demand. The aim of the design is to build a power supply with a constant current output. The designed circuit is supposed to reduce the reactive power demand and keep zero voltage switching (ZVS) in all range of load.<br/><br/>This thesis selects the half bridge inverter and LCL-T network as the topology. The characteristic of the LCL-T network is ﬁrst analyzed under ﬁrst harmonic approximation. The trade off between the constant current output, reactive power demand, and ZVS is interpreted. The system is proposed to work at a higher frequency for a light load. In addition, the effects of higher order harmonics on the switching current and apparent power are also given in the form of calculations. Subsequently, the parameters in the topology of the half bridge inverter and LCL-T network are determined. The control circuit is built to realize automatic frequency switching according to the load condition. The next step is to simulate the designed circuit in LTspice and construct it in the lab. The result of simulation and experiment veriﬁes that the reactive power demand is reduced with a higher frequency at light load. Constant current output and ZVS are ensured at the same time in all range of load. But the efﬁciency of the system does not show a clear improvement since the loss is dominated by the cable loss, which is determined by the requirement of cable current and the pickup design.","Inductive power transfer; LCL-T network","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-09-30","","","","Electrical Engineering","",""

This implant improves the movement and decreases the pain and discomfort. Due to several reasons such an implant needs revision after ten to fifteen years. This revision surgery is a long and invasive surgery. When an implant is fixated with bone cement this surgery is even more cumbersome. Research shows that the lifespan of cemented implants is better than uncemented, but because of the difficult surgery surgeons are choosing uncemented implants more often, leaving the patient with a lesser implant. The aim of this project is to improve hip revision surgery in such a way that surgeons would choose cemented implants over uncemented. <br/><br/>Observing several surgeries, interviewing different stakeholders and reading literature showed that the main issue with cemented implants is the fixation of the new implant. This new implant needs a soilless surface to attach to. Removing the cement to ensure this clean surface is really hard, riskful and time consuming. Observations made clear that there is no strict procedure for this part of the surgery and that the amount of instruments meant for cement removal is almost endless. All the found insights were translated into the following design goal: <br/><br/>Compose a minimal cement removal set of “my precious” instruments that could be used for HRS, that fits a fast, feasible, clear and safe cement removal procedure and lets the orthopaedic surgeon remove cement in a safe, efficient, confident and tangible way. <br/><br/>To achieve this design goal a new procedure, a suitable minimal instrument set and a new cement removal instrument are designed. The procedure gives the surgeon more grip on the surgery and enables routine building. The instrument set supplies the surgeon with the right amount, not too much and not too little, of instruments needed to perform cement removal. And the Guido, a drill guide that helps the surgeon with removing the part of cement that is hardest to reach, makes the cement removal faster and more safe. <br/><br/>The procedure and instrument set are discussed with medical professionals to validate whether it would solve the current problem. Besides that, a prototype of the Guido is made, which is tested on fake bones by three orthopaedic surgeons. The procedure, set and the Guido all were received very well and the surgeons could not wait to work with it. <br/><br/>The concepts seem promising, but need further development. The materialization of the product needs to be finished and a CE certificate needs to be requested to be able to test it on cadavers. <br","hip; revision; surgery; total hip replacement; orthopaedic; bone cement; implant","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","Product Innovation Management","",""

The Neuromate project comprises three links, two of which have previously been established.<br/><br/>The main goal of this study was to find and evaluate a technique to complement the current Neuromate project with a wireless downlink, channelling the communication from the researchers towards the mice.<br/><br/>This new downlink should fit in the ongoing project and meet particular specifications. The most critical requirements are that it should be lightweight and small-scale and should allow simultaneous multi-user communication. Also crucial are the prevention of interference with the two other links, reliability and low power consumption. The three most promising techniques, power source keying, optical wireless transmission and terahertz torching are elaborated.<br/><br/>Terahertz (THz) torching, covering the high thermal part of the THz band (10 to 100 THz), was chosen as the technique to be developed in this thesis. This decision was based on the fundamental limitations of power source keying and optical wireless transmission, which appear in the weighted criteria evaluation of the requirements. The challenges of THz torching are mainly practical, while fundamentally it provides the opportunity to form a reliable non-interfering wireless link. The feasibility of THz torching for our specific application was tested by creating a proof-of-principle and conducting five different experiments. <br/><br/>The prototype includes two components. The first is a thermal source, which in the final design will be placed above the cage, and the second is a pyroelectric detector, which will later be positioned on top of the head module of each of the mice. During the experiments, communication with the recently developed THz torch was proven to be feasible. Experiment 1 resulted in an optimum data rate of 35.71 bps, allowing for the simultaneous stimulation of the mice. And the divergence of the source was sufficient to cover the entire cage, as it was found in experiment 3 that an angle of 50° was the maximum misalignment still allowing reliable transfer of the data. However, the prototype did fail to reach the required distance. In experiment 2 only 8 cm could reliably be bridged. The source was not strong enough to overcome the attenuation in the air. A more powerful source will allow an increased reachable distance, making sure the entire cage is covered.<br/><br/>In this work, an innovative and promising proof-of-concept has been realized for the wireless downlink of the Neuromate project.","terahertz torching; wireless communication; neuromate; downlink; thermal terahertz","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Biomedical Engineering | Bioelectronics","Neuromate",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2017","Over the past decade, wind turbine towers have grown taller and wider to support high capacity turbines. It may, therefore, be prudent to investigate materials alternative to steel to mitigate an increase in tower mass, cost, and complexities in transportation &amp; manufacturing associated with the steel towers. The current research focuses on the preliminary design of economically feasible composite wind turbine towers.Some of the project objectives involve setting up the design tool for tubular and lattice tower made up of Glass Fiber Reinforced Plastic (GFRP) and Carbon Fiber Reinforced Plastic (CFRP) material, preliminary design of possible joining techniques, setting up the cost model for various manufacturing approaches and assembly techniques and comparison of composite towers to steel tower design regarding mass and cost. The design tool will incorporate all the essential load cases, structural and geometric constraints and will help to analyze the composite towers with various hub heights and for 2.1 MW and 5 MW turbinecapacities.Loads and constraints are estimated through the literature study. Preliminary design of the tubular tower has been carried out using an analytical approach. For the lattice towers, a Finite Element Method (FEM) approach using Matlab was the suitable method to perform the analysis. A minimum first natural frequency constraint of 0.27Hz and 0.22Hz have been incorporated during the design for 2.1MW and 5MW turbine capacity towers respectively. For the joint design, bolted and adhesive joints are considered and the failure modes associatedwith these joints have been incorporated into the design to get an estimate of the joint mass and cost. The cost modeling of composite structures was done using the parametricequations that fit the Process Cost Analysis Database (PCAD) cost model in the region of interest. These parametric equations are usually functions of the surface area of the structure, perimeter, the number of plies and the complexity of the part. The final part involves comparison of the GFRP and CFRP towers with steel towers and comments on the feasibility of the composite towers.CFRP tubular and lattice towers show a mass reduction of up to 60% for lower hub height towers (&lt;=100m), but this advantage decreases with height. Due to the high material cost, the CFRP towers are at least 3-4 times costlier than steel towers. For the GFRP material system, up to 35% mass reduction was found in the tubular design with lower hub height (&lt;=100m). 5MW-100m hub height GFRP tubular tower showed the highest mass advantage (35%) and was the closest in cost to the steel design with the GFRP tower being 4% costlier. The GFRP lattice towers showed a similar trend with up to 35% but were at least 27% costlier than steel tower due to the high material and joint costs.The only region where composite currently shows any promises of mass and cost feasibility is for smaller hub heights (&lt;=100m) and on tubular towers. The major existing difficulties with steel towers are for heights in the range of 125-150m, and in this region, the composite tower design does not show mass or cost advantages. Based on the results of the various trade studies and optimized designs, it was concluded that the composites do not hold a definitive promise as an alternative material for wind turbine towers over steel. With the current technology and understanding of the tower designs, the mass advantage promised by composite towers is not enough for composites to be deemed a viable option that can thrive in a competitive market for renewable energy. Thus a few scopes for future research are provided that can help in strengthening the understanding of the composite tower design","Fiber reinforced Plastic wind turbine tower; Tubular tower; Lattice tower; GFRP; CFRP; preliminary design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-09-15","","","","Aerospace Engineering","","52.290023, 6.781693"

Piping is an internal erosion<br/>mechanism creating hollow spaces (pipes) underneath, for example, a dike as a result of the transport<br/>of soil particles due to seepage. The formation of pipes can cause collapse of the structure once the<br/>erosion process reaches the outside of the dike.

The Maasvallei covers the area of the<br/>Maas roughly between the Dutch towns Roermond and Mook. The early signs of piping in the form of sand boils are frequently observed during periods of high water levels in the Dutch rivers. Although the total collapse of a dike in the Netherlands due to piping has<br/>not occurred in the past decades, the frequent observation of the early signs of the piping process<br/>has resulted in the inclusion of the piping failure mechanism in the Dutch legal safety assessment<br/>regulations for water retaining structures. During recent high-water periods in 2011 and 2012 sand boils<br/>were observed along several Dutch rivers except at the dikes along the Maas. The striking absence of<br/>sand boils in the Maasvallei area raised the question if the failure mechanism piping is relevant for this<br/>specific area. In the recent assessment of the Dutch dikes, many of the dikes along the Maas in Limburg were found<br/>to be insufficiently safe against piping. The dilemma then becomes clear: the lack of early signs of<br/>piping contradicts the outcome of the safety assessment. Resources could be saved if the dikes do<br/>not need to be reinforced for piping, however, the safety should not be compromised. Within the thesis this dilemma is studied.

However, currently energy consumption data are being gathered by (smart) energy meters at the household level or through surveys. While gathering data using smart meter is highly reliable, it lacks semantic information about how energy is consumed (e.g. using appliance). On the other hand, survey allow to gather semantically rich data, but the acquisition of the data is labor-intensive. In this context, social media data data (e.g. twitter, instagram) which are semantically rich and publicly available can be used as an alternative source of data about energy consumption behavior. However, due to the noisy and ambiguous nature of social media data, the extraction of energy related information from micro posts is very challenging. The aim of this thesis is to introduce a general framework to discover knowledge about energy consumption behaviors from social media data. The framework explores the suitable of social media data as an alternative data source for capturing energy consumption behaviors, and thus to be used to complement conventional data sources. Using the state-of-the-art methods and approaches in social media data analytics field, we compose the framework which structured into three main stages: data collection, data enrichment &amp; processing, and data analysis &amp; visualization. To study the performance of our framework, we set up an experiment aiming at identifying energy consumption behavior patterns in two different world cities: Jakarta (Indonesia) and Amsterdam (The Netherlands). On data collection stage, we collected 1,306,336 tweets from both cities. Next, on data enrichment &amp; processing stage, we pre-processed the collected tweets and conduct dictionary-based annotation using our 8,329 energy consumption related terms. As a result, we identified 509,471 tweets (39%) of the corpus as energy consumption related tweets, which categorize into four different energy consumption behaviors: food, dwelling, mobility and leisure. Using the annotated streams as noisy datasets, we implement distant supervision machine learning technique using binomial classifier to identify energy consumption related tweets. Following this approach, we are able to achieve good classifier’s performance on identifying energy consumption related tweets. Finally, on data analysis &amp; visualization stage, we conduct statistical analysis and found strong positive correlation (r = 0.73) between energy consumption data extracted from social media and actual electricity load. Following this result, we show that social media data has the potential to be used as supplementary source of information for energy consumption studies.","Energy consumption; Human activity; Social media","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

At Delft University of Technology, a fatigue test is to be conducted and DIC will be used to measure surface displacements around the developing crack. These surface displacements are directly related to the crack geometry parameters. These crack geometry parameters can be found numerically via a minimisation algorithm where the difference between the surface displacements measured via DIC and surface displacement found via finite element analysis is minimised. Aim of present study is to perform a preliminary analysis before the experiment is performed in order to assess what is to be expected. It is looked into whether the out-of-plane surface displacement information that has to be taken into account since this influences the DIC hardware to be used during the experiment. Secondly, it has been looked into the noise as consequence of using DIC, and the influence of the noise on the minimisation to be performed. Finally it has been looked at the influence of the DIC noise on the accuracy of the minimisation. Since present study describes a preliminary analysis, simulated DIC surface measurements have been used. A finite element (FE) model of the specimen to be tested has been used in order to perform the study for uniaxial tension only. An algorithm using the FE model to perform the minimisation has been build and tested for simple 2D cases and a simpler 3D first before performing the 3D analysis with geometry considered. The simulated DIC noise taken is 0%, 1%, 2%, 5% and 10% of the mean measured displacement field in order investigate the influence of the noise on the minimisation. Present study showed that neglecting the out-of-plane displacement information introduces an error of around 2x10^-2 millimetres for 1000 MPa uniaxial tension applied. It is assumed that the algorithm used finds the same crack geometry parameters as have been used to construct the simulated DIC surface displacement field in case no noise is applied. It is found that this is not the case in present study. Reason is the algorithm converging to local minima located very close to the global minimum. Present study showed the location of the global minimum becoming less defined when noise applied is increased, i.e. the area in which the global minimum is located becomes larger. Present study shows that the algorithm can convergence towards the target crack geometry parameters. Accuracy of the algorithm as function of the noise has been checked for the full displacement field and the displacement field where out-of-plane information is neglected. Confidence intervals increase for increasing DIC noise, as can be expected. Due to the local minima the algorithm might converge to, it is not possible to draw conclusions on whether the full displacement field should be taken into account in order to have the accuracy required. Therefore, it is strongly recommended to change the algorithm to take extra information into account to make the algorithm converge to the global minimum. Furthermore, it is recommended to improve the numerical model, in order to improve the speed of the algorithm.","simulated DIC; FEM; Minimisation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Furthermore, this sharing of medical data would reduce the number of complications due to misinformation. <br/><br/>Parallel to the emergence of e-health, we are seeing the rise of a new related product category.

The current healthcare wearables allow a patient to monitor their health and fitness throughout the day, however, sharing this information with healthcare providers is still complicated. We see that current self-monitoring devices store their data in the cloud. However, the cloud providers do not treat the data they gather as medical data, and instead choose to compromise the data's privacy, by using it for advertisement and analytics. <br/><br/>In this thesis, we propose a new form of medical data management, in which data gathered by self-monitoring devices can securely be shared with healthcare providers. We analyze the privacy and security of e-health and self-monitoring devices, and the state of the art of current medical data security.

In view of these predictions, it becomes increasingly necessary to develop novel, economical and easily scalable methods for water treatment.<br/> <br/> Within the context of this thesis, two novel devices for water treatment based on solar energy and Earth-abundant materials are proposed: a photoelectrochemical (PEC) cell using amorphous silicon carbide (a-SiC:H) photoelectrodes and a PV/electrochemical system based on graphite electrodes. In order to evaluate their performance, both systems are tested in the degradation of recalcitrant organic pollutants.<br/> <br/> In the photoelectrochemical cell, a-SiC:H was used first as a photoanode (n-i-p structure), and afterwards as a photocathode material (p-i and p-i-n structures).  In both photoelectrode configurations, the degradation of phenol was monitored under different applied bias voltages. Additionally, photoresponse measurements were recorded in order to determine the behaviour of the photoelectrodes in the solution. Unfortunately, none of the photoelectrode configurations were able to develop noticeable photocurrents, resulting in a poor water treatment performance.<br/> <br/> With regard to the PV/electrochemical system, the graphite electrodes were first tested under an external power supply.

In addition to this study, the effect of an alternative copper counter-electrode was investigated, and the degradation of an organic dye (methylene blue) was examined.

Their use is mandated by the geometry of the joint and they perform very well under pure axial loading. However recent analyses have shown significant bending stresses in the T-bolts preventing their use to their full capacity. These bending stresses are unavoidable due to the presence of a slew bearing between the blade root and the hub. The bending stresses generated while loading the blade root, causes the blade root-bearing joint to gradually open, causing excessive loading of the T-bolt above a certain load. <br/>It is hypothesized that modifying the blade root design to reduce the effects of local bending can open up the possibility of reducing its mass and cost. To test this hypothesis, the blade root is initially studied and the stress ratio is identified as an appropriate joint performance parameter. The performance of the joint is boosted by increasing the pretension of the bolt. After an initial phase of over designing the joint to reduce the constraint stresses, the joint optimization is carried out using the Sequential Quadratic Programming algorithm. The optimization culminates with the mass reducing by roughly 110Kg and the material cost reducing by approximately 13% per blade root. The number of bolts reduces from 88 to 52. Thus, a simpler design is achieved, that promises simpler and cheaper manufacturability, higher reliability and lesser sites for crack nucleation in the laminates. The current design strategy at Suzlon is to employ a greater number of T-bolts with thinner shanks. Curiosity in the field of cost optimization that initiated from within Suzlon has proved that there exists a different design strategy that holds great promise for delivering structurally equivalent if not better designs with improved cost, mass and reliability.","WInd turbine; Blade root; T-bolt; Optimization; Fatigue","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-09-14","","","","Aerospace Engineering","","52.290023, 6.781693"

This means the subsurface heterogeneity is part of the problem to be solved. A comparison of groundwater flow and solute transport results were made using kriging as an interpolation method to implement subsurface cone penetration test data directly into the model. This generated a cell by cell implementation of the subsurface characteristics. To include the possible variability of the subsurface and to increase the reliability of the results, random simulations were implemented. In practice, the “pancake” method characterises the subsurface in a commercial software like Visual Modflow. This “pancake” method uses continuous horizontal subsurface soil layers.

Recent studies have shown that it is beneficial to use sub-boundary layer vortex generators (SBVGs). The height of these generators varies between 10% - 50% of the boundary layer thickness. However, the reduced height causes the induced vortices to be substantially weaker. Therefore, using SBVG is beneficial only when the regions of flow separation are well defined. To better understand and comprehensively predict the effectiveness of these devices for flow control over a range of operating conditions, two different SBVG profile: rectangular vortex generators (RVGs) and triangular vortex generators (TVGs) are analysed when subjected to a laminar boundary layer. The topics of interest are instantaneous flow, mean flow, far-field acoustic properties and influence of the angle of attack on the VG vane. The results emphasise the unsteady nature of the induced vortices for both the VG profiles. For RVGs, mean flow visualisation indicates the presence of local re-circulation zones in between the vanes with an increase in angle of attack. Additionally, secondary vortices are noted for both the VGs. These secondary vortices significantly influence the properties of the primary vortices thereby, suggesting that, effectively managing the secondary vortices using suitable design changes to VG profile could be one of the possible ways to accomplish better flow control.","Vortex generators; Windenergy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

(mentor); Wang, C.C.L. (mentor); Perko, Z. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2017","Proton therapy is a relatively new technique in the field of radiation oncology. The advantage of using protons can be illustrated by the depth-dose relation, which results in a more concentrated dose at a specific depth and thus potentially less dose in the surrounding healthy tissue compared to conventional photon therapy. However, this depth-dose relation also makes the dose delivery very sensitive to small geometric uncertainties. Because of this sensitivity, high accuracy of the quality assurance (QA) is essential.<br/>QA can be used to test robustness of the system when dealing with small geometric uncertainties such as air gaps. Most of the QA protocols use phantoms to test the clinical treatment protocol or the complete treatment chain. To accurately simulate a patient, the phantom should resemble the human anatomy as well as tissue composition its interaction properties with ionizing radiation. In order to be optimally test the accuracy of the treatment system, the phantom should include small air gaps, density gradients in soft and bone tissue-substitutes and millimeter-scale structures. Currently phantoms are produced using casting techniques, which limits the possibilities to include small features or density gradients. This causes the phantoms available to lack the level of detail required for proton therapy QA.<br/>One important source of errors in current treatment planning is the usage of a mono energy CT-scan of the patient for treatment planning, which measures the photon attenuation and converts this to Hounsfield Units (HU). For proton therapy, the HU is converted to the proton stopping power ratio (SPR) of the tissue compared to water, using a HU-SPR conversion model. Since there is no one-to-one relation between HU and SPR, this inevitably leads to errors, for example when tissues with the same HU have a slightly different SPR. Therefore dual-energy CT (DECT) has been proposed as a replacement for conventional mono energetic CT in proton treatment planning. The information acquired by the DECT is used in the Bethe formula to calculate the SPR directly, making the HU-SPR calibration curve obsolete, thus improving the accuracy of treatment planning.<br/>The goal of this study is to explore the possibilities of designing an anthropomorphic phantom with small geometric features using a 3D-printer. By using a 3D-printer we can print the structure of the phantom at the millimeter-scale. Multiple materials can be mixed while printing, making it easier to adjust material properties such as density. Since DECT could improve proton treatment planning, we will aim to use materials that will be compatible with DECT-based HU-SPR conversion methods, so that these materials will be treated similar to that of human tissue by the treatment system. This way, the phantom should have the same SPR as human tissue, as well as covering small geometric details.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Biomedical Engineering | Medical Physics","",""

With a research and prototype driven approach, a VR simulation and its integration into the training programme are designed. This simulation aims to improve stress resilience and decision making skills of cabin attendants (CA), and create more personally relevant training.<br/>The CSST department facilitates training to both cabin crew and flight crew on safety and security related theory and procedures throughout and surrounding the flight (in which this project focuses on the tasks of CAs). Interactive simulators are among the primary tools to convey knowledge and allow trainees to practice with a set of scenarios, from CPR and pre-flight checks to fire fighting and emergency cabin evacuations. The exploration of VR is grounded in the hypothesis that current simulations in the departments programme make such abstractions from reality that perceived realism and stress are deminished, and that VR could play a role in more closely approximating the complexity of real-life emergencies.<br/>To test this hypothesis, a user study was conducted with CAs, comparing current in-cabin fire fighting training to a VR alternative. This preliminary design includes a full-scale interactive cabin environment, with multiple possible courses of action and contextual effects such as spatial sound and obscuring smoke. The study compares the two methods in regards to stress (task load, heart rate), performance and presence. The results signify an increase in experienced stress, heart rate and task load in VR, as well as a worsened performance: the study's participants tended to make more procedural mistakes and communicated poorly when in the VR environment.<br/>One of the research findings is that VR is not as effective as physical simulators at training the nuances of (physical) interactions in procedures. Rather, its potential lies creating a virtual environment where a diverse set of events can occur, resulting in more complex and unpredictable scenarios. The simulation utilizes a room-scale collaborative VR system, enabling users to interact and move through natural motion. Trainers are enabled to create more personally relevant training, by easily creating custom scenarios using the 'Simulation Control' companion app, which also provides them with ways to control the simulation and communicate with participants that are immersed in the virtual environment.

This project was commissioned by, and executed in collaboration with Venture IQ, an innovation scouting company founded in August 2015. Venture IQ develops a software platform (named Catalist) to collect data on companies and share the results of their search efforts with their corporate clients. For every search project Venture IQ carries out the same approach, that spans three phases: Kick-off, Search, and Deep Dive. This approach does not embed client needs or provide structure to its team of analysts. <br/><br/>With the goal of this assignment to redesign Venture IQ’s service model with a focus on client needs, the assignment was formulated as follows:<br/><br/>To develop a service proposition for an open innovation intermediary to aid large firms in the early stages of their search for strategic partnerships with young ventures.<br/><br/>Through phase of discovery including review of literature, explorative interviews with industry experts, analysis of the context and Venture IQ itself, two main research questions are formulated.<br/><br/>1. How can Venture IQ’s service model be designed to better serve individual projects?<br/>2. What role can Catalist fulfill in the future of Venture IQ’s services?<br/><br/>The discovery phase provided insights into a variety of strategic motives that large firms have for searching for an innovation partner. To better understand the differences between individual projects and find answers to the research questions a conceptual typology of three search project types is constructed:<br/><br/>Market search projects - The large firm intends to gain access to new or adjacent markets to leverage their current technologies, products or services<br/>Technology search projects - The large firm intends to gain access to novel technologies that can increase value of the firm’s current market<br/>Explorative search projects - The large firm intends to gain access to, or knowledge about unfamiliar markets and the technologies, products or services that are shaping them<br/><br/>The research questions and the conceptual typology form the foundation for the next phase of in-depth research, during which nine search projects carried out by Venture IQ are investigated through case studies. The data for the case studies was collected through observations of client meetings and discussions, and analysis of correspondence and presentation documents. The nine case study projects were augmented with a survey among the analysts working on those projects to document their experiences.  Follow-up interviews were held with analysts to clarify responses where needed. <br/><br/>In addition to the goal of obtaining insights into Venture IQ’s process and client needs, the case studies form a method to learn about how the software platform is currently being used and how it can add more value to the search process. As a result from the case studies three platform user types were defined: Analysts: Venture IQ analysts that execute searches provide clients with results, Client lead users: people at the client firm who lead search projects and have experience in the field of corporate venture capital, and Project-based users: employees at client firms that are involved in specific searches because of their expertise in the field. <br/><br/>The insights derived from the qualitative data are summarized into five clusters, that each form opportunities for design. The design opportunities are collected in the design brief that states the vision for the future of  the software platform:<br/><br/>The vision is for Catalist to become the go-to platform for initiating and organizing corporate venture capital searches, and accelerate these with Venture IQ’s data-driven services.<br/><br/>The insight clusters are formulated into design challenges that, together with the design vision, parameters and requirements form the design brief, the foundation for the ideation phase. <br/><br/>Three concepts were composed from ideas that arose during team brainstorms. After detailing these concepts were tested along the requirements stated in the design brief and one concept was selected.  The selected concept describes a procedure where clients can initiate new search projects within Catalist whenever they desire to do so. This intake procedure consists of a series of questions that cover all the information that analysts need to start a search. Additionally, project information is captured in a format that allows collaborators (client lead users, project-based users and analysts) to review the project characteristics at all times and make alterations when necessary. <br/><br/>Two iterations of prototype testing with clients have  illustrated the value of a structured intake procedure. Despite the low fidelity of the prototypes valuable information was uncovered by asking for specific types of project attributes and motivations. Test users, who were client lead users, acknowledged the value of the procedure. Not only to improve the effectiveness of the search process but also to individually assess the underlying reasons for a new project. <br/><br/>A challenge for the future arose during the prototype tests of the intake questions, as some questions and definitions can still be misinterpreted. It is therefor recommended that the intake procedure is thoroughly tested to smoothen out the ambiguity that some elements might cause. <br/><br/>The most important design features are two elements that are strongly connected: a new experience for the client to start their search for a strategic partner, and a service model that is a guide for the intermediary performing the appropriate search actions. <br/><br/>The final design illustrates an innovative process for client users to interact with each other and with analysts, via Catalist. Aside from the intake procedure, a series of features is designed to make Catalist a central place to collaboratively search for potential partners and share ideas about future projects. <br/><br/>Although Catalist must undergo changes before the final design is realized, the new service model can be put into operation immediately. A simple online survey or intake document can be sent to clients that want to start a new project. From this intake survey analysts can select the appropriate actions and start the search process. ","Design; Strategy; collaboration; Innovation and Technology Strategy; Innovation; Design thinking; open innovation; corporate venture capital","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

The goal of the University Research project is to infuse service design into Ford’s DNA by introducing design research and service design methodology, and to explore the future of Light Commercial Vehicle mobility services using this new approach. The Plugs concept was developed in several workshops with Ford stakeholders, and through iterative rounds of research and prototyping. Handymen are a big user group of Light Commercial Vehicles, consisting of a big number of niches with highly specific needs, like plumbers, electricians and carpenters. A handyman’s van is not only his transport, but also his office, toolbox, lunchroom, stock room and corporate identity. Handymen are busy, proud professionals that need to stay in control of every aspect of their job. Throughout the day they keep track of many things around their van-supported business, like used materials, current inventory, working hours, driven kilometers and many other things themselves. This is often done by hand, and takes copious amounts of time, rather spent on the job they love doing. Thus, an opportunity was recognised for the automated tracking, logging and processing of business information through a connection with the vehicle. This insight lead to the Plugs concept. Plugs are smart hardware and software add-ons that add new connected features or functionality to the Ford Transit. Every Plug provides a different service. Plugs can help with many daily handyman tasks and pains using live (vehicle) data. Plugs minimise the time that is needed for arduous office work, and help the handyman to customise their van to their business’ needs. And so, the handyman can focus on the job he loves to do. It was recognised that to be able to offer a wide range of Plugs, Ford would need to involve third parties in the development process. An open-source approach was chosen. This is done through an open, collaborative and open-source process. A lead user community, called the 100, and third party developers can develop Plugs together through an online platform. By involving handymen in the development process, Plugs are user-centered and solve real handyman problems. Any handyman can completely tailor his van to his daily needs, regardless of if he owns the van, leased it, bought it 2nd-hand, or only uses it. <br/>This approach is a cost- and resource-effective way to develop a large amount of Plugs for many handyman niche markets: democratising commercial vehicle technology for handymen.","Service Innovation; Light Commercial Vehicles; Handymen; Mass customisation; Open-source; Platform strategy; Plugs concept","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

Nowadays, ‘conventional’ energy grids – including electricity, gas and thermal grids – are being transformed into smart grids, which consist of various technological components such as smart meters, energy storage, distributed generation and smart homes. In the transition towards smart grids, the EU aims to replace 80% of all energy meters with smart meters by 2020 and the national Dutch rollout of smart meters has started at the first of January 2015. There have been – and still are – challenges, controversies, public resistance, consternation and concerns based on values during the design process of smart meters, legislative procedure of requiring smart meters in households, and rollout of smart meters. Academic literature is written regarding the importance of values in the design and development of technologies and its influence on public acceptance, resistance and consternation. Still, there are challenges concerning the incorporation of values into smart grid components, especially smart meters, since consumer perceptions and other social interest are excluded from the design process. The rollout of smart meters and successful operation of smart grids gets threatened if smart meters and other smart grid components are socially rejected.<br/><br/>In order stimulate the incorporation of values into smart grid components, this research has the objective “to provide input for the design for values in smart grid components by uncovering stakeholder interpretations of the values that are at stake for smart grid components”. The values that are affected by smart grid components are identified where after value descriptions and stakeholder interpretations of the values at stake are analysed to understand these values and their background. The perspective of two of the most important stakeholders – production chain organizations and end-users – is highlighted. Values are differentiated per smart grid component, stakeholder category, distinguished into supporting- or final values, and (potential) inter-value or intra-value conflicts are identified. This provides input to answer the main research question: “Which values are at stake for smart grid components according to academic literature, how are these values interpreted by Dutch stakeholders according to national newspapers and how are these values related?”.<br/><br/>After gaining a theoretical background regarding values in ethics of technology and smart grid components, an initial list of values, including their conceptualizations, is created. This has served as input for a literature review and content analysis which are done to identify and analyse values within smart grid components literature and within The Netherlands. The initial list of values is based on values that are often mentioned in value sensitive design literature. The literature review is done on academic literature articles that pay attention to the acceptance and acceptability of smart grid components and showed which values out of the initial list are actually affected by smart grid components and whether new values emerged. In total, twenty-five literature articles are reviewed and value-laden perceptions, barriers, motivators or factors for acceptance are uncovered, causing the initial list of values to be enriched with new values. In order to uncover stakeholder interpretations of the values at stake within The Netherlands, 56 Dutch newspaper articles have been analysed by means of a qualitative content analysis. Value-laden statements and citations are distracted, recorded and coded into values while using the list of values, their conceptualizations and coding principles that have been set in the methodology chapter. A distinction has been made between positive, negative or ambiguous attitudinal directions in which stakeholders have expressed value-laden statements towards smart grid components. Values are coded in a positive attitudinal direction when they are being enhanced or the stakeholder is in favour of using a smart grid component according to how the statement is being presented or cited. On the other hand, values are coded in a negative attitudinal direction when they are being hindered or the stakeholder is against the use of a smart grid component according to how the statement is being presented or cited. This provides insights on how these values are supported or hindered from the perspective of different stakeholders.<br/><br/>Within the literature review and content analysis results, values are differentiated per smart grid component, stakeholder category, and attitudinal direction. Barriers, motivator, factors or values-laden statements are explained in order to understand value descriptions and stakeholder interpretations. The literature review has shown that values are primarily expressed in a negative attitudinal direction within academic articles, meaning they are related to concerns based on values that are causing barriers for the design, development, and acceptance of smart grid components. This means that the majority of the values are being hindered due to the implementation of smart grid technologies, taking into account that the academic literature is merely representing the perspective of end-users. Values that have been most frequently recorded out the academic literature are economic development, privacy, autonomy, trust, environmental sustainability, and information cyber security. The content analysis does not only represent Dutch end-users but also stakeholders out of the production chain, research and consultancy, policy-maker and regulators, and the media, which can be considered as a stakeholder itself. Therefore, the values that are identified during the content analysis appeared to be more ambiguous, since both pros and cons were discussed and more stakeholder perspectives are represented within the newspaper articles. This means that for individual values, often, value-laden statements or interpretations are expressed in both positive and negative attitudinal directions, meaning values are supported or hindered depending on the stakeholder perspective that is taken. In general, production chain organizations report on values in a more positive attitudinal direction and end-users in a more negative attitudinal direction. Values that have been recorded most frequent within the content analysis are economic development, environmental sustainability, transparency, privacy, information cyber security, autonomy, and distributive justice. The academic literature includes the values security of supply, universal usability, and safety and health which are not mentioned in Dutch newspapers (yet), while the value of flexibility is mentioned in newspaper articles but not within the literature. This suggest that no events, incidents, or upfront concerns occurred or have been raised within The Netherlands concerning security of supply, universal usability, and safety and health. However, these values might become relevant in the nearby future within The Netherlands as well. Therefore, all values out of the literature review and content analysis are combined in order to identify supporting relationships or (potential) values conflicts.<br/><br/>Using the literature review and content analysis results, a network of related values is mapped that is based on overlapping value descriptions, stakeholder interpretations and interpretations of the results. The purpose of this network is to provide an overall overview of which values are connected through which descriptions or interpretations and it has helped to analyse the nature of some relationships after zooming in on these value connections. Depending on the stakeholder perspective that is being taken, final values have various supporting values, which are depicted in separated figures. The production chain and end-users are represented best within the content analysis and the most frequently mentioned final values include: economic development, environmental sustainability, reliability, privacy, distributive justice and security of supply. Three inter-value conflicts have been identified between: transparency and information cyber security, transparency and privacy, and economic development and autarky. Potential intra-value conflicts are identified based on controversies and concerns stated in the Dutch newspapers regarding the values of distributive justice, autonomy, privacy, and information cyber security. Since supporting relationships and value conflicts depend on the stakeholder perspective that is being taken, the overall network of related values can be used in future research and practical implications to identify more supporting and conflicting relationships from the perspective of other stakeholders, who may have different thoughts on which values are considered to be important or when new stakeholder interpretation for the values at stake arise. This research contributes in shaping design for values within the energy domain as well as delivering a method to map related values by means of overlapping descriptions and interpretations and to analyse the nature of these relationships thereafter. Stakeholders, especially policy-makers and production chain organizations are recommended to use this knowledge in the design- and governance of smart grid components in order to enhance the acceptance, implementation and deployment of smart grids and their components.","Values; Smart grid; Energy; Design for values","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

For electricity and gas distribution system operators (DSOs), the opportunity to contribute significantly to more environmental and social sustainable development in the energy industry is large. DSOs own and use large amounts capital assets that consist of finite materials, are focal actors in large global supply chains, and are able to make large purchases due to their public role and their financial means. The long (20-80 years) useful lifetime of infrastructure assets puts great emphasis on asset risk management, and operation and maintenance strategies to optimize technical and economic performance. As a result, the purchase decision of the assets mainly focusses on technical and economic requirements and criteria. This purchase moment can be considered to be the start of the assets’ life cycle and its outcome thereby determines to a large extend the design and use of the asset. To reduce the social and environmental impact of the asset, environmental and social demands must thus be incorporated in this procurement process. Currently, a matured approach to sustainable procurement is unavailable within the infrastructure industry. Alliander, a large Dutch DSO, attempts to include sustainability as an addition to the existing procurement process. However, procedural integration in the existing processes is required to successfully and effectively integrate sustainability in asset procurement. Infrastructure asset management, and DSO asset management in particular, are embedded in a risk-averse culture with high emphasis on technical, legal ,and economic values. Introducing innovative and more sustainable asset alternatives in daily decisions generates resistance among actors as no compromise on existing technical and economic values is desirable. This actor resistance needs to be overcome as procurement decisions are made by a team of actors. Decisions therefore require group consensus rather than actors that unwillingly agree to the decision. The long asset lifetimes, dispersed and interdisciplinary knowledge, and uncertain need for specific DSO asset functions and services in the future complicates optimal decision-making even further. The infrastructure procurement process is an assessment process in which multiple suppliers and their asset alternatives are appraised using a large set of demands. By adding environmental and social sustainability demands to this assessment, procurement becomes partly value-based. Actor-dependent prioritization of demands leads to divergent and/or contradictory objectives. The subsequent trade-offs between individual (actor) and mutual (organizational) objectives are therefore embedded in a multitude of different interests, perspectives, and values. To overcome this decision-making difficulty, effective and goal-oriented collaboration among the actors that are involved is required. Multiple scientific and corporate sustainability assessment and decision frameworks are currently available. However, a proven approach that can facilitate interdisciplinary group decision-making in the procurement processes is not yet available. A general sustainable procurement policy needs to be developed to provide formal guidance in the complicated procurement. Developing such a policy will provide an answer to the research question in this report:<br/>How can sustainability goals be incorporated in the multi-actor decision-making process of infrastructure asset procurement by Dutch distribution system operator Alliander?<br/>To develop the sustainable procurement policy and answer this question, four procedures were followed. Firstly, problems related to sustainability in (public) procurement were explored via an explorative and systematic literature study, as well as 23 informal expert interviews. Policy development goals, constraints, and criteria were taken from this first procedure into the second procedure, namely: the development of the policy. Developing a robust and suitable policy was done by merging the insights from the following five knowledge areas: sustainable development, asset life cycle management, multi-actor networks, multi-criteria decision-making, and (sustainable) procurement. The third procedure validated the policy through two case study applications at Alliander. Insights from these practical cases and the consultation of Alliander experts served as input for the final procedure: the evaluation of the policy. In this procedure, the added value and compliance with the policy constraints and criteria were evaluated.<br/><br/>[-figure-]<br/>Figure 1 Sustainable procurement policy overview<br/><br/>The resulting policy, depicted in Figure 1, discusses the methodological steps that are required for successful sustainability-focused procurement in eight sequential phases. The core elements of this methodology are four-fold: (I) Collective formulation of procurement goals and the function of the asset; (II) Formulating technical, economic, environmental, and social demands throughout the complete asset material life cycle; (III) Expanding the perceived added value concept from technical and economic values to equally important environmental and social values; and (IV) Establishing unanimous consensus in decisions with diverging actor priorities to put the interests of the organization above those of individual actors, and to make long-term actor collaboration possible. In addition to the methodology, a decision support tool was developed, based on the matured Analytic Hierarchy Process and pairwise comparison weighting method, which facilitates essential dialogue within the multidisciplinary procurement team throughout the procurement process. The tool offers a structured and logic-based decision-making approach: actor-specific value judgements, drivers, and priorities are made explicit by transparent documentation and visualization of individual criteria weight distributions. The differences between individual and group priorities regarding asset demands hereby become clear. The actor dialogue can thereby be limited to major differences in actor priorities rather than discussing numerous minor or non-existent differences. Future scientific research is required on how to deal with interrelations between high amounts of procurement demands from different knowledge disciplines. To make sustainable procurement business-as-usual within the infrastructure industry, committed and inspiring leadership is required. A crucial step is the acknowledgement and of environmental and social added value, in addition to the current appreciation of technical and economic added value. Expanding the concept of added value creation, and thereby the core values of infrastructure organizations, makes sustainable procurement more accepted within asset management and incentivises supply chain actors throughout the supply chain to act more sustainably.","Sustainable procurement; policy; decision support tool; distribution system operator; infrastructure","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","",""

As digging is performed under water, only limited visual feedback of the task can be provided by means of a visualization interface. Operators require an extensive amount of practice before being capable of achieving sufficient and consistent performance. Often, automation is implemented as a means of reducing costs related to expensive operators and attaining consistent performance. However, automation struggles with adapting to unforeseen situations and a large task variety, which are areas human operators excel in. Instead of attempting to fully automate excavators, this thesis takes a more human-centered approach, and focuses on the design and evaluation of a human-like controller to partially automate excavator operations, while assuming a human operator is still present to trade or share control with. In order to simultaneously deal with the various nonlinearities in the system while providing human-like control this work proposes the use of an Adaptive Model Predictive Controller, whose underlying principles are similar to those of humans.To determine whether the controller is indeed human-like a complex excavator model including a realistic soil model was developed and used to implement and tune the controller. Finally, a simulator experiment was conducted to compare the subjects and the controller in terms of performance for various tasks and the control behavior similarity for a well-trained task. Eight subjects controlled the excavator model and performed four stages, starting with a familiarization stage in which the subject got accustomed to the system. The other three stages (easy, difficult, boulder) featured a 9 m long target path, with conditions of varying difficulty between stages. The controller showed 2 to 3 times lower tracking errors for both the easy and difficult stage while providing 1.5 to 5 times smoother inputs, but could not overcome the unforeseen boulder whereas all subjects could, showcasing the importance of having humans and automation complement each other. Furthermore, a high quality fit (VAF &gt; 70%) was found between the boom inputs of the subjects and the controller in the well-trained easy stage, indicating human-like control.","human-like control; adaptive model predictive control; offshore excavator; extended kalman filter","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | BioMechanical Design","",""

The designing process is however still old fashioned and mostly done by hand. Creating a method to automatically design these PV systems can help to stimulate this growing market even further. In this thesis a research is done<br/>into the development of an automatic PV system design algorithm.<br/><br/>The research consists of two main parts. A section related to panel placement and a section related to the inverter choice. Strategies were developed for both parts and that resulted in several prototype algorithms. These algorithms were tested to see if these algorithms have practical potential. The panel placement algorithms are divided into two categories: maximum panel placement and finite panel placement. Development of these categories was done for both flat and pitched roof sections. The shading caused by surrounding obstacles was taken into account to find the most optimal positions to place the panels. A grading system for the panel layout was developed to ensure that preferred layouts<br/>are found. The shading caused by the surrounding obstacles was also used to determine the type of inverter is that optimal for certain panel configurations.<br/><br/>A proof concept was conducted for the developed algorithms by testing algorithms on real roofs and comparing the results with PV system designs that were made manually. The designs were compared with each other in terms of predicted PV system performance, the layout and the duration of the designing process.<br/><br/>It was demonstrated that the finite panel placement algorithm produced PV systems with an average performance difference of about - 0.83 % with a standard deviation of 5.26 %, compared to the manual designs. The maximum panel placement algorithm took an average of 2.7 minutes with a standard<br/>deviation of 2.1 minutes. The finite panel placement algorithm took on average 3.8 minutes with a standard deviation of 5.5 minutes. Both of which can be considered as being significantly faster than making a manual design.<br/><br/>For a PV system with many panels and several string inverters, algorithms were developed that predict the optimal configuration of the strings. It also predicts the total performance losses that occur when panels are connected in series. These algorithms can help to determine the optimal type of inverter and how to optimally configure separate panel strings in large systems. The algorithms work<br/>based on initial tests, but not enough testing has been done to be conclusive.<br/><br/>The work done in this thesis can be used as a stepping stone for further development of automatic PV systems design algorithms. The panel placement algorithms and the inverter algorithms can be developed further into a complete automatic PV system design algorithm.","PV; Automatic; LiDAR","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","PVision",""

An analysis of the discharge data and an estimation on the groundwater recharge are desired to obtain this. In this paper, the discharge data of seven gauge stations in the Irrawaddy river are analyzed. Also, a method is described to estimate the groundwater recharge based on the Water Accounting + framework (WA+). This is done for the Irrawaddy basin in Myanmar upstream Pyay, and the Chindwin basin, which is part of the Irrawaddy basin. The groundwater recharge estimation is made with the use of remote sensing data, no ground measurements were needed for this. The method is based on the water balance and uses precipitation data (CHIRPS), actual evaporation data (ETensv1.0.) and output from the PCRaster Global Water Balance model. On a yearly basis, it is assumed that the change in storage is zero. Therefore, the annual discharge for the Chindwin basin and at Pyay could be used to validate the remote sensing precipitation minus evaporation. For the period 2005-2010 the 6-year average groundwater recharge is estimated to be 430-500 mm/year (20-23% of the rainfall) in the Chindwin basin and 340-400 mm/year (19-22% of the rainfall) for the Irrawaddy basin upstream Pyay. Most groundwater recharge takes place in the Northern part of Myanmar, as expected considering the high rainfall there. Some simplifications were made in the groundwater recharge estimation and the calculations were made on a cell basis. This is taken into account when determining the range. The method provided in this paper can be applied everywhere with remote sensing data. However, ground truth is recommended to validate the results.","groundwater recharge; Water accounting; Irrawaddy Basin; Remote Sensing; Discharge analysis","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We define a random walk on such manifolds and give a direct proof of the invariance principle. This principle says that under some conditions on the jumping distributions (i.e. the distributions of single steps), the random walk converges to Brownian motion when space is scaled by 1/N, time by N^2 and N tends to infinity (which has been shown with more general methods by Jorgensen and by Blum). To prove this, we show convergence of the generators on the set of smooth functions and we apply the Trotter-Kurtz theorem (as has been done by Blum, in a rather sketchy way and in a slightly different setting). We also show convergence of the corresponding Dirichlet forms. Then we show that the conditions on the jumping distributions are satisfied if they are compactly supported and have mean 0 and a covariance matrix which is invariant under orthogonal transformations.<br/>Next, we define random grids on a Riemannian manifold and we define random walks on them. We show that their Dirichlet forms converge to the Dirichlet form of Brownian motion, using the results above. We also prove a result that is a bit weaker than convergence of the generators in this case.<br/>Finally, these grids allow us to define the Symmetric Exclusion Process (SEP) on a manifold. Using the convergence results above, we follow the line of a proof of Seppäläinen to show that the hydrodynamic limit of the SEP satisfies the heat equation. Some details still need to be filled in, but we believe that this method will allow us to study interacting particle systems and their hydrodynamic limits on Riemannian manifolds.<br/>Before all of this we start with an introduction to Markov processes, their semigroups and generators. In particular we focus on time-reversible (or symmetric) processes and the Dirichlet form with its properties.

TCOs find applications in displays, thin film transistors, solar cells, etc., due to these distinctive properties. Hydrogen-doped indium oxide (IO:H), a TCO first developed in 2007, is emerging as a material of interest because of its high mobility (&gt;100 cm<sup>2</sup>/V·s) and high transparency (&gt;90 % in the visible region of the spectrum) as compared to other TCOs such as tin doped indium oxide (ITO) and aluminium doped zinc oxide (AZO). Recently, IO:H has been developed using sputtering and temporal atomic layer deposition. However, each has its disadvantages such as the development of pinholes in TCO films, long purge steps in ALD process, etc. For this reason, a new deposition method has been investigated.<br/>In this thesis, IO:H has been deposited using atmospheric-pressure plasma-enhanced spatial atomic layer deposition. In the first part of this project, the use of N<sub>2</sub> plasma along with water and trimethylindium (TMI) vapour as the prime reactants for the deposition of IO:H films with thicknesses typically around 140 nm on alumino-boro-silicate glass substrates was studied. The process parameters such as flow rate of water, exposure time of the substrate to the reactants, etc. were optimized, and the ALD process temperature window was found to be between 150 °C and 225 °C. In the next part of the project, H<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub><br/>plasma was employed to further reduce the total process time and to enable deposition of a high-quality TCO at a lower temperature. The use of H<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2 </sub>plasma almost doubled the rotation speed of the substrate (i.e., substrate exposure time reduced from typically 300 ms to 150 ms). This opens ways for faster net deposition rates that typically correspond to 0.02 nm/s.<br/>The electrical, optical and structural properties of the thin films deposited using both the plasmas were studied. It is demonstrated that using H<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub> plasma, it is possible to deposit high-quality thin films with carrier mobility values as high as 85 cm<sup>2</sup>/V·s at 150 °C and 110 cm<sup>2</sup>/V·s at 175 °C with resistivity values of only ∼ 2.5 mΩ·cm. When N<sub>2</sub> plasma was used similar values were recorded at 200 °C and 225 °C. A transparency of ∼ 90 % in the visible region of the spectrum and ∼ 85 % on an average was observed in the spectral range of 300-1800 nm in both the cases and the absorbance was found to be below 10 %. XRD and SEM analysis of the thin films showed that the layers deposited are polycrystalline. The average size of the crystallite increases in the direction parallel to the surface of the substrate with an increase in the deposition temperature. The average size<br/>increases from ∼ 50 nm to ∼ 100 nm when N<sub>2</sub> plasma is used and from ∼ 35 nm to ∼ 70 nm when plasma is used. <br/>Finally, a preliminary optical analysis of the thin film on a CuInSe (CIS) solar cell was performed and compared with an ITO-based CIS cell stack. From the simulation results, it was seen that no parasitic absorption occurs in IO:H in the near infrared region of the spectrum. The advantage of high transparency of IO:H, as compared to ITO, is somewhat lost as the thickness of IO:H thin film has to be increased to compensate for the relatively higher resistivity of the material as compared to ITO.<br/>The knowledge gained from the spatial ALD process developed in this thesis and the properties of the thin films deposited as such will propel advancements to further improve the deposition technique for low temperature and large area applications in commercial roll-to-roll and sheet-to-sheet production of thin films on polymer substrates.<br","hydrogen-doped; indium oxide; spatial ALD; hydrogen plasma; atmospheric pressure plasma","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-09-08","","","","","",""

It starts of by explaining what Virtual Reality means and setting the boundaries for the project. It then continues identifying interaction patterns by covering papers, literature, blogs, interviews and researching actual VR applications on the HTC Vive, Google Cardboard and Playstation VR. After this the direction towards guiding attention is taken as current Head Mounted Displays only allow to see what is in front while virtual worlds allow content all around. Using the work from Stigchel, a theory for guiding attention is set up. Together with other resources, three tools are developed that guide attention to objects outside the field of view in unique ways. An arrow in the peripheral vision, organic lines in the background that converge on a certain point and an animated sphere that moves towards a point of interest. These three tools are tested and evaluated; the arrow is most professional and effective, the animated object is most fitting in VR and very effective, while converging lines are very subtle and not always effective. Recommendations for their implementation are given in the report. Three more tools are developed that do not necessarily guide attention to a specific point, but allow users to be more aware of interesting objects in their environment; a mirror ball that reflects everything behind the user, a radar that helps with orientation and shows points of interest and finally a birds-eye view that allows the user to see the virtual world from up high. These tools are tested and compared with the guiding tools. It is found that participants do not have a preference for any one tool, but do prefer being guided towards an object of interest. The mirror ball is least liked though because the reflection requires more thinking. It could be improved by making it more convex and filtering the image. The radar could be improved by showing distance to objects and showing map elements. The birds-eye view can be improved by showing a miniature world and filtering it so that points of interest are more apparent. The report concludes with sketching a possible scenario in a chemistry lab in which each of the tool is demonstrated.","VR; Virtual Reality; Interaction Patterns; Guiding Attention; Field of View; Tools; Overview; see; head mounted display; visuals","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

In order to do so, the technical feasibility and viability, and environmental benefit of vertical cutting as a complementary mining method were investigated. The investigation was performed for the case of the Victor Diamond mine in northern Ontario, Canada, where open pit mining ends by the end of 2018 or beginning of 2019.<br/><br/>Vertical cutting has been used for several decades for the construction of water retention walls in the civil engineering industry. By placing the vertical cutter system directly on top of an ore target and cutting straight, vertical trenches up to a maximum depth of 150 m, it is intended to cross over to the mining industry. Extraction with vertical cutting can occur according four extraction scenarios. Three of the scenarios are land-based, the fourth assumes flooding of the mine, and has not been considered for the Victor project.<br/><br/>Checkerboard mining is the base case extraction scenario with an extraction rate of approximately 30%. The long trenching scenario would increase the recovery with an additional 15% but induces a high risk of instability in the existing pit walls and the kimberlite in between the trenches. Application of backfill is the third scenario and achieves a recovery of 98%. Backfilling of the trenches requires the movement of significant volumes of additional rock as well as induces time delays due to the curing time of the backfill.<br/><br/>Financial evaluation of the vertical cutting scenarios shows a high dependency of the project value on a decreasing cutting performance. Cumulative cash flow analysis and NPV suggest that extending the mine life at the Victor Diamond mine with vertical cutting is favourable. Even in the case of increased rock strengths, as expected in the deeper parts of the Victor pipes, vertical cutting has a positive net present project value. Long trenching, which is considered to be of high risk for pit stability has only marginally greater project value than the base case.<br/><br/>The development of alternative mining solutions also aims to reduce the impact of the mining operations on the surrounding environment. Vertical cutting combines multiple mining processes into one operating piece of equipment. It reduces the GHG emissions, improves the safety of extraction process and is expected to increase the support from stakeholders. Extending operational life using conventional methods would require large expansion of the mine involving the increase of the operational fleet, pumping capacity and land usage. The application of vertical cutting has the ability to prevent the negative impact of enlarged open pit mining while maintaining the benefit of continued production.","Alternative mining; Trench cutting; Kimberlite; Residual resource recovery; Rock stability","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-09-08","","","","Applied Earth Sciences","",""

As for engineering applications, the subsequent phenomenon of oblique droplet impact is of great significance for a proper design of the vanes in the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) chamber of ASML to prevent contamination. During the impact, the pool surface deforms and a cavity is generated, which later on collapses into a jet that shoots upward. Meanwhile, a liquid crown will be visible above the surface. When this crown becomes unstable, splashing occurs. We study these phenomena numerically by using fully three dimensional simulation in Basilisk C, an open source CFD package, coupled with an adaptive Cartesian grid and volume-of-fluid (VOF) method. The simulation is validated by both qualitative and quantitative comparison with the available experimental results and theory. In both simulation and experiment, three types of impact phenomena are identified: smooth coalescence of droplet with the pool, splashing in the impact direction only, and splashing in all directions. We quantify these three regimes by accounting for the Weber number and the droplet impingement angle, and compare the results with the experimental data and scaling argument proposed in the previous literature. We also study cavity dynamics and shape. The growth of the cavity angle is captured by our simulation. In analogy to the perpendicular drop impact, we give a model for the cavity expansion, from which we obtain a temporal function for the cavity depth which is in agreement with the simulation. The magnitude of the cavity depth and the displacement match with the available experimental data. Besides, our simulation captures the scaling dependence of both the depth and the displacement on the Weber number. We further point out the connection between the descent of the crown and the initiation the cavity collapse. The three-dimensional details about the crown behavior and cavity formation from our simulation provide an insight of the phenomena which could cause contamination in the EUV chamber, and offer an opportunity for a further research on this subject.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

The assignment was to design a solution (framework(s) and corresponding narrative(s)) illustrating the strategic opportunity for the future process, role and value of “strategy” at Studio Dumbar and, in this way, clarifying “strategy” as a service, making it clear, explainable and sellable. After extensive research into the external context (academic literature and professional expert opinion) and internal research into Studio Dumbar itself and how “strategy” is interpreted there (through observation, interviews and case study research), “strategy” at Studio Dumbar can be better described as brand strategy, and more specifically: the derivation of a brand’s positioning as strategic driver for a brand and its visual identity. At present, Studio Dumbar’s brand strategy finds itself at the start of visual identity design trajectories. The current brand strategy process consists of five main steps: new business, desk research, interviews, workshop, deliverables. It serves two roles: 1. It is a phase that gives direction for the design process of a visual identity, and 2. It is a service offered by Studio Dumbar and provides overarching advice for the brand. It currently has the following value for these stakeholders: for designers at Studio Dumbar it gives direction and a feeling of the company, for project managers at Studio Dumbar it keeps the project and team on track and creates synergy, for (prospective) clients of Studio Dumbar it gives them perspective, overarching advice and direction.<br/><br/>ADVICE: After analysing the options for the future of brands strategy at Studio Dumbar, they are advised to strengthen the current process, role and value of Studio Dumbar, through adopting the 5 Suit Method, which was designed to illustrate this possible future. The 5 Suit Method is a growing and adapting set of cards that define the steps, techniques and tools that can be used in the brand strategy process at Studio Dumbar. The cards include tips, possible tools to use and mind-sets to apply to individual steps. It illuminates the process, making it transferrable and strengthens it through the addition of a more structured desk research phase, other additions or variations. It therefore shows a dynamic way of working that is structured, whilst leaving room for a personal approach. In addition, making the service team-based is advised. Employing a (junior) brand strategist will vastly increase the speed at which transferability, and the mentality that goes with it, is achieved. Exploring the opportunities across Dept, a digital agency of which Studio Dumbar is part, should be embraced from the start of brand strategy projects, to broaden the possible outcomes for clients. More project management of brand strategy projects will make this possible and help maintain a transferable process. The main next steps for Studio Dumbar are to employ a (junior) brand strategist, finalise the contents of the method, redesign it visually and digitally and then launch it.<br","Brand Strategy; Branding; Strategy; Strategic Design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

These targets require significant reductions in energy consumption and switch to carbon free renewable energy sources. Changing to renewable energy sources brings several complications to the electricity system. Supply and demand of electricity need to match at any time. The intermittent nature of renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind, requires energy storage and need to be balanced with dispatchable power generation. Passenger cars could offer dispatchable power as they are parked for 95% of the time. Especially fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) connected to the grid could offer this service in a clean and efficient way. Could parked and unused grid connected FCEVs replace the positive dispatchable power plants to balance 100% renewable energy systems? This research investigates how future 100% renewable national electricity, heating and transport systems can be balanced with the use of hydrogen production and storage, and grid connected FCEVs. A model is developed that simulates the future energy systems of Germany, France, Spain, Great Britain, Denmark and Belgium. The energy systems include electricity generation and consumption, road transport, hot water and space heating. Road transport vehicles are battery electric vehicles (BEVs), FCEVs or a combination of both. Electricity and hydrogen are the only energy carriers. Electricity is mainly supplied by solar and wind power. Hot water and space heating is mainly supplied by solar thermal energy and electric heat pumps. Electricity generation and consumption profiles and temperature data of 2014, 2015 and 2016 serve as inputs. The future 100% renewable energy scenarios are based on scenarios published by government agencies, research institutions or transmission system operators. Demand response heating (DRH) is analysed and applied to all cases. Interconnecting the electricity grids of Germany and France is also investigated. <br/>Hydrogen production and grid connected FCEVs can balance national electricity grids. Electrolysers can act as negative balancing power consuming excess electricity of intermittent renewable energy sources to produce hydrogen. Roughly 0.4-0.6 GW of electrolyser capacity is required to balance 1 GW of renewables in the investigated countries. This requirement can be lower when curtailment is applied and the installed capacity of renewables is slightly increased. Hydrogen can be stored locally in high pressure storage tanks or at large scale in underground salt caverns. A typical salt cavern can store around 6 million kg of working gas. Per TWh of final energy consumption approximately 1-2.5 million kg of hydrogen storage capacity is required. Conventional positive balancing plants such as gas turbines could be replaced by FCEVs connected to the electricity grid. Peak backup demands can be balanced with 25 - 50% of the FCEV passenger fleet, which corresponds to 12.5 - 25% of the total passenger car fleet. The utilisation of FCEVs for V2G varies from 2.5 to 8%. Between 7% and 14% of the electricity consumption in a country is supplied by grid connected FCEVs. Hydrogen can be locally produced at hydrogen fuelling stations or electrolysers can be installed near large scale electricity generation sites or salt caverns where hydrogen can be produced and stored directly. Hydrogen fuelling stations need an average dispensing capacity of 3000 kg/day (∼600 passenger FCEVs/day) to cover all fuelling demands except peak demands. <br","Hydrogen; Hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles; Energy Systems; Energy Transition","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Amongst others, PSD2 requires banks to allow a way for third-party providers to have direct access to a current account’s data if authorized by the customer. This forces banks to open up their databases which calls into life a particular stream of questions about how technologies should be designed in order to preserve privacy. Therefore this research was dedicated to designing a framework of general principles for the inclusion of privacy in innovation within the financial industry, in particular for the incumbent bank.<br/><br/>The Value Sensitive Design approach was utilized in order to provide this framework through a qualitative explorative case study. In the conceptualization stage of VSD, privacy was defined through a literature review. For the empirical investigation, data was collected through semi-structured interviews with eleven experts from three of the four types of stakeholders. Values that were identified in literature were qualitatively validated by scoring their importance relative to each other. For the technical investigation, the most important values were translated into design requirements by utilizing the value hierarchy method. The application of VSD to innovation in finance is the theoretical contribution of this research.<br/><br/>Privacy was conceptualized as complex and interrelated with other values. Values related to privacy in the case of PSD2 were also identified in several literature streams. Through a qualitative validation, the final set of values to be reflected by technology designed after PSD2 was determined which shows that privacy is the value of greatest importance to be included in financial innovation. Also, based on the insights experts brought forward during the interviews, five ethical challenges that come with the implementation of PSD2 were identified. The applicability of the value hierarchy method was demonstrated by translating the value privacy into six design requirements. These six design requirements addressed the end-user’s ability to make an informed decision for consent, ex-ante privacy assessment through standardized licensing procedures and a shared license database, the possibility for end-users to manage information disclosed through APIs and the limitation of information referring to transaction’s counterpart that did not consent.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-08-23","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

Security is the protection against intended incidents. Intended incidents happen due to a result of a deliberate and planned act. Security systems are implemented in order to set up security precautions which have as main goal the protection of all assets present within the environment under supervision. In recent years security in aviation, and especially in the airport environment, is getting more and more important. The rising variety and growing number of threats upon the airport environment lead to the need for universal and rapid deployment of individual security systems. This caused a segregated way of working of the entire airport security system. The hypothesis arises that this way of working is inefficient, and a performance increase can be achieved when the airport security system would be integrated. This research is aimed at analyzing a possible approach to integrate the airport security system and its influence on the performance indicators of the airport security system. <br/><br/>Some performance indicators of the airport security system, such as level of security and level of service, are in conflict with each other. <br/><br/>The agent-based modeling approach is used to properly represent the socio-technical nature of the airport security system.

Once part of these personal devices, one does not want them to show failure. Although reliability of such devices is taken into account in the design, the fabrication process might lead to the emergence of small damages in the product. Since these damages or their propagation might cause failure of the device, a series of visual inspections and functional tests is part of the fabrication process. The obtained resolution by optical microscopy, currently the state of the art inspection method, is not sufficient for the detection of small damages such as microcracks or damages located inside a sample. To keep improving the reliability of semiconductor devices, these damages need to be detected in another high speed, low cost way.<br/><br/>As semiconductor devices shrink in size, their natural vibration frequencies increase and approach the<br/>MHz-range. Vibration based damage detection methods might therefore offer an alternative high speed in-situ inspection method. The main goal of this thesis is to identify and experimentally verify vibration characteristics that indicate the presence of damage, with a focus on microcracks, in semiconductor devices. While linear vibration based damage methods have proven to be insensitive to small damages such as microcracks, non-linear vibration based damage detection methods show much higher sensitivities to this type of damage. The non-linear elastic wave spectroscopy (NEWS) of several damaged materials have shown two characteristic phenomena: amplitude dependent natural frequency shifts and the generation of higher harmonics. Both are explained by a phenomenological non-linear hysteric elastic model. While the applicability of NEWS is proven for several materials, its performance for silicon, in particular at microscale, is still unknown.","Damage detection; Non-destructive testing; Semiconductor; Non-linear; Non-linear elastic wave spectroscopy; Dynamics; Experimental study; NEWS; Structural Health Monitoring","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-09-07","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Micro and Nano Engineering","",""

Especially, when it concerns large and heavy support elements of Gravity Based Structures. An example of such a structure is a large piece of concrete leg that would be cut off the basement below the water line and recovered on deck using a certain type of lifting appliance. The aim of the thesis is to estimate the forces in lifting cables caused by the dynamic response due to environmental forces acting on the whole system. To achieve this goal, a three-dimensional numerical model is created, with help of the programs <i>Matlab </i>and <i>Maple</i>, which, in particular, can be used to study features of hoisting the concrete legs of Brent Bravo, Brent Charlie and Brent Delta support structures. A real lift case of the leg of Brent Delta's support structure is simulated, using realistic leg dimensions. Such a lift would be executed with help of the Jacket Lift System available of the <i>Pioneering Spirit</i> vessel. Realistic weather conditions considered by using available MetOcean data and translating it into vessel motions using available response amplitude operators. The dynamic response of the whole system has been calculated and the corresponding cable forces of the chosen lifting configuration have been determined.<br/><br/>Obtained results have been studied using sensitivity analysis by varying the damping and stiffness coefficients. The complete system has been exposed to variable wave conditions, to obtain values of forces with respect to wave periods and wave heights. The influence of the wind speed has been analysed and translated directly into wave conditions. Different stages of the lift have been simulated and the corresponding dynamic responses have been established. Obtained loads in the cables have been compared to Safe Working Loads considering the relative displacement of the leg with respect to the Jacket Lift System. Finally, different rigging configurations have been studied by varying positions of the spreader bar.<br/><br/>The initial motions, without damping, tend to generate large forces in the cables. However, with introduced damping, motions become significantly more periodic and the cable forces decrease. Furthermore, it has been concluded that the execution of the hoist should rather be avoided for wave spectra consisting mainly of short waves. These waves initiate relatively large cable forces in the system.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-10-01","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

In order to achieve this, the long-term project NL-Lab was initiated by InfraQuest in 2012. With the advantage of its longevity and the multiple parties contributing with material, testing and analysing, the knowledge aimed for, is gradually accumulating with the time passing. After 5 years of running, a considerable number of data have been collected and analysed, leading to many observations, that in turn raised questions and doubts. These doubts are the subject of this research, focusing on the functional characteristics of water sensitivity and permanent deformation.<br/>A common problem for both properties regards the production and compaction of type-testing specimens. The practice so far suggests both stages to take place in laboratory conditions. However, there were indications that the performance of the same asphalt mixtures taken from the field instead of the lab, differed. Testing and comparing in terms of water sensitivity and permanent deformation, these indications were indeed repeated. Lab and field specimens did not match in performance in the majority of the tests, suggesting that differences between the two conditions are projected in differences in performance.<br/>The second common problem also evolves around the type-testing, this time regarding the test procedure as a whole. It is a highly time and money consuming process that has to be repeated in a trial-and-error manner, until a satisfying mixture in terms of performance is found. The aim of this research was to limit this process as much as possible by replacing it with regression relations. For the water sensitivity test, the relations obtained were of a fairly good predicting quality, and could be eventually used in the preliminary mixture design. The permanent deformation relations however, were at low levels of predictability, due to the test’s high sensitivity in being reproduced and the inconsistent test setups used by the various contractors taking part in the project.<br/>Focusing only on water sensitivity, the conditioning protocol described in the current standard, is considered as not very capable of capturing the property it aims for, and that it is conservative in the damage it causes to the mixture. Utilizing two conditioning protocols, MIST and Freeze-Thaw protocol, the standard method indeed was found to be the least damaging of all. With the MIST being the most destructive, at extreme levels in most cases, and the Freeze-Thaw following it, each method’s pros and cons were found.<br/>The last aspect tested referred to the friction reduction method used during the permanent deformation test (triaxial cyclic compression). The old and new standard versions both prescribe two different materials, while the requirements for rutting remained unchanged. Testing using these two materials, Teflon and Latex, plus one new, it was found that the differences in the triaxial test output were major. Consequently, this mismatch means that inconsistent comparisons take place, leading to conclusions on rutting performance not representative of the actual situation.<br","asphalt concrete; standard; type testing; rutting; water sensitivity","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","NL-Lab",""

The real adiabatic exponents are expressed as functions of state variables to take into account compressibility effects on the isentropic behavior of substances. Due to the implicit analytical nature of the real exponents, any equation of state or thermodynamic library can be used for their evaluation. The theoretical limits and overall behavior of the real isentropic gas model are explored for a Van der Waals substance. In the two opposing physical limits, the model is shown to reduce to the incompressible substance model for liquid densities and the ideal gas model as the temperature increases or the pressure goes to zero.<br/><br/>The relation of the generalized isentropic gas model with other thermodynamic properties is explored, leading to the development of specific heat relations and other thermodynamic properties in terms of the real exponents γPv, γTv, and γPT. Besides providing alternative schemes for their evaluation, special features of thermodynamic properties such as the state of maximum density and inversion temperature may be related to the value of the isentropic exponents determined by the local compressibility of the substance. Due to the exact definitions of the real adiabatic exponents at a state point, the relations between properties is thermodynamically consistent – another physical requirement.<br/><br/>The generalized isentropic gas model is then applied to isentropic flows to derive traditional gas dynamic relations such as speed of sound, stagnation properties, and choked flow conditions for non-ideal compressible fluid flows. Exact solutions are provided for Prandtl-Meyer expansion fans, and approximate Rankine-Hugoniot jump conditions are explored for real gases. Finally, attributes of the fundamental derivative of gas dynamics are explored under the generalized isentropic gas model to gain new insights into its mathematical properties. Under the generalized isentropic model, the fundamental derivative is shown to satisfy both liquid and gaseous physical limits. Non-classical behavior is attributed to higher-order derivatives of the real exponents.<br/><br/>The application of the generalized isentropic gas model is demonstrated and validated for use in non-ideal compressible fluid dynamic (NICFD) codes by simulation of the one-dimensional Euler equations for a standard shock tube problem. Several numerical schemes for the evaluation of thermodynamic properties of varying levels of accuracy are presented for evaluation of the isentropic gas model. In the application of the shock tube problem, the general equation for the speed of sound is demonstrated to be equivalent to the speed of sound of a Van der Waals gas, proving the validity of the model.<br","real gas thermodynamics; real isentropic relations; real isentropic flow relations; non-ideal compressible fluid dynamics; speed of sound; compressibility","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

But due to its brittle failure behaviour the safety of these structures is an issue. Several concepts are found to guarantee the safety during the development of its structural application. One of these developments is to reinforce glass with other materials, this concept is known from concrete structures. After fracture of the glass (initial failure), the reinforcement will function as a tension element in order for the beam to maintain its integrity. This creates an additional load transfer mechanism, preventing total collapse of the structural system (ultimate failure) if designed properly.<br/>The objective of this thesis is to further develop reinforced glass beams. In Chapter 1 this is started by defining an abstract concept called the ideal glass beam. This concept is defined as a glass beam which has increased initial failure resistance, ability to maintain its integrity, freedom in manufacturing and all without disturbing the clean transparency of the glass. For the reason of transparency potential all concepts are fibreglass based. Freedom in manufacturing is realised by the use of fibreglass fabric which can be cut as desired and laminated together with the glass panes, just as is done with fully integrated (GFRP) reinforcement. This results in the three reinforcement concepts; post-tensioned fibreglass reinforcement; fibreglass fabric reinforcement; and transparent fibreglass reinforcement. All these three concepts are not yet or only partially developed and thus require research. However only post-tension and fibreglass fabric are chosen to be elaborated in this thesis. The application of transparent fibreglass is briefly discussed in order to assess its plausibility. <br/>Next to these design concepts, some issues exist regarding numerical calculations of glass systems. Most non-linear analysis run into convergence problems. Or computational intensive methods to account for the snap-back constitutive relation. This is due to the relative low fracture energy and high tensile strength with respect to concrete. A new kind of analysing method is in development which uses a series of linear analysis together with a damage model, reducing the material properties at each iteration. This method is called sequential linear analysis (SLA). The stability if this method creates the opportunity to analyse how alterations in design and numerical model influence the performance. These alterations come from differences in modelling approach in previous research, developments in SLA from research in concrete and design possibilities. <br/>The design strategy and philosophy of a reinforced glass beams is different from the current design approach, where additional panes are used to prevent ultimate failure. What these differences are and how a reinforced glass beam should be designed is elaborated in Chapter 3. Here the initial and ultimate failure strength capacities are discussed, how their resistance in affected and how they should be designed in order to create a safe system. In Chapter 4 the origin, feasibility and validation of the concepts are elaborated. In order to validate the concepts and numerical method some validation goals are drafted partially consisting on the former mentioned design philosophy. These goals result in desired data requirements which is subsequently used to describe the experiments to acquire this data. Initially only two bending experiments are required, for validation of both post-tension and fibreglass reinforcement. Both are validated using a reference experiment, for post-tension this is a specimen without applied normal force and the fibreglass fabric reinforcement is validated using integrated GFRP strips. In addition to these experiments tensile data of the different reinforcements is obtained to be used as input during numerical modelling. Also pull-out experiments are done for the fibreglass reinforcements to have a more direct comparing approach and to spread the risk of unsuccessful execution of either experiment. <br/>In Chapter 5 the experiments are designed based on the former mentioned requirements using analytical calculations. This is done to ensure theoretical feasibility of the experiments and to estimate the behaviour. The post-tensioned design consist of GFRP strips adhered on top and bottom after tensioning in order for them to function as reinforcement. No eccentricity is used te prevent crushing of the glass edges as the tensioning is introduced by head sections on either edge. These steel components function as actuators to introduce the normal force on the glass. The fibreglass fabric beams are designed to have equal ultimate failure resistance as the reference specimen. <br/>In the experimental research in Chapter 6 the validation goals are repeated and each experiment is treated. Starting with the tensile experiments, ordinary force displacement experiments are executed on the Fibrolux GFRP strips. These experiments failed at lower values of tensile strength and Youngs’ modulus than expected based on the values given by the manufacturer. This is explained by stress concentrations due to the rectangular geometry and relative low uni-directional (UD) fabric within the composite, according to the manufacturer. The fibreglass composite experiment also failed at a lower resistance than expected. After failure loose fibres are visible implying full saturation is not achieved. Using the theoretical strength of the SentryGlass (SG) it is calculated that approximately 30% of the fibres contributed in the strength resistance. The pull-out experiments are designed as a double pull-out with one lower resistance side which should fail by de-bonding. The difference in resistance can be compared with a reference set which has equal shear resistance to analyse the bonding performance. But due to the same saturation issue as the tensile fibreglass specimen, these fibreglass specimen also failed earlier. Thus making it unable to compare the different reinforcements. The GFRO pull-out specimen did fail properly as is expected from the reference set. Furthermore, the bending experiment using fibreglass fabric reinforcement did perform accordingly. Despite the same internal slipping of the fibreglass, the specimen showed almost sufficient ultimate resistance. After the occurrence of the first crack, the resistance increases again but after some deflection a decrease is observed. This is the consequence of the same internal slip due partial saturation. The final experiment regarding post-tensioning had a fault during the post-tensioning process, resulting in an insufficient posttension force. The experiments did therefore shown no increase in initial failure. Although the post-tension experiment did not succeed, still a GFRP reinforced beam was experimented and a different failure was observed. This different failure mode occurred due to the low stiffness of the reinforcement resulting in high crack opening and earlier failure of the system. <br/>The numerical analysis is done in Chapter 7. This chapter contains two parts, first the analysis part and secondly the validation part. During the first part a study is done on different parameter and design considerations. This study is based on an experimental data set from former research, this set is also used on a sequential linear analysis (SLA) and non-linear analysis (NLA) validation and is therefore the ideal case to advance the developments. A reference model is made based on starting points from previous research and each aspect is applied on this reference model to analysis the performance differences. This performance differences are analysed based on four aspects: Resistance, deformation, crack density and amount of cracks. After each analysis a conclusion is made using these performance aspects and is graded with respect to the reference case. Two major objectives in this study is to implement the lacking resistance of the SG interlayer and post-tensioning. For the interlayer, the characteristics of SLA are used to construct an equivalent post-cracked resistance using the reduction branches. The post-tension should be implemented as initial stress/strain conditions but as SLA is still in development this is not yet available. A two solutions are found based on the transformation of the material properties. Both result in the increased initial failure, but only one represents the post-cracked behaviour of a post-tension beam in the correct manner. The numerical models of the reference case and post-tension experiments are validated in the second part of this chapter. Initially the fibreglass fabric experiment were planned to be used as validation, but this is not done. Based on the complex behaviour of the reinforcement, numerical analysis of this experiment does not contributed to the objective. The validation of the numerical analysis is done based on the deviation which represents the difference in ultimate resistance with respect to the experiment. For the reference case the deviation in resistance and deflection to the experiments decreased when the findings are applied to the reference model. However the crack pattern is still an issue as T-shaped crack occurred where V-shaped cracks were expected. Also in the validation of the post-tension experiment this V-crack is not present, but due to the absence of SG the cracking pattern is lot more conform the observations in the experiment. This case not only has small deviations in resistance and deflection, but failed in equal manner as the specimen. <br/>All results are summarised and discussed in Chapter 8, from this discussion the conclusions regarding the stated research objectives in the outline are drawn in Chapter 9. In this chapter is concluded that the suitability of GFRP post-tensioning could not be validated due to the fault in the process and the low Young’s modulus resulted in higher crack opening and earlier reaching of ultimate failure. The fibreglass fabric did achieve a fair ultimate failure resistance but as they did not have a higher resistance as the initial fracture they did not pass the validation criteria. This was due to insufficient saturation of fibreglass with SG, causing the fibres to slip on one each other, hence not able to reach their full capacity. The analysis of different aspects using SLA resulted in a development in analysing method. Using a grading system the influences on the performance of each aspect are indicated. Creating insight of the influences of different design and modelling considerations. To finalise some recommendations are in place, as this is only the beginning of a broad subject. Obviously, it is recommended to research the third concept as this could not be included in this thesis, to even further develop the ideal reinforced glass beam. But regarding the post-tensioning, more<br/>effective systems are recommended as the initial failure increase in the post-tensioned design was quite low, for example, higher eccentricity and more stable structures. Solutions for higher saturation in the fibreglass fabric to decrease the slip and increase the resistance. Regarding the numerical analysis, implementation of SLA in 3D brick elements and a better more physical correct plasticity model are recommended. Next to these independent subjects reinforced glass in general requires the definition of different failure modes and the prevention of brittle failure modes. Also would it be important to perform force-controlled experiments, possibly in combination with an impact load. Since this is the major reason to apply reinforcements. More recommendations and conclusions are found in Chapter 9.<br/>So in conclusion all the independent subjects converge to the contribution in the developments in reinforced glass beams. The freedom and benefits in application of integrated fabric reinforcement are known and more knowledge is obtained regarding design of reinforced glass structures and influences of (in)correct numerical modelling.<br","Glass; fibreglass; gfrp; post-tension; sequentially linear analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Often services are outdated and the capacity is often too large or too small. These capacity problems especially occur in stadium that are built for major tournaments. When the tournament is finished, no appropriate tenants can be found and the stadium often remains empty. Another problem for a football stadium is the infrequent use. Most stadiums are in use only 20-25 times a year. Because these times are spread relatively even throughout the year, there are no large periods in which construction or refurbishment can happen. Besides all this, football stadium are unique structures, which require a large investment. Football clubs are often not capable of making such an investment.<br/>A lot of possible solutions are researched in the past, such as a demountable stadium or a modular, that can easily be enlarged or reduced by adding or removing extra modules.<br/>In this research another possible solution to these problems is drafted. By structurally uncoupling the grandstand structures and the roof structure, a lot of possibilities arise for the stadium. Grandstand structures can easily be enlarged or reduced, services can be refurbished without extensive construction and even movable grandstands can be designed. By moving the grandstand, the stadium can become suitable for other sports or events.<br/>Besides the extra possibilities that arise, uncoupling the two structures also causes the opportunity to design both structures in a structurally efficient way. Bendingmoments can be prevented as much as possible,which makes the structure much more efficient. A lot of material can be saved, making the total stadium much cheaper.<br/>In this research the roof structure is designed. The starting point in this design was that the structure should be optimal with regards to material usage. Different shapes are designed, which are compared by both structural and functional aspects. A few systems are selected that will be used for the preliminary calculations. In the preliminary calculations each of the different systems is calculated and optimised with Karamba and Galapagos. The total self-weights of the systems are compared and the best scoring system is analyzed further.<br/>This final system is then modeled parametrically. Multiple parameters, like the height, centre-to-centre distances and the different cross-sections, are optimised to determine the optimal design with regards to material usage. After all parameters are optimised, the final design is calculated thoroughly. The results of these calculations are compared to similar structures to check if it really is an optimal design. From the results it follows that similar structures have a larger self-weight. This shows that the design in this research is indeed an appropriate alternative compared to more traditional stadium designs.<br/>Besides the final design, also some design options are researched to see their influence on the structural behaviour of the roof structure. These design options are, for instance, a slightly different shape or a roof with a hole in it. These options can be seen as extras for the design. The determination of the structural consequences of these extras show how much they influence the total price of the system.","Stadium; parametric design; dome; steel; optimisation; large-span structure","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Building Engineering","",""

The strategy consists of a logistical solution in the form of a stock keeping scenario and a mechanism to exchange parts of the drive train. Requirements for the maintenance strategy is to be innovative, in order to stand out from conventional wind turbines and to reduce downtime to a maximum of 5%, in order to be competitive with conventional wind turbines. The research was performed by simulating five stock keeping scenarios and six mechanisms to exchange the complete drive train, or parts of the drive train. Every combination between stock keeping scenario and exchange mechanism was simulated for a 700 MW DOT wind farm located at the proposed wind farm sites of both “Hollandse Kust: Noord-Holland"" and “IJmuiden Ver"", for 5.0 MW and 7.0 MW turbine configurations. The simulations were carried out using the O&amp;M Calculator developed by ECN. The results of the simulations show that the conventional approach to maintaining offshore wind turbines is not the best approach. In terms of a logistical solution, making use of a dedicated maintenance island in the sea or a floating workshop in the form of a service operations vessel (SOV) gives a 2 to 3% higher availability compared to how stock keeping is currently performed. Nowadays the exchange of components of the drive train is done by expensive and scarce installation vessels. Even though a large intervention like this is not often needed a decrease in downtime of up to 1% can be achieved if DOT wind farms make use of a better exchange mechanism. Best results are achieved for an integral exchange of the complete drive train, hub and blades, in case of component failure. For a DOT wind farm to reach the industry's goals to reduce downtime to a maximum of 5% the maintenance strategy needs to be changed. The greatest downtime reduction is found in reducing the waiting time for a suitable weather window. Keeping resources closer to the wind farm or improving weather capabilities of your vessel can help in doing so. Conclusively an innovative component exchange, making use of the modular concept of the DOT can ensure a maximum downtime of 5%.","Wind; Operation; Maintenance","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The design life of these Jack-ups is typically around 30 years. However, some have remained operational after exceeding their design life. It is therefore critical to gain an understanding how long and under what conditions these jacks-ups are still able to operate safely. There are two main deterioration processes in Jack-ups as they age: metal fatigue and corrosion. Fatigue is a process that weakens material due to repetitive loading and unloading. Corrosion is the deterioration of a metal caused by an electrochemical reaction between it and its environment. In this thesis these two deterioration processes are assessed and quantified in two Seafox Jack-ups. Fatigue is assessed on the Seafox 2 and corrosion on the Seafox Burj. The structural characteristics of a Jack-up result in a significant dynamic response. Therefore, a dynamic analysis is conducted to determine the stresses in the jack-up legs. Furthermore, various non-linearities justify a time domain finite element analyses conducted in USFOS. The thesis presents a structural model of the Seafox 2 using a simplified hull and spring elements to represent the hull-leg and leg-ground connections. Environmental loading is determined by using the actual wave records kept for each operating location of the Seafox 2 in a simulation. The simulation identifies a critical joint with the highest stress range. The hot spot stress range in this joint is determined using stress concentration factors (SCF), using two methods: parametric equations of Efthymiou and finite element analyses. From the hot spot stress ranges and the number of recorded stress cycles at each location the fatigue life of this critical joint is calculated with a S-N curve. The critical joint is used as proxy to establish the design fatigue life of the Seafox 2 based on actual wave loading. The analysis shows a design fatigue life of the Seafox 2 of 262,2 years. This supports the conclusion that the rig can remain operational. Although the analysis conducted is a conservative one, the non-linearity of the S-N curve (small fluctuations in in stress cause large changes in fatigue life) makes it advisable to continue to check critical joints for cracks when the Seafox 2 is docked. The Seafox Burj went into docking in 2015. Ultrasonic thickness measurements made it clear that the Burj had significant steel diminution due to corrosion in the legs. For commercial reasons Seafox wanted to know whether the legs needed to be replaced unconditionally, or that the Burj could still operate in lower water depths. The ultimate limit state for the Burj, with steel diminution due to corrosion, is calculated for three locations. Two are possible locations where the Burj might be deployed and one chosen as a model benchmark. The Burj is modelled in the same manner as the Seafox 2. From the results it can be concluded that steel diminution has a considerable impact on the ultimate limit state. The analysis indicates that the Burj, cannot operate in deep waters anymore without costly leg repairs. The analysis indicates that it can still operate safely in shallow waters. Therefore, narrowing the work scope of the Burj to shallower waters is a viable way to avoid costly leg repairs.","Jack-up; Fatigue; Dimunition; Dynamic Analysis; Finite Element Analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A bed protection usually consists of relatively large stones.<br/>For calculating the required dimeter of the stones several formulae are available, of which the formula of Shields is the most well-known. In most of these formulae the required dimeter depends on the maximum flow velocity.<br/>Almost all flows in hydraulic engineering are turbulent. This means that the velocities are not constant in time, but fluctuating. Due to this irregular nature, the flows are described in a statistical way with a mean velocity and a standard deviation. This standard deviation is called turbulence. <br/>In a uniform flow, the amount of turbulent remains constant, but it increases rapidly just behind a hydraulic structure and decreases gradually further downstream. The situation that will be dealt with in this research is that of the Backward Facing Step. <br/>The turbulence is often represented as the amount of turbulent energy.<br/>If the relative turbulence is known, the maximum velocity can be calculated and from that follows the required stone diameter. Knowing the standard deviation of the velocities is therefore very important, since having too small stones can destroy the bed protection and too large stones are more expensive and their placement could lead to practical problems.<br/>Voortman (2013) came up with a new method to predict the turbulent energy, based on the energy cascade. He assumed that the dissipation rate of the turbulent energy depends on the amount of energy itself. Hoeve (2015) concluded, based on earlier experiments, that the method might work for the increase of turbulence, but that not enough data was available for calibrating the method for predicting the decrease of turbulence further downstream.<br/>For this reason, twelve new experiments were done in the Laboratory for Fluid Mechanics of the Delft University of Technology. The experiments consisted of a step and a certain combination of water depth, flow velocity and bed roughness behind the step. <br/>In these experiments, the flow velocities were measured at various locations and levels, so that the mean velocity and standard deviations at various locations are known.<br/>In combination with the measured water depths, the head levels and turbulent energy could be calculated at each location and from that the change in head level and turbulent energy could be calculated.<br/>The measurement data was obtained in both the deceleration zone and behind the reattachment point. <br/>After a careful analysis, it turned out that it is possible to describe the dissipation of the turbulence with an exponential function, as suggested by Voortman (2013).<br/>With the obtained data it should be possible in the near future to find a better link between the generation and dissipation of turbulent energy as well, leading to the creation of a new turbulence method and resulting in better bed protections.<br","turbulence modeling; Backward facing step; Bed protection; hydraulic engineering; Flume experiments; Turbulent energy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The European Union adopted a Circular Economy package in 2015, while the Dutch government introduced a programme to achieve a circular economy by 2050. The construction industry is regarded in particular, being responsible for the use of about 50% of all raw materials. Innovation in the field of demountable and reusable structural elements is therefore of importance. By connecting composite (steel-concrete) slabs to steel beams using shear studs, composite beams are created. This results in a structurally efficient composite flooring system. However, demounting and reusing this system is very difficult due to the welded connection of the shear studs to the steel beam and the embedment of the studs in the concrete. This research aims to provide recommendations for the design of a demountable composite flooring system in which both the steel beams and the composite slab can be reused, while its structural efficiency is retained. Additionally, the environmental benefits of this system are assessed.<br/><br/>To quantify the environmental advantages of a composite flooring system, a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) has been conducted based on a case study of the Temporary Courthouse building in Amsterdam. For this building, it is found that the use of a composite flooring system instead of hollow core slabs leads to a reduction in environmental impact of 16-37%. For a building with main spans of 16.2 m instead of the original 10.8 m, this reduction increases to 35-51%. This is mainly caused by the reduction in the amount of concrete in the composite slab. Additionally, the weight reduction of 40-50% compared to hollow core slabs is beneficial for the transport-related environmental impact. Furthermore, it is found that the importance of the steel beams for the total environmental impact of the composite flooring system is limited: a reduction in steel section size due to shear interaction between the beam and the<br/>slab only leads to a reduction of 2-6% in environmental impact. However, a cost analysis shows that material costs are reduced with €12 - €31 per square metre when shear interaction is achieved. This shows that the use of demountable shear connectors between the beam and the slab can be viable, as long as the costs of the shear connectors are kept below these amounts.<br/><br/>The structural behaviour of a composite beam with a composite slab and M20 grade 8.8 bolts as demountable shear connectors has been analyzed in more detail by means of analytical calculations and finite element analysis. It is found that initial slip due to bolt-to-hole clearances must be prevented in order to avoid larger deflections than allowed. A demountable composite flooring system is proposed in which the slab is cast in-situ for the first use, after placing the shear connectors, and reused as prefab elements without the shear connectors. In this way, bolt-to-hole clearances are avoided, while the main advantages of composite slabs are retained. Design recommendations are provided as a framework for the future development of a demountable composite flooring system.","Life Cycle Assessment; Composite; demountable; Reusable; Circular Economy; Structural design; Sustainability; Shear connector","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

SkyTeam, the company for which this project was executed, currently is the second biggest airline alliance worldwide. In 2012 SkyTeam introduced SkyPriority: a set of eight privileges for customers with a first or business class ticket and for customers within the highest tiers of the airlines’ frequent flyer programs (FFPs).

By automatically collecting upcoming flight-details from the e-mail inbox of the customer, the assistant is able to provide him with the right information at the right time throughout the whole journey. In addition, it shows the customer the privileges he can make use of, taking into account his cabin service, FFP status and the airport he is visiting. By doing so, Cura aligns the customer’s expectations of the trip with the actual experience. Moreover, the assistant can be used regardless of the airline the customer is flying with, as long as it is a SkyTeam airline. As a consequence, the customer doesn’t have to download an extra app, but can keep using the app of his most frequently used airline. This not only increases the relevance of the apps of the 20 airlines when travelling with multiple airlines, but also creates consistency between the different journeys of the customer.<br/>IMPLEMENTATION <br/>In order to deliver the most accurate information possible, several requirements that are important for the well-functioning of Cura were listed. To realize the assistant, it is recommended to initially break the proposition down into a minimum viable product (MVP). Although this version of the assistant wouldn’t yet be able to give intelligent suggestions (based on e.g. personal preferences, time, location and past behavior), it would already fulfill the most urgent needs of the customer: taking away stress and confusion and creating consistency between the different journeys. After this, the recommended improvements will result in a more personalized and complete version of the assistant. <br/>VALUE FOR SKYTEAM AND THE MEMBER AIRLINES <br/>The service increases the customers’ benefit when travelling with the SkyTeam airlines, fosters the loyalty of existing SkyPriority customers and could attract new customers. Moreover, the concept responds to the wish of the member airlines to become more digital, but also allows them to customize and deliver the service as being their own. Worth mentioning is that there currently is no other alliance that offers such a product to its HVCs. Therefore introducing Cura would, as desired, differentiate SkyTeam among highly innovative airlines and alliances.","Service design; Aviation; Application; SkyTeam; SkyPriority customers; Customer Journey","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","Product Innovation Management","",""

More specifically, roll motion is of high significance for barges, in order to correctly predict the acceleration of the structure caused by roll motion and determine the procedure of sea-fastening and off-loading. The correct forecast of roll motion requires accurate estimation of roll damping. At the same time, the main sources of roll damping are the creation of waves, skin friction and creation of vortices (eddies), due to roll motion. For this reason, the physics of the problem cannot be fully described by a flow model based on potential theory, as it is highly dependent on vorticity and viscous effects. As a consequence, potential theory algorithms underestimate roll damping, which results in over prediction of roll motion and thus in a conservative estimate of workability. It is also important to mention that the vorticity and the viscous effects, lead to nonlinear damping characteristics. More specifically, the roll damping moment is controlled by its odd numbered harmonics, the first of which is dominant. Consequently, it is common to express the damping moment in an equivalent linearized form, equal to the first harmonic.<br/>During the last years simulating the flow around the rolling vessel using viscous flow algorithms is becoming more and more popular. Using CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) is a cheap and fast way to create a “numerical” wave tank and perform numerical decay tests, forced roll simulations, and roll response simulations in regular waves. Of course the underlying algorithm should be validated, before any commercial or scientific use. In this thesis, roll damping will be estimated by performing virtual forced oscillation tests, and the computed roll damping coefficients will be presented as a function of roll amplitude. The virtual forced oscillation tests have been performed with the open-source CFD software OpenFOAM. Additionally, numerous numerical experiments are performed in order to choose the optimum discretization schemes, turbulence model, mesh and time configurations. Finally, Ikeda’s experimental data is used in order to validate the viscous flow algorithm and the numerical model. Two methodologies have been used in order to determine the nonlinear roll damping. In the first case the free surface is included in the viscous flow model, using the Volume of Fluid method. The second approach disregards any free surface effect and the total damping is calculated as a superposition of viscous (by viscous flow algorithm) and wave (by potential theory algorithm) damping. Both approaches are compared with Ikeda’s experimental data and it is concluded that both methods are able to capture accurately the linearized roll damping coefficients, for various amplitudes. Finally, viscous flow simulations of the full scale barge, in order to calculate the roll damping coefficients, are notably time consuming. For this reason, in order to reduce the computational time, the methodology which neglects the free surface effect, is chosen, as it is a good compromise between time efficiency and accuracy.","Roll damping; Roll motion; CFD; Viscous flow simulations; OpenFOAM","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-09-05","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

The application is mainly in roof structures. The members, spanning between two supports on the perimeter, are connected at their intersections by joints, and assembled in an initially straight grid. By lifting at a sufficient number of points the straight grid is subsequently transformed into a bent shape and new geometry is preserved by fixing the supports. Subsequently, the curved surface is braced with a third layer of flexible members. According to this specific principle of construction, actively bent grid shells can be built within a short period of time. <br/>ThinkShell, a research team at École des Ponts ParisTech, has developed a number of actively bent Glass Fiber Reinforced (GFRP) grid shells over the last ten years. Due to mechanical properties such as lightweight, high elastic limit strain, and high stiffness, Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer (CFRP) becomes an interesting material choice for construction of long-span actively bent grid shells. <br/><br/>In the actively bent members of the grid shells considerable amount of permanent stresses is present. The main source of stress is caused by the transformation of the straight grid into a bent shape during erection. Fiber Reinforced Polymer (FRP) is sensitive to creep behavior, which may lead to possible collapse mechanism due to creep-rupture or creep-buckling as a result of reduced stiffness of the material on a long-term. Limited knowledge is available of the time-dependent long-term creep behavior of CFRP, in the field of structural design of buildings. The main objective of this research was to define stress limits related to time-dependent long-term creep behavior of CFRP in members of actively bent grid shells, using the Stepped Isostress Method (SSM). <br/><br/>The most important conclusion drawn from the experiments using the SSM is that, in actively bent grid shell design, it is crucially important to stay below the sustained stress limits to avoid creep-rupture, as the CFRP fails in a brittle manner. From the SSM analysis using test data from bending experiments it was concluded that if the permanent load in the CFRP is 55% of the ultimate load, creep-rupture will happen in 40 days. This result does not seem realistic as the sustained stress limit from CUR96 corresponds to a service life of 50 years. Out of the four steps in processing of raw test data using the SSM, the rescaling step is the most critical step. There is strong dependence between the rescaling step and the horizontal shifting step. To determine the rescaling values and horizontal shifting for the bending experiments, a corresponding conventional creep tests as a reference test is proposed. <br/> The SSM represents a promising method for accelerated creep testing and corresponding test data analysis for CFRP in members of actively bent grid shells. Sustained stress limits derived from the SSM may be used as more realistic, i.e. less conservative stress limit values to avoid creep-rupture, compared to the values defined in CUR96, for the specific design parameters. <br","actively bent grid shells; CFRP; creep; Stepped Isostress Method","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2017","Structural design optimization is the process of obtaining an optimized structure while satisfying a set of criteria. The process can be divided into three stages: topology optimization (stage one), geometry extraction (stage two) and shape optimization (stage three). The last two stages are regarded to be the post-processor of topology optimized results and this MSc. Thesis proposes a new method for this part. At stage one, topology optimized results show unwanted features, namely jagged boundaries (i.e. poor smoothness) and intermediate densities (i.e. poor crispness). The post-processor should overcome these unwanted properties.<br/>During post-processing the geometry is described implicitly by a Level Set Function (LSF). The zero-level contour of the LSF describes the actual geometry. The LSF is constructed by summing a set of Radial Basis Functions (RBFs) each multiplied with a weight, resulting in a smooth summation. At stage two, a geometry is extracted by setting up and solving a set of equations linking the RBFs to the densities obtained at stage one.<br/>At stage three, a shape optimization is done to compensate the loss of structural performance, which resulted from translating the densities to an LSF at stage two. The geometry described by the LSF does not match the mesh created for stage one. A fictitious domain method called the Finite Cell Method (FCM) is used to perform a structural analysis on the non-matching mesh. A sensitivity analysis is done to provide gradient information to the gradient-based optimizer, the Method of Moving Asymptotes (MMA). Controlling the slope of the LSF is needed to make sure the sensitivities do not become zero throughout the domain. The maximum possible slope of the LSF can be fixed by setting a bound on the weights of the RBFs. Furthermore, intermediate densities are penalized such that these provide relatively low stiffness compared to its material use.<br/>Several case studies are done using the proposed method. The post-processor: (1) improves the smoothness due to the use of the smooth LSF, (2) decreases the amount of intermediate densities by an average factor of 5.5 and (3) achieves an average 10\% improve in performance between stage two and three. The computation time is strongly problem dependent, test cases are either: slower, equally fast or faster than the topology optimization of stage one.","topology optimization; shape optimization; Level Set Method; Finite Cell Method","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-09-01","","","","","",""

The main issue preventing wide application of the technology is its high noise level. One of the main contributors to this noise is the pressure fluctuations generated during the interaction between a propeller tip vortex and a downstream surface.<br/><br/>The goal of this research project is to create a better understanding of the vortex- surface interaction, which would allow for more effective noise mitigation strategies to be developed. An experimental approach was adopted to quantify the effect of a number of governing parameters on the pressure fluctuations over the surface induced by the vortex. Furthermore, an attempt was made to develop a conceptual model describing the vortex-surface interaction in order to study the relative contributions of the sub-phenomena of the interaction. The accuracy of the conceptual model was assessed using the data obtained from the experimental campaign.<br/><br/>From the results it was clear that the low pressure vortex core was the primary mechanism that generated fluctuations over the surface. The vortex path was clearly visible and dominant over a large part of the chord. In the slipstream region the wake generated the largest pressure fluctuations. The effect of the wake was contained at the leading edge, up to 4% of the wing chord.<br/><br/>Large discrepancies between the unsteady pressure, both in magnitude and in spatial distribution, were observed. Three contributing factors to the discrepancies were identified, namely the overestimation of the induced angle of attack effect, the use of the Lamb-Oseen vortex model and the method of determining the vortex core radius. These discrepancies implied that the conceptual model could not be used for its intended purposes.<br/><br/>The results of this study show that the advance ratio and incidence angle are the most critical parameters governing the vortex-surface interaction. Although the former is difficult to incorporate into noise mitigation strategies, the latter can be used as a parameter in the initial design phase. Interestingly, the geometry of the airfoil seems to have limited effect on both the magnitude and distribution of the interaction. Although the conceptual model discussed in this report is not accurate, the development of such a simplified model would still contribute a lot to the body of knowledge. It could be used to evaluate the relative contributions of the different vortex-surface interaction sub-phenomena, or to perform a 'parameter sweep' to investigate the effect of the governing parameters on the unsteady pressure distribution and magnitude.","vortex-surface interaction; experimental; Conceptual modelling; m-tunnel; aerodynamics; propeller noise","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering | Flight Performance and Propulsion","",""
