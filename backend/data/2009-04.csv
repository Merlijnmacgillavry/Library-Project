Even though these structured overlay networks are usually closed, there is still the risk that one or more nodes get compromised by attackers. When these networks provide business critical services, serious harm can be done by a compromised node. Because these networks are company controlled, properties like available bandwidth and latency times are much better known than in a general wide area network like the Internet. This knowledge can be used to create a system where malicious nodes in the network can be detected and located in a relatively short period of time and with little overhead. This thesis describes the design and implementation of the Sphinx protocol that provides this functionality. We show that it is possible to detect and locate malicious nodes in a distributed hash table in a short period of time, with little overhead, and with high sensitivity. We are able to detect and locate the nodes that cause latency deviations, dropping of messages, mis-routing of messages, and changing of the message payload.","DHT","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Parellel and Distributed Systems Group","","","",""

In the last two centuries the city was connected to land infrastructure (railway and roads), which led to a shift of the city centre. With the coming of the railway and its station south of Dordrecht in 1872 the main entrance to the city was shifted from the rivers to the land. This led to a shift of the location of the city centre, it used to be parallel to the river, now it shifted more to the south, leading to regression in the old city centre and to a diminished connection with the other cities on the river banks (Zwijndrecht and Papendrecht).","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Design and Construction","","","",""

The results of these studies are of great importance to study the effect of eustatic sea-level change and analogue studies for hydrocarbon reservoirs. Relatively less research has been done in the Northeastern Caspian Sea, which is the flattest and shallowest part of the sea. The subsurface architecture and processes that lay down sediments in this area are relatively unknown. Therefore the objective of this study is to increase the knowledge of the depositional environments and shallow subsurface architecture of the Northeastern Caspian Sea. The results of this study can be used for the development of North Caspian offshore-petroleum-production facilities, as an analogue for reservoirs deposited in similar conditions and to study the effects of sea-level change on low gradient coasts. For this project 6 new offshore cores have been drilled to a depth of 10m in the Northeastern Caspian Sea. In addition, a large amount of shallow subsurface data has been gathered from cores, cone penetration tests and seismics, during the development of offshore hydrocarbon-fields in the area. Sedimentological descriptions of the new cores were made, samples were dated with radiocarbon techniques and a biostratigraphical analysis was performed. The depositional environments for the different lithofacies were determined and a sequence stratigraphical framework was developed. With the available data a 3D-subsurface model was build with Petrel software to visualize the spatial sediment distribution and test the developed concepts. Four lithofacies, deposited in different depositional environments were found in the cores. The oldest deposits are dated before 48.000y BP, they have been deposited as aeolian dunes during a lowstand and were reworked during a transgression by coastal processes. On top, lagoonal sediments are deposited between at least 48.000y BP and 42.000y BP during multiple centennial to millennial or less frequent sea-level cycles. These deposits are overlain by transgressive barrier-like sands which have been radiocarbon dated around 27.000y BP. The sediments in the top of the cores have been deposited after the Mangyshlak or Derbent regression in an environment with a low sediment influx and frequent sea-level changes. The study shows that the depositional environment in a low gradient environment with frequent sea-level changes mainly depends on the relative position to the coast, the supply of sediments and the speed of sea-level change. It increases our knowledge of the depositional environments and subsurface architecture of the Northeastern Caspian Sea.","Caspian; Kazakhstan; subsurface architecture; depositional environment","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2009-05-31","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Applied Earth Sciences","","","",""

(mentor)","2009","Royal Boskalis Westminster nv is an international group with a leading position in the world market for dredging services. In most practical cases a jet installation or a big discharge aperture is used for the fast unloading of a load of sand. When a relative small discharge opening, without the use of a jet installation, is used to unload a hopper, the unloading time will increase. Uncertain is how much longer this type of unloading will take and what kind of mechanisms play a crucial role in this unloading procedure. The goal of this study is to analyse and describe this unloading process. An attempt is made to model the processes in such a way that an estimation can be made for the unloading time. During this research two sets of experiments were executed, the preliminary and the main experiments, each with a different experiment set-up, to obtain more insight in the unloading process. The goal of both sets of experiments was to get a two dimensional view on the sand-water-processes above the discharge opening. The most important parameters which are varied during the experiments are the width of the discharge opening (wdo) and the height of the sand at the start of the unloading process. Out of the preliminary and main experiment comes the qualitative description of the unloading process in time: 1. Coming into existence of a dome. 2. The failure of the dome. 3. Fluidization of sand mass. 4. Break through of water through the sand-water mixture 5. Breaching of sand from the walls at both sides of the discharge opening. For two components out of the unloading process a first set-up for a quantitative model is made with as final goal a good prediction of the total unloading time of a barge. These two components are: 1. The dome that comes into existence 2. The moment of failure of the dome With the theory in this thesis and the data of the executed experiments can be concluded: Total unloading time: o The total unloading time decreases for an increasing width of the discharge opening Expanding velocities: o A new approach has been developed for the single particle mode in which the perpendicular expanding velocity for the roof of the dome (?=180 degrees) is approximately 2.2 times larger than expanding velocity perpendicular to the vertical walls (?=90 degrees). This new approach fits a lot better with the data out of the experiments for the expanding velocities of the dome, but is not yet completely satisfying.","saturated sand; dredging; unloading process; discharge opening; water jets","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Bombois, X.J.A. (mentor)","2009","In the last decade great progress is made in the field of biped walking robots. Developing and studying biped robots is done for several reasons, such as understanding how humans walk, creating assistive robots to fulfill household tasks or for commercial reasons. At the Delft Biorobotics Laboratory (DBL) various biped robots are built and studied to get a better understanding of how humans walk. The goal of DBL is to develop a humanoid robot with low energy consumption, high versatility and the ability to deal with large disturbances during active dynamic walking. In 2007 research started on 3D stability in limit cycle walking, for this purpose a humanoid biped robot named Flame was built. At the start of the current study, the biped robot Flame was able to walk, the problem was that the biped was not able to start walking from a standstill. Flame has to be ""launched"" by hand to get in a stable walking cycle. With automatic stable gait initiation the biped robot Flame would be able to function more autonomously and thereby provide better test circumstances for different stability analyses. This is mainly due to constant initial conditions for every walking cycle. The goal of this study is to develop a gait initiation procedure where, after the gait initiation (at the first heelstrike), the biped robot is within the basin of attraction and will thus perform a stable walking motion. A performance measure is defined to analyze the performance of the gait initiation procedure in the biped robot Flame. This measure shows some variation in the different gait initiation trials, but Flame can reach a stable walking motion from a standstill by using a falling trajectory. Now the biped robot Flame is able to automatically start walking from a standstill.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Delft Center for Systems and Control","","","",""

(mentor)","2009","The demand for high data rates in wireless communication systems is increasing as well the demand for new (communication) services. Expanding of existing services or introducing new services needs a portion in the radio spectrum. Mean while the radio spectrum is a scarce resource and is regulated by governmental regulations and policies. Measurements done by the FCC show that the licensed spectrum is not always fully used and hence is not efficiently utilized. This need for spectrum resources and the unefficient use of it has lead to the birth of Cognitive Radio (CR). CR enables the efficient use of the radio spectrum and makes it possible for new services to operate adjacent to existing Licensed Users (LU) without suppressing their performance. There are several methodologies to realize CR, one of those methodologies is Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing OFDM. OFDM is one of those methods which is very suited to be used as a modulation and transmission technique in a CR system. OFDM is suited due to its multicarrier property and its robustness in the faded mobile wireless environments. In almost all wireless applications the arrival of the transmitted message in a good and acceptable quality is an agreement condition. Hence the Bit Error Rate (BER) is important and must be boosted. Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) has been known as a technique to enhance the transmission quality and capacity. Learning and understanding capabilities in CR are crucial to achieve the goals of efficient spectrum utilization in terms of spectrum resources and energy resources. The wireless channel is central within this context, thus estimating the channel is the key to make CR operational, taking in consideration that the transmission-reception technology is available. In this thesis, we design a MIMO system using OFDM modulation technology to transmit and receive two signals over the mobile wireless channel. We use MIMO concept to enhance system capacity and robustness of the wireless transmission. Due to the influence of the channel on the transmitted messages and its importance in wireless transmission to reconstruct the transmitted signals, the channel needs to be known as much as possible. We gather knowledge about this wireless channel and try to estimate it using training symbols called pilot symbols. We distribute the pilot symbols in a way were they can estimate the channel. The way those pilots are organized and implemented in the data stream is called the pilot pattern. We design three different pilot patterns suitable for implementation in MIMO. Within the pilot patterns, we implement the novel Virtual Pilot concept, to simplify the filtering process and to save energy, because the virtual pilots don’t consume power. We test all three patterns. Based on their performance in estimating the channel, we chose the best performing one and implement it in aMIMO OFDMbased CR system. The performance of each pattern is measured by means of BER and Mean Square Error (MSE). We assume that information about the LU is available from spectrum sensing for the transmitter. Due to the properties of the OFDM frame (2D), the estimation is done by using Wiener filtering first in frequency direction followed by filtering in time direction. To reduce computation complexity of the filtering process, we chose the cascaded Wiener filtering as 2x1D filtering instead of 2D filtering, because the first have a comparable performance compared with the last and have less computational complexity. Due to the MIMO structure, the received signal is the contributions from all transmit antennas. Those different contributions from the transmit antennas at the receiver need to be separated. To separate the different contributions form each other, we use the layering concept. Vertical Bell Laboratories Layered Space-Time (V-BLAST) is a detection algorithm to be used in each receiver to detect and separate the transmitted signals in the received stream from each other.","mimo; ofdm; pilot channel estimation; pilot pattern; spectrum sharing; cognitive radio","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","IRCTR","","Telecommunications","",""

Kort samengevat werkt een compressiewarmtepomp door een vloeistof (koelmiddel) bij lage temperatuur te laten verdampen en bij hoge temperatuur te laten condenseren. Om dit mogelijk te maken moet in het eerste geval de kookpunt temperatuur worden verlaagd tot onder de temperatuur van de warmtebron en in het tweede geval worden verhoogd tot boven de temperatuur aan de afgifte kant.

In the Netherlands a plan was launched to organize the Olympic Games (OG) in 2028. Transport, especially Public Transport (PT), plays a big role in successfully organizing OG. However, designing a transport system solely for a two week event, which is not certain to take place, makes not much sense. Therefore the aim of this thesis is to give a PT concept that is ready for the future of the Netherlands and can also accommodate the OG. The concept “MOVE” is consists of 5 building blocks. The strength of the concept “MOVE” is the connection between these blocks, the synergy created ensures a big leap in quality of the PT. The 5 building blocks are:  High frequent Public Transport High frequent transport for the train means a train every 10 minutes in the “broader Randstad”. To make sure the system has enough capacity and is robust, the network should almost entirely have four tracks. The frequencies of bus, tram and metro should also grow with the frequencies of the train.  Accessibility of the Public Transport System To increase accessibility for train stations at the border of cities and outside of the cities accessibility by car must be improved. In the city center a big gain in accessibility can be made by making feeder lines more accessible by bike.  Development of areas around train stations To make PT more effective different types of destinations must be created besides train lines, for example schools, offices and hospitals. Train stations must also become more comfortable place to be.  Dynamic prizing By dynamic prizing, with the help of the “OV-Chip card”, the use of PT can be spread over time and space. Also contracts should be made with companies to increase the use of PT among their employees and to make package deals of combining their products and PT tickets.  Reliability of Public Transport To increase the reliability of PT the network around stations and timetables they must be simplified to have fewer switches and decrease the dependency between train lines. Also cross-platform connections must be avoided in the new timetables. The strength of the concept “MOVE” is the connection between the building blocks. Combined, these blocks can lead to a possible growth in travelers by PT of 90 to 110%, which is around 25 to 55% more than the effect of the separate building blocks. The estimated cost of the concept “MOVE” is around 20 to 25% of the cost of the current network, but as said this will lead to almost a doubling in the number of travelers.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Transport & Planning","","","",""

Theoretically, 1,5MW can be won when mixing flows of 1m3/s of river water with sea water. Taking into account all losses that occur in the system, makes that the net power is approximately 1,0MW/m3/s. For a large-scale application of Blue energy large amounts of water are necessary. Salt water has to be brought into contact with fresh water, and the brackish water (mixture of the incoming fresh and salt water), has to be discharged away from the power plant. Next to this, the potential for Blue energy at a certain location largely depends on the occurring salinities at that specific location. A larger difference between fresh and salt results in a higher potential. In this study the main focus lies on the hydraulic aspects of Blue energy. The study showed that in the Dutch Delta five locations exist where Blue energy might be feasible. The Botlek area of the Port of Rotterdam, has been chosen to deepen out. For this location the fresh water availability has been determined with a statistical analysis. Aspects like the changing river regime due to climate changes and salt intrusion into the Delta area have been taken into account. A number of hydraulic simulations (Delft3D, Maasvlakte II Model) have been done in order to determine the maximum salt water flow, and the occurring salinities. The calculations showed that at the chosen location considerable flows can be generated, with salinities which are perfect for Blue energy. Hence, a considerable amount of electricity can be generated (hydraulically) with a Blue energy power plant in the Botlek area. For this power plant the main characteristics have been determined, and an economical analysis has been made.","blue energy; salinity gradient; osmotic pressure; Botlek; renewable energy","en","master thesis","TU Delft, Civil Engineering and Geosciences, Hydraulic Engineering","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","","","","",""

A detailed reservoir-geological model is an important step in assessing the spatial distribution of lithofacies- and fault-related heterogeneities in this sandstone, because these are of influence on the fluid flow properties of the sandstone. The Delft Sandstone Member consists of fluvial deposits in a syn-rift tectonic setting. The thickness, stacking, and lateral connectivity of the fluvial sandstones determine the overall reservoir communication.

The Delft Sandstone Member is approximately twice as thick in the Delft area compared to the Moerkapelle area, probably because of the location of the MKP 11 near the boundary of the basin, where the Del 03 is located near the middle of the graben where more subsidence has resulted in more accommodation space. Both packages show loosely stacked sandstone bodies in the bottom of the Member and thicker stacked sandstone bodies in the top. The vertical connectivity is best in the stacked sandstones in the top of the Member, the lateral connectivity is difficult to establish only on the basis of correlation of wide-spaced well logs.

Such urban systems1 make full usage of their structure and elements with continuous processes and flows. (Klaasen, 2004). The research on 24/7 environments was inspired by the difference in time bound spaces between the Netherlands and my home country, Singapore. Being used to easily finding services, retail and entertainment at all hours of the night, the shock of being in a country that in certain parts cease to operate on weekends prompted this explorative study into understanding what conditions are required to allow for a 24/7 environment which contributes to the urban vitality of the space, especially spatial pattern and conditions, and what are the effects of 24/7 environment in general. Explorative Study: Spatial planning of today, seldom take into concerns regarding the usage of space in a temporal fashion (Klaasen 2005, Drewe 2005). Planning and design are extended within visions and expected goals in terms of years, however, neglect the importance of planning the details of a finer temporal grain2 is to the vitality and success of an urban area. Given the state of current urban settlements to proceed into sprawl and fragmentation, it seems highly illogical to continue using whatever precious space we have left only within a pre-conditioned notion of time. Not to mention that given the limitations of the simplified models of reality that urbanists have been conditioned to work with, the element of time has barely been taken into account, voluntarily or involuntarily. This research is an explorative study into the why and how conditions that makes a 24/7 environment, in describing and propagating the environment. Bearing in mind that it is not humanly possible to function continuously as our biorhythm will never allow it, nor is it socially responsible. This explorative study of 24/7 environments within urban systems looks to spaces that have multiple time, spatial and functional characteristics. The purpose is to understand how these places can be multi-faceted and vital to the urban system. This is not about creating a 24/7 city non-stop activities This is about exploring the conditions of the urban phenomenon of a 24/7 environment","urban vitalityt; 24/7; environments; spatial condition","en","master thesis","TU Delft, Architecture, Urbanism","","","","","","","","Architecture","","","","",""

(mentor)","2009","Fractional-flow theory provides key insights into complex foam IOR displacements and acts as a benchmark for foam simulators. In some cases with mobile oil present the process can be represented as a two-phase displacement. We examine two such cases. A first-contact miscible gas flood with foam injection includes a chemical shock defining the surfactant front and a miscible shock defining the gas front. The optimal water fraction for the foam (i.e., the water fraction that gives the fastest oil recovery) maintains the gas front slightly ahead of the foam (surfactant) front. A first-contact miscible foam process with surfactant dissolved in the (supercritical) CO2 is influenced by surfactant adsorption on rock and also on partitioning of the surfactant between water and CO2. A foam with surfactant that is more soluble in the water would propagate slowly, regardless of the surfactants absolute solubility or the level of adsorption on rock. This study forms part of a larger study combining fractional-flow modeling of these processes with computer simulation. The simulations verify the results obtained with fractional-flow methods and illustrate the challenges of accurate simulation of these processes. For both cases (i.e., first-contact miscible gas flood with foam injection, and first-contact miscible foam process with surfactant dissolved in the gas phase), simulations show that, in the limit of small grid blocks, the solution converges towards the fractional-flow solution. Fractional-flow theory not only predicts the displacement in the absence of dispersion, but helps explain the effects of dispersion on the displacement. Numerical dispersion introduced by the simulator is shown to have significant effects on the outcome of the simulations. At the urfactant front, numerical dispersion can drastically change the nature of the foam front, depending on the foam model used (specifically, the effect of surfactant concentration on foam strength). A foam model where foam is abruptly created at 50% of the injected surfactant concentration mitigates the effects of this dispersion, but the velocity of the foam bank is still altered. Investigation on the influence of adsorption shows that Langmuir-type adsorption models tend to sharpen up the (dispersed) surfactant front and are the least sensitive to dispersion. At the miscible front, dispersion affects mobilities in the oil and gas phase; again, fractional-flow theory helps explain the implications for the displacement. In multiple-contact (developed) miscible displacements, simulations, with dispersion present, show a region of three-phase flow ahead of the miscible front.","miscible co2-foam simulations","en","master thesis","TU Delft, Civil Engineering and Geosciences, Geotechnology","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","","","","",""

(mentor); Langereis, G. (mentor)","2009","There is a large demand for an online sensor to monitor the quality of lubricating oils. By constant monitoring the engine oil quality, a better understanding of oil condition can be found. The information on oil condition will lead to a much more accurate determination of proper oil change time, while it also provides increased insight into the actual state of the engine, and ultimately it will lead to more sustainable utilization of oils. A MEMS implementation of such a sensor is highly desirable due to its integration capability. Additionally reduced mass and size allow placing the MEMS device in places where a traditional system would not be able to fit. Microacoustic devices have been successfully used for various sensing applications where the sensitivity of the oscillating surface with respect to mass loading is utilized. These devices can be used for sensing liquid property for many applications. In this thesis work we aim at answering the following questions: · Which Microacoustic based sensor is able to resolve density and viscosity of a liquid? · Which Microacoustic based sensor has miniaturization capability? We choose shear mode resonators as the most suitable devices. Shear mode resonators can be used to measure the density and viscosity of contacting fluids separately. These devices are ideal for many sensing applications: they are small and inexpensive, very robust (can operate in high temperature, high vibration, and highly corrosive environments), have no macroscopic moving parts, have a good miniaturization capability, and can be configured to function as in situ fluid monitors. In contrast to other sensors, our solution allows to resolve the density and viscosity with help of one single corrugated device (in contrast to smooth surface devices). Shifts in resonance frequency and damping in an extremely rough resonator are related to the square root of the density-viscosity product and also to an offset term proportional to density. Experiments designed in order to support the analytical model have been carried out. The results obtained indicate that this is indeed an effective method for separate determination of liquid density and viscosity with shear wave mode resonators.","MEMS; oil; quality; density; viscosity","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics","","","",""

These methods vary from keyword spotting techniques, lexical affinity, statistical natural language processing and hand-crafted models. Based on a large scale survey, two profounding theories have been selected for investigation. The first is the proposed work of (Kamps & Marx, 2001) which states that the lexical relations found in WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) can be used to measure the activation and evaluation of words. This theory has been investigated, by implementing various search algorithms, including a multi-threaded bidirectional search algorithm, which enables us to compare the results with manually annotated word sets. Improvements to this theory have been made so that for more words the activation and evaluation values can be calculated, without compromising the results. Secondly the theory of (Liu, Lieberman, & Selker, 2003) has been investigated. This theory is based on a novel technique, by inferencing commonsense knowledge to reason about the emotional content of a given text. No full implementation has been made, but a basis has been created for future implementation. Finally, we have implemented a natural language resource toolbox for affective NLP research, called the NLP Affect Toolbox. This toolbox can be used as a programming library to support and fastly implement future research. It can also be used to conduct experiments and to explore the possibilities of state-of-art (affective) natural language processing by experienced programmers, and through a graphical user interface for others.","artificial intelligence; natural language processing; affect sensing; lexical affinity; WordNet; ConceptNet; Dictionary of Affect in Language; syntactic parsing; semantic parsing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2009-05-09","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Man-Machine Interaction Group","","","",""

The area is home to different artists and craftsmen who work in collaboration and inspire each other. By doing so new initiatives emerge. Subculture dominates the space and its character is a mixture of industrial remains and the ‘just-happening’ of objects and events. The building assimilates into this context by showing respect for its big dimensions and by relating to the liberal and industrial atmosphere by means of a straightforward organization, a furnishing determined by ‘production’ and a just let things happen attitude. Interior: separate institute and representation towards public & distinguish between working space and social space The CPA has a strong internal component as well as a strong external one. It is important to clearly separate between the two of them. Important to the users of the institute: they have their own space in which they are not hampered in their thoughts and doings. To the visitor this separation is also important: it shows where they are and are not allowed to be. The building supports the perception of accessibility. Both user and visitor do not want to feel disturbed; the user during his work, the visitor by his presence. Working as an artist consists of two moments. One is when you are working on your project turning ideas into a performance. The other one is when you are discussing with fellow artists. The former is mainly concentrated and introverted while the latter is very social and reflective. The distinction between these moments results in social spaces and working spaces. Building: five components translate ideas into the building Open public floor: continuation of the outside space into the public parts of the building. Concrete plates cover the transportation zones while smooth concrete surfaces point out the zones for occupation. Floating Volumes: The engine rooms of the building. They contain the working spaces in which ideas are transformed into performances. The volumes define the in-between-space and its variations allow for different kind of use. On the outside all volumes have the same rough metal-plate cladding. Their interiors are made of wood-panels on wooden structures and allow for flexible spaces. The furnishings of the rooms obey to its specific program and contain the bare necessities. Pantries and lounges are located in the in between space. Structure and cores: carriers of the institute. They literally keep the volumes suspended in the building. The visually present structure also circumscribes the institute and therefore demarcates and dramatizes the separation between the centre’s internal and external component. When you are in-between the structure, you know you are at the institute. Service space: occupies the in-between space. Wide corridors from core to core service the transportation of people, goods, heat/cold, air, electricity and data. Here the people of the institute meet. They are the catalyst of the institute and contain sheltered spaces for informal meeting as well as open spaces to relax and enjoy the view through the building. Enclosure: unites the institute and public areas into one Performing Arts Factory. The glazed shed makes the institute as well as the continuous public space noticed. A saw-tooth roof allows for sun shading: south facing parts of the roof and façade contain a pattern of photovoltaic cells which in the act of filtering sunlight also produce energy. Theatrevolume The theatre has to house performances of different disciplines. Also future projects, which originate from the collaboration between disciplines, should be able to perform in the theatre. What these performances could look like is yet unknown. The theatre is understood as a free-floor theatre. Different arrangements of seating can be composed. Adjustable panels are installed in the walls and provide for different acoustical conditions. Footbridges, towing systems and fixation points underneath the whole ceiling ensure maximum freedom for equipment.","Centre for Performing Arts; performing arts; Amsterdam; NDSM; working space; social space; public space","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture","Interiors, Buildings and Cities","","","",""

(mentor); van Oudheusden, B.W. (mentor)","2009","The development of micro aerial vehicles is motivated by the need for autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles to observe barely accessible areas. Insect flight has been a source of inspiration during the development of DelFly, a flapping wing MAV at Delft University of Technology. In order to further decrease the overall size of DelFly, preserving the excellent flight performance, a thorough understanding of the aerodynamics is necessary. Compared to steady airfoils, flapping wings are able to generate high lift coefficients due to unsteady aerodynamics. It is expected that the occurrence of a leading edge vortex at wing rotation plays an important role in unsteady lift generation. Due to the biplane wing configuration of DelFly a wing-wing interaction, called the clap and peel mechanism, is caused. This mechanism is assumed to further enhance the lift generation by expelling air downwards, omitting the need for a start and stop vortex to be shed and strengthening the leading edge vortex. The influence of wing flexibility and the resulting wing deformation during isolated rotation, called the flex motion, supposedly postpone the shedding of the stopping vortex and strengthen the leading edge vortex. The motivation of the current investigation is to visualize the flow field around a flapping wing MAV with proven flight performance. Complex wing kinematics, highly threedimensional flow and fluid-structure interaction are thus included without simplifications. Particle image velocimetry measurements and simultaneous force measurements are performed on the DelFly II flapping-wing MAV, to investigate the flow-field behaviour and the aerodynamic forces generated. The high flexibility causes the wings to peel and flex during the rotation at the minimal and maximal amplitude respectively. This passive wing deformation largely influences the flow field behaviour. The wings start peeling apart before the clap has been completed. During the peel, the PIV analysis shows a strong influx between the wings and a conical vortex structure above the leading edges. This peel mechanism contributes significantly to the lift, as revealed by the force measurements. During the clap, the presence of a mirror wing causes the air to be expelled downwards and to roll up into vortices of the same direction as the bound vorticity of the subsequent stroke. The jet generated by the clap is stronger on the inner half of the wings, but exceptionally weak on the outer half. This is attributed to the high flexibility of the wing foil. The strong and chaotic starting vortex shed at the beginning of the outstroke, is responsible for a strong decline in lift force during the subsequent translational phase. The clap mechanism does rather attenuate than enhance lift. The occurrence of a leading edge vortex during the flex can not be assessed from the PIV images due to optical obstruction, but is likely to appear since the wing flexing is accompanied with a large increase in lift. An additional augmentation in lift could also be attained by the delayed shedding of a combined starting and stopping vortex. Although this flap phase is accompanied by an increased lift, it does not contribute to the total lift as much as the peel mechanism. The PIV visualization first suggests the occurrence of a leading edge vortex at the onset of the subsequent translational stroke. Especially during the flex the high deflection of the wings achieved at a higher flapping frequency is favourable. The force plot shows a relatively higher and broader peak in lift force. The aerodynamic mechanism underlying this phenomenon could not be identified.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","","","","",""

The model is non-hydrostatic; the velocities are corrected with a pressure gradient following from the requirement of a divergence free flow field per computational cell. The model is a two-layer model; only layered systems with two layers of different but constant density are considered and the mixing is left out of consideration. The divide between the between upper and lower layer is considered a sharp interface. The density is discontinuous at the interface and the fluids are completely separated by the interface. To guarantee an exact representation of the interface, a boundary following grid is used in the vertical. In several test cases the model has been validated. In a closed basin test the dispersion relation is shown to follow the linear dispersion relation for internal and external waves almost exactly when two layers are used. The model is also tested against analytical models with regard to dissipation of the waves by a viscous lower layer (mud) and showed comparable results. The model however performed less well for highly advective processes with large gradients such as the sex-change test. Considering differences in flow velocity between the layers, the stability of the model was substantially lower than according to linear theory. The limit for this new model has been found to depend on the thickness of one layer only in stead of the total depth. Finally the model was used to reproduce results of laboratory experiments found in literature. The steepening of internal waves and generation of solitons was reasonable well represented. The result of this study is a non-hydrostatic 2DV two-layer model, which has the same attractive properties as the model by Stelling and Zijlema regarding wave dispersion of both internal and ex-ternal waves.","non-hydrostatic two-layer internal wave numerical model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Fluid mechanics","","","",""

Door de overmatige ontwikkeling van nieuwe kantoren is de afgelopen jaren grote structurele leegstand ontstaan. De structurele leegstand concentreert zich vooral in verouderde kantoorgebouwen op ongunstige locaties. Monofunctionele kantorenterreinen uit de jaren '70-'80 vallen door hun opzet onder de ongunstige locaties en kantoren uit deze periode zijn sterk verouderd. Door de enorme leegstand komen deze locaties in een neerwaartse spiraal terecht. Een van de kantorengebieden waar deze ontwikkeling gaande is, is het kantorengebied Amstel III in Amsterdam Zuidoost. Om de neerwaartse spiraal van een kantorenterrein te doorbreken, moet het gebied een multifunctioneler karakter krijgen. Menging van functies zorgt namelijk voor een verhoging van de aantrekkelijkheid, diversiteit en levendigheid van de locatie. Bovendien wordt de kantorenmarkt evenwichtiger als er door middel van functieverandering kantoren aan de markt onttrokken worden. Om nieuwe functies in een gebied te kunnen introduceren, moet er voldoende draagvlak zijn. Gezien de monofunctionaliteit van kantorenterreinen is er alleen voldoende draagvlak te creeren als de functieverandering niet gebouw-, maar gebiedsgericht wordt aangepakt. Door de private ontwikkeling van kantorenterreinen zijn de eigendomsverhoudingen sterk verdeeld. Dit maakt het herontwikkelen van een kritische massa zeer complex, omdat partijen alleen gezamenlijk de gebiedsgerichte herontwikkeling kunnen realiseren. Bovendien zijn de risico's en investeringen die bij de herontwikkeling van meerdere kantoren horen enorm. Voor een geslaagde samenwerking moeten alle betrokken partijen op lijn komen wat betreft visie en aanpak van het project. Omdat de verschillende partijen op dit moment ieder hun eigen belangen en ideehebben, ligt het grootste knelpunt bij de herontwikkeling van kantorenterreinen in het op lijn krijgen van alle partijen en het op gang brengen van het proces. Om de herontwikkeling van kantorenterreinen te bevorderen is een methode ontwikkeld waarmee de stappen, die genomen moeten worden om tot een gezamenlijk plan te komen, worden gestructureerd. Bij iedere stap wordt aangegeven aan welke voorwaarden moet zijn voldaan om door te kunnen naar de volgende stap. Op deze manier kan inzichtelijk gemaakt worden waar het proces precies vastloopt. Het stappenplan bestaat totaal uit vijf stappen die allen met succes doorlopen moeten worden om tot een gezamenlijke haalbare business te komen. 1. 'Sense of Urgency'. 2. Onderzoek. 3. Coalitie. 4. Haalbaar scenario. 5. Haalbare business case. Amstel III in Amsterdam Zuidoost is een kantorengebied dat door de problemen op de kantorenmarkt in een neerwaartse spiraal terecht is gekomen. De herontwikkeling van een kritische massa zou de neerwaartse spiraal van Amstel III kunnen doorbreken. In verband met de specifieke kenmerken van kantorenterreinen die het proces om tot herontwikkeling te komen, belemmeren, is als kritische massa voor het 'Hogehilweggebied' gekozen. Uit de toepassing van het stappenplan blijkt dat de problemen in het 'Hogehilweggebied' zich momenteel nog onvoldoende manifesteren om algemene 'sense of urgency' voor de herontwikkeling op te wekken. Beleggers ondervinden weinig hinder van de leegstand en zijn daarom niet bereid om grootschalig in te grijpen. Dat herontwikkeling van het 'Hogehilweggebied' op dit moment niet mogelijk is, wil niet zeggen dat de ingreep nooit gerealiseerd kan worden. Vooral de verdere ontwikkeling van problemen in het gebied en de herontwikkeling van het Atlas complex zullen nieuwe aanknopingspunten kunnen bieden om de plannen in de toekomst alsnog te realiseren. Het advies is daarom om te wachten tot de neerwaartse spiraal verder doorzet en de problemen in het 'Hogehilweggebied' toenemen. In de tussentijd moet worden gefocust op de herontwikkeling van het Atlas complex, want dit is de enige mogelijkheid om voldoende aanknopingspunten voor de herontwikkeling van het 'Hogehilweggebied' te verkrijgen. Daarnaast zullen mogelijke samenwerkingspartners eigendommen in het gebied moeten verwerven om vervolgens een coalitie voor de realisatie van de herontwikkeling te kunnen vormen.","kantorenterrein; gebiedsontwikkeling; procesaanpak; stappenplan","nl","master thesis","TU Delft, Architecture, Real Estate & Housing","","","","","","","","Architecture","","","","",""

(mentor); Van den Bos, J.P. (mentor); Dastgheib, A. (mentor); Roelvink, J.A. (mentor)","2009","The reshaping of temporary rubble mounds like the core of breakwaters or reclamation bunds is often a concern for contractorsi n the construction stages of marine structures. The formulas found in literature for the prediction of such behavior are few, and they do not provide clear insight on the influence of relevant parameters, in particular the small dimensions and wide stone-size gradation of the material involved, usually consisting of quarry run or resulting from dredging. The previous research in the field of dynamic stability focused on berm breakwaters and gravel beaches. These two typologies of structures define the range to which the rubble mounds considered in this study generally belong. An overview on the design tools provided by the technical literature shows that, whenever the grading was included as a governing parameter, some influence was recognized in the characteristics of the structure (e.g. the permeability) and in the dynamism of the different fractions of stone sizes. However, very wide ranges of the parameter grading were never investigated and a specific analysis in this direction constitutes the main significance of this study. The Delft University of Technology provided the laboratory facilities to carry out physical model tests on a wide graded rubble mound structure representative of the core of a breakwater. The parameter D85/D15, describing the stone-size gradation of the construction material, was varied between the values 2.71 and 17.7, and two different seaward slopes of the model structure were also tested. The reshaped cross-shore profiles measured during the tests showed how if the grading increases the stability of the structure is reduced. This is not always in accordance with the findings of previous researchers, showing how the extrapolation of existing empirical formulas to structures with high values of the ratio D85/D15 do not give reliable results. Instead, the formulas given by van de Meer (1992) to estimate the whole reshaped profile of a dynamic slope predict with good agreement the shape of the measured profiles, although the physical model shows a larger horizontal extension of the displacements. This difference is governed by the grading, being more noticeable as this parameter increases. This result leads to the definition of new formulas, some of them being modifications of the ones given by van der Meer, to describe the geometry of a reshaped profile. The formulas, all including the parameter grading, are derived through curve fitting of the measured data. Also a formula for the direct estimation of the crest recession is given. As a final step, a simple numerical model is proposed in which the new formulas are implemented, constituting a quick way to assess the shape of a slope after a wave attack. As a suggestion for further utilization of the results of physical modeling, a brief comparison is also carried out between the output of the tests and the prediction of the numerical model XBeach (developed mainly at UNESCO-IHE). In conclusion, this research points out how the formulas provided by the technical literature are not reliable in representing the effects of a very wide stone-size gradation in the stability of a rubble mound structure. Physical model tests proved to be a suited way to investigate these effects, as the nature of the phenomena who play a role in the stability does not allow a simple analytical representation. The tests carried out within the present study lead to the implementation of a numerical model of practical use for engineers and contractors: further investigations through laboratory tests are recommended to validate and extend the findings of this study. Another proposed direction for further research is the comparison between the results of physical model tests and the output of numerical models.","breakwaters; rubble mound; grading; permeabililty; dynamic stability","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""
