(mentor); Van Oudheusden, B.W. (mentor)","2005","The present work investigates the flow around a two-dimensional square section object at varying angles of incidence. The experimental approach employs Particle Image Velocimetry for the determination of the time-averaged velocity field and the unsteady large scale coherent variations (e.g. vortex shedding) as well as turbulent fluctuations. The angle of incidence is varied from 0° to 45° covering the entire range of possible wind directions. The investigation constitutes a further step within the ongoing research for the assessment of the quasi-steady theory for the low-frequency oscillation (galloping) phenomenon of bluff bodies. A specific aspect of the set-up is the use of a transparent hollow model, which allows light transmission and minimizes internal total reflection. Above 10° incidence the flow may reattach on the lower surface and produce a separation bubble. Time-mean averaged velocity fields reveal that the near-wake length increases monotonically, peaking at 10°. Beyond, the distance from the vorticity centres to the nearest corner of the model drops significantly, caused by the shift of the separation point location. The vortex shedding is influenced hereby to a large extent. The flow organisation is further analysed with Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) to investigate the unsteady flow structures associated with vortex shedding. The POD modes are used to reconstruct a low-order flow model that provides a phase reconstruction of the vortex shedding sequence for all angles of incidence. In addition to the velocity field characterisation, a method to determine the mean (timeaveraged) lift and drag coefficient of the model from PIV velocity data is proposed. The Reynolds-averaged momentum equations are employed to calculate the pressure gradient field, yielding subsequently the pressure field by means of a two-dimensional integration technique. The estimated pressure field is introduced in an integral momentum balance, which is solved on a contour around the model. The method has been successfully applied to the experimental data of the flow around a square cylinder. The force data show satisfactory agreement with reference data published in literature.","Particle Image Velocimetry; PIV; Loads; Bluff body","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Aerodynamics","","","",""

(mentor); Van Zuylen, H.J. (mentor); Bliemer, M. (mentor); Taale, H. (mentor); Wiggenraad, P.B.L. (mentor)","2005","Reliability is becoming a more and more important performance characteristic of road networks and transport services. Travel time reliability was found to be one of the most important factors for route choices of travelers. Drivers often complain that it is the unpredictability of travel time that they dislike most of a journey in a congested city or area. Network design and some traffic control measure or ITS, such as Advanced Traveler Information System (ATIS) and Incident Management (IM) have been proposed to improve road network reliability. Road pricing has been advocated as a potentially powertlil travel demand management (TDM) strategy capable of significantly influencing travel demand characteristics through the network. Generally, the policy objecfives of road pricing could be summarized as follows: managing demand, optimizing congestion level, reducing environmental impacts, maximizing social welfare gains, raising revenues to recoup maintenance cost and construction cost, etc. To our best knowledge, no researchers have advocated improving network travel time reliability as an objective of road pricing. Some researchers suggested evaluating road pricing from a network reliability view. These suggestions give some incentives that road pricing could make contributions to network reliability. This study investigates road pricing as an instrument to improve network travel time reliability, which is induced by link capacity variations and short-term origin-destination demand fluctuations. The network reliability is specified as a function of standard deviations of route travel times. It is assumed in this study that the road authority aims to optimize network reliability by setting tolls in a network design problem. Travelers are influenced by these tolls and make route and trip decisions by considering travel times and tolls (not taking the trip reliability into account). Theoretical analyses using static models with elastic demand are performed to analyze the influence of road pricing on road network reliability. In the theoretical analyses, capacity variation is assumed as the major influencing factor on the network travel time unreliability. An important assumption is made in the theoretical analyses, being that travelers make their route choices based on the average travel cost. Travel time and link capacity are stochastic variables, while route flow is deterministic for each charge level. The theoretical analyses start with the analysis on a single route network. Then a tworoute network with one link charged is analyzed using deterministic user-equilibrium (DUE) and stochastic assignment. Finally theoretical analyses on a general network are performed and a formula to calculate route travel time unreliability is derived based on oiu- assumptions mentioned previously. This formula is utilized in an application on a hypothetical five-link three-route network to investigate the impacts of road pricing on network reliability. The theoretical analyses show that road pricing may improve network reliability and that network reliability depends heavily on charge levels. Theoretical analysis shows that decreased OD demand and route flow switches, caused by implementing tolls, influence network reliability. Depending on the combination of the effects of decreased OD demand and route shifts, network reliability in case of elastic demand can either be improved when the effect of OD demand decreases is stronger than the effects of route shifts, or becomes worse when the influence of the route shifts is stronger than the influence of decreased OD demand. Whereas the theoretical analyses are performed using static models and some assumptions had to be made, a dynamic simulation-based method using the dynamic model INDY for the five-link network is utilized to investigate the influence of road pricing on network reliability more appropriately. Using the dynamic simulation-based approach, capacity variations and short-term origin-destination demand fluctuations are considered as the most important factors affecting travel time variability. Fixed OD demand and elastic OD demand are taken into account respectively. Four cases are analyzed in the simulation-based analyses; the fixed demand case with capacity variations, the fixed demand case with demand fluctuations, the elastic demand case with capacity variations and the elastic demand case with demand fluctuations. With fixed demand, route shift is the major causal factor of the variability of network travel time reliability with respect to charge levels. The results from the simulafion-based method show that in the fixed demand cases with the increase of the charge levels, route flow switches become less and less. Network reliability can be improved with tolls. With elastic demand, both decreased OD demand and route shifts play an important role in network reliability. Decreased OD demand leads to positive effects on network reliability. Frequent route shifts is the essential cause of network travel time unreliability for the networks with tolling systems, and network reliability will be improved i f there are less route flow switches. Combining the effects of decreased OD demand and route shifts, network reliability may either be improved or becomes worse, depending on the charge levels. The optimal charge from road authority's view can be determined, aiming to optimize network reliability. With the optimal charge, people take longer but more reliable routes. It turns out that there is a trade-off between the average route travel time and the route travel time reliability. In a normal situation (without tolls), both capacity variations and demand fluctuations have great influence on travel time variability, since these two factors lead to stochastic route flow shifts. Demand fluctuations have greater influence on travel time variability than capacity variation does. Because demand fluctuations have direct influence on route flows, which leads to direct travel time variability. The objective of optimizing network travel time reliability proposed in this study can contribute to the charging system design, which is a bi-Ievel optimization problem. Road authority, as the leader, tries to optimize network reliability by setting tolls. Travelers, as the followers, try to minimize their own travel cost, which is the sum of travel time and tolls. The objective function can be used to optimize charge levels or search optimal links for charging for fixed charging systems and for variable charging systems. Only a small hypothetical network with a single OD pair has been analyzed in this study. For this small network, we conclude that road pricing can improve network travel time reliability. For more general networks, the objective of optimizing network reliability can be employed to determine the optimal charge level and to optimize the charging system design.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Transport & Planning","","","",""

(mentor)","2005","The use of smart well technology to optimize water flooding introduces a large number of control parameters both in space (well segments) and time. The problem of finding the optimal control parameters to maximize net present value as an objective function can be solved with the aid of a gradient-based optimization method. Using too many parameters may lead to a large number of local maxima in the objective function, so the gradient-based optimization method may result in suboptimal solutions. In this thesis, proper orthogonal decomposition is applied to regularize gradient-based control parameter optimization by projecting the original high dimensional control space onto a low dimensional subspace and thus reduce the number of control parameters. Since in a low dimensional subspace there are fewer local maxima, the solution is more likely to reach a local maximum that is in the close vicinity of the global solution. To evaluate the efficiency of our proposed method, ordinary multiscale parameterization as developed by Lien et al. (2005) is also applied to the optimization of the control parameters. A multiscale approach starts from optimization of a very coarse representative parameter. Then the number of parameters is gradually increased until convergence is reached. Numerical examples indicate that a regularization approach with the aid of proper orthogonal decomposition may speed up the convergence rate, and also may increase the convergence to the global solution within shorter optimization time compared to optimization without regularization technique. The method effectively reduces the control effort by grouping multiple well settings in space and time and treating them as one control parameter.","smart well; simulation; optimization; regularization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Department of Geotechnology","","Section for Petroleum Engineering","",""

(mentor)","2005","HTM is a major role player in the public transportation sector of the Netherlands with its tram and bus services. The company is continually working to improve their infrastructure management policies by considering aspects such as vehicle priorities, driver allocation and vehicle schedules. One obstacle in the way of HTM’s continual improvement is that they have no scientific and systematic method of evaluating possible alternatives that might be considered due to infrastructure changes or schedule modifications. Currently, possible changes are evaluated by heavily relying on expertise and historical data. While the use of expertise and historical data in itself is not undesirable, and in fact quite valuable, using these alone mean that HTM does not have a quick, consistent and cost-effective way of assessing possible changes to their tram network. This means that proposed alternatives for new schedules cannot be validated or tested before it is implemented. The high implementation costs and the low frequency of schedule changes give ample incentive for an effective evaluation method. This project addressed this need for an evaluation method by developing a simulation framework suitable for modelling tram infrastructure and the accompanying schedules. This simulation framework consists of existing and newly created building blocks that are loosely coupled to the input specification of the infrastructure and schedules. The purposeful separation of the data and the functional processes of the building blocks allow decision-makers at HTM to easily build new models that represent proposed alternatives to the tram network and organisation. The developed simulation framework was tested by building a model of a single HTM tramline. This model was used to validate the simulation framework and to evaluate the tram schedules according to a number of performance indicators.","simulation; HTM; public transportation; scheduling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2013-08-02","Technology, Policy and Management","Systems Engineering","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","",""

Bij de bouw van de Tweede Beneluxtunnel is afgeweken van de traditionele methode met onderstroomzand. Bij dit project is een deel van de betonnen tunnelelementen, afgezonken op een grindbed. Een grindbed wordt geplaatst voordat een tunnelelement wordt afgezonken, dit vraagt om een nauwkeurige uitvoering. Omdat het een nieuwe bouwmethode betreft zijn er nog geen richtlijnen ten aanzien van grindbedden. Vanuit dit perspectief is er een behoefte aan meer kennis ten aanzien van het funderen van afgezonken tunnelelementen op grind. Met dit afstudeeronderzoek is getracht om antwoorden te vinden op de volgende vragen: - Is een grindbedfundering een ""goede fundering"" voor een afgezonken betonnen tunnelconstructie? - Welke vlakheidseisen moet je aan de fundering stellen om de capaciteit van de betonconstructie niet te overschrijden? - Is voor een afgezonken tunnel een grindbedfundering een betere methode dan het traditionele onderstromen met zand? Om het effect van een onnauwkeurigheid in een grindfundering te onderzoek zijn onnauwkeurigheden in de grindfundering vertaald naar stijfheidsverschillen binnen de fundering. De analyse van het interactiesysteem tussen fundering en tunnelelement is uitgevoerd voor vier funderingsvarianten. In EsaPrimaWin is een 3D-model van een tunnelmoot gemaakt. De fundering is in dit model geschematiseerd als een elastische bedding. Door de stijfheid van de beddingsconstante te varin is onderzocht wat de effecten zijn van een lokaal stijvere bedding. En dus wat het effect is van een onnauwkeurige grindfundering op de krachtswerking in een betonnen tunnelelement. Op basis van het resultaten van het onderzoek kan worden geconcludeerd dat een grindbed een goede fundering is voor afgezonken tunnels. In het uitgevoerde onderzoek zijn er te veel onzekere parameters om een eenduidige vlakheidseis af te leiden. De resultaten tonen wel aan dat stijfheidsverschillen nauwelijks effect hebben op de krachtswerking. Op basis van het onderzoek is geen duidelijke voorkeur uit te spreken voor een grind- of zandfundering. De technische randvoorwaarden leiden niet tot een keuze. In dat geval zijn de kosten doorslaggevend. In het kader van dit afstudeeronderzoek is geen kostenvergelijking tussen een grindbed- en onderstroomfundering uitgevoerd, maar kan het onderwerp zijn voor een vervolgonderzoek.","","nl","master thesis","TU Delft, Faculty of Civil Engineering and Geosciences, Hydraulic Engineering","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","","","","",""

(mentor)","2005","The bed and bank of a river, enclosing structures and other works where water is involved are exposed to waves, currents and water level changes. Bed and bank protection works are necessary to prevent eroding of the bed, bank or structure. Bed and bank protection works, on fascine mattresses, geotextile or on a granular filter, are important hydraulic engineering works. They are constructed out of thin layers of granular material. For the construction of these protection works stone-dumping vessels are often used. Granular material dumped by a side stone-dumping vessel will hit the bottom at a certain place and cover it with a thin layer. Repeated thin layers of dumped material will eventually form the bed or bank protection work of a certain thickness. The protection works are constructed in sections, which should all be of equal thickness to ensure a regular protection layer. Therefore it is important to know where stones, if dumped overboard, will hit the bottom and what happens when they hit the bottom. A theoretical model has been developed for the distribution of stones dumped in stationary water, based on a flat bottom. This theoretical model has already been validated by experiments done on a flat bottom. Bed and bank protection works, however, are often constructed on a slope. It is unknown whether the theoretical model is valid in this situation. In this model based on a flat bottom, the Single Stone Model, the stones are dumped at one spot. This theory can be rewritten to the Line Distribution model in which stones are dumped into the water over a certain length, like in the case of a side stone-dumping vessel. Like the Single Stone Model, this theory is based on dumping stones on a flat bottom. Experiments researching this theory have been performed (figure 1). In this thesis, results of experiments investigating the influence of slopes on the distribution of the stones dumped by a side stone-dumping vessel are reported and the validity of the Line Distribution Model on a slope is verified. In the experiments three different slope angles were used to investigate the influence of them. The distribution of stones dumped on a slope of 1:4 can be described by the Line Dumping Model without slope correction, for all water depths and stone diameters as used in the experiments. Apparently this slope angle is too small to influence the dumping process.","","en","master thesis","TU Delft, Faculty of Civil Engineering and Geosciences, Hydraulic Engineering","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","","","","",""
