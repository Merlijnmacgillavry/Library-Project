With almost 2.5 quintillion bytes of data being generated and captured every day (Liang et al., 2018), researchers and companies have a strong interest in exploring the value that can be created with this data, called big data analysis. Also, since companies strive to be market leaders, they constantly evaluate methods/approaches to discover hidden trends/ potential opportunities. One method of finding hidden trends is through market segmentation, a process which can be defined as a division of a heterogeneous market into several smaller homogeneous markets to precisely understand the desires of consumers. Identifying and targeting the right consumers through market segmentation is highly dependent on the collected data. Due to the usage of obsolete data collection methods and privacy regulations, most often, companies only possess siloed data. If siloed data is used, then companies might not be effective with their segmentation strategies.<br/>One way to ensure that data is complete and consistent might be through data sharing in a ‘data market’ between players to holistically understand the consumers. With this thought in mind, this thesis considers the telecom industry as an example and explores the effectiveness of market segmentation using shared data. The main research question of this thesis study is Before going deeply into the aim of the thesis, let’s first understand the current problems of the telecom industry. Traditionally, telecom firms have generated revenue via three streams i.e. voice, messaging and data. However, over the past decade, the market has witnessed an emergence of Over the top content players such as Netflix, YouTube, and Amazon Prime. These players do not need any association with the telecom firms to provide their services and thereby have impacted traditional telecom companies’ voice and messaging revenue streams. In addition to this with new content frequently being updated in these OTT services, customer preferences are constantly changing, and telecom firms are finding it hard to predict these varying needs with the siloed data present in their databases. This has therefore resulted in low average revenue per user (ARPU) levels for these telecom firms. As the first step in the thesis, we performed a literature review and identified four common segmentation techniques used by the telecom industry. The four techniques are customer value segmentation, customer behavior segmentation, customer lifecycle segmentation, and customer migration segmentation. These techniques are customer-centric and are heavily reliant on data for their effectiveness. To observe if these identified techniques are employed at the industry level and to contemplate the viewpoints of experts on data sharing in market segmentation, we interviewed market segmentation experts from the industry. The following subsections provide an overview of the interviews, questions asked in the interview and findings from the interviews.","Data sharing; Telecommunication; Market Segmentation; Data Marketplaces; Big data Ethics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","Safe-DEED",""

One of these problems is the increased effect of the cold start problem. This problem entails that we do not understand what new users are interested in because we have very little information about them. The increased effect of the problem is due to the low number of bookings that are made compared to e-commerce purchases.

These members are referred to as columns and are frequently present in for example lifting appliances and offshore structures. Whether or not a column consists of longitudinally welded subsections is relevant for its mechanical performance in compression. Steel columns consisting of longitudinally welded members contain residual stresses caused by the non uniform longitudinal expansion and shrinkage during the welding process. The distribution and magnitude of these residual stresses are dependent on the dimensions of the heat affected zone (HAZ), and varies for instance as function of the welding procedure, and whether or not post weld measures are taken to diminish these residual stresses. In this thesis the width of the region in a column's cross section where tensile residual stress is present is referred to as the HAZ width. Using practical experiments an estimate is made of realistic HAZ widths in column structures using _nite element analyses. These column structures where welded and kept free of restraints during this process, so that a resulting curvature is developed upon cooling down to ambient temperature. The established value of the width of the tension zone is on the order of the thickness of the column's cross section. Based on existing norms a trapezoidal distribution of residual stress having a width of the earlier found value is applied on a _nite element model of a single square column, both for pinned and clamped boundary conditions. Mesh independence of the obtained results are verified by convergence studies. The compressive load capacity of the considered column is accected in the intermediate range of slenderness ratios, and shows a maximum reduction of approximately 21%. The effect of welding residual stresses is also investigated on a scaled model inspired by an existing design of a tower crane. A crane section is modelled by four vertical columns connected by multiple side bars. These side bars reduce the effective slenderness ratio of the columns loaded in compression, and therefore a less severe effect of the residual stresses on the collapse load is found.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

To this end, the tunnel tube is modelled as a Euler-Bernoulli beam deformed in three directions (horizontal displacement, vertical displacement, rotational angle), the discrete anchoring system as a continuous elastic foundation considering geometrical nonlinearity. Then, the Morison equation is used to model the combined current and wave loading and the oblique wave loading. A simplified wake oscillator and a non-simplified wake oscillator are used to model the vortex-induced vibration (VIV) under current loading. Subsequently, the modal superposition method and Runge-Kutta method are applied to obtain the response of the SFT in the time domain. The Fourier transform and the wavelet transform are applied to the time domain signal to perform a frequency domain analysis. Finally, a test on a scaled SFT model is used for a case study. A parametric study is carried out based on the results to study the influence of the geometrical and structural design parameters. The results show that the motions in the horizontal direction and the rotational direction are significantly coupled together. Geometrical nonlinearity introduces the second-order effect to the system leading to a complicated vertical motion with a considerably larger displacement compared with the linear case. The amplitude of the VIV on the tunnel tube of the scaled model is very small based on the non-simplified wake oscillator. Moreover, it is found that, basically, increase of the BWR, increase of the stiffness in the cables, increase of the distribution of the net buoyancy in inclined cable, decrease of the tunnel length or decrease of the inclination of the inclined cables can reduce the maximum response of the SFT. Based on the above findings, it is concluded that a global dynamic analysis is suggested when a SFT is expected to be subjected to oblique wave loadings. Geometrical nonlinearity is necessary to be considered for an accurate analysis especially for the response in the vertical direction. It is also necessary to be considered when the influence of the BWR is of interest. The VIV on the tunnel tube is negligible base on the scaled model.","Nonlinear Dynamics; Global Dynamic Analysis; Vortex induced vibrations; Submerged Floating Tunnels","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering","Submerged Floating Tunnel",""

In the wold, more and more plastic packaging is being used. A large part of the used plastics is single-use plastic packaging that is only used for a couple of minutes and then discarded. The discarded plastic packaging stays in the environment for hundreds of years. A solution to this is shifting from a single-use plastic packaging that does not degrade and uses a fossil resource, towards a new type of paper packaging that degrades when ended up in the environment and is from a renewable source. Miscanthus based packaging can fulfil this need. Elgra is a company that cultivates Miscanthus and is looking for new paper packaging applications. To come to a design challenge, an extensive analysis is performed on the internal and external context of Miscanthus and paper packaging. From this analysis, three different market criteria are formulated: -Closed systems have a controllable environment -A constant demand reduces market fluctuations -The paper industry is complex From these market criteria, the market of Schiphol airport was chosen to introduce Miscanthus based packaging. It meets all three criteria and can be a local for local packaging. From the market criteria, a design challenge is formulated. This thesis answers the following design challenge: Design a circular innovation strategy for Miscanthus based packaging at Schiphol, with a local for local approach, taking into consideration the complex system of papermaking. A deep dive into the market of Schiphol showed that introducing Miscanthus packaging at KLM catering services (KCS) is the most beneficial for Elgra and KCS. The design challenge is answered by presenting four different design artefacts that illustrate four different strategic routes that can be taken. The artefacts are implemented using a local for local approach, this means that the packaging is cultivated, produced, distributed, used and collected locally. In addition, an LCA is performed to measure the environmental impact of the four different artefacts. It showed that the 3D moulded products which were mechanically pulped had the lowest impact. To validate if the market fits the four design artefacts, a value proposition canvas is filled in. The final artefact which is the most likely to be implemented is the beauty case. This artefact illustrates how Miscanthus packaging needs to be pulped using mechanical pulping and is 3D moulded into its shape. The roadmap that is presented shows that in the first horizon, a first Miscanthus packaging (for example the beauty case) is implemented at KCS. The goal is to set up a viable business with Miscanthus packaging at is core. The second horizon of the roadmap has the goal to professionalise the business by buying production machinery to produce Miscanthus packaging in house. The third and last horizon has as a focus on expanding the business to produce packaging from other renewable crops with its own production facility, still fitting the local for local approach.","strategic design; Strategic product design; circular product design; business design; packaging; sustainable packaging; Miscanthus; Miscanthus x Giganteus","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

However, they are susceptible to corrosion in different environments leading to damages and catastrophic failures. Different corrosion-inhibition strategies are used to retard corrosion of copper and copper alloys. Among them, corrosion inhibitors are successfully used to inhibit their corrosion. This thesis focuses on the corrosion inhibition of brasses (the copper-zinc binary alloys) using two kinds of organic inhibitors, namely 2-mercapto-1-methyl-benzimidazole (1H-HB-2T) and 2-mercapto-benzimidazole (MBI). Corrosion inhibition of the substrates using the inhibitors were screened using linear polarization resistance (LPR) measurements. Subsequently, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was used to study the detailed corrosion inhibition processes and mechanisms. Finally, two modes (RAS and ATR) of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) were adopted for in-situ and ex-situ tests to study the adsorption mechanisms of inhibitor molecules on the surfaces. The research results showed that: (1) the composition (phase type) of the brass controls the interaction of inhibitor on surfaces; (2) an increased Zn content of brass leads to a decreased corrosion resistance; (3) 2-mercapto-1-methyl-benzimidazole (1H-HB-2T) exhibits better corrosion efficiency than 2-mercapto-benzimidazole (MBI) indicating the importance of the methyl functional group to increase the inhibitor’s efficiency; (4) 1HHB-2T exhibits a spontaneous structure transformation from thiol to thione and (5) within a maximum 5-hour exposure, the adsorption of the inhibitors to the metal surface is complete.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

DTU showed the benefit of such a reference model with their 10 MW reference wind turbine and continued the evolution in multi-megawatt wind power systems. Even though these two systems exist in the conventional wind turbine industry, a publicly available reference system does not exist in airborne wind energy. Currently, Airborne Wind Energy Systems (AWES) are still in the prototype testing phase as no commercial utility-scale product has been released to the market yet. A reference model like the NREL 5MW turbine can therefore significantly increase the speed of AWES development and open a door towards more publicly available research. This thesis solves the following main research question: ""How does a multi-megawatt utility scale airborne wind energy reference system look like, focusing on the main wing parameters?"". This is done by setting up a relatively computationally efficient optimisation framework based on a Fluid Structure Interaction (FSI) model combined with a flight dynamics simulation model which can be used in early design optimisations, for example. The FSI model consists of a 3D linear structural Finite Element model coupled with a potential-flow based 3D panel method. The aircraft structure is parametrised and parameters are found for an aircraft with a wing area of approximately 150 m2. The wing mesh and other structural components are created in Matlab while Nastran is exploited to obtain the stiffness, mass and inertia matrices. A model order reduction technique is applied to the structural model, relying on the mode superposition method to decrease the computation effort by several orders. The wing's aerodynamic behaviour is calculated by the 3D panel method. A model order reduction technique is also applied here, based on a Taylor expansion of the aerodynamic influence coefficient matrices. A modified fixed wing aircraft flight controller is used to fly a circular flight path where the ground station periodically allows the tether to be reeled out and in. The navigation of the aircraft is split up in two components, namely the lateral controller (based on a modification to the L1-control logic) and radial dynamics controller (depending on the elevator and tether reel-out behaviour). A Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMAES) optimisation method is applied with a specific objective function to find the system design parameters. This work then presents a detailed representation of the aircraft design, consisting of the planform parameters, material choices and composite layup. It demonstrates the ability of the framework to obtain a wing that can sustain high wing loadings. Also the system performance in a full power cycle illustrates the full potential of a 150 m2 wing which is able to generate multiple megawatts of power. This thesis serves as a foundation of reference systems in airborne wind energy, which other researchers can use and adapt to contribute further to a benchmark network in Airborne Wind Energy.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering | Aerodynamics and Wind Energy","",""

This has sparked the interest in power-to-fuel technology to store excess renewable energy in the chemical bonds of synthetic fuels. As a highly reactive, turn-key process, plasma-chemical conversion offers a promising approach to power-to-fuel technology. However, recent studies have shown limitations in either energy efficiency, conversion or flow rate. The novel Spinning Arc Plasma Reactor (SAPR) developed by J. van Kranendonk stabilises the plasma by mechanical rotation with the potential to contain a liquid film for in-situ product removal. The aim of this thesis is to characterise this reactor by studying the effect of rotational confinement on the reactor performance. To this end, the prototype initially built by J. van Kranendonk was further developed. A wealth of recent studies on the plasma-chemical conversion of CO2 as a step in the formation of synthetic fuels serves as a benchmark to compare reactor performance of the SAPR concept against. A series of experiments with argon were performed to establish the relationship between the system variables (pressure, power, flow rate and rotational speed) and the plasma parameters (electron temperature and electron density). Based on this knowledge, a series of experiments with CO2 were performed to establish the relationship between the reactor performance measured by the conversion and energy efficiency and the system variables: pressure, power and flow rate. The maximum conversion of about 30% to 55% was obtained at an energy efficiency of approximately 0.25% and the maximum energy efficiency of about 3% was achieved at a conversion of approximately 8.5% conversion. Similarly to other studies, improvements to either one came at the expense of the other. The performance of the SAPR proved comparable to dielectric barrier and other glow discharges but was outperformed by microwave and gliding arc discharges. Especially energy efficiency was inferior to these configurations. Further analysis of the discharge emission spectra suggested that CO2 dissociation mainly occurred through electron impact excitation. This explains the large difference in energy efficiency as microwave and gliding arc configurations are able to exploit more energy efficient dissociation channels. Nonetheless, this study was able to further develop the concept and has laid the ground work to explore the potential effect of a liquid film and in-situ product removal on the reactor performance.","Plasma chemistry; CO2 dissociation; Rotational confinement","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This baseline study was divided in three main steps: a desktop study, where high resolution maps of precipitation, potential evaporation, soil type and landuse were used in conjunction with a smallholder socio-hydrological model to identify 'hotspots' where farmers' capital falls below poverty lines; a field survey, in which farmers were extensively questioned on their financial situation and farming practices as well as their perception of water scarcity and irrigation schemes; and a final synthesis where interventions are analysed with the smallholder socio-hydrological model and a psycho-social analysis of farmer behaviour is delivered alongside a mapping of current water productivity of cotton in the study area. The main results found are that the proposed water harvesting and recharge interventions increase and stabilize yields, and the overall effect on capital are moderate. Other factors that do not impact water availability including fertilizer and labour were found to have notable impacts and should be well understood to accurately improve farmers' situations. Financial aspects including cotton sale prices and loan interest rates had strong impacts on farmers' capital development as well, particularly with high interest rates punishing some farmers. An analysis of good- and poor-performing farmers demonstrated that irrigation in general and micro-irrigation did improve probability of good farmer performance as did increased yields. Older men also showed higher rates of profit, demonstrating that the impact of experience may increase profit margins, even if it necessarily doesn't increase likelihood to adopt interventions. What was found to increase probability of adopting irrigation and irrigation technology was low promotion exposure. It is hypothesized that increased promotion may influence many farmers negatively, fostering an attitude of despair rather than informing them of opportunity. The psycho-social evaluation also found that solutions that are reasonably expensive but not too costly have higher chances of being adopted. <br/>Four main recommendations were made to help improve farmer welfare with respect to the scope specified. It was recommended to: limit promotion and to be more selective and positive with the message; focus on localized water storage interventions to increase farmers' access to water; regulate cotton prices through government intervention or contracts with clothing companies to decrease vulnerability to price changes; and improve access to loans from the government and reduce the role of money lenders who often are the ones charging the greatest interest rates.","India; Water management; Maharashtra; Cotton; Smallholders; Intervention Design","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","","Project Cotton Water","20.7, 78.6"

In order to explore methods to control the thermoelastic coupling effect, we investigated factors that are relevant to the instability in eigenfrequency measurements, including the thickness of metal coating on the top of the resonator, and the position of the detecting laser spot on the resonator. We found that this instability-induced error is 1 to 2 orders of magnitude lower on resonators without coating than on those with coating, and 3 to 4 orders of magnitude lower if the measurement is done with the first flexural eigenmode than with the first torsional mode. The minimum mass error is achieved when measuring the first flexural eigenmode on an uncoated suspended microchannel resonator. It is in the magnitude of zeptogram (10e-21g), and can be smaller than the minimum detectable mass change which is limited by the minimum detectable frequency change in the measurement.","microchannel resonator; thermoelastic coupling; mass precision error","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-12-31","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Micro and Nano Engineering","",""

Our utilized profiling technique includes deep neural networks such as the multi-layer perceptron and the convolutional neural network. As this adds a layer of complexity to our assessment, we must understand how the properties of the network consolidate our security assessment. Previous research has shown that classical neural network metrics such as accuracy does not correlate to how successful or efficient a side-channel analysis is, therefore, we have proposed a mutual information metric. We measure mutual information across each layer in the neural network such that the behavior of each layer in interpreting how each layer is benefiting our classification. We investigate if the mutual information measure can be used to make a beneficial architectural distinction of the neural network for our side-channel analysis problem. Finally, we show there is a relationship between the mutual information and the guessing entropy for our side-channel attack and that it can be used to confirm that the chosen model is fully optimized for the side-channel problem.","Side-Channel Attacks; Deep Learning; Mutual Information; Convolutional Neural Network; Neural Network; Machine Learning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science | Cyber Security","",""

This cause for the failure can vary from poor project management, to poor engineering, external factors like environment etc. This research particularly aims at identifying the competencies needed by project managers, with a aim that it will eventually reduce the failure rate.<br/>This research was carried out to investigate the relevance of competencies with respect to contract type, specifically cost reimbursable and lump sum contract and its variations with the project phases. Eventually also identifying the effect of competencies on project success. This will cater to the problem definition what kind of competencies can project managers adapt to execute a lump sum contract. In order to understand lump sum, we also need to study cost reimbursable that is the extreme opposite of lump sum contract. Encompassing all the above the following research question was formulated:<br/>“What are the critical competencies of a project manager needed at different phases of a lumpsum project to ensure project success?”<br/>The main research objective is to understand the importance of competent project managers. The research was divided into three phases.<br/>In the first phase a thorough literature review was done to get insights on competencies, yielding a set of fifteen competencies that will be studied against the phases of a project. FLUOR B.V., has five stages of a project, which will be considered for the research purpose. Two sets of project success factors were identified through literature, one being at macro view point and the other being micro view point.<br/>The second phase was all about data collection and analysis. Survey was conducted to identify the variations in competencies through different phases of a project. Interviews were conducted to recognise the relationship between contract type and competencies, and competencies’ impact on project success. Since both the methods addressed different hypotheses. Data collection is followed by the analysis. Frequency charts were made to identify the most preferred competencies.<br/>The final phase was to put the results to use. A competency-based scorecard was designed to suitably hire and appoint project managers. This was based on phases of a project. Only the top eight competencies per phase was chosen for the scorecard. Competencies that are most affected during a lump sum contract are added to an existing leadership model, it’s a matrix of leadership levels and competencies. The competencies affecting the project success can also be useful in allocating project managers to different projects. This could be directly implemented in projects.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

Garpenberg is a multi-deposit poly-metallic mine owned by Boliden AB. Cost calculations were performed on data from 2018 to derive costs for each deposit and activity. Ore transport and rock bolting were two parameters which were suitable to be used for variable cost implementation. These costs were assigned to the different orebodies and cut-off grades were adjusted to reach a break-even level. Stopes were created using the Stope Optimizer software in Deswik, using the variable cut-offs and the technical constraints previously used for Garpenberg's Life of Mine Plan. Cut-offs were elevated or depressed to optimise NPV for each deposit separately and the optimal combination yielded an NPV increase of 530 Mkr, a 4\% increase, compared to using static cut-off grades. More value can be obtained by combining cut-off strategies in Garpenberg as whole, in contrast to separate optimisation. Scheduling of newly created stoping areas within the Lappberget deposit proved to be beneficial for value. Finally, a financial analysis into double stopes of 50 m high was performed. The elimination of production levels provides the main cost reduction. However, lower selectivity and expected dilution will limit the financial gain from this method.","Cut-off; Sublevel Stoping; Optimisation; Garpenberg","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-10-31","","","","Applied Earth Sciences | European Mining Course","","64.873793, 20.383698"

Compressional and shear wave velocities play an important role in static elastic rock deformation behaviour estimation. Onsets of compressional and shear wave signal have to be determined in order to calculate the corresponding wave propagation velocity. Onset estimation by automation is especially problematic in shear wave signals due to noise caused by reflections and refractions, which results in inaccurate onset estimations and, therefore, requires manual onset picking which is time-inefficient and, hence, costly. Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) is the automated picking method applied to the ultrasonic signals in this thesis. By efficiently processing shear wave signals it was tried to optimize the results of the AIC. Ten processing techniques from biomedical engineering, statistical signal processing, audio and speech processing and RADAR applications were thoroughly researched. Their applicability to ultrasonic signals was reasoned based on literature. Six applicable signal processing techniques were eventually applied to 30 synthetic and 30 real ultrasonic signals. The mean and standard deviation of the error related to onset estimation before and after processing was used for evaluation. Visual comparison before and after processing was also executed to evaluate the visual impact of the processing techniques. Results showed that only a Butterworth high-pass filter visually enhances synthetic and real ultrasonic signals and improves the mean and standard deviation with respect to onset estimation. A Chebyshev high-pass filter also improved onset estimation results, but deteriorated the visual interpretation of the time signals. A simple amplitude filter unexpectedly provided the best results with respect to onset estimation. It is concluded from this studies that onset estimation by AIC can be improved by application of related signal processing techniques. This could be beneficial in estimation static deformation behaviour.

In the Netherlands, it is projected that not less than 7 GW of solar PV capacity will be installed in 2020. Therefore, the Netherlands is expected to experience abundant energy supply from solar generation in the near future. Energy sharing can be a reliable method to manage a great number of solar PV production. This direct sharing might reduce the strain and improve the stability of the main grid because it lessens the power to be transported and balanced across the main grid. Such an energy sharing method is also known as <i>peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading.</i> Despite its potential benefits, the pre-established requirements to perform such trading can be perceived unjust for some communities, such as for the community of Bospolder-Tussendijken in Rotterdam-West which can be considered as one of the poor communities in the Netherlands. As an illustration, P2P energy trading by design requires people to own solar PV to generate distributed power, in which not everybody could afford it economically. This study is then aimed at specifying a set of norms for a just P2P energy trading system by operationalising the framework of <i>value-hierarchy</i>. Accordingly, the abstract level of energy justice as a value will be translated into a more concrete set of norms, and the practical actions to support the realisation of those norms in Bospolder-Tussendijken will be suggested to the Municipality of Rotterdam.

(mentor); Cunningham, S. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","Research shows that CIOs of both public and private organizations are searching for new ways to support better outcomes of their data-driven decision-making. As linking external data with internal company data can result in interesting new insights and value, CIOs are increasingly developing IT strategies that involve the real-time use of external data. One of the innovations that is being adopted in real-time to enable better informed decision-making is external Big and Open Linked Data (BOLD). Combining internal company data silos with external BOLD in real-time helps in the creation of these real-time insights, such as new relationships, patterns, or more context to existing data that was not yet useful. These new insights can be used for better decision-making on a variety of problems and opportunities, such as strengthening customer relationship, better pricing, building a better product market fit, expanding products and services, and managing risk. However, the adoption of external BOLD addresses several adoption barriers that hinder the real-time integration of external BOLD with internal company data. The presence of adoption barriers show that there is a lack of alignment across the different levels of an organization and between the organizations concerned with the data integration. A common practice to align a new strategy and its implementation across the organization is Enterprise Architecture (EA). Countless Enterprise Architecture Frameworks (EAFs) are in existence, but none of them seems to focus on aligning an organization with its business ecosystem. This study shows that the foundation of EA is not capable of satisfying the external mindset of organizations and that an extended approach is required to align a new strategy between organizations. Therefore, this thesis answered the following main research question: How can organizations enable the real-time integration of external Big and Open Linked Data with internal company data for decision-making? This thesis used a Design Science Approach to develop an extended EAF that enables the real-time integration of BOLD for decision-making. Throughout this thesis five sub-research questions are answered to derive to the answer of the main research question. First, two systematic literature reviews are conducted to explicate the research problem by identifying the adoption barriers of BOLD and the limitations of the foundation of EA. Secondly, explorative expert interviews and qualitative data analysis are conducted to define the requirements for an extended EAF that deals with the adoption barriers and enables the real-time integration of external BOLD with internal company data. Thirdly, several systems engineering techniques (Morphological chart, Best-of-class chart, and brainstorm sessions with creative methods) are used to transform the requirements into an extended EAF. Lastly, the extended EAF is evaluated on quality and suitability through a ‘Plan Evaluation’, which resulted in potential improvements of the design. The findings are synthesized for answering the main research question. To explicate the misalignment across organizations and between organizations, the different barriers that hinder the real-time adoption of BOLD are identified. This resulted in a conceptual model of adoption barriers of BOLD related to information quality (data absence, data quality, a lack of meta-data), task complexity (task handling issues, lack of standards and different sources), technology (Lack of supporting infrastructure, legacy systems, data fragmentation), use &amp; participation (Lack of knowledge, implementation issues, constraints, lack of acceptance), legislations (privacy, security issues, and permits and license issues) and governance (Policy issues, Scalability Issues and a Lack of Data Governance). If organizations want to use external BOLD for decision-making in real-time, no adoption barriers can be present. This study shows that the foundation of EA can align a new IT strategy and its implementation across the organization, but not of aligning a new strategy between organizations and its ecosystem. This means the practice can mitigate the adoption barriers that arise across an organization can be overcome, but not the adoption barriers that arise between organizations. This thesis shows that a general transformation from a system of record to a system of engagement is required to adapt to this external mindset, which is key part of the paradigm shift that comes with an organization’s digital transformation. Modern organizations should embrace the system of engagement, including the company’s ecosystem as part of their Enterprise Architecture Framework. Hence, this thesis presents the ‘Ecosystem Architecture Framework’ that facilitates this transformation and has incorporated the required capabilities to mitigate the adoption barriers that arise between an organization and its ecosystem. The Ecosystem Architecture Framework provides guidance for organizations to implement an IT strategy that involves the real-time integration of external BOLD on an institutional, technological and transactional level. First, the framework provides a proactive approach that initially deals with the potential adoption barriers. Secondly, the framework enables collaboration between the data users and BOLD providers by establishing strategic alliances with mutual incentives to mitigate the adoption barriers. Thirdly, the framework allows organizations to involve all stakeholders concerned with the BOLD integration in the design of the system. By developing a shared architecture vision and architectural requirements alignment between the organization and ecosystem is created. Fourthly, the framework enables organizations to initially link their architectures through a direct real-time connection. This study demonstrates that organizations need to invest in a hybrid integration platform (e.g. an API Management Platform) that facilitates that organizations can easily integrate and share integration services (e.g. APIs), different applications can be linked together, collaboration between applications is possible, and orchestration of the applications by a single interface. Fifthly, the framework looks beyond the technical implementation and ensures that an inter-organizational model developed to make the architecture working. The inter-organizational model consists of shared artifacts that make sure the same way of working is implemented within the business ecosystem. This can be achieved by developing uniform standards for data, meta-data, technical information about integration services; A common data model that ensures one data model, unified schema and semantics are used within the business ecosystem; An independent API policy that ensures that each external data provider can be internally linked to the architecture by conforming to this policy; and institutions between the organizations that enforce the same way of working to enable sustainability of the data. Lastly, the framework ensures that the architecture keeps running by adapting to changes of the environment. Therefore, it is important that organizations develop a governance mechanism that ensures the system is scalable, maintainable and sustainable. It is important that the inter-organizational model and shared artifacts of the ecosystem are managed and adapt to changes of the environment to keep the architecture running. The outcomes of this research have both scientific and societal relevance. The former is achieved by adding the following contributions to science: new adoption barriers of BOLD; a critical assessment of the foundation of EA and EAFs; the required capabilities to mitigate the adoption barriers; and an approach that can be used to enable the real-time integration of BOLD with internal company data. The latter is achieved by providing a validated approach that can help to increase the success rate of data-driven strategies, which is relevant for national governments and organizations that want the data-driven strategies to succeed. The thesis also has some limitations. Firstly, the Ecosystem Architecture Framework is only validated trough a plan evaluation, which is a ‘design on paper’. Secondly, the framework is dependent on the TOGAF-ADM and can only be used as design principles without TOGAF-ADM. Also, the report has become very lengthy, as the research covers many different research methods. For future research, it is recommended to also validate the design through a ‘product- and process evaluation’ that investigate the implementation issues and effects in a real-world context. Secondly, it is recommended to do future research on additional capabilities to create an EAF that can be used independently. Thirdly, an in-depth study on the specific capabilities is recommended to investigate the different design patterns for incorporating the capabilities. Fourthly, it would be interesting to do research on engaging the Ecosystem Architecture Framework in different industries with different organizations part of different ecosystems and evaluate the differences.","Open Data; BOLD; Decision-making; Adoption; Barriers; Ecosystem Architecture Framework","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-09-30","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

This is due to the uncertain and dynamic nature of product, market and consumer knowledge related to innovation. Value proposition creation (VPC) process is a part of FFEI. The scope of the research of this thesis is from VPC kick-off until finalisation of the concept. It involves opportunity exploration, generation, prioritisation, validation of ideas and concepts. Although VPC is being studied in academic and by organisations since decades still organisations are going through a high number of iteration and continual change of scope of VPC process before finalising the concept which is accepted by consumers. The acceptance of the concepts is checked qualitatively and quantitative with consumers. The main reason of the failure of the concept to gain consumer acceptance is the lack of structure of VPC process, lack of understanding of attributes of VPC, lack of understanding of tools and processes required to define the key attributes, and lack of understanding of influence of innovation on these attributes of value proposition (VP). Attributes of the value proposition can be defined as the consumer, market, product, process, and organisational characteristics of value proposition. Furthermore, innovation is considered as the newness to the organisation. Hence, the objective of this research is to prepare theoretical framework showing the relationship between attributes of VP and acceptance of the concept which can be used by managers as a step by step guide to design a sprint of VPC process based on the scope of innovation. Philips is selected for this research to understand the real-life cases which involve VPC process. The initial conceptual model was prepared from literature review and desk research at Philips which is validated through semi-structured interview. Final conceptual model, theoretical framework 1, and theoretical framework 2 are prepared from case study and interview result analysis. Final conceptual model shows the key attributes of VP which influence acceptance of the concept by consumers and their role (independent variable or moderators). These key attributes are unmet consumer need, superior offer, competitive price, involvement of consumer, involvement of multifunctional team, additional cost, emotional appeal and brand influence. Theoretical framework 1 showed step by step method to guide VPC process by identifying above-mentioned key attributes for inspiration (opportunity exploration), ideation, and implementation phase. It further showed the influence of scope of innovation (incremental or disruptive) on the relationship between VP and acceptance of the concept by consumer. Theoretical framework 2 identified the tools and processes essential to define the attributes of VP to generate high concept test score from consumers. This research contributed to academia and practice by identifying key attributes of VP, establishing relationship between attributes of VP and acceptance of the concept by consumers, providing structure to the VPC sprint, defining attributes essential for different innovation type, and identifying the tools and processes needed to define each key attribute of VP.","innovation management; Fuzzy front-end innovation; Value proposition creation; Acceptance of concept by consumers; Concept Validation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-09-30","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

This thesis project aimsat shining a light on the latter, while also proposing a best business case scenario for realization.In order to deal with the issue at hand, a complete MATLAB-based modelling tool has been developedfor the simulation and evaluation of PV module and PV system performance. Additionally, a locationsurvey was conducted, which resulted in the recreation of the skyline profile and the study of the reflectivityof the ground. In case of using a bifacial PV module, the PVMD Toolbox can be integrated in theapproach.Using the developed modelling approach, different PV technologies were investigated. The bifacialmono-Si PV modules by LG were found to outperform the competition on yield and cost criteria. Theresults indicated that the best performance is achieved for a tilt of 40<sup>o</sup> and an azimuth of 165<sup>o</sup>. A sensitivityanalysis was also carried out, based on which a ground clearance height of 1.5 [m] was selected.Furthermore, the results extracted using the modelling tool were cross-validated using the PVMD Toolboxand the System Advisor Model (SAM), showing a satisfactory performance with the maximum deviationsbeing 1.5% and 3%, respectively.Moreover, two different potential loads were studied in conjunction with the solar modules. The firstwas the 1.25 [GWh] annual demand of the EXACT building, closely located to the investigated area. Inthis case a grid-connected PV system was designed with the total amount of modules being calculatedas 2,520. The second was an electrolyzer of a nominal capacity of 1.25 [MW], scheduled to be installedat the Process and Energy (P&amp;E) Department of the university. The electrolyzer was assumed to supplyhydrogen to two fuel cell buses, and its respective PV system was designed both as grid-independent aswell as grid-connected. In the independent approach the total number of required PV modules was foundto be 4,000, while in the grid-connected approach the size of the PV system was chosen similar to theone designed for the EXACT building. Moreover, two hydrogen production strategies, a minimum anda maximum, were investigated. The respective produced hydrogen was found to be 9,100 and 20,619[kg].The choice of the best business case was based on a performance and cost analysis that was conducted.The conclusion drawn from this analysis was that decentralized PV systems have a better performance dueto higher inverter efficiency and lower cable losses, while the centralized approach has a better behaviourcost-wise due to the initial investment being smaller by 2%. Additionally, systems with a higher lifetimeyield better results. All in all, the grid-connected, decentralized, electrolyzer-coupled PV system with themaximum hydrogen production strategy was deemed as the best business case. The initial investment of1.28 [M €] is won back over a period of 5.1 [yr], having an LCoE of 8.2 [cts €/kWh]. The area requiredto fit the PV system is comprised of Zones B1, B2 and B3, which show the greatest potential.","feasibility study; modelling tool; solar park; simulation; electrolyzer; business case; performance analysis; cost analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-10-01","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

Therefore, making full use of marine energy is a good choice for humans to solve the energy crisis. One way to capture ocean energy is converting wave energy to electrical energy, by means of devices called wave energy converters (WECs). This project introduces a new type of wave energy converter named “Gyroscopic-Pendulum Wave Energy Converter (GP WEC)”. Compared to the classical vertical axis pendulum WEC, a flywheel is added in the system. In combination with the floater motions it creates a gyroscopic effect on the pendulum causing it to rotate, a power take-off device is connected directly to the rotating pendulum shaft in order to harvest the wave energy and generate electrical energy. To investigate whether this new type of WEC will generate more energy than the classical one, this thesis proposes a dry test setup for the gyroscopic pendulum allowing for systematically investigating the gyroscopic effect on its power output. This thesis starts from the design of the GP WEC dry experiment and then provides the clear definition of all the components of equipment, along with the applicable scaling laws of all the components and parameters. Also, the requirements as to limits of the equipment are studied with a parameter study. Using the results of the parameter study a numerical model of the GP WEC is used to simulate the dry-tests. Based on these simulations the range and number of parameters that will be tested in the future experiment are confirmed, and test matrices defined. Some interesting observations from the numerical simulations are further studied looking into the time domain response. This thesis concludes with the definition of a test setup for dry experiments to be executed at TU Delft in a follow-up study, test matrices for investigating the gyroscopic effect on the power output are defined, and simulation results are presented which can be used for later validation of the physical model.","Wave Energy Converter (WEC); coupled pendulum; gyroscopic effect; Gyroscopic-pendulum","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-09-30","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

Li metal anodes and high voltage cathode materials are widely considered to be the path into next generation Li-ion batteries, while the scare amounts of lithium in the earth's crust has prompted research into other battery materials. Of these, Sodium-ion batteries are extremely interesting due to the abundance of Na, similar insertion chemistry to Li as well as the possibility of using aqueous electrolytes due to higher redox potential. Next generation Li-ion batteries are currently held back due to issues like - dendrite formation at the metal anode which may lead to internal short circuiting and thermal runaway of the organic electrolyte. Similarly, Na-ion systems have issues with organic electrolytes due to the limited solubility of Na electrolyte salts. Solid state electrolytes (SSEs) have rapidly garnered interest as a potential alternative. SSEs vastly improve battery safety due to their superior thermal stability and mechanical strength. However, there are still limitations for SSEs in both these systems that need to be resolved prior to implementing these electrolytes in commercial batteries.In this study, alginate salts, which are natural polysaccarides extracted from brown algae, have been examined as a solution to the problems in these systems. Initially, sodium and lithium salts (NaAlg and LiAlg) of alginic acid were synthesized followed by their physical characterization. Conductivity for sodium and lithium alginate (with 0% water) were both promising at 0.2 mS/cm. Additionally, both LiAlg and NaAlg exhibit excellent performance as binders in anode systems compared to PVdF (polyvinylidene difluoride) binders.For utilizing the LiAlg in Li solid-state batteries, NaSICON-based LAGP electrolyte was synthesized and characterized for this study. The degradation of LAGP on Li contact has already been well researched. To combat the issue, we try to utilize a layer of LiAlg as protective layer at the LAGP surface. The coated LAGP remains stable against Li without undergoing degradation. The Li cyclability and electrochemical performance of LiAlg was further analysed by coating it on a various electrodes and studying their rate capabilities against Li. LiAlg displayed excellent performance as a secondary polymer electrolyte on the surface and in the bulk of the electrodes. These tests show exceptional cycling performances and establish a proof of concept for LiAlg as a polymer electrolyte.NaAlg which was chosen as the electrolyte in Na-ion batteries, displays better gelation properties. The effects of water content and operating temperature on Na conductivity were investigated. For a fixed water content, increasing the temperature results in improved conductivity - though this effect is more prominent at higher water concentrations and within the margin of error at lower water concentrations. At a fixed temperature, the conductivity shows linear improvement in at low (&lt;25%) and high (&gt;90%) water concentrations, while remaining constant between 25% and 90%. Additionally, the performance of NaAlg electrolytes (2w% NaAlg aq. solution) and GPE (20w% NaAlg Gel Polymer Electrolyte) was compared with the conventional Na2SO4 electrolyte. During these tests, the electrolyte underwent degradation possibly caused due to cross-linking induced by the dissolution of Mn2+ from the cathode on de-sodiation. Nevertheless, as a proof of concept, the NaAlg showed promise as an electrolyte (aq. and GPE) but further system optimization needs to be done to fully establish its scope as electrolytes for Na batteries.","Alginates; Li-ion battery; solid state battery; battery electrolytes; Na-ion battery; Sodium Alginate; Lithium Alginate","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-12-31","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

In the specific case of the Adhesively Bonded Single Lap Joint (ABSLJ), bending-induced stresses that result from the load path eccentricity add up to the adherend inplane stresses. Moreover, significant peak peel and shear stresses develop at the lap ends of the adhesive and associated adherend interlaminar tensile stresses have a detrimental effect on the joint’s strength. Such joints made of Fiber Reinforced Polymer (FRP) adherends bonded with an epoxy adhesive layer sustain a substantial amount of damage, from failure onset to ultimate failure. With the purpose of design structurally efficient and damage tolerant composite joints, it is essential to understand the stress distribution and to accurately predict the damage initiation and propagation events in such joints made of composite materials.<br/><br/>A well-established set of Damage Progression Models (DPMs) in the framework on the Continuum Damage Models (CDMs) were developed as a tool to predict the global response,damage initiation load and ultimate load of the specimens. Hashin 3D, Puck and LaRC05 werethe implemented failure criteria to detect the initiation of damage in the adherends. After thispoint, the elastic properties of the detected damage elements were reduced according to sudden and gradual material degradation models. As for the adhesive, the von Mises criterion was used to detect the damage onset and a linear softening law modeled the material degradation. For the validation of the DPMs, the numerical results were compared against the data of an already published experimental study. Four different adherend layup sequences: [45/90/ − 45/0]2푠, [90/−45/0/45]2푠, [0/45/90/−45]2푠 and [45/0/−45/0]2푠 were studied based on data extracted<br/>from the mechanical testing, Digital Image Correlation (DIC) and Acoustic Emission (AE).<br/><br/>Good correlations between numerical predictions and averaged experimental linear stiffnesses were found, particularly for the two configurations with the outmost ply at 45∘, for which the difference was lower than 5%. The initial non-linear stage of the global response seems to be governed by the longitudinal bending stiffness, while the subsequent linear behavior is controlled by the longitudinal membrane stiffness of the adherends. Regarding damage initiation, numerical predictions showed to be 11.5%, 7.5%, 29.9% and 6.1%, respectively, more conservative for the four analysed configurations, when compared to the AE results, whose established criterion should be further developed. With respect to the ultimate load, the relative differences between predictions and tests showed significant variability among the tested configurations; specifically the deviations were of: 33.2%, 37.4%, -0.4% and -13.71%. <br/><br/>Despite the encouraging results, an inherent shortcoming of CDMs is the representation of damage in a smeared manner due to the homogenization of the anisotropic material in the modeling process. A blended framework using CDMs to model intralaminar failure and discrete crack models to model interlaminar failure and matrix cracking might lead to more realistic damage patterns.","Damage Progression; Continuum Damage Model; Single lap joints; FRP composites","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

However, at the moment, blockchain solutions are suffering from low transaction throughput and high delays. For instance, the bitcoin network processes at most 7 transactions per second. Blockchain second layer solutions aim to solve this transaction scaling problem with the idea of creating off-chain transactions using payment channels. For a payment channel, the blockchain network is only required to initialize and terminate the channels. Otherwise, they can finalize transactions between pairs of users instantly without using the blockchain network. The Lightning Network is one such payment channel solution that creates an overlay network on top of the blockchain and routes payments across users. Currently, the Lightning network uses source routing to route payments from a source to a destination. However, source routing does not scale to large networks.<br/><br/>In this thesis, we begin by establishing the requirements for routing in the Lightning Network. Next, we analyze generic payment routing algorithms based on the set requirements and understand their limitations. Further, we design a routing algorithm for the Lightning Network that builds upon the key ideas found in the previous work. We, in particular, provide design solutions for computing transaction fees and communicating errors in a privacy-preserving manner. These problems were not addressed in any earlier works. Finally, we implement our algorithm in an active Lightning Network codebase. We evaluate it with regard to security, privacy, and performance requirements and also compare the same with the existing solution.","lightning network; routing algorithm; blockchain; distributed systems","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Embedded Systems","",""

(mentor); van Baalen, Lennart (mentor); van Rhee, C. (graduation committee); Verhoef, P.N.W. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","Context: The shift to green energy offers a need for offshore wind farms. The transition from a relatively cheap energy production from carbohydrates, to a young offshore wind energy industry needs innovations to lower the cost. Increasing the efficiency of wind turbines and lowering the installation cost of a wind farm, will eventually make wind energy cheaper then energy produced by coal. A part of the installation process is the burial of the submerged power cables. The fragile power cables have to be buried a couple meters below the seabed, to be protected from anchors, fallen objects, and fishing activity. Problem definition: To submerge the power cable into the seabed, a trench have to be made. The soil of the seabed can consist of sand, silt, clay, rock or any combination of them. This research focuses on the trenching though clay. Clay has a very low permeability compared to sand, and clay has cohesive strength. For trenching in clay, a narrow plough is mostly used. These ploughs have a small frontal area and are build to cope with the high ploughing forces. A prediction of ploughing forces and velocities are made by models in preparation of cable burial projects. With accurate predictions, the best equipment can be chosen and a planning of the trenching operation can be made. The prediction models take into account the geometry of the plough and the soil characteristics. A reduction in pulling force results in an increase in ploughing velocity and therefore lowering the time and cost of cable installation. Approach: A large part of the pulling force in clay is caused by the adhesive force on the sides of the plough sliding through the clay. The adhesive force is therefore the main focus of this research. There are two main goals: the first goal is to investigate the adhesion force in relation to the strength of the clay; the second goal is to investigate ways to reduce the force caused by the adhesion. The adhesion factor is a parameter that is included in the prediction models. In literature of construction and agricultural engineering, predictions of adhesion factors and ways to reduce the adhesive force can be found. However, the circumstances during subsea ploughing are vastly different then in the other fields of engineering. Therefore, the approach of this study is to use small scale ploughing experiments with different strengths of clay to investigate the two goals under subsea ploughing conditions. For the experiments, a test setup is used. In this setup, a block of clay of a meter long can be hold into place in a water tank and be submerged. On top of the water tank, an electric motor can pull a cart over rails. A small scale plough can be bolted underneath the cart. During an experiment, the plough is pulled through the clay and the velocity and pulling forces are measured with sensors. Results and conclusions: The adhesion factors of three types of clay are found. The softest clay with a undrained shear strength of 25 kPa has a adhesion factor of 0.43. Literature shows that the adhesion force is about 1.0 at 25 kPa. This low adhesion factor could be the result of the frontal cutting that disrupt the clay. The residual shear strength is lower then the undisturbed clay. For the medium (80 kPa) and hard (131 kPa) clay the adhesion factor is respectively 0.68 and 0.53. These values are on the higher side of what literature reports. This could have to do with the relative high velocity during ploughing. The downward trend of adhesion factor with increasing clay strength does correspond to literature. To research the possibility of reducing the adhesion force, three small scale ploughs with modified adhesion surfaces are tested. The Alpha plough, which uses vertical gaps, reduced the adhesion force by 52 percent in both soft and hard clay. The Bravo plough, which uses convex shapes, reduced the adhesion force 39, 72 and 54 percent in respectively soft, medium and hard clay. The Charlie plough, which uses water nozzles at the adhesion surface, reduced the adhesion force by 70 percent in soft clay and 63 percent in hard clay. This experimental study obtained valuable knowledge of the adhesion factor and possibilities to reduce the adhesion force.","Subsea Ploughing in clay; Subsea power cable Burial; Adhesion Factor of clay; Adhesion reduction methods; experimental ploughing study","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-09-30","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

More frequent and extreme rainfall events are expected in many urban areas. The extent how climate change will affect weather patterns is however uncertain. This challenges contemporary stormwater management practices. A post-disaster reconstruction of an urban area would potentially be an opportunity to anticipate climate change uncertainties from the initial design phase of new urban development. This would allow for taking advantage of the disaster recovery by rebuilding a more resilient stormwater system than was present before, in which the uncertainties are anticipated. A resilient stormwater system would thus be able to cope a wide range of plausible futures, rather than the average. As academic literature lacks insight on re-establishing resilient urban stormwater management in a post-disaster reconstruction, this thesis aims to gain more insights into what extent resilient urban stormwater management has been established in a Tsunami reconstruction, with regard to uncertainties on climate change and urban development. A case study is conducted in which is focused on a) the conducted design approach, b) the realm of conditions for which the implemented stormwater system would be vulnerable and c) which solutions could be implemented to reduce the vulnerability, and reflected upon opportunities of an interdisciplinary approach from a stormwater management perspective. The selected study area is a town called Ötsuchi Town, in Northern Japan, Iwate Prefecture, which was severely hit during the 2011 Tsunami. The disaster necessitated a comprehensive reconstruction. To gain more insight into what extent a resilient urban stormwater system has been implemented, an exploratory modelling and analysis approach has been applied, which is also known as Scenario Discovery. Prime drivers of Scenario Discovery are exploring the system's performance for wide-ranging plausible futures by sampling the system myriad times with aid of computational modelling, and, the use of regional sensitivity mapping algorithms to understand the dominant factors that lead to insufficient system performance. The latter can be used as input for seeking vulnerability-reducing strategies. In this research, the Patient Rule Induction Method (PRIM) algorithm is used to understand the conditions for which the stormwater drainage system capacity would be exceeded, for an acceptable flooding level of 0.2 meter. Two open-source tools were combined: the conceptual stormwater flow model EPA-SWMM, and, python library EMA-workbench which provides the tools needed for applying Scenario Discovery and supportive analysis. After the 2011 Tsunami a separate half-open sewer system was established in the reclamation area of Ötsuchi Town. No natural-based solutions, or Blue-Green infrastructure were implemented, even though the residential is adjacent to steep mountain slopes. The uncertainty parameters over which is sampled, include rainfall intensity, rainfall duration, external runoff coefficient, imperviousness, the hydraulic conductivity, Manning's roughness coefficient and depression storage. The Scenario Discovery results show that the system has been built robust. For almost all locations no flooding occurrence arise from the sampling, even for very extreme rainfall events (&gt;100 mm/hr, for a duration of 60 min). However, when the runoff coefficient of the external runoff from the mountain would be above 0.58, a small area in the northern part would be vulnerable. The dominant factors, are found with PRIM and the relative weights are with very high precision and recall found by pre-processing the sampling data with Principal Component Analysis. It showed that for the vulnerable area, the hydraulic conductivity of the soil and the proportion of paved area are decisive in whether or not flooding occurs. Paying attention to certain thresholds, would significantly reduce the vulnerability of flooding occurrence. Given the high volumes for which flooding would occur, a preliminary feasibility study has been done for both a vegetative swale and infiltration trenches, in combination with a storage retention area in the lower lying area, such that the pressure on the stormwater drainage system can be released. The vegetative swale reduce the vulnerability significantly. The infiltration trenches seem to be effective for the lower rainfall duration and rainfall intensity. PCA-PRIM outcome showed that when implementing infiltration trenches in the vulnerable area, the impervious rate becomes relatively less sensitive in comparison with outcomes of PRIM with the reference situation. More information on mountain runoff, soil properties and land use would enhance the accuracy of the results. In addition, since, no information is known yet on initial losses of mountain runoff, more information on runoff flow processes from the mountains would enable to perform joint probability analysis with the results of this research, to better assess whether or not the time is now to implement additional measures. From the results of this research it seems that the urban stormwater drainage of Ötsuchi Town has been rebuilt very robust, however when the system would fail, no additional measures outside the grey infrastructure are taken. An interdisciplinary approach could have encouraged a more resilient stormwater management. As this research shows that multiple commutative reconstruction measures could be found from a stormwater management perspective, the obtained information with applying Scenario Discovery, would have been useful to encourage an interdisciplinary approach during the reconstruction process. It is therefore suggested to explore the usage of Scenario Discovery on urban stormwater management even further, such that it enables to take advantage of the disaster reconstruction to establish a resilient urban stormwater management. An example would be to investigate whether the relative sensitivity of the uncertainty parameters would change when a less robust system would be examined. For example, for an urban drainage system for which the threshold would already be exceeded for lower rainfall intensity and duration than 100 mm/hr, and 60 minutes respectively. In addition, a coarse representation of rainfall events are considered in this research. Therefore it would be suggested to examine the applicability of region-specific storm profiles in combination with an exploratory modelling and analysis approach, to better assess the implication of the PRIM outcomes for implementing resilient urban stormwater management strategies.","Resilient urban stormwater management; Scenario discovery; Tsunami reconstruction; Exploratory Modelling and Analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","DIMI","39.358250, 141.89944"

This project is chaired by prof. dr. ir. Pieter Desmet and coached by dr. Rebecca Price. The project was initiated by Margot Scheltema, an influential Dutch commissioner with multiple companies. She initiated this project because she is suffering from retinitis pigmentosa, a progressive eye disease, and will soon have to walk using a white guiding cane. However, she finds this cane too stigmatising and is looking for a more positive white cane. Research In order to get insights into possible design directions for a positive white cane, extensive user research was conducted. This research was conducted in collaboration with Visio, an institution that helps the visually impaired that is based in Den Haag. With help from Visio, three auto-ethnographic studies were conducted, as well as one generative session and three observation studies. These observation studies were conducted by means of participant observation and gave insight into how cane walkers are trained, how the visually impaired interact with technology and how visually impaired people can be profoundly misunderstood by their environments. Independently, two observations of Margot Scheltema were conducted that gave insights into how the visually impaired are still able to live a rich life. Also, one generative session was conducted and two events were visited that include a trade fair and the Dutch retina day. The research shows that the visually impaired face multiple problems on a daily basis. These problems include increased visibility due to (the effects of) visual impairment, loss of agency, difficulty communicating (the effects of) visual impairment and experiencing a negative self-image. Some attitudes towards assistive devices were also observed, and these are connecting the image of the assistive device to self-image, facing the reality of the situation, not letting the opinions of bystanders affect you and being concerned about the social effects of using specific assistive products. From these insights, four personas were created that can be places in certain situations in a journey map. These personas, combined with an extensive literature study and the journey map served as a basis to develop design proposals upon. Design proposal After some failed attempts to reaching a meaningful design proposal, a tool was created that allows concepts to be developed while keeping research front and center. The final concept consists of a modular cane that used contemporary technology to give the visually impaired an edge in developing their unique skills and add their insights to the world. It leverages positive aspects about being visually impaired and amplifies them, making them actionable. Three embodiments of this modular, open-ended design were developed and presented in scenarios. The aesthetics of the cane were designed in such a way that it shows the technological advances it makes use of, while still having a very striking and unique appearance. Combining the added benefits with this unique identity brings together multiple strategies that serve the purpose of de-stigmatising assistive products that were found in literature research. Validation The concept was validated using a stigmaticity test and a generative session at Visio using visually impaired participants. The session at Visio gave insights into what kind of data the visually impaired imagined to be generating, with whom they would want to share that and which degree of privacy they would prefer to be associated with which kind of data. The stigmaticity tests shed some light into the effect of the aesthetics of the positive white cane. In these tests, the dyadic distance between participants and a research confederate were measured and the amount of looks the research confederate received were recorded. It was found that, in the female research confederate, dyadic distance was significantly closer when wielding the positive white cane. This means that people were more comfortable getting closer to her than when she was wielding the current white cane. This was also the cane with the male research confederate, but less significantly so. Conclusion The results of this design project suggest that a positive white cane be made that combines advances in technology and a unique aesthetic that not only de-stigmatised the white cane but also brings meaningful new features to the visually impaired. These new features will allow them to become more connected, learn faster and contribute to society in a more direct manner. The data generated by this positive white cane would also serve researchers in their attempts to shape the world and make it more inclusive for everybody. Next steps that can be taken include the making of functional prototypes, holding joint workshops with both professionals working in the field of visual impairment, visually impaired users and government workers to explore the possibilities the positive white cane has to offer and many others. This project will exhibit at the Design United exhibition at Dutch Design week and I hope to make many connections there that could potentially allow me to develop this project further.","Stigma; Assistive technology; Design research","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For optimal spectral utilization, a multi-junction silicon based device needs a silicon alloy with a bandgap between that of nc-Si (1.1 eV) and a-Si (1.8 eV). a-SiGe:H has a tunable bandgap between 1.4-1.6 eV by varying the GeH4 flow rate in the layer. An investigation of deposition parameters on PECVD processed a-SiGe:H films showed that variation of the GeH4/SiH4 flow rate is the most influential deposition parameter to achieve bandgap tuning. It influences the optical-, electrical- and material properties due to the fact that it directly changes the GeH4 flow rate in the material. Subsequently, a n-i-p substrate single junction a-SiGe:H solar cell is fabricated. This is the reversed p-i-n superstrate a-SiGe:H solar cell, fabricated by the PVMD group. It has a Voc of 508 mV, a FF of 0.39, a Jsc of 9.9 mA/cm2 and a final efficiency of 2.9%. Due to the low performance, manipulation techniques were introduced. The different proposed shapes consist of bandgap grading in the absorber through GeH4 flow rate profiling. A study on buffer type and thickness, different profiling schemes, grading widths and total absorber thickness strongly improved the device performance. The overall champion single junction a-SiGe:H solar cell has a 3.2 nm n/i i-a-Si buffer combined with a 5 nm n/i i-a-SiGe:H buffer, a V-shape GeH4 peak flow rate of 2.4 sccm, a 134 nm n/i grading width, a 36 nm i/p grading width and a total absorber thickness of 170 nm. This cell generates a Voc of 735 mV, a FF of 0.64, a Jsc of 13.23 mA/cm2 and a final efficiency of 6.18%. This is a relative increase of 113.8% in efficiency. The single junction solar cell fabrication is followed by demonstration of a two-junction device. The overall champion tandem solar cell consists of a 200 nm a-Si:H top cell and a 170 nm a-SiGe:H bottom cell with a V-shape GeH4 peak flow rate of 5.3 sccm. This champion tandem solar cell generates a Voc of 1395 mV, a FF of 0.69, a current limiting Jsc of 8.34 mA/cm2 and a final efficiency of 7.99%.

However, radical innovation has inherent characteristics that make a radical innovation project difficult to manage, such as: increased generativity – the aspect that describes how radical innovation outcomes are creative and novel, different than other radical innovation outcomes, and fundamental non-probabilistic uncertainty – uncertainty inherent to radical innovation cannot be mitigated using data-driven forecasting techniques. The increased generativity and fundamental non-probabilistic uncertainty characteristics of radical innovation presents challenges especially when a decision regarding the internal adoption for further development of a radical innovation concept needs to be made, as financial tools, such as Return On Investment (ROI) and Net Present Value (NPV) are widely used to evaluate and make a decision regarding the internal adoption of radical innovation concepts. The aim of this master thesis is taking a strategic design approach to design a tool, that facilitates the decision-making process behind the internal adoption of radical innovation concepts, while addressing the knowledge gap between the challenges of radical innovation, and the decision-making tools and evaluation criteria currently used. Literature review and field research, consisting of qualitative interviews with experts from academia and experts working in industry, was conducted to understand the context of the decision-making process behind the internal adoption of radical innovation concepts. The research phase revealed the knowledge gap mentioned above and insights that were used towards devising design criteria for developing a tool. Insights gathered from the literature review and field research led to the development of the Viability Decision Canvas, a tool that facilitates the decision-making process behind the internal adoption of radical innovation concepts. The Viability Decision Canvas is based on the Viability Model which describes viability as the main decision criteria when a radical innovation concept is evaluated by a company, where viability is modeled by desirability, feasibility and suitability. Viability Decision Canvas facilitates the evaluation and the decision-making process behind the internal adoption of radical innovation concepts by employing abductive reasoning in a Fast-and-Frugal decision tree format, that addresses the non-probabilistic uncertainty inherent to radical innovation. The Viability Decision Canvas, besides the decision-maker, involves other relevant people (e.g. designer, engineer, marketer, senior manager, etc.) in the decision-making process to ensure organizational alignment. Being simple and structured, the Viability Decision Canvas allows and encourages rapid adjustment to suit the specific context of the company and the context created by the radical innovation concept generativity aspect. Critical assumptions identified during the design of the Viability Decision Canvas were validated through a test in a company context, while the usability of the Viability Decision Canvas was tested in the same company context and in a role-playing test with peers. The feedback gathered was incorporated through iterations towards the final version of the procedure. The positive results of the Viability Decision Canvas evaluation, regarding the facilitation of the decision-making process behind the internal adoption of radical innovation concepts, show the potential value of the use of the Viability Decision Canvas to be implemented as a company routine.","Radical Concept Adoption; Evaluation; Decision-Making; Adoption of Radical Innovation; Viability Model; Viability Decision Canvas","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

This approach is able to uncover any dependencies, regardless of known or unknown causes. The results from the Bayesian Network can be used to calculate a set of newly defined informativity indicators. These indicators give information on a station’s capacity of providing information on the delay state of the rest of the network. Among the possible applications of these indicators are: providing accurate information to passengers and the operator on delays, and aiding in determining the most effective areas for delay mitigation measures. To increase the usefulness of these indicators, they are compared to centrality indicators, so that even for networks with little available data, the informativity indicators can still be approximated. It was found that the centrality and informativity indicators correlate to some extent, meaning the informativity indicators could be very meaningful and relevant in further gaining knowledge on and improving public transport reliability.","Public Transport; Reliability; Bayesian Network; Correlations; Informativity Indicators","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Transport, Infrastructure and Logistics","",""

(mentor); de Moel, Peter (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","For drinking water treatment applications, it is possible to predict the external porosity of an expanded bed of granular activated carbon in fluidized conditions. A new model has been developed with a 2% relative prediction error. <br/><br/>In order to supply sufficient and safe drinking water, water utilities use a treatment train consisting of several unit processes. One of these treatment unit processes is granular activated carbon (GAC) filtration, a crucial unit process widely used for its filtration and adsorption capabilities as a barrier for undesired macro and micro-pollutants. The point of interest for this research is one of the critical steps in the filtration part of the unit process, the backwashing procedure.<br/>Backwashing is a cleaning procedure, which consists on stopping the normal operation of the filter and reversing the normal downward water flow. This upward flow leads to the expansion of the filter’s media and washes away any undesired particles caught in between and on the surface of the media. Inadequate backwashing can lead to unwanted operational outcomes, for instance, solids accumulation and mud balls or media washout, resulting in costly operational expenses. In addition, currently there is a tendency for water utilities to explore new sustainable GAC filter media, which have different expansion tendencies. These operational requirements create the need for the development of prediction models to estimate the expansion degree of the filter bed during backwash procedures. Additionally, a deep understanding of the phenomena that governs this unit process is required to increase its resiliency.<br/><br/>The main goal of this research was to predict the expansion degree of GAC in the water phase. In order to achieve this goal, two innovative approaches combining advanced laboratory techniques and prediction models was the course of action. The first approach was the development of an input model known as the AquaGAC model, to describe the different characteristics of porous media and perform checks using calculated and measured hydraulic parameters. With the combination of the AquaGAC input model and an existing fluidization model (FBI) that computed the expressions of five classical models, the prediction of porosity of the performed experiments was achieved. The second approach consisted on using a data driven model, which consisted on the combination of the outputs the FBI and AquaGAC models with several morphological parameters to derive empirical expressions that accurately estimated the external porosity. <br/><br/>Obtained results suggest that using the 10th percentile of the particle diameter in classical models, delivers porosity prediction errors of 10% in comparison to the 50th percentile used in practice with errors up to 25%. Based on symbolic regression, data driven models produced expressions with accurate correlations with porosity errors ranging from 2-5%. <br/><br/>The results of this research are encouraging as the AquaGAC input model can serve as a basis for other fluidization models that use porous media with different shapes. Recommendations are made to improve the experimental set-up, the accuracy in estimating the particle envelope and wet densities, and the quantitative evaluation of the orientation. Future research of the expansion behavior of mixtures is also recommended.<br","activated carbon; Fluidization; drinking water treatment","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Water Management","",""

Sleeping and relaxing are the highest performed activities inside an airplane during cruise flight, however this is scored lowest on comfort. To increase passenger comfort on long-haul flights a better sleeping facility has to be provided by airlines. An extensive literature research along with gathering of relevant information resulted in a list of requirements the Economy Class Sleeping Facility had to fulfill. These requirements together with the knowledge from gathered information were taken into account during the ideation phase. Out of these ideas 2 ideas proved to be possible to turn into a viable product meeting all requirements. These ideas were subsequently turned into concepts by evaluating measurements to check if they were indeed as promising as expected from the ideation phase. A life size prototype was built to make it possible to test both concepts with potential users. This user test performed with 10 participants generated several insights which led to changes to the concepts. Subsequently, concepts were compared and evaluated by using a Harris-Profile to see if they met all requirements formulated from the analysis phase. From this evaluation 1 concept turned out to have the most potential and was chosen to developed into a full design. The final design consists of the Economy Class Sleeping Facility, but also took into account the whole economy class interior it should be placed in. A final evaluation was performed to evaluate the design and form recommendations. This final evaluation is done by an online questionnaire filled in by 204 participants, with 184 relevant responses. <br/>This all resulted in the final design of the Economy Class Sleeping Facility. This Economy Class Sleeping Facility is unique because it offers beds that transform into seats which need to be used during taxi, take-off and landing. This all without occupying extra space, by applying the proposed lay-out capacity of the Flying V even increases with 3 passengers. The beds have a length of 193cm, which means that the majority of people can lay down fully flat while flying. Inside the cabin passengers have their own control panel controlling airflow, lights and the curtains which create privacy. Next to that each bed is equipped with a personal In-Flight Entertainment system. Out of 184 people who evaluated the design, aged between 17 and 75, 69,57% indicated they would use the bed system as presented to sleep during a long-haul flight. Also, participants rated the expected comfort of the beds with an average of 4,45 out of 7. While experienced comfort of sleeping in economy class seats was rated 2,63 out of 7. This shows a large increase in passenger comfort offered by the Economy Class Sleeping Facility.","Aircraft; interior; Sleeping cabin; Flying V; bed; airplane; Comfort; Passenger Comfort","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

Improved control over the vehicle dynamics has been shown to contribute to substantial reductions in the number of deaths and serious injuries resulting from road traffic crashes. The introduction of Electronic Stability Control yielded impressive improvement in vehicle stability. A meta-analysis revealed that a 49% reduction of single-vehicle accidents is realized. Recent research continues the development of a fully autonomously operating vehicle. The vehicle requires the ability to operate in all situations safely, in order to reach the highest level of automation. Vehicle performance should be guaranteed within, at and beyond the limits of friction. Previous research revealed that the unstable drift motion could enlarge the operating envelope of a vehicle. An extensive amount of research is dedicated to controlling a drift. The results show that control systems are increasingly capable of stabilizing a steady-state cornering scenario. The main limitation of these studies is that only a portion of the vehicle motion that is observed in reality can be considered to be steady-state motion.<br/><br/>This thesis presents a multi-objective trajectory optimization which extends the steady-state analysis to a dynamic driving scenario. Based on experimental data obtained with a 1:10 scaled vehicle, accurate vehicle and tire models are derived. It is validated that the models closely mimic the dynamics of the scaled vehicle. In order to justify the use of drifting, the differences between stable and unstable driving equilibria are studied. The stability and controllability are assessed through the construction of the phase portraits and the computation of the Controllability Grammian. The findings, obtained under the assumption of steady-state conditions, are then validated in the dynamic driving scenario. A two-step optimization approach is presented. Spline optimization based on a simplified model is used to obtain initial conditions for a high fidelity model-based optimization. The scope is limited to a single corner, which is optimized under varying velocities and friction conditions. <br/><br/>Under the assumption of steady-state conditions, it is found that the drift motion imposes various benefits over normal driving. Higher cornering velocities and therewith yaw rates can be achieved in a drift. Besides, the principles of tire saturation and force coupling allow for controlling the lateral and yaw dynamics of the vehicle through the rear longitudinal tire force. This increases the maneuverability of the vehicle. The results of the dynamic optimization extend the findings of the steady-state analysis. In the dynamic maneuvers, drifting is found to improve vehicle maneuverability at high velocities and in scenarios of low friction. The approach presented in this work forms a basis for studying the effects that drifting could have on vehicle motion in reality. The relevant aspects of vehicle motion are translated into a multi-objective optimization. The methods that are developed in this work release the simplifying assumption of steady-state driving conditions. As a result, the drift motion can be studied in a more realistic driving scenario. It is expected that through further improving the optimization algorithm, the full operation envelope of the vehicle can be explored.","Multi-objective optimization; Drifting; Splines; Parameter Identification; vehicle dynamics; Trajectory optimization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

Developing a good conceptual design for a building is important because it can save a great amount of time and resources over the entire building process. This report discusses the project StructuralComponents 6, a continuation of the ongoing project StructuralComponents which focuses on the development of computational tools for conceptual building design. The goal of StructuralComponents 6 is to develop a tool for the conceptual design of mid-rise concrete buildings laterally supported by shear walls. The tool allows the user to digitally construct a prismatic, rectangular building design with a custom number and arrangement of shear walls, and performs structural validation of any given design in terms of stiffness, strength and stability. The project is split into three phases. 1) The conceptual design process is studied, and a framework of a conceptual design tool is developed. 2) A calculation method is developed that can be applied to a flexible number and arrangement of shear walls, assuming the shear walls are connected by infinitely-rigid floors. 3) The tool is implemented using Python and Grasshopper. A case study is performed to determine the applicability of the tool to real-life building design. It is concluded that the rigid-floor calculation method is adequate for the design of buildings with minimal out-of-plane floor effects (i.e. buildings with pre-cast floors). Through the case study, it is shown that the tool can be successfully applied to a building with a complex arrangement of shear walls.","parametric design; conceptual design; Grasshopper; structural analysis; computational design; concrete structure","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Building Engineering","",""

The workload for specialists is increasing (Rossen, 2018), the current health path for patients is extended and long (van Tongerloo, 2019) and more general practitioners do not want to have their own practice which results in lower accessibility (Smit, 2019). Besides, the computer is often in-between the communication of the patient and the specialist when entering the consultation room (Voormolen, 2013). These developments are opposite to the ones of the on-demand society we are currently living in: people have personalised information on-demand and expect companies to understand their needs and wants on the spot (Solis, 2017). However, healthcare is, at this point, behind. The Erasmus MC has noticed this gap, and therefore, the Erasmus MC wants to implement the value-based healthcare strategy. Within this strategy, the Erasmus MC wants to focus more on the patient experience and the patient’s participation in decision making during the consultation (Kimpen, 2019). So how to improve this patient experience, to align the consultation with the value-based healthcare system? Within this project, the current barriers of positive patient experience, before, during and after the consultation, are defined by an extensive literature and user study. The concept proposal, the renewed patient portal of the Erasmus MC, aims to translate these barriers into enablers of a positive patient experience. The renewed patient portal exists out of three elements: improve the patient’s knowledge around a disease by giving personalised information (1), track the patient’s data to get more personalised care (2), and prepare the consultation to start the conversation to the point (3). A case study for diabetes type 1 patients, focussed on the second element of the renewed patient portal, shows a tangible example of how the patient’s data can be used to give more personalised and on-demand care. The final deliverable of the case study is Mijn Erasmus I.D., a visual representation of the patient’s mental and physical data. Mijn Erasmus I.D. is a digital patient I.D. that is accessible via a platform for the patient and an interactive screen in the consultation room. An extensive validation study has proven that Mijn Erasmus I.D. turns all the found barriers into enablers of the positive patient experience. The aimed longterm effect is to create a more in-depth and personal conversation, within the same amount of time. Mijn Erasmus I.D. allows the specialists to understand the perspective of the patient better within the given amount of time by gathering the patient’s information up-front. An understanding of the patient’s perspective contributes to better health outcomes at a physical, psychological and social level (Street, Makoul, Arora, &amp; Epstein, 2009). The research, the design goal, the concept proposal (the renewed patient portal) and the case study (Mijn Erasmus I.D.) are evenly important to inspire healthcare for future innovation.","patient experience; future of healthcare; communication","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-09-27","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

In this study, a pneumatic control system was designed that decreased the activation forces and where proprioceptive feedback was provided. The system was placed on the back of the user and was actuated by shoulder movements. The design has been evaluated on two aspects, namely the sensitivity, determined by the Just Noticeable Difference (JND) and the Weber Fraction (WF), and the displacement (re-)production accuracy (e.g. opening/closing of the prosthetic hand). Ten healthy, right-handed male subjects performed both experiments. The sensitivity was assessed by a reminder task where two forces were compared. Four reference force levels were used: 2, 4, 6, and 8N. This resulted in WF values of: 18% for 2N, 4% for 4N, 3% for 6N, and 2% for 8N. The results for the three higher forces agreed with literature. To evaluate the displacement accuracy the Absolute Displacement Error (ADE), the Relative Displacement Error (RDE), and the Displacement Variability (DV) were measured for three different reference displacements: 5mm, 10mm, and 20mm. The results show that the control of the system is accurate enough for object manipulation and the relative error was lower than 1% for each reference displacement.

When the environment has reduced stability margins, reflexes are tempered due to the oscillations caused by the neural time delay of the reflexive pathways. An explanation is that reflexes adapt to the dynamics of the environment and stability margins are the constraint. This view requires that humans assess stability margins, which could happen by detecting changes (i.e. oscillations) in the perturbation eliciting the reflexes. The perturbation perceived by the human is the actual perturbation filtered by the dynamics of the environment. Therefore, changes in the stability of the environment influence the perceived perturbation. The goal of this study is to determine whether reflex modulation is triggered by the environmental dynamics (i.e. damping and stability margins) or by the properties of the perturbation eliciting a reflexive response. An experiment was designed where participants were asked to minimize the displacements caused by continuous force perturbations applied to the hand while interacting with different environmental dynamics. Some of the perturbations were prefiltered to mimic the filtering effect of the environmental dynamics. Variations in the dynamics of the shoulder joint were quantified through the estimated arm admittance (i.e. displacements in response to force perturbations). The results show variations in the admittance between the perturbations mimicking the environment and the true environment at low frequencies (below 5Hz); and for different prior knowledge about the environmental dynamics (below 2Hz). These variations indicate that perturbations can be designed to mimic the environmental dynamics, and that perturbation properties and stability constraints cause changes in the motor behaviour.","Motor control; Reflex; Afferent feedback; Proprioception; Stability; Admittance; Perturbation design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Not every Internet user however has benign intentions. Cybercriminals use this technology for their own personal gain, by creating malicious software with the objective to compromise and even control the devices of unsuspecting victims. After devices have been infected with malicious software, they will be controlled by a central networking infrastructure, or Command and Control (C&amp;C). Numerous studies have developed detection methods to find the commanding servers behind these attacks – which is important for locally implemented anti-virus software – but the infrastructures behind these attacks is only uncovered after these malicious servers have been taken down. We have collaborated with one of the largest Tier 1 Internet Service Providers and have collected ~4Tb of global NetFlow traffic consisting of daily connections made worldwide, giving us the possibility to analyze malicious infrastructures from a new perspective. This dataset allowed us to evaluate one of the most promising data sources to uncover and analyze adversarial C&amp;C infrastructures; open source cyber threat intelligence. After having introduced a taxonomy to evaluate this intelligence, and having assessed the defensive advantages users will gain when adopting these information feeds, we came to the conclusion that – even though advertised differently – this intelligence only provides a small fragment of the total picture. For this reason we have decomposed Internet networking infrastructures into three categories in which Internet devices can be divided, computer clients, Internet of Things (or IoT ) and routers, and use a machine learning driven methodology to paint the threat landscape of the tactics, techniques and procedures adversaries employ within these three categories. When looking into infections on clients, a numerous amount of different structures can be observed which cybercriminals use to hide their infrastructure like round-robin DNS or interesting server hopping sequences. When learning these patterns, we successfully use a combination of machine learning and statistical functions to complement threat intelligence feeds. Where these feeds during the course of 2018 only show 1,105 malicious servers, we find that there are more than 188,000 malicious servers in our dataset. A more recent addition to the Internet are smart, or IoT, devices like surveillance cameras, which have proven to be incredibly vulnerable. In an analysis we report on the scale and impact of the first IoT based malware, Mirai, and its variants during the start of 2018. 1 in every 2,345 scanned and brute forced devices is successfully infected with a Mirai variant. This poses a great attack vector, taking into account that there are about 7 billion IoT devices as of 2019. For our last analysis we have focused on a firmware vulnerability towards MikroTik routers which cybercriminals have exploited to rewrite outgoing user traffic and embed cryptomining code in every outgoing connection. Accordingly, for every web page visited they can use the computation power of the victims computer to mine for the cryptocurrency Monero. We report on the tactics, techniques and procedures, and coordinating infrastructure of the adversaries, which had control of up to 1.4M routers over a period of 10 months, which is approximately 70% of all global MikroTik devices. Our work shows that an entire world of possibilities emerge in terms of network security when able to analyze NetFlow data. In the ongoing battle against cybercrime, anti-virus companies try to outsmart adversaries by using novel device based detection techniques. This is an evident rat-race between defenders and attackers. We have shown that ISP providers could play a big role in this, by analyzing NetFlow data flowing through their routers to perform detection of malicious behavior based on previous misuse and cyber threat intelligence.","Cyber Threat Intelligence; cybercrime; cybersecurity; Command and Control; NetFlow","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-04-01","","","","Computer Science | Data Science and Technology","",""

This research investigates Key ‘Lead’ Indicators (KLIs) and provides suggestions on how to measure and influence them in the future large rail infrastructure projects. These ‘Lead’ Indicators are forward-looking performance metrics, unlike the ‘Lag’ indicators, and can forecast the deviation in the project performance at an early stage. Building on existing insights from theory on lead indicators, it asks: How can Key Lead Indicators be used to improve project performance of inner-city rail infrastructure projects across Europe? The research is performed through a combination of mixed qualitative research methods including literature review, case studies and an expert consultation meeting. From the literature review, it is observed that all the identified lead indicators tend towards negative aspects or events in a project. However, the research considered the indicators to be neutral which can help to forecast both positive and negative aspects of a project. The results of the literature review reveal that Design Change, Communication, Decision Making, Level of Experience, Mood, Attitude, Commitment, Conflicts, Trust, Criticism and certain External indicators are the most important and frequently repeated KLIs. Based on the literature results and three case studies each one from Sweden, Netherlands and Austria respectively, interviewees from each case are asked to respond to the questions framed in order to identify the KLIs from practice. The results of the analysis confirm that almost all KLIs observed from literature are similarly observed in practice. Level of Experience of the project personnel and Close Stakeholder Engagement are found to be the most frequently repeating KLIs across all the projects. It is concluded that in order to improve the performance of future LIPs, the identified KLIs should be responded at the earliest by measuring and influencing them. Broadly, more attention should be paid on improving the recruitment process, prioritizing client’s requirements, empowering stakeholders, improving personal relationships and creating positive project environments. A detailed set of recommendations is provided as starting points to enable the required change. This research contributes to scientific knowledge of lead indicators in project management by enriching the concepts of KLIs and discovering steps to measure and influence them.

Considering the sudden boom in PV systems, several IT firms invested heavily in the creation of online PV system sizing tools for customers worldwide. This was done to ease the calculation process of sizing a Solar System. However, a deep study and analysis of the various available system sizing tools in the market proved that none of the tools independently satisfied all the constraints. Some tools could be used specifically for economic feasibility analysis, while others could be used for just dimensioning purposes. There was always a shortcoming in every software tool. Hence, there raised a need to come up with a dedicated tool that could satisfy all the constraints. This thesis aims to develop one such tool which could incorporate certain proven modelling techniques in order to provide optimistic results. At first, accurate solar insolation data is obtained for the purpose of initial DC side energy yield calculation of the PV system. Succeeding this, chosen transposition and thermal models are used for the calculation of optimal tilt and optimal azimuth of the PV Modules. In addition. the battery is sized and the charge controller is modelled. Subsequently, a comparative study between Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) and Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) techniques of charge controllers which gives insight on the pros and cons of using each type of charge controller technology is performed. In addition, system sizing of a Solar-Diesel Hybrid System is done followed by an economic analysis which includes the calculation of Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) and Payback Time. Finally, the system sizing was validated with an actual test system which gives insight into the practical differences between the site conditions and the theoretical conditions.","Photovoltaic Systems; system sizing tool; transposistion modelling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-09-27","","","","","",""

This is investigated using an experimental apparatus, in which a wing model is accelerated from rest and the transient TE flow is analysed using high-speed Particle Image Velocimetry techniques. Initially, fluid moves from the airfoil’s pressure side, along the TE, towards the suction side, and a boundary layer is created. Then, boundary layer stagnation occurs, a vortex separates from the TE, and a transformation in the presence and locations of stagnation/separation occurs.

In many of these operations the precise localization and positioning is quite important, especially in cases that the robot must navigate between man-made installations. Although underwater vehicles can carry a number of different sensors, many of them can not be exploited for efficient navigation, due to costs, complexity, weight and inaccuracy. Most of robots feature at least one camera, a sensor that can be cheap, small, with low power requirements and that offers vast amount of information. The advances in computer vision and embedded systems have set cameras as an attractive mean for navigation. This combination allows computer vision as a viable alternative to provide data in real-time. This data can be used locally as a positioning source for the own robot control system, or to inform the navigation coordinates to an observer<br/>or another system. Visual Odometry (VO) is the process of estimating the position and orientation of a robot based completely on data acquired by cameras. The camera-only system can be enhanced with the fusion of an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) to estimate motion even more accurately, resulting in Visual Inertial Odometry (VIO). This thesis researches various approaches for underwater navigation with edge computing and focuses on systems that utilize a camera and an IMU. A VIO system architecture is proposed, comprised by a machine vision camera, an IMU, a micro-controller and the embedded system Jetson Xavier from NVIDIA. Some of the most recent VO/VIO algorithms are evaluated on a number of underwater datasets and the impact of the IMU on their performance is assessed. Design issues are discussed and challenges related to the camera - IMU fusion are analyzed. The Visual-Inertial ORB-SLAM (ORB-SLAM + IMU) algorithm is deployed on the proposed VIO system and is optimized on the embedded GPU. The whole framework is evaluated on an artificial underwater structured environment which was created in an indoor tank. While the outcome of the algorithm on motion estimation is examined, the computational performance of the embedded system is profiled for various power modes as well. Results show that the proposed VIO system is able to estimate the underwater robot’s traversed trajectory in the tank with adequate accuracy and that can execute the Visual-Inertial ORB-SLAM in real-time with sufficient speed.","Visual odometry; visual SLAM; underwater robots; Embedded systems","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-09-30","","","","Electrical Engineering | Embedded Systems","",""

The new probing technique uses an on-wafer cavity-backed slot to couple the signal to a tapered structure in an open-ended waveguide which is held above the cavity, and acts as a fully shielded transition from the transverse electromagnetic mode of the planar stripline to the fundamental transverse electric mode of the waveguide. The on-wafer structure used for the transition is limited to the back-end-of-line of the process, and is shielded from the ill-characterised substrate. The transition achieves an insertion loss of &lt;1.8 dB across the entire 220-325 GHz band and does not require galvanic contact with the die. The layout for the on-wafer structure has been designed for a 0.25 µm SiGe process and a simplified version has been used for a simulated sample measurement using the thru-reflect-line calibration algorithm. Due to coupling to nearby structures, the novel probing technique show significant improvement over the standard coplanar probes only when a chip area greater than the cross-section of the open-ended waveguide is reserved. Simulated measurement of an independent passive structure show a reduction of the average worst case bound from 0.041 to 0.017 in the 220-325 GHz band.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-12-31","","","","","",""

The sector emits 39% of the global CO2 and is responsible of 40-50% of material flows. The focus of reducing the environmental impact in buildings is, in the past, mostly attributed to the operational energy. However, due to increasing renewables and efficiency, that share is declining. Making the embodied impact in a building relatively more significant. The structure encompass the largest part of the embodied impact in buildings. The materials, components, and systems embedded in a structure are often still of high value when the building reaches its end of life, i.e. the technical service life is not yet achieved. To reduce the environmental impact of structures and therefore buildings as a whole, one should integrate design measures for new constructions to grasp the most value out of the incurred embodied impact. Three eco-effective structural design criteria are established that encapsulate the structure's whole life cycle - material environmental costs (product and construction stage), service life (use stage), and residual value (end of life and benefits beyond system boundary stage). These structural design criteria are merged from the following structural design perspectives - material selection and material use (material environmental costs); durability, maintenance, adaptability, and flexibility (service life); and waste effectiveness, disassembly, reusability, and recyclability (residual value). In the eco-effective paradigm, one focuses on the future value of a product. This may entail that more material environmental costs could be made, but in the end you will be rewared with either a longer service life or more residual value. Therefore, the emphasis is put on the latter two structural design criteria. A crucial bottleneck of not attaining the technical service life of a structure on a building level, is the functional service life. The functional service life should be equalized with the technical service life to grasp the full potential of a building structure. Three strategies have been constructed based on the structural design perspectives and the structural design criteria. Design for Durability; thus, equalizing the functional service life with maximization of the technical service life. For this strategy, it is imperative that solely one function will inhabit the building. Examples are churches, temples, museums, i.e. buildings with a sentimental and/or historical value. The second strategy is Design for Multifunctionality. This is for buildings that have proven not to stand the test of time. Therefore, conditions should be created in the structure that it could be possible for the function to be converted (n functional service life = technical service life). These two strategies are on a building level. The following strategy is on equalizing the functional and technical service life on a component level. This is done by Designing for Disassembly. In this strategy, it is known that the service life of the building relatively small. These eco-effective structural design strategies can be used by structural engineers during the conceptual design to reduce the environmental impact on the long-term.","Structural Design; Eco-effectiveness; Circular Design Strategies; Material Environmental Costs; Service life; Residual Value; Durability; Multifunctionality; Disassembly","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

This leads to unwanted noise and vibrations on board, which reduces passenger comfort, and increases the underwater signature of naval ships. The influence of different cavitation regimes on propellers and boundary layer transition on wings, has led to studies that isolate the cavitating tip vortex. This is done by using a converging-diverging nozzle (Venturi tube) geometry, combined with a suitable inflow condition to simulate a cavitating line vortex. The currently available computational power allowed for a comparative study of SRS methods (i.e. the IDDES model) and RANS models (i.e. the k − ω SST and EARSM) in wetted and cavitating vortex conditions. Both the general flow field, as well as the dynamics of the cavity deformations in the vortex were analyzed in this thesis. The geometry was selected based on the available experimental validation data for the wetted flow case, whereby preliminary studies determined the inflow and outflow lengths of the domain. A Lamb-Oseen tangential velocity profile was specified at the inlet. The vortex strength and viscous core size were tuned to obtain similar inflow conditions as in the experimental measurements, which used a fixed-blade swirl generator to generate the line vortex. The flow field in the wetted vortex case demonstrated an excessive amount of viscous diffusion of the vortex for both RANS models.This was caused by the overproduction of modeled turbulent kinetic energy at the viscous core edge. EARSM resuls were verified in a grid- and time step refinement study, however the large modeling error in the viscous core prevented the validation of the results. The IDDES model results were closer to the experimental reference, but were obtained with an almost laminar flow field. Modeled turbulence was mostly dissipated and no resolved velocity fluctuations were present in the flow at the measurement section. In the cavitating vortex simulations, numerical diffusion of the EARSM led to a more diffuse vapor core interface and a more downstream development of the vortex cavity compared to IDDES, where the flow field remained predominantly laminar at the measurement section. Both EARSM and IDDES predicted a solid-body rotation of the vapor core, combined with an increase of radial velocity towards the vapor core edge. The non-negligible radial velocity resulted in a conical cavity shape. The velocity profile of the simulated line vortex therefore did not correspond to that of a cavitating Lamb-Oseen vortex (which assumes no radial velocity components), such that the simulated line vortex was not representative of a cavitating tip vortex. he sheet cavities originating from sharp edges at the front and end of the Venturi throat strongly influenced the flow field and cavity dynamics. The developed front sheet cavity determined the streamwise inception of the vapor core of the vortex. Periodic shedding and collapse of the irregular downstream sheet cavity caused axial and radial contractions of the vapor core<br/>as well as a noncircular deformation of the cavity cross-section. No traveling or standing Kelvin waves could be identified on the cavity interface using the developed post-processing and spectral analysis tool. The identified cross-sectional deformation did not correspond to cavity deformation modes defined in previous research and none of the other deformation modes were found to occur. Grid-dependent solutions, numerical noise and large wavenumber resolution indicated that a finer grid is required and that the analyzed length of the cavity should increase to improve the quality of numerical analyses of simulated cavity dynamics.","Turbulence modeling; Cavitating tip vortex noise; Cavity dynamics; Venturi; Swirling flow; spectral analysis; ReFRESCO","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Marine Technology","",""

Data marketplaces have emerged as a new form of data-driven business models which enable trading of data between the data owners/providers and data consumers by providing the necessary technological and non-technological infrastructure. These features present an alternative to the cumbersome logistics currently involved in searching, buying and selling data; thus, simplify the data supply chains between the data-driven business entities. However, they suffer to take off into mainstream success because of a myriad of reasons. Of all the reasons, 2 of them are focused in this thesis. Firstly, the difficulty involved in architecturally enabling a data marketplace platform as the prospective enabling technologies are still immature. Secondly, the uncertainty associated with the commodification of data which comprises of the intellectual property enforcement of data (data ownership), privacy and confidentiality breach (threats), regulatory ignorance (implication of GDPR), reluctance of businesses from participating because of the previous reasons et cetera. This reason is collectively referred as due to the uncertainty around the threat landscape of the data marketplaces. Multi-Party Computation (MPC) technology provide a solution to these problems. Through its capabilities to preserve the confidentiality of data architecturally and thereby securing the interests of the data actors with respect to the uncertainty of the threat landscape around data, MPC can enable safe and secure data sharing between data actors. This characteristic of MPC can help data marketplaces to overcome their challenges and foster their realisation. However, since MPC cannot handle the scale of real-life application, it is not mature enough yet to be incorporated into real-life data marketplaces. An EU funded project called SafeDEED: Safe Data-Enabled Economic Development, proposes to overcome the scalability issue and intends to achieve the maturation of MPC for real-life application. Building upon this forecast, a research was conducted to investigate the implication of the maturation of MPC technology towards the 2 problems faced by data marketplaces, architectural and threat landscape; and the same is documented in this thesis.","Data Marketplaces; Multi-Party Computation; Secure Data Trading; Cyber Threat Modelling; High-Level Architecture; Business Threat Framing; Technology Adoption; Data-Driven Business; Exploratory Study; Qualitative Research; Inductive Reasoning; Hypotheses Development; Expert Judgment","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","Safe-DEED",""

As per current practice, such vessels are designed for fatigue using inhouse software with a nominal stress approach supported by static sea-state scatter data and judgement based operational profiles. <br/>Recently, new data sources with real time sea-state data over the whole globe have come available, including GPS locations of ships. Together, this enables it to generate real time operational profiles for its ships. A total stress concept has been developed based on results from a JIP called VOMAS.

Similar results are expected for steel joints as well. <br/>The main goal of this thesis was to explore possible improvements for the fatigue design methodology. A tool called Tanaav was developed for this purpose which makes use of both remote monitoring data and the total stress concept and provides an estimate of the yearly fatigue damage and fatigue lifetime. The tool has been used to predict the fatigue lifetime for three fatigue sensitive details in 46 FCS5009 vessels.

The use of the maturity levels is limited in the pre-determined description. This research is an attempt to foresee the effect of different management maturity towards asset cost and performance by using Dynamic Bayesian Network. The network is developed by using a semi-hypothetical case on grass revetment management. The network models the maintenance process which covers the asset degradation and the influence of different extent of management towards grass condition in time. The degradation probability was determined by using Cooke’s classical model expert judgment. We designed different network involving four management dimension that was translated as model scenarios.

This research focuses on synthesis of a firm population for urban freight transport demand model.

The model is then implemented on a case study on the province of South Holland. The utilized data is open, free-of-charge data offered by the Central Bureau for Statistics (CBS) of The Netherlands. The synthesis uses a sample-free, indicator-based approach to initialize the IPU-based model. The results show correlation between firms’ distribution and urban density of neighborhoods for most of the population. However, the suitability of a neighborhood to host a firm type has a more nuanced definition that cannot be encapsulated in a single indicator.

By likening an unfamiliar context to one we are more familiar and experienced with, it becomes relatable and easier to navigate. With its wealth of sensory stimuli, the kitchen space offers enormous opportunities for the creation of such metaphors. At the same time, the act of cooking is riddled with sensory “black boxes ”: Moments in which little to no information is available to the senses. In the kitchen, those are often caused by literal boxes: Ovens, microwaves, fridges, etc. Whenever these moments occur, the cooking process moves beyond sensory reach. Being deprived of any direct means of probing food throughout the process presents a significant challenge: Clues that would otherwise inform decisions and provide reassurance are no longer intuitively available. The lack of tangible, practical information is a core challenge for the development of future kitchen appliances. This thesis explores multimodality as a tool to resolve the difficulties users are currently experiencing. Multimodal interactions describe interactions that make use of multiple senses at once. By investigating the roles different senses play in human perception, this project builds a repertoire of engaging communication tools. Various techniques are developed to frame information in multisensory ways. By tailoring these techniques to their context of use, they can elicit experiences that are situationally relevant and enjoyable to the user. Using the findings of the multimodal explorations, this thesis developed a concept using haptic, spatial, and visual modalities. The interface of an oven was altered to guide users towards helpful and relevant information. This was done by including a multimodal dial into an oven's display unit. The dial uses its repertoire to expose information on ongoing processes that would typically be out of reach to users . By modulating its stiffness and texture it can, for example, tangibly inform users about the cooking progress. This three-dimensional, dynamic exploration of evolving processes helped users understand their choices and increased their confidence and enjoyment throughout the experience. For a luxury kitchen manufacturer such as Gaggenau developing interfaces that bridge the gap between the sensory, physical world and the digital future of technology is of great importance. This thesis hopefully contributes insights that will help Gaggenau shape the future of the kitchen.","Multimodality; Home Appliances; Interface; Metaphoric Design; HCI; Kitchen; Technology","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

The evaluation of missing capacity can be classified by the area of study, i.e. single or multi-area, and by the capacity expansion source, i.e. generation and/or interconnection capacity expansion.

To study the jetting process and optimize the dredging devices, the moving vertical water jet penetrating cohesive soil experiments were carried out by Nobel (2013). However, in terms of the design optimization for the dredging devices, it is not easy to change the jet scale and soil properties during the experiment due to time and economic constraints. Some detailed physics during the jetting process, e.g. pressure on the soil surface and shear plane inside the soil during jetting, were also not monitored during the experiment. Therefore, numerical simulation is chosen to optimize the design of dredging devices and study the physics of the jetting process. A CFD (computational fluid dynamics) numerical model is built to simulate the moving jet penetrating cohesive soil. The soil is modeled as a Bingham plastic. The sediment transport is modeled by using drift-flux model. The moving jet modeling is achieved by using dynamic mesh algorithms AMI (arbitrary mesh interface) and A/R (cell layer addition removal). The CFD numerical model has been validated with the experiment of Nobel. After the validation, an analysis of the jetting process based on this CFD model is accomplished proving that the CFD model can reveal the details of the soil failure process during jetting. This thesis work reveals that it is possible to describe the hydraulic excavation of cohesive soil with reasonable accuracy using CFD numerical model. The CFD model can also reveal the details of the soil failure process that could not be retrieved from the experiment. Since the model is generic, it can be applied for a jet bar with multiple nozzles.

Recently, drone races have also gone fully-autonomous. As a result, these agile robotic platforms not only pose challenges of flying fast to the participating pilots but also create challenges for the flight control computers. As a result, the concept of autonomous drone racing has gained significant attention from research groups around the world. These races aim to push the boundaries of perception and control algorithms, while simultaneously mitigating the real-world uncertainty of execution on autonomous systems. While perception algorithms face challenges due to limited feature detection, high motion blur and computational requirements, control algorithms face challenges of convergence to the desired trajectories that are planned out in the race arena. <br/>This thesis addresses the challenge of control for racing, which is responsible for guiding the drone to design and track desired trajectories for fast flights. The control sub-modules of racing drones are responsible for generating trajectories for fastest possible flights and also for obeying these generated commands. Additionally, the requirement of limited algorithm complexity is added to match the philosophy of computationally efficient algorithms at the Micro Air Vehicle Laboratory. However, to address the requirements of these control sub-modules, the prerequisite of accurate state estimation always persists. Assigning control actions to a robot without information on the current state of the robot is rather unwise. As a result, this thesis first aims to perform accurate state estimation before designing controllers for time-optimal trajectory tracking. Again, another constraint of using only a single sensor (i.e. the Inertial Measurement Unit) is added to make the drone race in GPS denied environments. As a result, the goal of the thesis is two-fold i.e. making accurate state estimators while using limited sensors and designing optimal controllers for taking the quickest trajectory through the arena. To achieve the goal of accurate state estimation, existing techniques are studied. Several features from each of these methods are selected to design a new estimator. To achieve the goal of time-optimal trajectory generation, firstly, the flaws of traditional control methods are pointed out. A new optimal-control technique is proposed, which makes use of fundamental principles dating back several decades. This principle is then fused along with present-day optimization solvers. Finally, the proposed state estimation and control algorithm are compared against prior (benchmarked) techniques in the area. Compared to existing optimal control techniques, the proposed algorithm leads to faster trajectories and consumes less computational power onboard.","drone-racing; optimal-control; state-estimation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-03-31","","","","","",""

Acceptable overtopping limits are usually based on the mean overtopping discharge or the maximum overtopping volume (EurOtop, 2018). For temporary situations, such as breakwaters under construction, overtopping limits are not clearly defined. This complicates the choice for a working crest level, where the safety of staff and equipment on the partially constructed breakwater is the main concern.<br/>In this study, OpenFOAM in combination with the waves2foam toolbox (Jacobsen et al., 2012) is used to model wave overtopping over a breakwater under construction to identify the flow characteristics (i.e. the flow depth and velocity) caused by overtopping waves. The aim of the study is to provide a method to define a safe working level for rubble mound breakwaters under construction, based on the tolerable flow depth and velocity. The safety of the staff and equipment is expressed in limit functions. The method of Sandoval (2016) is applied to define the limit function for workers safety on the breakwater under construction (based on combinations of flow depth and velocity). The safety of the hydraulic excavators is mainly based on the overtopping flow depth, e.g. the flow depth should not exceed the cabin-level.<br/>2D physical model test results on a partially constructed breakwater are processed in order to obtain benchmark data to validate the numerical model. Once the numerical model was validated, a numerical test program was set up that varied the wave height, wave steepness and the relative freeboard, in order to investigate the dependence of the overtopped flow depth and velocity on the varied conditions. A JONSWAP spectrum was used to simulate 8 different wave fields of 250 waves. On the crest of the numerical breakwater, the flow depth and velocity are measured by means of equally spaced gauges and probes in order to describe the flow behavior.<br/>Overtopping events due to the irregular wave train are statistically analysed in terms of flow depth and velocity. The empirical 2% exceedance values are considered as design parameters as these can be compared to existing literature on impermeable and smooth dikes, to highlight the effects of the partially finished and permeable structure.<br/>Empirical relations between the investigated parameters and the overtopping flow depth and velocity on the core crest edge of the breakwater are presented. It is found that the maximum flow depth reduces exponentially over the crest. The reduction appears less strong when saturation of the crest material starts to play a role. The flow velocity increases over the crest for the cases with larger initial flow depths and/or flow detachment from the breakwater crest edge, in contrast to the formulas for dike cross sections. This latter phenomenon was explained by the acceleration caused by the redirection of the flow on the breakwater crest. From the numerical results, two distinct areas of the unconstructed breakwater crest can be identified: a “transition zone” where the flow is detached from the breakwater crest and a “flow zone” with attached flow where the limit functions are valid.<br/>Based on the numerical findings, empirical guidance is given for the land-based workability of breakwaters under construction. It is shown how the newly developed empirical formulas can be applied in practice to determine a safe working level. It is noted that the maximum overtopping flow depth and flow velocity do not necessarily occur at the same moment. A method is introduced that shows how the safety can be assessed using a combinational number for the flow depth and flow velocity (based on numerical modelling) and the stability limit for people. It is shown how a safe working level can be found based on exceedance values of safety limits.","Rubble mound breakwater; Wave overtopping; OpenFOAM; Safety; Workability","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","",""

Alzheimer related transcripts and proteins demonstrate that within a biological level the abundance values are quite similar for all brain regions, but large differences are found between the levels. High degree confidence interactions in the transcriptomic level are also different from the proteomic level.

The demand for finding new ways to produce microdroplets has resulted in a challenge to characterize these droplets. The problem becomes especially difficult for microdroplets which are placed on a transparent hydrophilic substrate. Ink-jet printing, Digital microfluidics, DNA synthesis are some of the applications which need topography measurements of low contact angle microdroplets. One application which is of interest is the sample preparation for Cryo Electron Microscopy (cryo-EM). A recent development in the search for efficient sample preparation for cryo-EM is to use hollow microcantilevers (HMC). HMCs can isolate even a single sub-cellular component and help prepare samples confined in a femtoliter droplet. These droplets are dispensed on a hydrophilic Electron Microscopy grid (EM-grid). By controlling the thickness of the water layer on the EM-grid through evaporation, it is possible to make the HMC technology more reliable by reducing sample wastage. However, such a control loop is absent. A real-time topography measurement of such droplets can serve as a control signal which can be used as feedback for a control loop. The objective of this project is to investigate the feasibility of optical methods to measure the topography information of a low contact angle microdroplet. The scope of this project is limited to develop a tool for a droplet which is supported by a glass slide (droplet-on-glass). In a subsequent study, the tool will be tested for droplets supported on grid (droplet-on-grid). An optical interferometry setup is proposed as a solution. A Mach-Zehnder interferometer is built to obtain the experimental fringes. A Single Frame Fourier Transform technique was used to analyze the data and obtain the results. Droplets of glycerol were dispensed on a glow discharged glass slide. Topography of the droplet was obtained until complete evaporation and a detection limit of 165nm was achieved. The accuracy of the method was found by comparing the results obtained with a Bruker White Light Interferometer (Bruker-WLI) in Phase Shifting Interferometry mode. An accuracy of 23\% was observed. The proposed setup had a repeatability of 14.7nm. To measure the reproducibility of the setup, a 3d printed structure which had the same size and shape as that of a droplet was used. The reproducibility of the setup was found to be 19.8nm over three days. Simulations were performed to analyze the effect of filter shape, filter width and the carrier frequency. Based on these findings, steps to measure a droplet-on-grid system with the proposed setup is explained. Further, to test the capabilities of the instrument the evaporation of a large water droplet on a EM-grid was observed using the proposed setup. It was found that the motion of fringe pattern as the droplet evaporates could give a good indication to control the evaporation time of even conventional machines, which do not employ hollow microcantilevers to dispense small droplets. However, final validation of the proposed setup with the cryo-EM is yet to be performed due to time constraints. As a recommendation for future work, new ways of dispensing samples on the EM-grid are explored. The necessary steps required to validate the setup with a cryo-EM are explained. Further, some ways in which the analysis time could be reduced are explored. This will be helpful in developing a software necessary to implement a real-time solution.","Low Contact Angle Droplets; Microdroplet; Fourier Transform Interferometry; Droplet evaporation; Mach-Zehnder Interferometer","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-12-31","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Optomechatronics","",""

To assist in engineering, Model Based System Engineering (MBSE) can be implemented that provides more control and linkage by means of modelling. The implementation process for MBSE is limited described in literature, especially for the TII sector. Desk research helped to understand and characterize the challenges of the TII sector. By means of in-depth interviews with Siemens Mobility engineers next, requirements were developed.

An implementation process was constructed that puts the framework blocks in order and adds more information for implementing MBSE. The main component, the actual modelling, is split up into technical and process modelling. The technical modelling is fed by the choices and interactions of the process modelling. In the implementation process described which framework blocks are important at what moment, as well as update characteristics of the eventually MBSE environment. In the end, the MBSE methodology and the designed process with framework blocks seem promising for maintaining control of future engineering projects.

The innovation phase is the period from invention of a radically new technology until the first market introduction. This research into the first phase develops a model that provides guidance during the innovation phase. The main research question is: How can important factors that help or hinder the development of radically new technologies during the innovation phase be modelled? A literature review, to understand the role of the innovation phase in innovation models, uses papers from several fields of research: S-curve, pattern of development and diffusion, conditions for large-scale diffusion, Strategic Niche Management, Minnesota Innovation Research Program, Fuzzy Front End, and Sectoral Systems of Innovation. A second literature review, to understand characteristics of the innovation phase, is performed, using the same fields of research as in the first literature review, but complemented with more applied research that provides even more empirical data through case studies. All topics of interest from both the innovation models in the first literature review and all claims in the second literature review, come together in the search of factors for the innovation phase. Two case studies are performed: 3D printing and Augmented Reality. Both case studies provide new insights and improvements to the list of factors. The centre of the model is formed by a group of five factors. Those five factors go from Expectations to Strategy to Resource to Knowledge to Product. The Innovator is the self-appointed process owner who wants to create the product. The Innovator tries to manage those five central factors to maximally improve the technology’s chances. There is a special role for Resources, because insufficient focus on this factor results in a complete stop of all development efforts. The four other factors all have influence on the five central factors. It is up to the Innovators to increase help to the five central factors and to decrease any problems. Examples are to use demonstrations to increase expectations or to secure funding, or to deal with a complete lack of demand for the technology, or with laws that prohibit the product from commercialization. An important limitation to the research is the hindsight bias in which the definition of a technology is based on what the technology eventually became. It is also hard to prove a model that is based on factors: the best option is to make it as plausible as possible. The most important recommendations are to add a measurement of the number of Innovators to the innovation phase of the pattern of development and diffusion, to explore the transition from the innovation phase to the market adaptation phase, and to formulate strategies for the innovation phase, based on this model and its factors.","Innovation management; Innovation phase; Pattern of development and diffusion; 3D Printing; Augmented Reality; Factors","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

Surprisingly, researchers present a different picture of AR. They wonder about the functional benefits of AR and the impact of AR applications on customer engagement and buying behavior. There is also a striking lack of empirical evidence. This study aims to close these gaps by being one of the first field experiments in which the impact of AR on user engagement and order value is measured in a live environment. The live environment chosen for this study was a restaurant, as restaurants have been found to engineer their menu to affect order value - so an AR menu with 3D virtual dishes could be developed to manipulate the behavior of participants in the restaurant. The participants found the AR menu to be more representative of the dishes and their portion sizes compared to the regular, paper menu. Unfortunately, this did not translate into an increased order value or NPS score. Second, it was found that Perceived Usability - a dimension of user engagement - had a direct, positive impact on order value in the mediation model presented in this study. With these findings this study provides empirical support for what has been found in user engagement and AR theory. Future studies can further explore this relationship and more interestingly, businesses and researchers can use AR and data analytics to optimize and learn from our relationship with food.","Augmented Reality; User Engagement; Empirical study; Order value; Exploratory factor analysis; AR; Mobile application; Restaurant; food; 3D","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

The current research focuses on the users’ experience with a movie platform. It argues that users satisfaction can only be improved if the conversational recommender system knows the preferences and the Openness to Experience of the users, and therefore gives custom-made recommendations. Specifically, the relationship between the degree of Openness to Experience and serendipitous or accurate recommendations is investigated. The present study demonstrates that overall people low on Openness to Experience significantly prefer accurate suggestions rather than serendipitous ones. Instead, people high on Openness to Experience do not have a significant preference regarding accurate or serendipitous recommendations. Furthermore, to explore whether a conversational recommender system increases user satisfaction, this study explores to what extent the satisfaction of users in recommender system is dependent on (traditional vs. conversational) recommender system mode of interaction.

The literature on innovation management and network economics also recognizes that firms’ innovation strategies can no longer be described by their operational arms-length, rather it can be defined as an ecosystem that crosses a variety of industries. Previously, the networked nature of the organizations have attracted increasing attention among academics. Nevertheless, this heterogeneity in the available literature and the multivocality of the term turns the ‘innovation ecosystem’ concept into a problematic structure, and its implications become indeterminable when sketching successful innovation strategies. This thesis strengthens the idea that a better assessment of the innovation strategy success can only come through enlightening the managers’ decision-making rationale as well as external and internal forces to which they respond. In order to provide pragmatic implications for future practice and novel inquiries for innovation management scholars, this thesis takes a caption of today and scrutinizes the readers understanding of the innovation ecosystem concept. Only after that, it goes into questioning why firms follow certain strategies in the context of innovation ecosystems. The problem addressed in this thesis is how certain factors influence managers’ decision-making rationale in innovation ecosystems. Accordingly, the objective of this thesis is divided into the following four: (i) it analyses what can be considered as an innovation ecosystem; (ii) it identifies innovation ecosystem actors, their roles and strategies they employ; (iii) it analyses managers’ strategic decision-making process in innovation ecosystems; (iv) it distinguishes the factors influencing the decision-making rationale of managers who are pursuing an ecosystem strategy. To fulfil the research goals this thesis approaches the investigation from two different angles: the energy and construction sectors. The explorative nature of the addressed problem is investigated through employing a mixed methodology. First, interviews were conducted with the academics as well as managers from the field. Second a survey-based Multi Criteria Decision-Making method, called Best Worst Method, is employed. The results indicate that in a decreasing order of influence: push for strategic renewal; availability of a new market opportunity; firm’s posture; push for sectoral reconfiguration; innovation culture; access to capital; ecosystem related uncertainties; and legislative impositions are considered influential in managers strategic decision-making rationale. The findings suggest that managers pay great attention to the possibility of a new market opportunity. This drives managers to align their innovation strategies with the greater innovation ecosystem. As opposed to the traditional view, in which sourcing and commercializing value is considered stagnant, in innovation ecosystems, firms create new markets by co-operating with competitors and complementors. This thesis concludes with suggestions for the managers and future research.","Innovation ecosystem; Decision-Making; Market creation; Ecosystems; Innovation Strategy; Co-creation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

To prevent burns from scar formation and contraction, the use of splinting therapy in the early phase of wound healing is considered as an effective non-surgical method. Splinting entails the application of a mechanical load in the opposite direction of the contractile force within the wound, based on the assumption that wound- or scar contraction will be prevented or reduced. However, clinical research provides conflicting evidence on its effectiveness and optimal treatment method. Therefore, the aim of this study was to design an in vitro model to investigate the mechanoresponsive cellular effects of stress on specifically Human Eschar Fibroblasts and their extracellular matrix, in order to confirm or disprove effects of burn splinting. Methods. The two major players of the burn wound model include (1) the fibroblasts, and (2) the novel extracellular matrix they produce. Outcome measures were chosen that directly relate to matrix organization, fibroblast functioning and matrix functioning. Three chronological sub-goals were defined to achieve the goal of designing a burn wound splinting model: (1) Formulating a suitable mechanical stress protocol; (2) Select a system that enables the selected mechanical stress of extensible substrates that facilitate the growth of fibroblasts and their derived extracellular matrix; (3) Create and optimize conditions to culture fibroblasts on an extensible substrate. To successfully reach these goals, the current literature on this subject was evaluated and comparative experiments were executed. Feasibility of the model was tested in a pilot study. Results. The MCB1 stretching apparatus was provided by Association of Dutch Burn Centre as a suitable device, which was modified to fulfill all predefined requirements. Human Eschar fibroblasts and dermal fibroblasts were cultured on custom made silicone culture wells. Cross-linked gelatin-A coating and vitamin C-supplemented culture medium were selected for optimal cell culturing results. A clinically relevant stretching regimen was chosen, given the paucity of available evidence in literature. A pilot study to test the feasibility of the model indicated that both dynamic and static stretching of eschar fibroblasts show a trend towards thicker, denser collagen matrices compared to unstretched conditions. These collagen fibers also showed a greater degree of alignment. However, no definitive conclusions can be drawn since sample size is limited. Conclusion. The model presented in this work constitutes a practical framework to test mechanotransducive processes in burn scars on a cellular and molecular level.

Typical oil recoveries range from 20% to 40% of OIIP under traditional primary and secondary recovery stages. The understanding of the mechanisms that control such complex processes is essential considering the continuously growing worldwide energetic demand. History matching of core flooding experiments data through numerical modeling is a powerful tool to understand the physical parameters and mechanisms that control the flow of fluids in novel recovery strategies as Foam-Assisted Chemical Flooding (FACF) in which the effects of oil/water interfacial tension generated by surfactant are combined with mobility control provided by foam. <br/>This report presents the mechanistic modeling study of seven experiments on different core flooding techniques including continuous gas injection, Water-Alternating-Gas injection (WAG), surfactant injection and Foam-Assisted Chemical Flooding (FACF) on Bentheimer sandstone cores. CT scan images were acquired to monitor the evolution of saturation distributions, starting from the primary drainage stage. A 1D model was built for each experiment to history match the saturations revealed by the CT scan imaging through the cores at different pore volumes injected, pressure drops, production fractions, and oil recovery. Good agreement between simulation results and experiments was obtained, with minor mismatches in breakthrough times (0.04 ± 0.02 PVI) for some experiments. <br/>For the history match of primary drainage and forced imbibition, the parameters of the Brooks-Corey equation for calculating relative permeabilities were obtained from a regression analysis on the available observed data. Actual residual saturations were lower than the average saturations reported at the end of each flooding stage.<br/>History-matching of the continuous gas injection at waterflooding residual oil saturation and WAG at connate water saturation experiments demonstrated that the initial water saturation in secondary and tertiary gas injection strategies is a parameter that greatly controls gas mobility. Gas trapping and its effect on the flooding was confirmed for the WAG experiment. <br/>The mechanistic modeling of surfactant injection at under-optimum salinity conditions showed that the geochemical modeling to determine initial ionic concentrations in the aqueous phase can be neglected in absence of naphthenic acids in the oleic phase, even when alkali is present in the solution. The shape and size of the oil bank formed after mobilization of residual oil are controlled by the proper numerical representation of the phase behavior in the oil/microemulsion system, whilst other features as oil bank velocity are controlled by surfactant adsorption. Relative permeability curves at low trapping numbers (forced imbibition) and high trapping numbers (under-optimum salinity conditions) were obtained. <br/>Finally, history match of the drive foam in FACF led to the conclusion that the local equilibrium model for foam model implemented in UTCHEM may not be able to cover the entire range of possible mechanisms controlling the foam formation, specifically, the mechanism by which foam is generated due to increase in interstitial velocity and local pressure drop in zones of reduced effective porosity near a previously formed oil bank.<br","core flood history match; mechanistic modelling; immiscible gas injection; WAG; FACF; foam; mobility control; EOR; CEOR; Bentheimer sandstone; CT scan","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Petroleum Engineering and Geo-sciences","",""

Carbon capture and storage could be an effective methodology for reducing CO2 emission on a short term due to its relatively mature status. Moreover, carbon utilisation, as a closing the carbon cycle approach, is gaining significant attention on a scientific level and on a public level. A large amount of technical possible directions for CO2 utilisation have been identified and examined. However, the majority of these reaction pathways are focused on the use of pure CO2, leading to a relatively high overall cost for commodity chemicals. It would be beneficial from a cost perspective to integrate the capturing of CO2 with the utilisation and this is the focus of this thesis. <br/><br/>The research described in this thesis is centred around the novel methodology to capture CO2 from flue gases using an aqueous ammonia based solution. Instead of a conventional thermal swing process, hydrogen is used to convert the captured CO2 (in the form of ammonium bicarbonate) towards formate. A distillation process has been developed to basically split the ammonium formate solution in an ammonia solution and a concentrated formic acid solution. This formic acid solution can be used as such or even further converted via hydrogen towards formaldehyde. <br/><br/>It is of importance to note that this pathway has been selected based on in principal known chemical steps but combined in an innovative manner. A theoretical (modelling) approach is combined with an experimental part to achieve proof of principle of all the key steps, leading towards a detailed techno-economic evaluation. A design has been made for a 100 kton of flue gas captured and utilised system. Starting point is the capturing of CO2 from a 6 v/v \% flue gas concentration with a capture efficiency of 90\%. Depending on the methodology used this can lead, after hydrogenation and distillation, to a formic acid product with a concentration between 32 - 37 \% wt. It can be stated that the above described process could be economically feasible, with payback time of 9.3 years and an interest of 8\%. A final production price of formic acid at 400 \euro/tn making the process attractive compared to the market price of formic acid. <br/><br/>Sensitivity analysis is been conducted towards various parameters that may affect and influence these production costs, such as electricity price, capital cost of the electrolyzer and lifetime of the capture plant. The market for formic acid is relatively small, however, this thesis discusses as well the possibility of converting the formic acid to formaldehyde, which is a very important commodity chemical. A concentrated formaldehyde is produced, comparable to the 37 \% wt commercial product. Recommendations are discussed for process options which can in principal lead to significant improvement towards the basic design of the integrated capture and conversion method.<br","Capture; utilization; formic acid","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-09-27","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

It could be used to do interior positioning, crowd management, facility management and more. As the Global Data Privacy Regulation (GDPR) became enforceable in 2018, it set strict rules for personal data collection and usage. Since Wi-Fi access data contains personal information and it’s hard to be anonymised for research purposes, GDPR brings more limitations for people like researchers when they deal with Wi-Fi access data. The GDPR triggers the development of a data platform in TU Delft, which aims at sharing data to researchers in a legal way.

Three stakeholders are involved in this context: the ICT Department as the data controller, researchers and designers as the data requester, and the students and employees in the TU campus as the data subject. All their values need to be taken seriously when developing the platform. Thus, the aim of the research is to bridge the gap between the stakeholder’s values and the implementations of the platform developers. Literature review is conducted first, discussing why ethics are important in platform design. Then the background information about Wi-Fi access data and GDPR are researched, so as an overview of the data platform.

On the backside of each card, questions that help the developers to measure whether this value is met are asked. The second card set are ‘inspiration cards’. It shows one or more functionality that could be developed to fulfill each value, triggering the developers coming up with more tangible features. It is expected that the toolkit will be used in the group discussions when deciding what functionalities will be implemented into the platform, to speak for the absent stakeholders as well as to trigger discussion.

In regards to that, two separate LES are performed: one for the baseline case with a Rood wing/flat plate combination and another with the Rood wing/anti-fairing combination. A detailed comparative study is performed between the two cases to observe important differences in junction flow characteristics. Both the simulations are performed on a 25 million immersed boundary Cartesian mesh by solving the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations using the in-house finite volume LES solver called INCA. Results from the LES study confirms the existence of the propulsive pressure mechanism of drag reduction for the anti-fairing case, previously proposed by Belligoli et al. However, the results also show that there exists a secondary drag reduction mechanism caused by a combination of increase in approach boundary layer momentum thickness and dampening of the turbulence associated with the horseshoe vortex (HSV) upstream of the wing. This secondary mechanism has been found to be caused by the convex dent present at the start of the anti-fairing geometry. The total drag reduction for the anti-fairing case comes out to be 1.8%. A new parameter called junction drag is defined which accounts for the drag only due to the presence of a junction. The reduction in junction drag obtained for the anti-fairing case is about 6.8%. Apart from the LES analysis, a RANS analysis has also been performed to further investigate the drag reduction capabilities of anti-fairing for different approach boundary layer thicknesses and anti-fairing depths. All the RANS analysis have been performed on a 5 million body-fitted mesh by solving the incompressible Navier-Stokes using the open source finite-volume solver OpenFOAM. Results from the RANS analysis indicate that there exists an optimum depth for the anti-fairing which corresponds to the least drag. Furthermore, it is found that the effect of approach boundary layer thickness is mostly on changing the base drag of the case where no anti-fairing is present, rather than actually affecting the performance of the anti-fairing at different depths.","Anti-fairing; LES; INCA; Drag Reduction; CFD","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

(mentor); Naudet, Joris (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","In recent years, with the increasing number of man made objects in space the need for accurate satellite orbit prediction has increased tremendously. Prediction of satellite trajectories is important to plan collision avoidance manoeuvres between space assets and debris, to autonomously maintain formation flying missions and to plan manoeuvres for ground-track maintenance of Earth-observation missions. For satellites in very low LEO, aerodynamic drag is the largest and the most difficult force to model because of the changing nature of atmospheric density. This report describes the efforts made towards improving the orbit prediction of SAOCOM-CS with a focus on drag force modelling. This is accomplished by orbit determination using GPS state vector measurements and precise deterministic force models, during periods of high and low solar activity. Drag scale factors are estimated with different resolutions. Different methods are used to choose the estimated drag scale factors for orbit prediction. GRACE-A and PROBA-V satellites are used as test cases. For a prediction arc length of one day, the best prediction strategy results in maximum position errors (3D) of 243.5 m and 24.1 m for GRACE-A \&amp; PROBA-V, respectively during high solar activity. Based on the prediction results of GRACE-A \&amp; PROBA-V, a rule of thumb analysis is used to derive the maximum position error in the orbit prediction of SAOCOM-CS, which lies between 40 and 75 m. Changes in the mean estimated drag scale factors of the satellites are observed between high and low solar activity which might indicate deficiencies in the NRLMSISE-00 density model. The report also provides the effect of the space weather forecast errors on the best prediction strategy. Introducing a 10 \% error in the solar activity index resulted in mean maximum along-track prediction errors of 393 m and 16 m for GRACE-A \&amp; PROBA-V, respectively during high solar activity. Similarly, including random errors in the geomagnetic activity index resulted in mean maximum along-track prediction errors of 443 m and 15 m for GRACE-A \&amp; PROBA-V, respectively during high solar activity. Finally, the optimization of the estimation and prediction methods for the computational efficiency of PROBA-V is presented. A six hour estimation arc length with the force model comprising Earth gravity field of degree and order 30 of the model ITU\_GRACE 16 with luni-solar perturbations and devoid of atmospheric drag, solar radiation pressure and tidal forces is the most computationally efficient combination for a prediction arc length of one day.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Ideally this is done by building across contexts on each other’s insights and contributions as if they were bricks. However, current M&amp;S software does not support context independent bricks due to a variety of rigid bindings; the bricks are essentially glued to a context and cannot easily be reused. In this research we combine the fields of M&amp;S and Computer Science to determine under which circumstances context independent bricks can exist. We took the current concepts about components and applied a low coupling high cohesion attitude to create a new flexible structure, the Brix; we formally defined this structure in the Brix Formalism. Furthermore we built a proof-of-concept system named BrixMS in JavaScript that can simulate models built in context independent bricks. BrixMS offers little in the way of features, yet it has the potential to simulate any computable system with an unmatched flexibility and reusability. While hard limits exist in terms of how we can represent Grand Challenges and how much we can compute, BrixMS proves that context independent bricks are a practical reality that we can use to more effectively find solutions to our Grand Challenges. ","modelling tool; modelling formalism; grand challenges; components","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","",""

The sluices were finished in 1970 and are thus 50 years old. This research is initiated because the expected lifetime of hydraulic structures is thought to decrease significantly due to climate change. This study aims to provide insight in the functions the Haringvliet sluices fulfill and to what extent climate change influences the functioning of the Haringvliet sluices. If the lifetime of the current structure is reached multiple other strategies are suggested. The lifetime of the sluices is determined, based on the effect of climate change on the functions the sluices fulfils. The climate scenarios used for the assessment of the sluices are the KNMI’14 climate scenarios (Gl and Wh). These are the most mild and most extreme scenarios. The amount of sea level rise and the change in annual river discharge distribution of these scenarios are used for the assessment of the sluices.   For the assessment of the Haringvliet sluices, multiple tools are used. Calculations are made with the programs SOBEK and Hydra-BS, available literature is used, information received from interviews with experts and hand calculations have been used as tools to assess the Haringvliet sluices.  Flood protection, fresh water availability and ecology are the functions for which the sluices have been assessed. Another failure mechanism for which the sluices have been assessed is structural failure. The lifetime for which the sluices fail constructively are conducted by a semi-structured interview. Not opening, not closing, overtopping and overflow are the failure mechanisms included in the assessment for flood protection. The effect of the failure mechanisms in combination with climate change may not lead to hydraulic loads which exceed the retaining height with 0.2 meter of at least two dike sections at the hinterland. With the Kierbesluit, the Haringvliet sluices are opened during high-tide. The requirement concerning fresh water availability is that the chloride concentration at Middelharnis-Spui may not exceed 300 mg/litre. The requirement for ecology is based on fish migration in combination with the Kierbesluit. Multiple fish species must be able to migrate from the North-Sea to the Haringvliet for at least 50\% of the time as indicated for each specie in the migration calender. The sluices may also not be closed for 50 consecutive days. This reduces migration via the Haringvliet.  The lifetime for which the function of flood protection is reached, is based on literature, spreadsheet calculations and the use of the models SOBEK-RE and Hydra-BS. With SOBEK-RE water level calculations are carried out in which the failure mechanisms of not opening and not closing are added. The results have been stored in a database which is used as input for Hydra-BS. Hydra-BS probabilistically calculates water levels through the south western delta. The effect of the failure mechanism of overtopping is calculated by calculating overtopping volumes with formulas found in prior research (Van der Meer, 2008). The overtopping volumes can be significant but due to the large storage area at the Haringvliet, the effect is relatively small. Also, the coincidence between a storm at the North Sea and large discharges at the Rhine is relatively low.  The assessments of the functions fresh water availability and fish migration are based on the aggregation of multiple researches in combination with the effect of a changing climate, for which the KNMI’14 climate scenarios are used. Concluded is that the function for fish migration cannot be fulfilled in the most extreme scenario around 2050.  First strategy proposed to extend the lifetime is to change the Kierbesluit. Sluices may be opened by lower discharges during high tide. However, this decreases the lifetime for fresh water availability. The lifetime with another Kierbesluit can be enlarged by circa 30 years. With this measure the functions of fresh water availability and fish migration still reach the lifetime first around the year 2080. Life time extending measures can be thought of and can be of both economic and social points of view. Closing the sluices more frequently (social point) reduces the fish migration. Relocating the fresh water intake locations more upstream or by building a fish passage from the North-Sea to the Haringvliet is a measure which is coming from an economical viewing point.   When taking into account the extending measure concerning ecology, the lifetime of the sluices become as follows. In case of an extreme scenario the functional lifetime can be met until at least 2050 and the structural lifetime is reached around 2100. In case of an average climate scenario, all the functions fail in a relatively short time span of 20 years, around the year 2130. With the Gl climate scenario used in this thesis the sluices fail first structurally, which is around the year 2170.   In case of an average or mild climate scenario, the sluices need to be removed or covered because they fail structurally. To replace or cover the current Haringvliet sluices when the lifetime is reached, multiple functional strategies have been developed.  For the development of the new functional strategies it is assumed that the requirements do not change compared to the current requirements. The functional strategies are based on three possible designs for the Haringvliet: a permanent closure of the Haringvliet in which pumps are installed, a similar sluice complex or creating an open estuary again. These three strategies are used in combination with other structures. Eventually two verified designs are evaluated. It turned out that closing of the Haringvliet can fulfil all the requirements. A larger sluice complex including a fish passage turned out to be the best functional design. With the rough assumptions used in the evaluation, the variant in which larger sluices combined with a fish passage is suggested comes out as the best strategy. Other strategies could turn out to be more suitable for the requirements, criteria and boundary conditions valid at that moment. Therefore adaptive coastal and river management is recommended.  What must be noted is that backward salt intrusion, intrusion via the Nieuwe Waterweg and Spui to the Haringvliet can cause problems concerning the quality (salt concentration) of drinking water. Closing the Nieuwe Waterweg is a solution concerning the requirements composed for the Haringvliet. However, the effect on the Port of Rotterdam and the costs involved for this closure are not estimated and are therefore not included in the functional designs.  In this thesis multiple methods are used to calculate the effect of a failure mechanism of the Haringvliet sluices on the hydraulic load. Suggested is to come up with a model in which the failure mechanisms not opening, not closing and overtopping are included. Further, with the data from Rijkswaterstaat on the chloride concentrations in the Haringvliet a salt intrusion model can be made to improve the Kierbesluit.","Haringvliet Sluices; Lifetime; Haringvliet; Structures; Functional lifetime","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","",""

From a control engineers perspective, three stages arise to develop such a method: the research, the system and the control part. The research part presents the results of a control theoretic analysis of PricewaterhouseCoopers’ (PwC) valuation methods. The subject of the analysis in this thesis considers an enterprise in the car leasing business. It addresses the fact that current cash flow forecast methods have limitations that can be overcome by using the tools of Systems and control. This part determines that three important agents influence the cash flow of an enterprise: the firm, its management and its consumer. The system part develops an LTI model in such a way that its dynamical behaviour aligns with the behaviour of the firm and its consumer. This part uses bond graphs and the analogies of economic engineering to build a fifth-order mechanical system that corresponds to the firm and its consumer. The system includes the interaction between the firm and its customer in order to determine price, output, and resource allocation decisions. The control part designs two controllers that align with the control actions of management in various market situations. Proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control as management deals with growth reference signals and unexpected disturbances in future market situations. Furthermore, management strives to maximize profit. This part designs an optimal controller that optimizes energy flows to maximize the profit of an enterprise by analogizing cash flow as energy. The benefit of modeling an enterprise with a control theoretic approach is that the model incorporates high-order effects such as price changes and management decisions, which results in a more realistic representation of reality.","Cash flow; Finance; Economic engineering; Optimal Control; PID control; Car leasing; Firm; Management; Consumer; LTI systems Theory; Modelling; Valuation; Forecasting","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

Rivers form a dominant pathway for macro plastic particles into the ocean. Plastic pollution in rivers can result in blockage, where it affects water quality and ecology. This increases risks of flooding and provides health concerns. To prevent further dispersion of plastics into the ocean and reduce health and flood risks, reduction of plastic concentrations in rivers is desired. Buoyant macro plastics are a dominant polluter and understanding their cross-sectional distribution in rivers could promote areas for efficient extraction or monitoring. As field measurements are expensive and time consuming it is desired to accelerate research with modelling techniques. To improve modelling of buoyant macro plastics and translate cross-sectional distributions it is necessary to model relative motion of buoyant macro plastic particles to the flow and one another. Previous research has shown that the understanding of macro plastic forces and transport is limited. The range of macro plastic properties complicates modelling approaches to macro plastic transport. To simplify, a classification of macro plastics is introduced according to cornerstones in behaviour. A basic force model is constructed (derived from riverine wood transport studies) to provide an understanding of the effect of size, density, wind and discharge on transport of different macro plastic types. This new understanding is applied to a variety of flow features induced by a range of river elements (river bend, channel widening, river confluence and groyne) to develop a hypotheses on the cross-sectional distribution of the different macro plastic objects in these environments. These hypotheses are tested in a numerical transport model. A theoretical background study on particle response times and Stokes numbers is performed to identify a relation between the particle response time and relative particle dispersion (compared to the flow). This provides a possibility for translating the transport of the different macro plastic objects into the numerical model. To define numerical modelling input of different buoyant macro plastic objects, particle response times are calculated and translated to horizontal particle dispersion coefficients in D-WAQ PART (software package of choice). Each of the previously formulated river elements is modelled as well in the numerical model. The modelling results show that river bends cause an increase in particle concentrations along the river bend. Channel widening increases the concentration along the boundaries. A river confluence increases the concentration along the tributary side of the channel. A groyne increases the macro plastic concentration along the groyne-free side of the channel. These results show that particle response times and their relation to Stokes number and particle dispersion propose an interesting tool for the modelling of relative particle motion towards the flow and the different macro plastic objects. This study identifies the significance, diversity and complexity of macro plastic particles in riverine environments. It highlights the need for classification and simplification to facilitate modelling and still be able to obtain relevant results. Describing macro plastics according to cornerstones in behaviour provides an efficient tool to simplify modelling. Coupling of different macro plastic classes to a range of riverine environments and understanding the differences in their cross-sectional distribution provides practical use.","Plastic pollution; River transport; Buoyant macro plastics; Numerical modelling; cross-sectional; distribution","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For this to happen, there are some problems that must be overcome. For example, in a quantum processor qubits are usually arranged in a 2D architecture with limited connectivity between them and in which only nearest-neighbour interactions are allowed. This restricts the execution of two-qubit gates and requires qubit to be moved to adjacent positions. Quantum algorithms, which are described as quantum circuits, neglect the quantum chip constraints and therefore cannot be directly executed. This is known as the mapping problem. This thesis focuses on the problem of mapping quantum algorithms into a quantum chip based on spin qubits, called the crossbar architecture. In this project we have developed the required compiler support (mapping) for making quantum circuits executable on the crossbar architecture based on the tools provided by OpenQL. Using this compiler, we have analyzed the mapping overhead of the crossbar architecture and studied how it relates to the characteristics of quantum algorithms. In addition, we have developed a verification program that checks the output of the compiler and provides a visualisation tool for debugging.","mapping; spin qubits; crossbar; architecture; quantum; silicon; OpenQL; routing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Engineering","",""

Recent hurricanes like Harvey (Texas, 2017) and Idai (Mozambique, 2019) emphasize the global character of this threat. In the U.S., Hurricane Harvey tied with 2005's Hurricane Katrina as the costliest tropical cyclone on record, inflicting $125 billion in damage. Harvey hovered above the state of Texas for six days in 2017, making it the longest landfalling storm in Texas history. During this time, over 600 millimeters of rain had fallen in most of the Houston area, with extreme observations showing 1500 millimeters of rain. This, in combination with surge and river discharges, caused inundation for over one-third of Houston. Current generation coastal flood early warning systems are often not designed to take into account the compound effects of pluvial, fluvial and marine flooding (e.g. the ADCIRC + SWAN model deployed by the Coastal Emergency Risks Assessment group ignores pluvial flooding). Moreover, the advanced models applied in these systems are computationally demanding and can therefore not be used in probabilistic real-time forecasting applications in order to include uncertainty in meteorological conditions. Furthermore, despite the importance of tropical cyclone rainfall, this field is not completely understood. Tropical cyclone rainfall distributions are dependent on best track data parameters (e.g. storm motion velocity), but also on environmental elements (e.g. topography). Current modelling approaches are either computational inefficient (e.g. large-scale climate models), are location-specific or are dependent on parameters not always available in archives. Therefore, there is need for a simple generic parametric rainfall model. Main focus of this research was the derivation of a methodology for assessing the joint probability of fluvial, pluvial and marine flooding. For this study, a case study is carried out for Houston, Texas. The TCWiSE tool is used to generate a set of synthetic hurricane tracks based on historical data and a Monte Carlo sampling method. A derived parametrization of tropical cyclone rainfall is used to generate a spatial tropical cyclone rainfall field. Furthermore, a Delft3D-FM model is used to generate offshore water level time-series for the synthetic hurricanes. A combination of SFINCS and Delft-FIAT is used to make an assessment based on both hydrodynamics and exposure for every single generated hurricane. The model train is capable of carrying out a flood risk assessment, derive flood maps for given return periods (e.g. 1 in 100-year flood) and make an exposure assessment for the joint occurrence of pluvial, fluvial and marine flooding. This framework can potentially be a useful tool for future policy- and decision making.","SFINCS; Flooding; Tropical Cyclones; Hurricanes; Typhoons; Precipitation; Rain; Copula; Modelling; Flood Risk; Climate Variability Study; Delft3D-FM; TCWiSE; FIAT","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","","29.76, -95.37"

The first part is delivered directly to people’s homes; the second part is delivered to a retail location where people then pick up the parcels themselves. This assignment was about the second flow of parcels, more and more consumers are choosing to pick up their parcel at a retail location, but the locations cannot handle the increasing volume anymore. This led to the following research question: Design a new PostNL service solution enabling consumers to receive their parcel in the way they prefer. The solution should lower the pressure on the current retail network and be adapted to the changing future context. As a next step in the process, research has been done into market conditions and consumers. Consumers were interviewed to create a customer journey about the order and shipping process. Consumers visiting a parcel point were interviewed as well as employees and owners of the parcel point. Lead users who came up with a solution for the problem themselves were also interviewed. Many consumers experienced the parcel points as a necessary evil because they are not at home during the day and therefore depend on a parcel point. They prefer to receive their package at home and do not want to go to a parcel point after work. They also indicated that picking up a parcel takes more time than just the transaction; they have to park, wait in line and wait for an employee to find the parcel. Some consumers also indicated that it was difficult to arrange something officially with PostNL. Subsequently, further research was done into where the frequent online shoppers live and whether this group had specific characteristics. It appears that frequent online shoppers are generally younger and receive a minimum of 5 parcels per month. PostNL does not have a shortage of capacity in every district; some districts still have a lot of retail locations available or fewer parcels are delivered to retail in a specific district. Based on the research, the Vinex districts and the high-rise districts around the city-centre have been selected as areas where the most improvement is possible. Various concepts have been devised to solve the problem, taking into account the insights of the research and the requirements from PostNL. The final proposed solution is a roadmap making use of lockers to receive parcels and a platform for more customer-oriented and efficient shipping. The lockers are placed at the entrance of the high-rise apartment buildings, so PostNL can always deliver the parcels at the home of the consumer. In the subsequent phases of the roadmap, the lockers are opened to retailers who deliver their goods themselves and other couriers who can use the locker for a fee. In the final phase of the roadmap, the couriers will collaborate even more, which leads to more efficiency and therefore sustainability. On the platform, the shipping wishes of the consumer ordering online are shared with the participating couriers so that they can offer a price for this request. Couriers can base their price for example on their available capacity and whether they already have to deliver a parcel near the address. PostNL earns a percentage on every transaction via the platform.","Service Design; PostNL; Parcel Locker; Roadmap","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

In order to achieve the goal of the thesis. First, the synchromodal transport network is analyzed on the basis of its transportation characteristics and network topology. The analysis of transportation characteristics helped us to define a notion of node criticality. The node criticality quantifies the effect on the robustness of a transportation system due to the perturbation of an infrastructure. Then, a relationship is established between the node criticality and topological centrality metrics in order to quickly identify critical infrastructures in the synchromodal transport network. Lastly, a systematic framework is proposed and applied to the Dutch synchromodal transport network. The results from the case study are quite insightful. First, we observe that the distribution of node criticality exhibits a power-law distribution which implies that the Dutch synchromodal transport network tends to robustness against node perturbation. Second, we observe that the performance of the dutch synchromodal transport network is quite sensitive to the perturbation in the road network. Lastly, we identify that the weighted degree centrality, eigenvector centrality shows a high correlation with node criticality thus these centrality metrics can be used to identify critical infrastructure in the synchromodal transport network.","Robustness; Synchromodal transport; Graph Model; centrality; Criticality analysis; Interdependent networks","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering","",""

(mentor); Apachitei, I. (graduation committee); Zadpoor, A.A. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","Background. The past four decades, the problem of resistant bacteria has emerged. As a result of biofilm formation of (resistant) bacteria on the implant, more implant-associated infections (IAI) occurred. This has caused an increase in orthopaedic implant revisions, causing a high burden of disease. To overcome the rising problem of resistance, many studies have focused on new antibacterial agents, such as Ag, Cu, and Zn nanoparticles (NPs) incorporated on titanium (Ti6Al4V) implants. It is known they show antibacterial effects. It is, however, unknown what causes the antibacterial effects of these metals incorporated on titanium implants. This study aims to unravel the antibacterial mechanisms of titanium implants bearing Ag, Cu or Zn NPs behind the in vitro antibacterial effects against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).<br/><br/> Methods. To obtain an implant surface bearing Ag, Cu or Zn NPs; porous Ti6Al4V implants and solid Ti6Al4Nb discs were treated by plasma electrolytic oxidation (PEO). The PEO electrolyte consisted of calcium acetate, calcium glycerophosphate, and Ag, Cu or Zn NPs. The surface morphology was visualized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and its chemical composition by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). All implant groups contained either Ag, Cu or Zn NPs and were tested on its antibacterial leaching activity against MRSA by a zone of inhibition experiment. In addition, the antibacterial effects as a result of contact killing were examined by a direct contact assay. Porous and solid surfaces were compared to reveal the differences in their contact killing properties. Moreover, the porous implants were incubated for 2 h and 24 h. Furthermore, the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) of the implant with and without inoculation of bacteria was measured by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) for forty minutes. ROS generation after inoculation with bacteria was tested in two ways: (1) the implant was placed in a solution of bacteria PBS after which ROS generation was directly measured in 100 mM DMPO, and (2) the implant with bacteria in BHI was incubated for 2 h after which the implant was placed in 100 mM DMPO to examine ROS generation of the implant with adherent bacteria.<br/><br/> Results. PEO processing resulted in four biofunctionalized groups: PT, PT+Ag, PT+Cu, and PT+Zn. The presence of Ag, Cu and Zn NPs was confirmed by SEM and EDS. The antibacterial leaching activity was only observed in PT+Ag. In addition, porous implants showed better contact killing properties than solid discs. All biofunctionalized groups were significantly different from a non-treated (NT) implant considering contact killing in 24 h. Moreover, ROS generation was observed in all biofunctionalized implants. However, solely PT+Cu was significantly different from a NT implant. Furthermore, the EPR results showed that bacteria generate ROS. In all biofunctionalized groups, however, ROS decreases when bacteria are added. In all groups, the ROS generation of adherent bacteria to the implants showed higher intensity than the ROS generation of bacteria in PBS in contact with the implant. <br/><br/> Conclusion. Antibacterial surfaces incorporated with Ag NPs show most antibacterial leaching effects, attributed to the ion release of Ag. Furthermore, it is assumed that direct contact killing of Cu is a cause of ROS generation of an implant bearing Cu NPs. <br","Titanium implant; Silver; Copper; Zinc; Contact killing; ROS generation; PEO; Antibacterial mechanism","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-09-30","","","","","",""

This question is then used to provide a framework of guidelines for the designer. A review of lighting design history introduced the terms ambient luminescence, focal glow and play of brilliants proposed by Kelly (Kelly, 1952). Research into perceptual psychology then disentangled principles of perception to the reader, after which it was found that mood was commonly used to measure the impact of environments. Contradictory results of studies suggested that mood lacked a reliable method of measurement. In a study by Vogels (Vogels, 2008), introducing the term atmosphere as a stable alternative for mood, defined as the affective evaluation of the environment, was introduced. In this study, the impact of static light conditions on atmosphere perception was investigated. It was found that four underlying variables are of influence when perceiving environments with static light conditions: cosiness, liveliness, tenseness and detachedness. Focusing on dynamic light conditions, a distinction was made between using real-world or abstract dynamic patterns as stimuli. The way people perceive real-world scenes was found to vary depending on culture and background (Nisbett &amp; Miyamoto, 2005) (Kuwabara &amp; Smith, 2016), leading to the preference for abstract patterns. A translation of abstract patterns into dynamic light textures was made by considering the principle of ensemble perception. Inspired by the natural world 39 stimuli were created. Participants were subjected to these stimuli in an experiment, finding that participants use the same words when describing atmospheres influenced by dynamic light textures through a frequency analysis. Participants’ responses were clustered according to their meaning, resulting in a 40 word lexicon. A set of 13 stimuli were shown to 16 participants in a second experiment, and participants’ responses were recorded using a questionnaire containing the 40 word lexicon. <br/>It was found that participants gave relatively the same responses. Additionally, it was found through a principal component analysis that three underlying variables are present in the perception of atmospheres influenced by dynamic light conditions: tenseness, liveliness and detachment. Furthermore, it was confirmed that people are able to distinguish between the perceived atmospheres. Cosiness was not found to be a principal component in our construct. Regarding the workings of the underlying variables found, we found that liveliness is influenced by organisation of shapes in the texture and colour contrasts. Tenseness is influenced by the complexity of individual forms within textures; it is also influenced by colour contrasts. Brilliance contrasts in the texture influence liveliness of a space; sharpness contrasts influence the sense of detachment. Dynamics in the textures, like the rate of change, influence both the liveliness and tenseness axes and might influence the detachment axis. The findings of the experiments and analyses were used to develop a framework usable by designers, noting however that several points of recommendation were made to improve the reliability and usability of this framework.","Atmosphere; Atmosphere perception; Lighting design; Light texture; Light; Dynamic lighting; Perception; Perceptual psychology; atmosphere metrics; Principal Component Analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","Turbulent flows are commonly encountered in scientific research or engineering applications and need simulations to be resolved. The Navier-Stokes equations govern the simulations of turbulent flows. One of the most common ways to solve the Navier-Stokes equations is to analyse the Reynolds averaged form (RANS). Next to the increasing development and use of Large Eddy Simulations (LES), the RANS equations are expected to be a necessary tool for the foreseeable future in turbulence modelling. These RANS equations need a closure term to be solved. The field of research to close the RANS equations has made most of its progress during the second half of the twentieth century, but is nowadays still an active field of research. More recent efforts have been taking a data-driven approach using different machine learning frameworks.<br/>Uncertainty quantification is an important aspect for machine learning models, as these methods can quickly become inaccurate when a test case is outside the range of the initial training data. Therefore, the aim of this research was to develop a data-driven turbulence model for the RANS equations that is able to predict and quantify the uncertainty of the model output.<br/>Uncertainty is introduced in the anisotropic Reynolds stress tensor, which is predicted using machine learning. Two methods were developed to capture the uncertainty of the data-driven turbulence model: (1) Jackknife methods were applied to a tensor based random forest (TBRF) and (2) a Bayesian additive regression tree model (BART-TB) was developed.<br/>Both methods converged locally to equal levels of uncertainty for different flow cases, however the Jackknife methods could not provide spatially homogeneous samples. Therefore, the BART-TB model was selected as the superior model. After reformulation, the BART-TB model was able to give more accurate predictions of the anisotropic Reynolds stress tensor. The results of the BART-TB model show great resemblance to Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS)/LES data for square duct and backwards facing step flows. Furthermore, this model shows increasing levels of uncertainty in the solution, when square duct training data is extrapolated to test cases of higher aspect ratio ducts.<br/>Overall, the introduction of uncertainty in the anisotropic Reynolds stress fields mainly provides an additional tool to estimate the accuracy of machine learning predictions in case of the BART-TB model, however, the mean predicted solution does not seem to be a direct improvement over the TBRF. Therefore, this method is mainly beneficial to apply, when a test case is at the limits of extrapolation, outside the scope of the training data, as this marks the point that any data-driven turbulence model can become highly inaccurate.","Uncertainty Quantification; Bayesian Additive Regression Trees; Turbulence Modelling; Machine Learning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

The plaque is made of a lipid rich necrotic core which is covered by a collagen rich fibrous cap. If this fibrous cap ruptures, it can lead to sudden thrombotic occlusion of the artery. Rupture of the fibrous cap is linked to many factors. Recently, through high resolution imaging, microcalcifications have been found in the fibrous caps. The role of these microcalcifications in fibrous cap rupture mechanics is a debated theory. Calcifications, by virtue of their high stiffness, are predicted to increase local stresses in the less stiff surrounding collagen tissue by creating stress concentrations. This interaction between collagen and microcalcifications has not been studied extensively. Fibrous cap rupture mechanics can be studied through mechanical tests such as uniaxial tensile tests. Due to limitations in access to human plaque tissues and differences in the mechanisms of cap rupture in animal models, there is a need for an in-vitro platform to study fibrous cap rupture mechanics. In this study, a simplified model of a fibrous cap incorporating two components, collagen and calcifications, for the development of an in-vitromodel of an atherosclerotic fibrous cap was explored. High levels of calcium and phosphate have been found in microcalcifications in fibrous caps. Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) have been linked to vascular calcifications and have been found to deposit calcium phosphate in collagen scaffolds. Collagen type 1 scaffolds were seeded with MSCs to create calciumphosphate deposits with the aim of emulating an atherosclerotic fibrous cap from the collagen and calcifications aspect. The collagen scaffold constructs were mechanically tested<br/>to study the mechanical properties and effects of the calcium phosphate deposits on the mechanical behaviour. The structure and failure behaviour was studied through histology and scanning electron microscopy. Deposits of calcium phosphate were successfully formed inside the collagen scaffold leading to a calcified scaffold. The calcified collagen scaffoldswere mechanically and structurally characterised. The composition and size of the calcium phosphate deposits were in line with microcalcifications found in atherosclerotic fibrous caps. The failure was characterised by noticeable initial failures, multiple miniature failures and high stretch before the final complete failure. The calcified scaffolds can potentially serve as a baseline for the development of an in-vitro model of an atherosclerotic fibrous cap and for gaining useful insights into fibrous cap rupture mechanics.","Microcalcifications; Collagen Scaffold; Atherosclerotic Fibrous cap; In-Vitro Model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-09-24","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","In the Netherlands there are many bridges that crosses waterways, which are key nodes in the transportation system. The safety and integrity of these bridges is nowadays assessed by (visual) inspections at regular intervals. This approach cannot provide information about damage development in between inspections, leading to potential failure or high intervention costs. A maintenance strategy for bridges based on continuous vibration-based monitoring provides a possible cost-effective solution that may replace the periodic (visual) inspections. Vibration-based structural health monitoring of civil engineering structures is receiving increasing attention in recent years. This is due to new developments in related areas such as sensing technology, system identification, data mining and condition assessment. A particular damage scenario that frequently occurs in steel orthotropic deck structures is the development of fatigue cracks in the welds between the longitudinal U-shaped stiffeners and the transverse beams or the steel deck plate. This damage scenario was also observed in the steel deck structure of the Zwartewaterbrug, located in Hasselt in the Netherlands. Vibration tests were performed on the bridge to develop a damage detection algorithm for early detection of the fatigue cracks in the bridge deck. In order to simulate the effect of damage, small masses were attached to the bottom of the bridge deck. The measurements were performed over a relatively short time period to exclude – in as far as possible – the effects of environmental variability. However, the bridge was kept open to traffic during the testing and structural response was primarily triggered by traffic load. The vibration data (accelerations) obtained during these tests was used for validation of the proposed methodology in this thesis. The aim of the thesis is to detect the added masses from the vibration data. To achieve this, a data-based approach for damage detection was proposed, which, besides the data acquisition, consists of four main stages: data preprocessing, feature extraction, pattern recognition and decision making. The analysis is focused on the high-frequency acceleration response, because the associated higher-frequency local modes are more sensitive to the small changes induces by the added mass. The similarity filtering preprocessing procedure was applied to filter out the variability related to the operational loading, and the Frequency Domain Decomposition system identification technique was used to extract damage indicators. Subsequently, a support vector machine algorithm was applied to “learn” patterns in the extracted damage indicators, which enables the algorithm to assign a damage state to a given measurement vector. Alternatively, a novelty detection technique was used to distinguish data from the “healthy” structure from data corresponding to a “damage” state. It was not possible to reliable detect the added masses from the high-frequency acceleration data due to the large variations in the damage indicators of a mass class. These variations are attributed to the changing environmental conditions over the measurement period. The principal component analysis was used in an attempt to remove these variations from the damage indicators, but the results were still not satisfactory. In conclusion, it was not possible to properly test the proposed methodology for damage detection using the data of the Zwartewarterbrug, mainly because the data was not suitable for the machine learning algorithms employed. Recommendations are given related to the methodology for the similarity filtering, determination of the high-frequency range, and machine learning algorithm to be used. Additionally, recommendations are given for future measurement campaigns to obtain data that is more suitable for successful application of the methodologies employed in the present project.","Machine Learning; Structural Health Monitoring; Vibration-based monitoring; similarity filtering; damage detection; Support Vector Machines; outlier detection; Frequency Domain Decomposition","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This method is also used in the current design code for steel shell structures, the NEN-EN 1993-1-6 \cite{NEN-EN_1993-1-6}. By varying the amount and types of constrained degrees of freedom, eight possible boundary conditions can be generated. Looking to the practical applications, a ninth variant with a non-homogeneous boundary completes a list of nine. From the nine boundary conditions, eight conditions are selected to be included in a FEM model study. The current design code describes only five of the nine conditions, what allows for a comparison of the known and unknown conditions with the prescribed rules. Two types of parameters that influence the local buckling failure mechanism are material and geometrical imperfections. In the study to geometrical imperfections, initial ovalisation, accidental eccentricity and dimples are considered. The effect on the design yield stress of the different imperfections is determined following the calculation methods described by the current design code. The calculated reduction of the design yield stress by specific boundary condition and an increasing imperfection is compared to results of ABAQUS FEM model tests. Residual stresses are investigated on the side of material imperfections. The used residual stresses are validated with a simple FEM ring model test that shows deformations due to the introduced residual stresses. The observed displacements could be compared with measured data of real experiments. A range of 36 different tubes is selected to investigate the influences of the eight different boundary conditions on the buckling failure behaviour. This test range covers a wide range of tubes with cross-section class 3 and 4 known for their sensitivity for local buckling. A base model is generated for all the 288 model tests, 36 tubes with all 8 boundary conditions per tube. The results from all tests are displayed in normalized moment-curvature diagrams. Because of a lack of test data of real experiments with boundary conditions involved, a validation with an analytical method is used that describes a linear and bi-linear part of the moment-curvature relation. Finally the results of the FEM model tests are analyzed per parameter but also the overall behaviour is discussed. From the model results could be concluded that residual stresses hardly influence the moment capacity but causes an increase in the curvature of most boundary condition. Geometrical imperfections cause a decreasing moment capacity and an increasing critical curvature whit an increasing imperfection. The trend of the influence of dimple imperfections is decreasing slightly faster compared to the trend observed from the code calculations. A safety of approximately 20\% is observed between the failure stresses of the test results and the design stresses from the code. With an increasing diameter over thickness (D/t) ratio or yield stress, the moment capacity decreases and the critical curvature increases. The relative influence of the D/t ratio within the tested range is larger compared to the yield stress. To investigate the influence of the different boundary conditions, the effect of all parameters is investigated per boundary condition. Following the test results, all boundary conditions except BC4F show the same influence on the maximum moment and corresponding curvature. Boundary condition BC4F shows a moment resistance reduction of 14\% and a critical curvature reduction of 26\% compared to the other conditions. Small observed differences in the post buckling behaviour between the other different boundary conditions are reported to complete this study.","Local buckling; Tubular piles; Boundary conditions; ABAQUS; Imperfections; Residual stress","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","",""

In 2014 this number has increased to 3,21 billion passengers – that’s a billion more in just five years time.” (Schuttenhelm, 2016) Air travel is rapidly becoming easily accessible to almost everyone and everywhere in the world. Low budget carriers are also making it possible for low budget travellers to afford short / long haul trip(s) in a year. With the growing number of flights and connections, the demand and offering for onboard services is also increasing. The levels of these onboard services are different based on the seating arrangements in the air carrier. As of now there is less allowance of personalisation for economy class passengers, but it is expected for the onboard experience by 2025 to be different from what we know it today. To keep up with these growing trends, Safran, the project collaborator, as a world leader for Aviation equipment supply wants to work towards bringing continuous changes to enhance passengers’ journey experiences. To be able to understand what needs to be improved, passengers’ current problems had to be identified. The focus of this research was the younger generation (students in this case) of passengers as they are usually highly opinionated and tech savvy with a preference for personalised services. A participant research had been conducted with 15 participants from different nationalities. The research conveyed that currently passengers experience uncertainty in their onboard meal experience. They often have no information or choice on what they ate or when they ate. Moreover, they feel time pressured in their decision making between often only two options given by the crew in a short span of time. This project aims to reverse the uncertainty, the passengers feel, by providing them with information and allowing them to make choices about what they can eat and when they want to eat. The medium designed to enable passengers in making these choices can be accessed through the IFE screen. This medium / tool is a service application known as À la craft, which lets passengers to order their preferred meals (main course, salads, desserts, beverages) and choose when they wish to eat from the given time slots. In addition to this the service also offers passengers, a surprise cultural meal which is determined based on their destination. This new service may attempt to solve most of the passengers’ concerns but increases crew workload if the required technology does not support their tasks. When the passenger places an order from their seat, these orders are then sent to the galley. A screen in the galley will let the crew access the orders and it also instructs them to heat (prepare) the required number of meal items in each category of the meal course and place them in the trolley. Another screen on the trolley will help the crew in locating pax in the aisle and their order details. This service can be eventually implemented, part by part in the way of working for the cabin crew as it is a major step into improving pax’s dining experiences. This service has been tested for the target group alone, but it can be assumed that testing for all the other pax groups may bring in more changes in the pax’s requirements. The final test found that this service gives autonomy and control to those pax that need it but may give a decision paralysis to those pax that do not prefer making so many choices. Most importantly, if the service could have been tested in the real context, potential for improvement would have emerged for iterations in terms of the application operated in the aisle and supporting technology for the crew in the galley. In a brief research conducted over the crew’s concerns, it has been understood that they believe in letting economy class passengers choose their meal through the IFE as serving and repeating same information on meals to more than 15 rows of passengers is heavily exhausting. It is my assumption that this may increase the workload for the crew by a few more minutes spent in preparing the orders and also would require more coordination with each other to serve pax as per their choices but would ease their workload in the aisle. Based on the findings of this study it is recommended for Safran Group to conduct further research, test the design in the real context by involving the crew and caterers as well and further develop the design it as it has a high potential for improvement and implementation in the future.","inflight dining services; passenger experience; onboard services","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

In the beginning of the project, research is done about the current context. Company activities and product properties that already contribute to sustainability are investigated, Besides, the theory behind sustainable models is consulted. After this orientation, some targeted exploration is done. Takeaways from interesting company cases and results from interviews with eight wave kitesurfers, result in the distinction of three different end-user groups and inspiration for idea development.<br/>Ideation is then started and the first structural PaaS model ideas are developed. One of these ideas is chosen for further development. This decision leads to a focus on the end-user group of ‘potential customers that want to try out Appletree boards before acquiring one’. This direction leads to a certain model construction and the development of a board trial service. Two trial structures are then elaborated into two different concepts, with a different aim on experience, interaction and intended behavior. Findings from a extensive user test with ten participants, result in a final design proposal. The best of two concepts is merged together, and the last adjustments are made. The final design consist of a trial service and a PaaS-lease service, that can be set up alongside the company’s current activities. The last part of this report describes the features of the final design and presents a few additional elaborations.

It aims to develop an optimization method that uses machine learning to identify an improved configuration of solar cell production lines. Conventional methods for process improvement rely on modelling experimental data to improve a process of interest. The number of experiments needed for modelling grows exponentially with the number of parameters taken into account. Since experiments are costly and time-consuming, the number of parameters that can be considered in this existing method is limited. This existing method thus allows modelling of only a few processes, and cannot include all inter-dependencies between the processes in the production line. In this thesis, an alternative method is proposed for the optimization of solar cell fabrication that uses machine learning and genetic algorithms. Instead of collecting experimental data, this method uses data collected from sensors in the production line. Machine learning is employed to establish a model of the production using the natural variation in this sensor data. This allows us to create more complete and accurate models of the production line. Genetic algorithms are then combined with the machine learning model to identify an improved configuration of process parameters. As part of this study, a virtual solar cell production line was developed to test and compare different machine learning algorithms. Based on experiments with this virtual production line, two novel approaches are proposed that can optimize production lines using a combination of artificial neural networks and genetic algorithms. It was demonstrated that the first approach improved the photovoltaic cell efficiency of cells from a simulated production line from 17.9$\pm0.3\%$ to 19.2$\pm0.2\%$. This significant improvement demonstrates the power of applying machine learning to solar cell production. The results achieved in this thesis encourage further development of the proposed method and application to real-life production lines.","Photovoltaics; Machine Learning; Design of Experiment; Process Improvement; Simulation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In 2019, the Dutch government presented the national climate accord stating that in 2030, 70% of all energy needs to come from a renewable source. In this accord, strong emphasis is put on a regional approach to the energy transition. Across the country, regions are picking up the gauntlet and 141 municipalities in The Netherlands have formulated ambitions to become energy neutral by 2050 or earlier. The road to reach these regional ambitions, however, is not always clear. One of the key issues in energy planning is defining the optimal mix of generation methods to fulfill the electricity demand. Historically, this challenge has been approached only from a least cost perspective. Different stakeholders, however, have a different view on what defines the ‘optimal’ situation and care about more than cost. It is found that minimizing land use and minimizing the visual impact of wind turbines are important objectives to consider when designing an energy system. This research presents a multi-objective optimization that employs a genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) to find the set of pareto-optimal solutions for an optimal generation mix for a regional energy system in The Netherlands minimizing costs, land use and visual impact. Three scenarios are investigated: reducing the total emissions by 70%, 90% and 98%. The results of the optimization are analyzed from a multi-actor perspective to provide insight into the most ideal solutions for different stakeholders. The results show that there are significant trade-offs to be made in designing an energy system: governments, investors and local residents all have a different view about the optimal generation mix. This research presents an average optimal solution: one that may work best for all actors. It shows that by finding a Pareto-optimal set, many optimal solutions can be compared on their desirability, leading to more insight into the functioning of the system and a more feasible design.","Energy system optimization; Multi-objective optimization; multi-objective evolutionary algorithms; Regional energy system; Energy system; Renewable energy; Socio-technical system; Socio-technical transition","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","",""

This growth, however, is restricted by the shortage of express transportation capacity and is increasingly causing congestion. The transport sector is not only subject to this growing demand from a business perspective but also faces environmental challenges. The unsustainable nature of current transport combined with the limited capacity, have led to an interest for a new form of transport: the Cargoloop, a cargo application of the hyperloop. The fundamental concept of this idea is that cargo will be transported through an autonomous ground-based system that consists of vehicles within a low-pressure tube, in which high speeds of around 1000 kilometres per hour can be achieved. By reducing the air resistance in the tube, little energy is necessary to put the pressurized vehicles in motion which in turn, results in an energy efficient form of transport. Moreover, it is hypothesized that the Cargoloop could act as a stepping stone towards transporting passengers via the hyperloop. However, so far, little research has been done into this topic. This study therefore investigates the economic feasibility of the Cargoloop. In order to be able to do this, the Cargoloop must first be designed. This study therefore consists of a two-step approach: in the first step a potential design of the Cargoloop is established and an initial route is proposed, followed by the second step in which the economic feasibility of the Cargoloop is investigated by means of a cost-benefit analysis (CBA). An overview of the costs and the benefits was investigated for three different CBA scenarios, in which the project was financed in different ways. The results showed that there was no scenario in which the Cargoloop is economically feasible on the trajectory between the airports of Cologne-Bonn and Paris-CDG. A fundamental factor for explaining this, is that when looking at the number of vehicles that would be annual operational on the route between the airports of Cologne-Bonn and Paris-CDG compared to the annual capacity of the Cargoloop, it could be found that only a small percentage of the capacity of the Cargoloop is utilized on this route. Substantial more cargo would need to be transported to make the Cargoloop economically feasible on this trajectory. This could be realized by obtaining a larger modal share or by expanding the network, so the overall cargo flow will become larger.","Hyperloop; cargo; express freight; design; CBA","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

What these SIDS generally have in common is that they are very susceptible to different natural hazards, among which coastal flooding. In order to address this issue, adaptation measures are needed. In order to prioritize adaptation efforts when considering these islands at a large scale, it is important to obtain an overview of which islands are most vulnerable to coastal flooding. This requires a large-scale assessment of coastal flooding for these islands. Such a large-scale assessment introduces different challenges, that were looked into in the hydraulic engineering part of this thesis. A first challenge is the availability op topography data for these islands. For most islands, only satellite-based DEMs are available. The accuracy of different satellite-based DEMs was assessed by comparing them to more accurate elevation data for 11 different islands. It could be concluded that in general, the TanDEM-X DEM is the most accurate for terrains with milder slopes, and the ALOS DEM for terrains with steeper slopes. Furthermore, the DEM error was found to be strongly correlated with forested and builded areas. Especially the DEM error in builded areas poses a problem for coastal flood assessments, as these are the main areas of interest in such assessments. Therefore, a building-correction method based on data from Open Street Map (OSM) was proposed and implemented. It could be concluded that the building-correction can both in- and decrease the DEM error, depending on the other error sources that are present in the DEM. A second challenge that is introduced when upscaling coastal flood assessments, is the used method for flood modelling. In the context of this thesis, a simple flood model (called the JBIW model) was developed. This model is a combination of the Janssen-Battjes model for short wave dissipation and the IW-method, which was originally developed for large-scale river flooding calculations. The JBIW model was tested in 1D and compared to other flood models. The results indicated that the simple flood model can be used to obtain a first estimate of coastal flooding, but is not accurate enough to predict exact values of the maximum water levels. Furthermore, the JBIW model was implemented in 2D for the island of Ebeye. The model was combined both with accurate elevation data and with building-corrected satellite-based DEMs. The results indicated that the error introduced by the use of the simple JBIW model were much smaller than the errors introduced by the use of the satellite-based DEMs. This indicates that further research focusing on the upscaling of coastal flood assessments for reef-fronted SIDS should focus on obtaining more accurate elevation data for these islands.<br/> Apart from allocating resources to the SIDS in the most efficient way, it is important that the resources that are allocated to a certain island are used effectively. There are different ways to help these islands. An interesting approach is to focus on increasing the adaptive capacity of the SIDS. In the context of the science communication part of this thesis it was investigated whether the simple JBIW model could be used to increase the adaptive capacity to coastal flooding in the context of São Tomé. In order to do this, a theoretical framework was developed that aims to provide practical guidance in the assessment of the (barriers to the) adaptive capacity of a certain system. This framework was applied to the context of São Tomé to map the adaptive capacity to coastal flooding of the system and obtain an overview of the most important barriers to this adaptive capacity. Subsequently, it was assessed which barriers could be addressed with a tool based on the JBIW model. These barriers were used as the starting point for an initial design of the tool interface.","Large-scale coastal flood assessment; satellite-based DEMs; simple flood modelling; adaptive capacity; SIDS","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

Research on such modelsis important since new or improved models can potentially reduce development time and costs andprovide insight in the role of key system parameters.This research investigates the effects of the mass and drag of the kite control unit (KCU) on the kite’sflight behavior since it is hypothesized that the mass of the KCU causes an outward swing of the KCUduring turns and that KCU drag reduces the angle of attack during the retraction phase.For this investigation, the simulation of a kite and tether system is required. Existing simulation environ-ments could not be used due to legacy code, limited validity or unsuitable model complexity. Therefore,a suitable kite and tether model need to be selected for implementation in a simulation environment(SE). Two kite models have been found suitable: Fechner’s and Ruppert’s model.In the early stages of this research the aim was to use a model that has been fitted to experimental flightdata. Due to the unavailability of experimental flight data, the parameters of both models are identifiedusing simulated flight data. This approach provides Kitepower with a method to identify the modelparameters with experimental flight data in the future. Kitepower is an AWE company that facilitatedon this research.The groundstation controller and flight controller signals of Kitepower have been integrated in the SE.Two experiments have been performed in the SE. For the first experiment, flights are performed withdifferent and increasing values for the drag coefficient of the KCU. In the second experiment the massof the KCU and kite have been varied independently. Both experiments have been performed in a lowand high wind condition.The high wind condition experiment showed that and increasing drag results in a reduction of 7% ofthe average cycle power. The KCU drag force can reach up to to 5% of the kite drag force for a KCUdrag coefficient of 1.5.Increasing the combined mass of the kite and KCU results in an increase of &gt;150% in average cyclepower output for the low wind conditions and an increase of &gt;40% for the high wind condition. Theincrease in power is caused by a reduction in elevation angle in combination with the assumption of aflat wind profile. Additionally an outward swing of the KCU of 4.5 ∘ has been observed.It is recommended to compare Fechner’s and Ruppert’s rigid body kite models through using experi-mental flight data in order to investigate which model reproduces actual kite flight the best. Furthermoreit is recommended to investigate the optimal altitude or elevation angle at which to operate the AWEsystem for maximal power output considering a non-flat wind profile, tether drag and kite and KCUdynamics. It is suggested that these findings should then be incorporated in the flight controller ofKitepower in order to increase the system power output.","AWE; kite; wind; Kitepower; Renewable Energy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-09-23","","","","","",""

After absorption30 wt% H2O and the CO2loading is expected to be 1.5 [mol CO2/ mol N amine].A VLE experiment is done to find the equilibrium between CO2in the gas phase andCO2in the amine, using the apparatus is was also possible to find the H2-Amine VLE.The experiment done with a 30 wt% failed due to high viscosity after which the solutionwas not homogeneous anymore. Adding more H2O up to 70 wt% solves the problem.However, the VLE is not accurate enough in low loading range(ZEF range. But, usingtwo isotherms, at 80 and 120°C the heat of absorption can be calculated. The results isa heat of absorption of -73.6 and -68.2 [kJ/mol CO2] for TEPA and PEI, respectively.To find the total desorption of CO2and H2O a desorption experimental setup isbuilt, experiments are performed at three pressures(50 100 and 200 mbar) and increasingtemperatures steps(80,90,100,110,120°C) . As the H2O evaporated at low temperature(&lt;80°C). At higher temperatures than 90°C only CO2was present in the gas phase, hencethe partial pressure is equal to the total pressure. The output of CO2increases withdecreasing pressure and increases with temperature. The maximum output is equal to0.9 [mol CO2/ kg amine] using TEPA. The output of TEPA is twice as high as the outputof PEI.Using the experimental data from both tests, an energy model is made find the energypenalty of the desorption component. A base case study, a simple one-stage flash vesselat T = 120°C and p = 100 mbar, a total energy penalty of 18.1 and 33.6 MJ/ kg CO2,TEPA and PEI respectively. By altering the pressure and temperature the energy penaltycan be reduced to 16.6 [MJ/ kg CO2]. As the CO2demand is known, the correspondingneeded power is equal to 159 [W]. A design is suggested to put two flash vessels in parallelto reduce the H2O output of the system. At at temperature of 100 and 110°C with aconstant pressure of 100 mbar, a minimum of 15 [MJ/ kg CO2] is reached, a reductioni of 17% compared to the base case. Using a pinch analysis 93 [W] of the total 159 [W]can be retrieved by heat integration. Furthermore, the integration of a specially designedsolar boiler could provide the remained 66 [W] with heat","DAC; CO2; H2O; Desorptio; Absorption","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-09-23","","","","","",""

We assess the changes over time of the global reflectivity in the F850LP/F845M (methane) and F467M (blue) filters, adding more than 10 years of data to previous analyses. We see an increase in brightness in the methane filter from at least 1996 until 2009, followed by a decrease until today, as seen from cloud-free regions only. A similar behavior is observed in the blue filter, which reaches a maximum disk-averaged I/F value in 2002 and stays nearly constant until 2015, when the planet starts to darken. We also evaluate variations in individual latitudinal bands between 90°S and 50°N. We note the largest increases for southern mid-latitudes (65°S-30°S) for both filters, and the northernmost band (20°N-50°N) for the methane filter. The largest decreases are seen in the northernmost band for the blue filter and for southern near-polar (90°S-65°S) and mid- to low latitudes (50°S-5°N) in the methane filter. We perform radiative transfer modeling to assess the latitudinal variability in the hazes altitudes and to identify changes in the atmospheric vertical structure that may give rise to the observed trends. Adopting the SUNBEAR code and assuming a two-haze-layer model, we find an optically thin (τ α Æ 0.03) upper haze layer placed around 0.6 bar and an optically thicker (τ ß 2.2) lower cloud based at 4.1 bar. This model describes the observed I/F values of the atmosphere in 2009 as well as for 2015 for latitudes north of 30°S, but does not agree with southern latitudes, where the best fitting model demands a shallower pressure base (3.4 bar) and methane depletion (methane mixing ratio lowered from 0.05 to 0.03) for the lower haze. The parameters retrieved for 2002 hint at a higher altitude (2.6-3.0 bar) lower haze layer compared to both 2009 and 1996, with the largest difference occurring in relatively cloud-free latitudes (65°S-50°S and 30°S-5°N). The upheaval of the lower haze might be related to the strong cloud activity seen in 2002. Today, southern latitudes’ lower hazes have descended to deeper pressure levels (3.6-4.1 bar) with respect to 2009, and different scattering properties are seen for them at southern mid-latitudes and northern regions.","Neptune; Atmospheric science; Planetary Exploration; Planetary Sciences","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

However the uncertainty which surrounds the transition strategies hinders the decarbonisation efforts, leading investment decisions in CO2-reducing technologies to postponement. In this study, a set of optimally robust-performing policy options is identified for the effective decarbonisation of the container glass industry by 2050. By conducting techno-economic analysis on the processes of Dutch production sites, alternative technology options and their combinations are compared on the basis of their technical and financial feasibility. The robustness of decarbonisation strategies is determined on the basis of carbon emissions, energy consumption, product cost and return of investment and assessed under a wide spectrum of potential future events using a many-objective robust decision making technique. The study concludes on the importance of using alternative fuels (i.e. biomethane, electricity and syngas) as well as the coupling of waste heat recovery options with innovative furnaces for improving the melting activity. Further development of breakthrough technologies is necessary to achieve greater carbon emissions reduction, which will be supported by a sound regulatory framework for technology deployment.

Rijkswaterstaat, as the manager of the main inland waterways in the Netherlands, wants to be prepared for this technology. As the technology is still very immature, this research has attempted to reduce the amount of uncertainty in the effects and implications of this technology using a scenario analysis approach. As a result, the main research question is as follows: “What are the potential physical and digital implications for the waterway infrastructure of Rijkswaterstaat due to automated inland shipping in the Netherlands by 2050?”. As little research has been done regarding this topic, this research used literature regarding the diffusion and implementation of high-tech technologies and applied the insights from theory into a scenario analysis. This research used the intuitive logics approach for scenario analysis to develop four scenarios based on drivers, factors, and trends as found during nine expert interviews. Nine interviews were conducted to assess the uncertain trends in the development of automated inland shipping. As a result, technological development and niche development were found as the main trends that highly influence the technology and are both very uncertain. The resulting scenarios were called “Into the roots”, “Fairway bound”, “Business as Usual”, and “Market segmentation”. When the development of the scenarios was finished, an implication analysis was performed to answer the main research question. This was done by conducting an expert workshop. Six experts from Rijkswaterstaat, in the field of waterway management, and infrastructural design were present during the workshop. The scenarios were validated by the experts, and an open discussion was held to assess the implications per scenario. The results of the workshop were afterwards documented and analysed.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","Jumbo Maritime is a shipping company active in the heavy lifting market. Jumbo uses stabilisers to enlarge the stability of the ship during lifting. By using stabilisers Jumbo can perform heavy lifts with a relative small ship, this is one of the major advantages. Downside of using stabilisers is that the installation and de-installation is a time-consuming process. Besides that the usage also causes safety issues, more and more port authorities no longer approve the usage of stabilisers. Research is done in finding alternatives for the use of stabilisers, focusing on alternatives for new ships that need to be build. Looking at Jumbo’s position in the market shows the following unique selling points, for the J-type: • Limited draft compared to its competitors • Length &lt; 150 meters On the one hand the usage of smart stabiliser to speed up the installation and de-installation of stabilisers is looked at. Because smart stabilisers are still stabilisers, also alternatives are analysed that do not require a stabiliser at all. By widening the ship, the ship can be stable enough to perform lifts without extra support from stabilisers. A model is created to be able to determine the required width for each concept. This model is generated based on the input and requirements set by literature, market analysis and Jumbo’s specifications. Some of these requirements are: limited dimensions, minimum required stability, anti heeling and deadweight. The four concepts that are created as input for the model are: • Base concept, concept 1..., Concept 2... Concept 3...Concept 4...: A case study is performed to be able to compare the concepts. Three cases are created, which are actual relevant cases for JumboMaritime: For each concept the costs are determined to sail the certain case. Because the heavy lift market consists of somany single jobs that differ a lot on weight, complexity and distance it is difficult to map the revenues. The costs are determined per job, to be able to compare the different concepts. Costs consists of the capital costs, fuel costs and operational related costs. Besides cost per job, also cost per ton/mile is calculated to determine the economical speed. For case 1 the economical speed is 14 knots, which is similar to the required design speed. This means that the ships sails most cost efficient at this speed. The time that is saved by eliminating the stabiliser is used to reduce the sailing speed. In this way the same amount of jobs can done in the same time. This research shows that the saved fuel consumption as a result of slower sailing can compensate the longer sailing time and increased resistance for a wider hull concept. Comparing the concepts in the different cases shows that concepts 3 and 4 are more beneficial in case the stabiliser usages goes up. It can be concluded that awider hull shape can operate at 2-5%lower costs. The fuel consumption of the V-shape decreases more significantly at lower drafts. It is an advantage at ballast sailing or during sailing light cargoes. Besides the lower costs, the increase of deck space for the wider concepts is added value in the heavy lift market. An other important advantage of the wider ship concepts is the elimination of safety issues because the usage of stabilisers is not needed any more to lift heavy cargoes safely.","Stabiliser; Stability; Case study; Shipping managment; Maritime","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-07-31","","","","Marine Technology | Ship Design, Production and Operations | Shipping Management","",""

However, the fundamental idea behind implementing these methods is the same, i.e., to achieve the best possible estimate of a single target speech waveform. This thesis explores a different route using generative modeling with deep neural networks where speech is artificially generated by conditioning the model on previously predicted samples and features extracted from noisy speech. The proposed system consists of the U-Net model for enhancing the noisy features and the WaveRNN synthesizer (originally proposed for text-to-speech synthesis) re-designed for synthesizing clean sounding speech from noisy features. Subjective results indicate that speech generated by the proposed system is preferred over listening to noisy speech however, the improvement in intelligibility is not significant.","Generative Model; Machine Learning; Speech Enhancement; Neural Networks; Speech Synthesis; Deep Learning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-09-01","","","","","",""

Thermal hydrolysis process (THP) is a feasible pretreatment for AD by improving the biodegrdability of organic compounds. Partial nitritation/anammox (PN/A) process could be applied in side-stream for treating the reject water from AD since the reject water has a low ratio of COD/N. The prime microorganisms involved in PN/A process are anammox biomass, denitrifiers, ammonium oxidizing organisms (AOO) and nitrite oxidizing organisms (NOO). However, the compounds generated in THP may cause negative effect on microbial activities. In this research, characteristics of the reject water was clarified, and manometric method and respirometry method were used to determine the microbial activities by measuring the conversion rates of the substrates. A higher concentration of soluble COD, total ammonium as nitrogen (TAN) and refractory compounds were in the wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) with THP installation (i.e. Tilburg, Hengelo, Apeldoorn, and Amersfoort) than the ones in the WWTPs without THP pretreatment (i.e. Sluisjesdijk and Olburgen). Sluisjesdijk has one step PN/A process, while Olburgen has two steps PN/A process. Maximum specific anammox activity(SAA) among the studied WWTPs was found in Sluisjesdijk as 1.32±0.02 gN/gVS/day. THP installation could suppress the SAA value. The presence of refractory compounds may lead to the decrease of SAA. The denitrification activity was enhanced by the high concentration of COD generated in THP. The ratio of AOO activity to anammox activity were similar to the stoichiometry value of 1.32 in Sluisjesdijk Sharon reactor, Tilburg, Hengelo and Amersfoort.

As more people migrates towards cities, a rapid increase in motorization rates and the number of private vehicles will further aggravate the already apparent urban challenges. Factors such as increased congestion, pollution and noise will result in a deteriorating life quality in cities for its inhabitants. Due to the fact that younger generations have an more progressive stance towards sharing services, proven by the success of companies such as Uber and AirBnB, sharing economies hold great disruptive potential in terms of urban transport. Cities are taking action against private ownership. European cities make room for pedestrians by blocking privately owned vehicles and by giving priority to shared mobility systems. These changes in urban city planning directly affect Audi. Audi does not yet offer a mobility solution that can offer door-to-door transit in this future city context. Therefor, it is relevant to consider mobility solutions that will offer a full brand experience covering all areas of the city. As cities grow bigger and stronger, more issues will be addressed directly at the city level. Planned growth in Europe has provided the time and resources for smart city planning. The systematic analysis of monitored data will lead to a more efficient world. The efficiency will translate into how Audi Millennials will use products and their services. They as consumers will demand a constant and seamless integration concerning mobility. Cities are blocking the use of privately owned vehicles in their centres. Even though cities are becoming more efficient and sprawled with a wide variety of efficient travel modes, Audi Millennials are forced to transfer from one transportation mode (and provider) to another in order to get to their destinations. This disconvenience leaves the door open to more premium travel experiences. Being able to provide a single travel mode and provider that will grant them access to all the city’s destinations will grant a premium experience through accessibility. The design makes use of two transport modes. One for travel on the city’s main roads and one for access to the city’s car-blocked areas. The first transport mode is a mobile HUB, which provides comfortable travel on the city’s main roads. The so called last-mile EV’s grant the user access to car-blocked areas of the city.","Automotive design; Car Design; Shared mobility; Audi","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

It allows a spacecraft to approach a target celestial body and enter a (temporary) orbit around it without requiring manoeuvres in between. Ballistic capture is a promising concept, as it is expected to be safer, cheaper, and more flexible in terms of launch windows than a traditional Hohmann transfer. Currently, a computationally efficient method which simulateneously allows for an inisghtful description of the dynamics of the ballistic capture problem remains to be found. A potential solution lies within the field of Lagrangian Coherent Structures (LCS). LCS is defined as a separatrix of regions in a flow with distinct dynamics. It may be possible that LCS around a planet have some correspondence to results found using stable set manipulation, a classic technique for obtaining capture trajectories. In this research three new areas within the field relating LCS to ballistic capture are explored. Firstly, it has not yet been shown what LCS can be found in an area around a planet, without making use of a priori stable set information. Furthermore, it is unclear what the effect is of changing the integration time in the procedure of extracting LCS. Finally, there has not yet been an analysis to show how the LCS relate to stable sets with different number of revolutions n. In this work two algorithms for extracting LCS have been developed. One is based on the simple but efficient computation of the Finite Time Lyapunov Exponent (FTLE). Another is based on the more involved Variational Theory. Both algorithms are validated on a toy problem used frequently in LCS extraction studies, and are then applied to the Elliptic Restricted Three Body Problem (ERTBP). It is shown that LCS around a planet yield resemblance with stable set results. The FTLE-based algorithm is able to quickly and efficiently identify the shape of the stable set. The Weak Stability Boundary, however, can not be extracted distinctly. The Variational Theory-based algorithm yields more distinguishable results for the Weak Stability Boundary. It is shown that large and constant integration times are beneficial. It is shown that extracted LCS form an approximation of the average resulting WSB for all stable sets.","ballisitic capture; lagrangian coherent structures; dynamical systems; stable sets; weak stability boundary","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

In July 2019 the first Student for River Camp is organized. Students from the Balkan, and the rest of Europe, applied for a week of lectures and activities at the Soča river in Slovenia. It is identified that these students, in varying degree, lack the knowledge of the cultural and political system that drives corruption in hydropower development. To transfer this knowledge, the medium of serious game is chosen, due to its effective, engaging and reusable nature. The aim of this project is therefore to: Design a serious game that engages the students participating in the Students for Rivers Camp, educate them in the complex system of hydropower development, And Inspire them in using their expertise and ambition for Balkan river conservation. To achieve this, the problem is investigated first. The culture of corruption is the result of the Balkan’s turbulent past, and manifests itself in a combination of bribing, threatening, rule bending and nepotism. The story to tell is that of Government officials and Hydropower companies enriching each other, over the backs of the local communities. The banks who invest in the hydropower projects don’t know, or don’t want to know about this. Activists try to stop hydropower development by activating the local community. The corruption game uses a combination of game mechanics to simulate this story. There are several characters to play, each with different and confliction goals and rules. Some want to develop hydropower dams, others try to prevent that. A stack of event cards guide the players through the game. The game is finished with a group evaluation, and individual assignment. The corruption game has been successfully tested at the Students for River Camp. 42 students and lectures played it as part of the program. It has been evaluated positively in achieving its goal. The game have been referenced multiple times throughout the week by lecturers, students and organization alike. Plans have been made to develop the project further, doing a final iteration.

(mentor); Kawasaki, S. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","During the past decade, Implantable biomedical devices have emerged as an efficient treatment for neurological disorders. Among them, low-intensity focused ultrasound (LIFU) has recently gained interest due to its focusing ability, depth of penetration and reversible effects. Although the exact biophysical mechanism that leads to the interaction between ultrasound and neurons is not clear yet, many successful applications have been reported both in vitro and in vivo in animals, raising prospects for clinical applications. Nevertheless, treatments were mainly delivered transcranially due to the lack of implantable technologies, constraining the frequency range to below 1 MHz. Thanks to the development of biocompatible capacitive micromachined ultrasound transducers (CMUTs), ultrasound has become implantable, opening the way for high frequency ultrasound neuromodulation. In addition, implantable biomedical devices are becoming smaller and smaller, requiring their power supply to follow this trend. Batteries can be a limiting factor for their miniaturisation and other powering methods have been investigated. Among them, ultrasound as a means to wirelessly transfer power represents the best trade-off between the amount of available power, implanted receiver size, and depth of penetration. Also in this case, biocompatible CMUTs could be used as transducers to power an implanted device. Yet they require a DC bias source in the order of tens of volts which is not practical for an implanted device. In this thesis the application of ultrasound for implantable biomedical devices is investigated. First, the modulation of the excitability of in vitro mice hippocampal brain slices (normal and epileptic) using high frequency sonication protocols is explored. Secondly, wireless power transfer using CMUT devices with charges trapped in the dielectric which do not require a DC bias voltage is investigated. The results indicate that high frequency ultrasound clearly affects the excitability of neurons, having an excitatory effect when delivered using a 5 MHz continuous wave sonication protocol, while it inhibits the neurons when they are exposed to pulsed wave ultrasound at 13 MHz. The intensities used were in line or much lower compared to values used by other groups of researchers. In addition, ultrasound power transfer with an efficiency higher than 48% was achieved using CMUT devices with charges permanently trapped in their Al2O3 layer. This efficiency was in line with values obtained by other groups using piezoelectric transducers. <br/>Based on these results, it is clear that ultrasound, specifically using implantable CMUT devices, has a great potential to be used in bioelectronic medicine applications for both the treatment of neurological disorders as well as a means of power transfer.","Ultrasound; Neuromodulation; Power transfer; CMUT","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

Since all sectors are electrifying and variable renewable energy (VRE) is being deployed more quickly than transmission and distribution operators are able to connect them to the electricity grid. Flexible capacity on multiple positions along the electricity value chain is needed to maintain stability of the network. However, the original design of the grid was not based on decentralized and variable generation. Together with uncertain regulations that are not up-to-date with innovations in the grid. Results in multiple barriers that the ESS needs to overcome and therefore have not been widely integrated yet. Since investment decisions by decision-makers are not only based on technical and economic features but also on social and environmental features better insight in the impact of different power system design is needed. <br/><br/>Several studies have been performed on the tech-economic modelling of singular ESS services, often using perfect foresight for prices and market behavior for different parts of the electricity value chain. This work presents foundation for valuation of ESS for industrial sites in the Netherlands in a future scenario with large increase of VRE in the energy mix.<br/>Since energy systems are highly complex systems. Modelling and simulation is performed to get a better understanding of the system by simplifying interactions and functional relations within the industrial power system. Hence, the model provides insights that help to reevaluate the power operation of an industrial cluster. As a result it helps to reshape the power system investment strategy for the future. Considering that ESS are multi-applications this study analyses how different operations strategies including multiple services influence the performance of the industrial power system. The operation strategies of enhancing self-consumption (greedy) and peak shaving are compared on the following performance indicators: self-consumption, self-sufficiency, utilized and unutilized VRE, size of network connection, capacity for flexibility and influence of transit power generation. The greedy and peak shaving operations are simulated in combination with the services of providing transit power for back-up generation and ability to provide flexibility service for the imbalance market.<br/><br/>The model is run for three different industrial loads (scenarios) for five different configurations of either a Photo-Voltaic (PV) system or a PV system in combination with an ESS. In all scenarios, the power systems performance is better when ESS is integrated in comparison to the PV-system. In the scenarios the scoring varies considerably between the configurations, primarily due to the heterogeneity of the used load profiles. Hence, allowing to identify the characteristics of industrial load profiles more suitable for a combined PV and ESS system. The results of this study are relevant for decision-makers considering to adapt their power system design strategy by providing a better understanding of their system. It shows how different services run in parallel allow the ESS to be operated less idle. Nevertheless, should decision-makers establish operational priorities since some services can be competitive and<br/>result in a sub-additive value. Furthermore, can the findings help policy makers and utilities to see what the influence is of increased VRE generation at the industrial load side of the network on the larger system.","Energy storage; Renewable integration; Valuation; Evaluation; Industrial load","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

However, current services fail to support them or even counter them, with their manipulative media-platforms in favor of their goals often at the cost of people’s goals. This creates a world of regret instead of happiness. The student of this graduation project claims that media entertainment designers should feel responsible to design services that respect and allow people to pursue their goals in finding happiness through it. This project can be considered an example, or even proof that there is indeed a manner to realize that and that, as company, it is crucial to do so as people are starting to reject services that are threatening their happiness. <br/><br/>APPROACH <br/>This graduation project first investigated what happiness consisted of, and how media entertainment could contribute to that. The conclusion was that people need to engage in mindful, intentional, intrinsically motivated media-experiences which well-balances short-term pleasure (Hedonia) with long-term happiness (Eudaimonia). Then, current platforms were analysed to understand why they exist and why they are currently designed the way they are and how this affects well- being. The conclusion was that current streaming-platforms are being created to maximize media-consumption which resulted in an over-focus on hedonia at the cost of eudaimonia and therefore people’s long-term happiness. As ViP focuses on re-framing and reinvention by creating future opportunities, instead of solving the present-day problems, a future context of 2020 had been outlined through an extensive analysis using academic literature, trend reports- and sites and interviews. The result was three meta-factors that described the world of 2020 as “embracing the mindful pursuit of meaningfulness’. <br/><br/>SOLUTION <br/>ViP states that as a designer, you should take a position in this future vision. The goal of this project is to design a new streaming-platform that improves people’s well- being through media-entertainment, which resulted in the following statement: <br/>I want to empower people to experience media-entertainment meaningfully, by guiding them in articulating their intentions through trusted others. <br/><br/>DESIGN <br/>The new concept considers media-entertaiment as meaningfull experience packages and facilites people in finding these packages through the suggestions of trusted others, such as people close to the user (like family and friends) but also famous people/accounts (like inspirational influencers or design blogs). <br/>Plus it empowers people to experience these entertainment-packages meaningfully by increasing their mindfulness through 6 steps.<br/>The concept contributes to well-being by focussing on improving both the hedonic and the eudaimonic experience by increasing people’s autonomy, competence and relatedness, focussing on personal growth, achieving goals, finding meaning in life and improving people’s vitalty by better self-regulating their media-behavior. <br","Well-being; Meaningful; Streaming; Platform","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

LLC resonant converters are replacing forward converters in DC-DC conversion due to their higher efficiency and magnetic integration. Size reduction in LLC resonant converter is possible by shifting towards 500kHz operation. But this shift comes with additional problems with regards to control mechanism and switching losses. The aim of this thesis is to design and prototype an LLC resonant converter. Problems associated with design and operation at 500kHz are identified and solutions are suggested to overcome such problems. The operation principle of LLC resonant converter is also explained in detail.

(graduation committee); van Deyzen, Alex (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","When lifting operations are performed by a heavy lifting vessel, the motions of the vessel and cargo are predicted by conventional six degrees of freedom calculations. It is assumed that the cargo is attached to the crane top in order to decrease the stability of the vessel and perform accurate calculations. While these conventional calculations can be used to calculate the vessel motions and themotions of the crane top, the cargo motions are not taken into account. In conventional calculations the dynamical aspects of the cargo are not taken into account and the forces due to cargo motions are neglected. In several recent projects carried out by BigLift Shipping swell waves have presented BigLift Shipping with challenges. Due to these swell waves the vessel and cargo where excited which caused problems during these lifting operations. Therefore BigLift Shipping is intrested in a method to calculate the vesselmotions in combination with the cargo motions. There are two objectives of the research presented in this report. The first objective is to increase knowledge of the dynamical effects of the cargo on the vessel motions and vice versa. The second objective of this research is to investigate if it is possible to reduce the cargomotions during lifting operations by changing variables in a lifting plan or by controlling the cargo with cargo control systems. To fulfill both objectives a tool is created. The tool that is created is a mathematical model of the vessel and cargo body. In this model the vessel and cargo are modelled as a multi-body system and is based on the frequency domain. A multi-body frequency domain model is able to calculate the responses of both the vessel and cargo motions quickly. For the input of the model the vessel constraints of the vessel and cargo body with each other and the outside world has to be described in a mathematical way. The constraints can be divided over four different modules. The first module of constraints follow from the vessel hydrodynamics. The connection of the cargo to the vessel via the crane cable are described in the second module. The influences of mooring lines on the multi-body system are described in the third module. Lastly the influences of cargo control systems are described in the fourth module. With the different modules the influence of variables of a lifting operation on the vessel and cargo motions can be studied. The output of the tool consists of the vessel RAOs. Together with wave spectra calculations these RAOs can be translated to response spectra and most probable maximum values. The tool that is created is used to fulfill the two research objectives. First a set of calculations are done to determine the baseline responses of the multi-body system. Different variables of a lifting operation are varied and the influence of the cargo mass, crane cable length, crane top position, vessel draught and vessel metacentric height are studied. This study showed that these variables can have a large influence on the responses and natural frequencies of the multi-body system. Cargo control systems are also implemented in the multi-body model. Calculations that included cargo control systems showed that the increased stiffness of such systems can vary the natural frequencies of the different degrees of freedom in the multi-body model. When damping is applied via cargo control systems the most probable maximum values of the motions can be reduced with maximumof 55.3%.","Hydromechanics; multi-body; Ship response; Cargo Handling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Marine Technology","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution); Universiteit Leiden (degree granting institution)","2019","A circular economy (CE) is seen as needed in all industry sectors to manage finite resources and to reduce the impact of production and consumption of goods on the planet. While the food and beverage industry has already many measurements in place to ensure cleaner production, a transition towards a CE requires a broader systems perspective. Insights from the field of Industrial Ecology (IE) are used to develop ways to measure CE. Based on the biological loop of the butterfly diagram of the Ellen MacArthur foundation, water, organic materials and especially nutrients were defined as core focus points for a CE in the food and beverage industry. A CE for this sector needs to include a systems perspective, minimizing losses of nutrients, water, and energy along the entire life-cycle of products. In contrast to the technical loop, it is significantly more challenging to achieve a closed loop as production is connected to natural processes (when growing the raw materials). However, companies can develop strategies to take into account best practice of resource use. To best support companies in developing strategies for business models for a CE, a review of existing business models was performed. CE was explored within the overarching category of sustainable business models to ensure the development of a Circular Economy Business Model Canvas (CEBMC). Based on this CEBM canvas, a set of 14 CE indicators was developed in the form of a scorecard to measure the progress of companies in the food and beverage industry in terms of CE. These indicators are based on water, material, nutrients, energy, customer, supply, production (water &amp; energy), employees, partners, transportation, packaging, profit, system consideration, and pollution prevention and were obtained by letting companies fill in a questionnaire with a set of 24 questions (see appendix IV). The indicator results are shown in a spiderweb and were presented as equal (thus not weighed) as CE is considered an equally important element in all aspects of the BM canvas. The CEBM canvas and the CE indicator scorecard are available for use in Microsoft Excel. The developed canvas and indicator scorecard were reviewed and validated through a peer review session, experts from academia, consultancies and companies in the field. A thesis research project with SEMiLLA IPStar B.V., the technology transfer partner of the MELiSSA space program, and a pilot study of the BioMakery at the La Trappe brewery in Koningshoeven, Tilburg, showed the functioning of the framework in practice, including its strong and weak points.

If the CKD is undetected, people have the risk to develop progressive loss of kidney function, which can lead to kidney failure. People with kidney failure will need dialysis to take over the kidney function. For the hemodialysis a vascular access is needed, currently the preferred vascular access is an Arteriovenous fistula (AVF). But the AVF still has the limitation that maturation failure is a significant problem. The maturation failure is mainly caused by stenosis and thrombosis at the venous side of the AVF. To successfully mature the vein needs to adapt to the changes due to the creation of the AVF. Due to the higher shear stress, some of the endothelial cells in the AVF could be damaged, due to this damage arterial and venous vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) are directly exposed to the blood flow. This means there will be a direct shear stress on the VSMCs. Besides this direct shear stress, venous VSMCs are also exposed to a much higher shear stress. The difference in response to this higher shear stress between the arterial and venous VSMCs may cause the problems within the AVF. In order to assess the difference in response between arterial and venous VSMCs flow experiments were performed with the IBIDI flow culturing system. HUASMCs, HUVSMCs and human primary VSMCs were used in these flow experiments. Immunofluorescence and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) were performed to analyze the outcome of the flow experiments. This study shows that there is a difference between arterial and venous VSMCs in response to shear stress in alignment of the VSMCs after the flow experiments and within the RNA expression. But further research is necessary to confirm these findings. The results and set up of this study are a good basis for future research into the difference between arterial and venous VSMCs.","Vascular Smooth Muscle Cells; Arteriovenous fistula; Shear Stress; Flow experiments; IBIDI flow culturing system","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-10-01","","","","","",""

This has resulted in the need for defense mechanisms, to effectively detect both known and unknown data exfiltration scenarios over the network. While methods such as DPI (Deep Packet Inspection) are commonly used to detect data exfiltrations, this mechanism requires a thorough inspection of every payload or packet going out of the network, making it unsuitable for use in some environments, as it is quite resource intensive and can lead to severe data privacy implications. In our work, we use lightweight netflows which are non-privacy invasive to detect data exfiltrations at connection-level granularity. The key intuition behind our proposed solution is that connections involved in data exfiltration tend to differentiate themselves from normal network connections based on certain feature values. The result of this research shows that features extracted from netflows such as the duration of a netflow, the source bytes, the source bytes sent per second, the source bytes sent per packet and the producer-consumer ratio can be used to effectively detect data exfiltration. Subsequently, connections are grouped using k-means, and the robust Z-score of their distances from their respective cluster centroid is used as a statistical and distance-based technique to detect connections involved in a data exfiltration. While this method detects some data exfiltration scenarios, it results in a significant number of false positives. Combining this with the results from the LOF (local outlier factor) and the LoOP (local outlier probability), which are density-based techniques, leads to a more robust model, as it significantly reduces the number of false positives and false negatives. Also, we show that using the smallest clusters formed from k-means for analysis leads to similar detection results as the entire datasets, with a significant reduction in computation time.","Data exfiltration detection; netflows; local outlier probability; local outlier factor; anomaly detection; network traffic analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science | Cyber Security","",""

(mentor); Negenborn, R.R. (graduation committee); Baggen, J.H. (graduation committee); Crombach, Paul (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","A significant part of the revenue generated by KLM Cargo comes from transporting temperature- sensitive goods. Currently, KLM Cargo faces quality issues in the handling processes of these goods which may lead to significant loss in revenue, and the risk of not generating new revenue. This research focuses on the improvement of the performance of the handling processes of temperature-sensitive goods at the warehouses of KLM Cargo. The main research question answered in this research is: ‘How can the overall performance of the handling processes of temperature-sensitive goods in the KLM Cargo warehouses be improved?’ The current state of the handling processes of temperature-sensitive pharmaceutical and perishable goods is analysed by using the Delft Systems Approach and the principles of lean manufacturing. The current state analysis shows that the temperature-sensitive goods are out of refrigerated storage for long periods of time or are stored in the wrong refrigerated storage area (perishables and pharmaceuticals are not to be stored together). This is mainly due to insufficient capacity of processes and facilities, the erratic arrival pattern of air cargo and the presence of non-value added process steps. It is concluded that KLM Cargo currently does not use adequate Key Performance Indica- tors (KPIs) that describe the performance of the handling processes of temperature-sensitive goods. Thus, new KPIs have been proposed. These are the Time Out of Refrigeration (TOR), the number of storage violations and the on-time performance on handling deadlines. The TOR is calculated as the amount of time a shipment is present at the Schiphol hub, but is not stored in a refrigerated area. The number of storage violations represents the number of times a cool storage area has insufficient capacity and the on-time performance shows the percentage of shipments that are delivered on-time according to the handling deadlines set up by KLM Cargo. The overall performance of the handling processes of temperature-sensitive goods can be improved by decreasing the TOR while the amount of storage violations and the on-time performance do not deteriorate. In order to reach the research objective, multiple design options are proposed. The different design options should meet the requirements for the handling of temperature-sensitive goods as well as the procedures laid out in the rules and regulations. Discrete Event Simulation (DES) is used to model the system and test the effects of the different design options. The system performance is measured by the TOR, the number of storage violations and the on-time performance. In the current state the average throughput time of a temperature-sensitive shipment is xxx minutes, of which the shipment spends xxx minutes out of a refrigerated area. The number of storage violations is approximately xxx shipments per day, or xxx shipments per year. There are three design options tested in the DES model, they consist out of the following: 1) the removal of non-value added processes, 2) levelled truck arrivals by optimal supply chain collaboration and 3) an input controller to control the arriving cargo at the Schiphol hub. Input data consisted of a truck and flight arrival schedule based on actual data along with a synthesised dataset which contains the amount of freight per shipment, the type of product, the type of cargo and the departure times. Each design option was run 25 times for a simulated duration of 365 days. The results were averaged and analysed in order to choose the best design option. The optimal way to improve the overall performance of the handling processes of temperature- sensitive goods is found to be the implementation of an input controller at KLM Cargo. In this design option, an input controller is designed that decides if arriving cargo is accepted for further handling in the KLM Cargo warehouses. If adequate handling can be ensured, the cargo is accepted for further handling within the warehouses of KLM Cargo. If adequate handling cannot be ensured, the cargo is ordered to wait outside of the KLM Cargo premises and is put into a queue with other cargo that cannot enter the warehouse yet. The moment adequate handling can be ensured again, the cargo with the shortest transit time is ’pulled’ from the queue and accepted into the warehouse for further handling. Implementing this design option resulted in a xx% decrease of the TOR, a xx% decrease in storage violations while the on-time performance did not deteriorate and compliance is adhered to. This design option does however increase the chance of cargo missing their flight, as waiting times are added for shipments that are not directly allowed to enter the warehouse. At the same time, this phenomenon creates an incentive for customers to deliver their cargo on-time. For future research it is recommended to look further into other potential control strategies that include demand forecasting. In order to address the cost aspect of the performance, it is suggested to investigate the devaluation of temperature-sensitive goods when they are not stored in a refrigerated area. Finally, it is recommended to extend this research on the entire supply chain from shipper to consignee in order to get insights in the performance per lane.","Cargo Handling; Schiphol; Temperature- Sensitive Goods; Cool Chain; Warehouse Handling Pro- cesses; OTP; DES; Time out of Refrigeration","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Marine Technology | Transport Engineering and Logistics","",""

Approaching the vascular aspect of such a model, we aimed to develop a method to differentiate induced pluripotent stem cells derived from PAH patients into functional endothelial cells, while also developing a framework for their incorporation into the engineered heart tissue model alongside PAH cardiomyocytes.<br/><br/>Based on a literature review of endothelial differentiation methods, a novel differentiation protocol was designed and validated by exploring the quality of endothelial differentiation through gene, protein, and functional characterizations as compared to undifferentiated stem cells and primary endothelial cells. Investigation of their phenotype revealed that the differentiation protocol developed here effectively produces populations of immature PAH endothelial cells that replicate many of the attributes of mature primary endothelial cells, while preliminary work has demonstrated successful integration alongside cardiomyocytes into the engineered tissue matrix. While further research is still necessary to optimally vascularize the engineered tissues using these differentiated endothelial cells, this research marks the first time patient-derived PAH endothelial cells have been integrated into an engineered heart tissue model, moving a complete 3D model of PAH one step closer to reality.","Differentiation; Disease modeling; Pulmonary hypertension; Tissue engineering; Stem cells","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-09-19","","","","","",""

This study aimed to investigate the ability of the hyaluronic acid-albumin based hydrogel to support viability, proliferation and chondrogenic differentiation of synovial mesenchymal stem cells, as a potential strategy for endogenous stem cell regeneration treatment of articular cartilage defects. Methods: Cell viability and proliferation were analyzed by fluorescent activated cell sorting, using DAPI staining for viability and EdU staining for proliferation. The retention of mesenchymal stem cell specific immunophenotype during culture and its modulation during chondrogenesis were analyzed using fluorescent activated cell sorting. Chondrogenic differentiation was verified by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction for the expression of genes associated with chondrogenesis. Finally, histology and medium analysis were performed to evaluate glycosaminoglycan content in the samples. Cells from different donors were included to evaluate donor variability. Results: Primary synovial cells in the hydrogel were viable up to 28 under both expansion and chondrogenic culture conditions. Synovial mesenchymal stem cells can proliferate in the hyaluronic acid-albumin hydrogel when cultured with platelet derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB) but not with fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2). Primary synovial mesenchymal stem cells can chondrogenically differentiate in the hydrogel as confirmed by chondrogenic gene expression analysis, produced glycosaminoglycans in the culture medium and histology. Finally, primary synovial mesenchymal stem cell CD90 and CD73 marker expression in the hyaluronic acid-albumin hydrogel was gradually lost during expansion, while during chondrogenesis both markers expression was retained but the CD90+/CD73+ cells decreased over time. Conclusions: In vitro evaluation of the hyaluronic acid-albumin hydrogel indicates that it is a promising candidate biomaterial for supporting endogenous stem cell regeneration of cartilage defects.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-09-19","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

IAIs are caused by pathogens adhering to the implant surface. One method to prevent IAIs is through the use of surface topography modifications. Cellular behaviour has been shown to be influenced by substrate surface topographies. Ideally, a topography that can simultaneously kill bacteria and promote osseointegration is desirable. In previous research, proved-to-be-bactericidal nanopillars of ~180 nm in height and ~80 nm in diameter were fabricated at 170 nm interspace, resulting in a bactericidal efficiency of 36 ± 5% for Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus). The current research aimed to enhance this bactericidal efficiency by producing nanopatterns with different interspace distances and introducing disorder, while keeping the same nanopillar dimensions. The patterns have been produced by using electron beam induced deposition (EBID) at 100, 170, 300 and 500 nm interspacing. A disordered version of the 170, 300 and 500 nm samples was included with 45, 110 and 210 nm disorder distance, respectively. In order to keep the nanopillar dimensions consistent, EBID parameters were systematically optimised. The nanopatterns were interfaced with S. aureus cells and the bactericidal efficiencies were determined by counting the number of healthy, deformed and dead bacterial cells. For the ordered 100, 170, 300 and 500 nm interspace nanopatterns, bactericidal efficiencies of 62.3 ± 23.1%, 45.0 ± 31.4%, 8.6 ± 4.2% and 3.7 ± 2.3% were found, respectively. For the disordered 170, 300 and 500 nm interspace nanopatterns, bactericidal efficiencies of 45.9 ± 29.2%, 14.7 ± 7.2% and 12.7 ± 9.8% were found, respectively. These results showed a significantly higher bactericidal effect on lower-interspace nanopatterns. Disordered nanopatterns showed only slightly higher bactericidal efficiencies when compared to the ordered nanopatterns. This data indicated that bactericidal efficiencies could be increased relative to the previous nanopattern design. The findings of this research aid in developing antibacterial nanopatterns that are capable of killing gram-positive bacteria and support the path to prevention of IAIs.","bactericidal; nanopattern; nanoscale additive manufacturing; electron beam induced deposition; antibacterial; nanopillars; topography modification; nanostructured surfaces","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-09-13","","","","Biomedical Engineering | Biomaterials and Tissue Biomechanics","",""

While looking into the cost components of the TCO and comparing this with a diesel truck, the boundary conditions for feasibility arise. This thesis identifies three sorts of boundary conditions. First of all, the availability of hydrogen refuelling stations (HRS) and the deployment of the hydrogen truck. Secondly, the affordability (TCO) of a hydrogen truck is primarily determined by the economy of scale. The effects of this are the most influential for the production of hydrogen and the hydrogen truck. Thirdly, the most important robustness in operation boundary conditions are the hydrogen storage techniques and there fuelling speed.

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","class=""MsoNormal"">Maintenance providers in commercial aviation are looking into new strategies to improve maintenance operations and aircraft availability in order to reduce cost and increase customer satisfaction. Aircraft availability and thus profitability highly relies on adequate maintenance because an aircraft is only profitable when flying. One of the strategies that can be used to achieve higher aircraft availability is Predictive Maintenance (PdM). The new generation of aircraft produces a flood of data enabling PdM, a maintenance strategy in which failure scan be predicted and maintenance takes place proactively instead of reactively. PdM is enabled by prognostics, which is an engineering discipline that aims to estimate the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of(aircraft)components. However, using prognostic information effectively and determining the benefits and impact on processes in the supply chain of these maintenance providers still proves to be very difficult in practice. This is amplified by the fact that this prognostic information is imperfect, not only can prognostic models produce false alarms or fail to predict coming failures, the exact timing of these events is subject to uncertainties. On top of that, little research into the benefits of prognostic information in supply chains is available. Especially, research considering global supply chains with pool processes such as in commercial aviation, is very limited. Efficiency of supply chains in commercial aviation is important in order to increase aircraft availability, reduce delays and cancellations, and reduce supply chain operating costs. This study provides a novel approach to using imperfect prognostic information to optimize a global supply chain considering a pool process and answers there search question: ’How to optimize a supply chain in commercial aviation using imperfect prognostic information?’ A discrete simulation model has been selected and developed for the simulation of a global supply chain of spare components for Boeing 787 aircraft at KLM Engineering and Maintenance(E&amp;M). This discrete simulation model provides insight in processes in this supply chain while simultaneously considering uncertainties and maintaining a superior computational time. Model verification shows thatthe model is programmed correctly and model validation shows the programmed model accurately represents the real supply chain in a case study at KLME&amp;M. Simulation and optimization shows that enabling the supply chain at KLM E&amp;M with prognostics can reduce the total cost by 20% per year. Results show that the prediction horizon, which is the amount of time failures can be predicted in advance, is the main contributor to this reduction in cost. Not only does this prediction horizon provide the supply chain department with enough time to ship components in a cheap manner, replacing components long before the failure massively reduces damage and thus repair cost. However, a sensitivity analysis shows there is a clear trade-off between minimizing cost and a reduction of the Mean Time Between Removals(MTBR). Cost can be minimized by predicting failures12 days in advance, which simultaneously results in an MTBR reduction of 2.1%.This effect can be mitigated when the accuracy of prognostic models is increased. Furthermore, there duction in cost heavily relies on the percentage of aircraft in the pool for which failures can be predicted.  This research shows the effects and potential benefits of using imperfect prognostic information in a supply chain in commercial aviation. Recommendations for further research are provided in order to use prognostics to optimize the entire logistics supply chain of aircraft maintenance, including the phase-out, reuse, and recycling of aircraft and their components. This could have a huge impact on the environmental impact and sustainability of the global industry that is commercial aviation.   ","Prognostics; Commercial Aviation; Supply Chain; Imperfect demand information; Inventory Optimization; Spare parts; Design of Experiments; Aircraft Maintenance; Predictive Maintenance; Condition Based Maintenance","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-09-01","","","","","",""

Despite this, today’s industrialization can not only be observed on land, but also increasingly in the marine environment. The “industrialization of the ocean” accelerates as sectors like offshore wind, deep water oil and gas as well as seabed mining emerge (Kronfeld-Goharani, 2018; OECD, 2016, p. 18). Therefore, more sustainable practices are needed (GPM, 2015; Hahn, Pinkse, Preuss, &amp; Figge, 2015; Ugwu &amp; Haupt, 2007) and the dredging industry is transforming. Next to minimizing impact, the value adding function of marine infrastructure is increasingly recognized. As the ‘productive driver[s]’ of the industry, corporate organizations, like contractors, pertain a key role to achieve such sustainable development (Hahn, Pinkse, Preuss, &amp; Figge, 2015). Moreover, their innovative power provides the opportunity to bring about change in the industry and to leverage long-lasting competitive advantage (Kramer &amp; Porter, 2011; Zhang, Oo, &amp; Lim, 2018). Accordingly, to distinguish themselves during tendering and to thrive for profit maximization, conducting sustainable business becomes more and more important for contractors (R. Peenstra &amp; Silvius, 2017, Tan et al., 2015). Responsible operations are no longer up for discussion, but are becoming central to value creation (Epstein, 2018). This results in corporate sustainability strategies (Peenstra &amp; Silvius, 2017). The problem addressed by this study is the gap between strategy making and integration of sustainability on project level for contracting organizations. At present integrated approaches for sustainability implementation into practice are lacking (Epstein, 2018) and there is no systemic approach, how sustainability can be successfully integrated into projects (Sabini et al., 2019). Although most papers, studying sustainability in projects, provide managerial implications, their highly contextual conclusions can hardly be applied to other projects (Sabini et al., 2019). Therefore, sustainability integration remains fragmented and strongly correlates with the assigned project manager in charge of the project (van Walt Meijer, 2018; Wolfgang, 2017). Based on case study research, the study provides a success factor model entailing seven critical factors for success for pro-actively integrating sustainability into projects of marine contractors. For Science, this study unravels critical strains in managerial decision-making for sustainability on project level, which thus contributes to the scientific discussion thereof. For practice, the findings have the potential to go beyond highly contextual implications, though being derived from marine infrastructure context. This is because the seven critical success factors may provide guidance to other contracting organizations regarding the variables to consider to implement sustainability strategies on operational level. For science and practice, the conceptual C7 implementation approach tackles the need of an integrated systemic approach, which was claimed to be missing. It helps contractors to apply the (sub) success factors of the model in practice. The development areas (not, -or inconsistently fulfilled factors) can be derived and subsequently actions can be taken to close the gaps.","sustainability integration; marine infrastructure projects; contractor; success factor model; tendering; organizational change","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-02-03","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

Relatively high friction losses of the operating pushbelt are associated with the element saddle surface on which the steel rings are lying. The pushbelt runs between two pulleys which are variable in diameter and, therefore, slip between the elements and the steel rings occurs, which leads to these friction losses.</p> <p class=""MsoNormal"">In order to increase the efficiency and durability of the pushbelt, the shape and the surface roughness of the element saddle has to be adjusted such that the friction is reduced. The pushbelt element saddle surface is difficult to reach since it is situated in a small slot of the element, and in the production process, it is currently not specially treated after fine blanking.</p> <p class=""MsoNormal"">The requirements in order to achieve a friction reduction in the pushbelt's element-ring contact were specified in terms of average surface roughness R<sub>a</sub> along the long side of the element saddle, called the horizontal R<sub>a</sub>, and the radius across the short side of the element saddle, called the short saddle radius (SSR). </p> <p class=""MsoNormal"">A grinding machine was specially built for testing the feasibility of belt grinding for this purpose and to be able to produce pushbelt elements with the required adjustments for pushbelt efficiency tests.

Furthermore, it was investigated which are feasible process conditions in order to achieve the required grinding result, and how accurately the saddle surface characteristics can be predicted in dependency of the machine parameters.</p> <p class=""MsoNormal"">For this purpose, machine tests were executed and the ground element saddles were measured with the aid of a white light interferometer in order to evaluate the achieved response variables which are the surface roughness R<sub>a</sub> and the SSR. The measurements were analyzed in order to describe the relationship between machine parameters and obtained grinding result. Furthermore, the measurements were used to fit an empirical model to the data, and the applicability of a polynomial and also an exponential model was investigated.</p> <p class=""MsoNormal""> </p> <p class=""MsoNormal"">In preliminary machine tests, it was found that it is necessary to keep the elements in a certain distance in the element holder in order to achieve a stable grinding result. Furthermore, after the preliminary tests, the grinding belt grit size was specified and it was decided to hold the grinding speed constant during the final experimental design. The chosen predictor variables for the grinding result in the final experimental design were the grinding time and the pressure which is used in the pneumatic cylinder in the machine in order to bring the grinding belt to tension. A full factorial experimental design with nine duplication experiments was used, so in total 18 experiments, where the factors time and pressure were varied on three levels.</p> <p class=""MsoNormal""> </p> <p class=""MsoNormal"">It was concluded that the applied pressure, so the tension force in the grinding belt, is the dominating factor for the achieved size of the SSR. An increased pressure decreases the size of the achieved SSR and also the variation of the response variables of the samples is decreased at higher pressures. The achieved horizontal R<sub>a</sub> on the saddle is affected by both factors, time and pressure, however, the grinding time appears to have more influence. The empirical exponential model and also the polynomial model give a similar prediction for the grinding result within the experimental factor range, but beyond that range, it was found that the exponential model is able to make a better prediction. However, the predicted machine parameters from the exponential model, which would be necessary in order to achieve the desired grinding result according to the requirements, are not feasible. The needed pressure would be too low for the grinding belt to make sufficient contact with the saddle surface and the predicted grinding time would be very high.</p> <p class=""MsoNormal"">Within feasible machine conditions, the achieved SSR is always lower than specified in the requirements and decreases rapidly with increasing pressure. Additionally, the lowest roughness R<sub>a</sub> which can be achieved according to the exponential model is slightly higher than the requirement. This is consistent with the performed experiments and it was concluded that with the current machine configuration, the requirements cannot be achieved.</p> <p class=""MsoNormal""> </p> <p class=""MsoNormal"">It is recommended to execute further experiments with an element holder having an increased diameter since with the current holder, although the element's saddle was positioned at the desired radius, the achieved radius across the saddle surface was smaller after grinding. Furthermore, it is recommended to perform further experiments with different kinds of grinding belts having finer grain sizes for achieving a lower surface roughness or having structured abrasives for less variation and a better predictability in the grinding result.","Belt grinding; Pushbelt; CVT","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-09-01","","","","Mechanical Engineering | BioMechanical Design","",""

Key arguments to opt for glass in structural design are sustainability, aesthetics and transparency. As for all structural elements, glass elements are required to be structurally safe, even in extreme conditions such as during a fire. Building regulations demand a structural element to be able to withstand a fire for at least 30 minutes. There is however a lack of experimental results on the material properties and performance of structural glass elements at elevated temperatures. One of the key material properties that determines the performance of glass at elevated temperatures is its stiffness (Young’s modulus). In this research the Young’s modulus of both Sola Lime Silica (SLS) and Borosilicate (BS) glass is experimentally determined for temperatures up to 700°C. The transmittance time of high-frequency sound waves (ultrasound) is measured for both BS as SLS glass rods during heating in a tube furnace. From this data the Young’s modulus has been derived mathematically. Additionally, the effect of a low-E coating and an intumescent coating on the performance of laminated glass panels is experimentally determined and assessed. During heating of only one side of the laminated glass panels, the time until the interlayer starts to form gas bubbles is recorded, whereas the temperature of the glass has been measured on both sides of the glass panels. From the experiments it is observed that glass performs well up to temperatures of 500 °C, provided there are no distributed thermal stresses present in the glass. Given this condition, the remaining stiffness at a temperature of 500 °C is 90% for SLS glass and 102% for BS glass. As for structural steel this is only 60%, it is concluded that both SLS and BS glass outperform steel in terms of relative stiffness at elevated temperatures. Between 500 and 600 °C a sudden deformation is observed. Therefore the structural safety of a glass element cannot be guaranteed for temperatures beyond 500 °C. The heating of a glass element can be delayed by the application of an intumescent coating. For low-E coating, an improvement in fire resistance is however not proven in this research. Instead, a negative effect has been observed and therefore the application of low-E coating is not recommended. It was shown that the PVB interlayer is the weakest point of the glass element. At temperatures of 200 °C the PVB interlayer is already completely molten, while at 500 °C the glass is still intact. The fire resistance can be improved by applying glass without an interlayer.","Structural glass; Ultrasonic measurements; Elevated temperatures; Young’s modulus; Intumescent coating; Low-E coating; Borosilicate glass; Soda Lime Silica glass","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Building Engineering","",""

A BHS is a system that consists of different subsystems, each with its own functions. It is important to make well-informed decisions about the BHS as early as the conceptual design phase, which is the part of the design where the basic solution, such as system configuration (the type and amount of equipment) and system layout (volume reservation for the system), is selected. The choices made in this phase influences the cost, performance, and reliability of the system. Even though the impact of the choices in the conceptual design phase is high, tools to guide the decisions are lacking. Previous research by Noort (2018) and Vijlbrief (2019) has led to an initial model that automates the conceptual design of a BHS. This initial model still has major limitations which need to be resolved in order to finalize the model. Thus, the goal of this research is to improve the model by increasing both the usability and usefulness of the initial model. The usability has increased by decreasing the run time, writing a manual to motivate the learning of the model, and adding a dashboard to visualize the results. The usefulness has increased by expanding the scope of the model, increasing the model precision by limiting uncertainties, and adding levels of detail to the outcome. Since both facets of the model have been increased, it can be concluded that the adjustments made to the initial model can be seen as improvements. It can therefore be said that the model proposed in this research can be seen as an improved model for the conceptual design of baggage handling systems.","Baggage Handling System; Model improvement; Usability; Usefulness","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","",""

This repetitive nature leads to a need for a better understanding of the behaviour during installation of various jacket geometries. This need brings the research objective of this thesis to ""Development a parametrized motion prediction model for jacket installation."". A 2D numerical model of a jacket type support structure installation in the side-lead direction has been developed in Python with two ways of calculating the forcing. Both of these methods rely on the Morison equations. The first calculation method uses bins along the length of all jacket members. Current, waves and the jacket's motions result into a flow perpendicular to the member center lines. This flow is used to determine the drag and inertia loads exerted by the water. The second method uses an equivalent stick model. This is a cylinder with a varying diameter over its height, representing the jacket structure. Strictly horizontal water particle velocities and accelerations due to current, waves and structural movements are used. This, in combination with the reduced number of bins leads to a reduction in computational cost. To find the characteristics of the system a sensitivity study is performed. Based on environmental and operational measurements taken from five jacket installations, the input for simulations were set in the goal of reproducing the measured response. The environmental and vessel measurements did not satisfy the level of accuracy needed, leading to a mismatch in results. In most cases the jacket structure design for a project is a given, meaning that jacket weight and location of center of gravity are set. These properties have a big impact on the dynamic system, nevertheless, the rest of the system still gives opportunities for increasing the workable limits. Two effective examples of this is the weight of the jacket lifting tool and crane height. A stick model implementation of the hydrodynamic forcing gives results comparable to the member evaluation implementation. The natural frequencies from the FFT taken of the free vibrations match well. However, a small difference in damping is observed. The equivalent stick model provides good results for quick estimations at low computational cost. The response of three jacket designs is studied using a base case jacket for reference. Implementing a slender design with smaller member diameters results in lower jacket inclinations for comparable sea states. This comparison also holds as the significant wave height is increased. A coarser jacket design with bigger member diameters results into a higher response amplitude. However, the difference in response between the base case jacket and the coarse design fades as the significant wave height increases. The third considered design has suction buckets with a large diameter. These buckets make the system very susceptible to wave loading when lowered through the upper layer of the water column where the highest water particle velocities and accelerations are present. Concluding from the analyses, predicting the jacket motions during the installation phase with the numerical model with the equivalent stick implementation is most effective. The results are suitable for quick estimations. The numerical model with implementation of the member evaluation is preferred if more detailed results are needed.","Floating installation; Jacket; Offshore Wind; Renewable energy; Support structure","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-09-18","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

An increase in the by-pass ratio imposes structural constraints on the engine leading to a decrease in the axial distance between the rotor and the stator. The turbulent fan wake thus becomes more coherent on the OGVs, resulting in an increased tonal noise production. A test setup which can emulate the noise production mechanisms on a smaller scale and study the noise mitigation process is currently lacking. A characterization experiment of such a simplified test setup to assess its ability to predict the vortex-cascade interaction noise as in a realistic fan-stage is performed in this master thesis. The setup consists of an arrangement of linear cascade of OGVs, and a rod which mimics the rotor of a turbofan engine. Two experimental campaigns are undertaken. The first one consists of a wing (NACA 5406) and a rod mounted on flat plates. The wing mimics the mean aerodynamic loading of the central blade of the cascade. This experiment is performed to study the individual characteristics of the OGV blades, when placed in a cascade. The second setup is that of the Rod Linear Cascade model. Far-field directivity of noise sources are analysed using microphones placed on directivity arcs. Ability to quantify the upstream propagation of noise from the cascades is realized using a beamforming array, which is recessed on the test section wall and facing the pressure side of the OGVs. The flow-field at different locations in the test section is analysed using Hot-Wire Anemometry. The Hot-Wire measurements are also used to supplement the acoustic results. The test section is observed to successfully emulate the vortex-cascade interaction noise and this noise is observed to scale with the sixth power of flow speed. The beamforming array is found to help in improving the SNR of acoustic measurements in the test section and hence allows the quantification of the upstream propagation of vortex-cascade interaction noise.","Rod-Linear Cascade; Turbofan; Acoustics; Experiment","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering | Aerodynamics and Wind Energy","",""

To accommodate for large numbers of EVs, a considerable amount of additional charging infrastructure must be installed. Simultaneous charging of large quantities of EVs leads to peak loads in the energy grid. One way to overcome this is through smart charging. With smart charging the time of charging is postponed to a less busy moment, and the charging powers of cars are mutually balanced. <br/>In this report, a problem around a smart charging algorithm is presented. Information on session duration, required energy and EV parameters is not available. The current algorithm handles this lack of information perfectly but there might be room for improvement. Considering practical limitations, smart charging is currently implemented based on a round-robin scheduling algorithm. This is an efficient and fair way to distribute limited resources. Additional information is available in the form of predictions, which are subject to uncertainty. In this study we aim to improve the existing smart charging algorithm by using these predictions. <br/>Based on historical charging session data, an analysis will be made of the charging behaviour of different user types. Charging infrastructure is used by a mix of user types, each type having their own characteristics in terms of connection time and energy demands. This will serve as the basis for development of a simulation environment which will be used later to assess the performance of different smart charging algorithms. <br/>A new performance metric is introduced that describes the amount of inconvenience that users experience as a result of smart charging. In addition, a simulation-based optimization method is introduced that, using a posteriori information, minimizes total inconvenience. Next, three heuristics are proposed that approximate the global optimum using the available predictions. Simulations show that a relative improvement of 81.6% is achievable with the current accuracy level of the predictions. Moreover, these heuristics can deliver more energy from the same grid connection than the existing algorithm. This leads to more efficient use of grid connections, higher revenues for the Charge Point Operator (CPO) and higher user satisfaction.<br","Smart Charging; Prediction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-09-18","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","People with a shoulder amputation are very much dependent on active total arm prostheses to provide in their self-care and to perform basic daily activities. Research on the development of active upper limb prosthetics has been growing over the past couple of years. The state-of-the-art total prosthetic arms that have been developed are very advanced and have human-like strength and dexterity but at the same time are relatively heavy. Other prosthetic arms that have been developed are limited in their functionality and in the activities that can be performed, since they can only address a few DoF, have a limited RoM and can only carry a small payload. This lack of functionality and excessive weight are both factors for amputee patients to reject their prosthetic device. Rejection is clearly unwanted and therefore an alternative prosthetic arm design is desired. From the three conventional actuator technologies: electric motors, pneumatic drives and hydraulic actuators, the latter has the highest force/torque density and therefore it is expected that for the same force/torque output a more lightweight hydraulic actuator can be used. Since actuators determine the mass of the prosthetic arm to a great extent, it is expected that the choice for a hydraulic actuator will result in the design of a lightweight prosthetic arm. The goal of this thesis is to design a hydraulically actuated 4-DoF conceptual prosthetic arm, which includes the degrees of freedom of the shoulder and elbow joint and to validate the performance of the shoulder and elbow flexion mechanisms with a 2-DoF working prototype. The conceptual prosthetic arm is to be as light as a human arm and have the same functional use: a similar degree of freedom, range of motion and the ability to deliver comparable strength. Design requirements and a kinematic analysis of the prosthetic arm form the basis and boundaries for the design process. Several actuation mechanisms have been developed for each degree of freedom and the most suitable mechanisms have been combined into the design of the 4-DoF Hydraulic Prosthetic Arm. The Hydraulic Prosthetic Arm has a total weight of 2.75-2.9 kg including battery and is thereby lighter than a human arm (excluding hand), which weighs 3.1 kg on average. Tests with the 2-DoF working prototype have validated the shoulder and elbow flexion mechanisms and have shown their performance in terms of load lifting capability and rotational speed. The upper arm and forearm were able to lift a 500 gram and 2,500 gram load respectively at 15 bar pressure, which was the limit within the hydraulic circuit. The rotational speed of the upper arm and forearm was 11 and 9 degrees per second respectively. The Hydraulic Prosthetic Arm outperforms the existing lightweight prosthetic arms, but is inferior to the most advanced and state-of-the-art LUKE arm and Modular Prosthetic Limb in terms of shoulder joint RoM, joint speed and strength. However the Hydraulic Prosthetic Arm weighs 500 gram less than both these arms and therefore is expected to have a solid competitive advantage.","Upper limb prosthetics; Hydraulic Actuation; Design study","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-09-18","","","","Mechanical Engineering | BioMechanical Design","",""

This study examined how PTNs can be clustered into groups when considering multiple features. Centralization, accessibility, robustness, service connectivity and directness are five main considered network features used in previous studies to analyze the network structure. K-means, hierarchical clustering and principal component analysis were performed to identify the cluster of PTNs defined from those five features. To illustrate the method, we conducted a case study of 20 real-life rail-bound networks worldwide generated by the up-to-date general transit feed specification (GTFS) data. As a result, we were able to identify four main meaningful clusters: tram, tram-related, metro and tram and mixed modes. Although modes of transportation and the size of the network were not parts of features, they heavily influence the clusters.

TDCS has obtained much scientific interest and it promises many potential benefits to the patients.<br/><br/>However, tDCS that is performed today is almost the same with the method that was used 20 years ago (applying 2 mA current, during a 20 min session, using two large surface sponge electrodes). The tDCS module of the future must be characterized by increased portability, battery life and focality.<br/><br/>Many commercially available devices have very low power efficiency, leaving space for the design of low power consumption tDCS devices. Power efficient tDCS modules will also need lower battery capacity and thus lighter batteries, increasing the portability of the system. Regarding focality, there is increased interest from the researchers and physicians for multichannel devices that use small diameter electrodes. These devices can increase the focality and the accuracy of the delivered currents offering more targeted therapies.<br/><br/>In this thesis, the realization of a novel, low power, multichannel stimulation module, made with discrete components, which uses the ultra high frequency (UHF) technique for tDCS applications is implemented. With this approach, the technological benefits of the UHF stimulation technique, regarding increased multichannel power efficiency, are derived, combined with a cost effective, low scale production method. Moreover, contrary to previous integrated circuit (IC) realizations, current control feedback is added to the system.<br/><br/>In this thesis, three prototypes are fabricated, with the last one being an eight channel module that can be supplied from a 3.5 V battery and has a very linear relationship between the selected DAC’s codes and the output delivered current and, at the same time, being able to stimulate a wide range of loads (0.148 - 10.11 kΩ) up to 2 mA. Furthermore, the employed novel boost technique shows 40.57% maximum improvement of the power efficiency, compared to the use of a conventional buck-boost converter. Moreover, the feedback system shows significant robustness, achieving only 7.6% output current divergence for 6731% change of the output load’s impedance. The module has 4 μΑ resolution, which is translated to 0.2% of the maximum delivered current. Except from the high resolution, the system also has a fast transient response, which is less than 2.1 ms. Additionally, when one channel is active, the stimulator shows 43.84% maximum power efficiency. The aforementioned power efficiency is 23.49% higher than the maximum efficiency of state of the art adaptive voltage current source implementations. Additionally, the multichannel system was tested in real life scenarios and its efficiency was compared to a fixed voltage current source module. The system achieved 37.57%, 45.47% and 11.59% power efficiency improvements for two, four and eight channels respectively.<br/><br/>Hence, a novel, multichannel module, with current feedback, is created that offers both high accuracy and improved multichannel power efficiency. The proposed system offers significant benefits compared to the existing solutions. Therefore, the system can be used for future implementations of power efficient multichannel tDCS devices.","stimulator; tDCS; multichannel","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-09-18","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

(graduation committee); Henrotte, Johan (mentor); van den Bos, Jeroen (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","In this thesis, a general method to predict the notional permeability for various structure lay-outs is developed. A numerical model is used to find a characteristic value for different structure lay-outs: the three structures for which Van der Meer determined the P-value, and a fourth structure of which the P-value has to be predicted. The P-value of the fourth structure is predicted by interpolation of the characteristic value of this structure between the characteristic values found for the structures of Van der Meer. The numerical model used is the RANS-VOF model OpenFoam. The developed prediction method uses the total wave induced water pressure over the armour layer as characteristic value. The prediction method is validated for a structure lay-out for which (Kik, 2011) found a P-value of 0.37 by means of physical model testing. A P-value of 0.38 was found by (Kluwen, 2012) for the same structure lay-out by means of more physical model testing. The prediction method predicts a P-value in line with the P-value found by (Kik, 2011) and (Kluwen, 2012). The predicted P-value is 0.35 with this prediction method. A sensitivity assessment has been performed by varying the wave conditions, the porosity of the porous layers of the structure and the Forchheimer parameters applied in the numerical simulations. Results show that the prediction is not very sensitive to changes in the wave conditions or changes in the Forchheimer parameters. And although not confirmed by tests, it seems that the prediction method is not very sensitive for changes in the applied porosities of the porous layers of the structure with unknown P-value. Therefore, the method seems to be a robust method and can be practically used in engineering projects. With this new prediction method for the notional permeability of a breakwater, it is possible to make a more accurate estimate on the notional permeability for more complex rubble mound structures. A more accurate estimate of the notional permeability will improve the accuracy of the initial design of the armour layer in early stages of a project. A next step to further improve the predictions of the notional permeability and to gain a better understanding of the damage of the armour layer of a rubble mound breakwater, is to research the correlation between the wave induced water pressure over the armour layer, the discharge through the armour layer and the flow velocity on top of the armour stones and to research how the combination of these three parameters has influence on the armour layer stability.","CFD; Notional Permeability; Breakwater","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","",""

The mismatch between electricity supply and demand will become an increasingly<br/>pressing problem, due to the growing share of renewable energy production and the electrification of the automotive industry. The upcoming field of Solar Redox Flow Batteries (SRFB) proposes a possible solution in the search for feasible energy storage. Integrating a photovoltaic module with a redox flow battery results in a highly reversible storage system, which has both the advantage of flexibility in capacity and charge/discharge power, as well as the direct and efficient coupling to solar energy generation. However, due to its early stage in development, the SRFB has several challenges to overcome, like low charging efficiencies and energy densities. To improve SRFB efficiency, this work provides a performance estimation model, to identify general sensitivities of SRFB efficiency with respect to the loss mechanisms associated with the device, such as (but not limited to) kinetic overpotentials and resistances, to establish device design principles. This model is also extended to simulate realistic environments, using real (daily/seasonally dependent) solar radiation and ambient temperature data. Moreover, a fit tool is realized to identify losses in a specific system, by varying parameters and mimicking experimental linear scan voltammetry data. Experimentally, several conducting layers are tested for their kinetics and conductivity and impact on device performance. A thin film of platinum is found to result in the best kinetics and lowest resistance. However, carbon-coated electrodes also show promising results and could be a feasible and cheaper alternative to platinum, when applying layer-optimization. Based on the design principles derived from the modeled and experimental results, a single-junction siliconbased SRFB is developed, based on a ferri-/ferrocyanide electrolyte, coupled with Cu2+=+, yielding high solar-to-chemical charging efficiency of 9.4%. This efficiency is close to the simulated efficiency, while multiple other SRFB photo-charging experiments follow modeled trends, validating the model.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Physics","",""

Many of them get copied the second they launch. In the end, everything looks identical. Digitalization is the main reason behind, causing the commoditization of the products (van Erp, 2011). Eventually, a brand becomes the only thing creating difference among competitors. However, instead of blaming the digital revolution, it is possible to take a step back and find a way out by designing from the brand perspective. So, what is the brand experience? Brand experiences can be defined as the overall experiences that cover customers’ sensations, feelings, thoughts, and actions lived within a certain brand. These experiences cause customer responses through brand-related stimuli (Brakus et al., 2009). Designers play an important role in the creation of brand experiences by translating the brand into the design. A touchpoint is considered as the final version of a design that is made for a certain brand. It can be a website, mobile application, packaging or a tangible product. Therefore, the design of the manifestation is a quite similar process with the standard user-centric design processes. The only difference is that while the user-centric design processes have the focus of the user, in this design process the focus is the brand. During the brand experience design process, there are many difficulties that designers face. The main reason behind is that in the literature, there are no inductive or deductive methods for designing for brand experiences nor is there a process for making a product or a service ‘on brand’. Think the brand out loud is a tool designed for validating the concepts if they are ‘on brand’ or not. The tool consists of a manual, card set and two boards. The card set is a selection of brand values, personalities, and emotions, and boards (explained in the manual) help both to define the brand’s core elements and to select concepts according to those core elements. While the tool guides the design team to discuss and reach a consensus, at the same time, it reveals the strengths and weaknesses of each design concept and helps to define directions for the final design.","Brand; Brand Experience; Concept Validation; Design Process","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

However, the longest spans created with timber structures still don't compete with the span widths of structures made of steel. This thesis provides a preliminary design for the long-span football stadium roof structure of The New Feyenoord stadium, which expends far beyond the existing maximum spans of timber structures. The aim is to provide insight in the feasibility of a long-span structure in timber. New Feyenoord stadium The city of Rotterdam is planning to built a new football stadium for the football club Feyenoord with a magnificent roof structure. This stadium is used to determine initial boundary conditions for the preliminary design in this thesis. A perfect bowl with an elegant flat, almost floating, roof that allows unobstructed viewing is desired. The playing field needs to be exposed to the weather conditions for the natural quality of the grass. The stadium will consist of three tiers with a total height of 40 metres, that need to be covered by a roof structure with a width of 205 metres, and length of 245 metres. Structural timber for a grand roof Timber has a high strength-to-weight ratio that is beneficial for long-span structures in which the self-weight of the structure is a significant part of the load. It has natural durability, a good performance in fire conditions, ease of workability, and a high ratio of prefabrication. The latter two result in an ease of construction and less human induced errors. Engineered wood products make it possible to create complex timber structures with more reliability than wood in its natural shape. The most promising are laminated veneer lumber (LVL) and glued laminated timber (Glulam), where LVL made of beech hardwood has the highest strength properties. Furthermore, new types of connections diminish the impact that connections traditionally have on the structural performance of timber structures. The enormous size of this stadium means that multiple connections are necessary due to dimensional restrictions for transport. Which reduces the amount of prefabrication. Structural systems for long-span stadium roofs Promising configurations for a long-span stadium roof structure are the single span, stress ribbon, shell roof system, and tension / compression ring. First, several existing stadium roof structures are presented to gain better insight on the possibilities of these systems. These stadiums are De Kuip, preliminary design of The New Feyenoord stadium by RHDHV, the Allianz Riviera stadium, the Wanda Metropolitano stadium, the Estadio Municipal, and the Tokyo National stadium. Initial designs are made for each structural system applicable to the case of the New Feyenoord stadium. These initial designs are explored on their structural behaviour and benefits for the case of the New Feyenoord stadium in combination with the material behaviour of timber. Structural forms for long-span timber structures Several structural forms are applied in long-span timber structures showing their applicability. These forms are the arch, box girder, truss, shell structure, space frame, and stress ribbon. This is explored by means of respective reference projects. These projects are the Multi-use Arena in Lisbon, Trade Fair Hall 11 in Frankfurt, the Anaklia-Ganmukhuri bridge in the Georgian Republic, the Maicasagi bridge in Nord-du-Quêbec, the geodesic domes in Brindisi, the Elephant House in Zurich, the Allianz-Riviera stadium in Nice, the Grandview Heights Aquatics Centre in Surrey, and the Essing bridge in Essing. These existing long-span timber structures mainly span only half of the required length of the New Feyenoord stadium. Possibility to create an efficient structural design for a long-span stadium timber roof structure After a rough assessment of the design concepts it is found that a combination between a tension / compression ring structure and a stress ribbon configuration shows the greatest potential for an efficient roof structure for the New Feyenoord stadium. Their are still many uncertainties for this type of structure for such a long span. There is no reference project and thus there can not be learned from mistakes. Also, the system is mathematically very complex because of its non-linear behaviour. Consequently, the structural system is modelled and verified in the parametric FEM environment of Grasshopper and Karamba3D. The found structural behaviour is verified by the strength verifications for timber structures. Tension / compression ring with radial stress ribbons The design consists of a triangular truss for the outer ring and a flat truss for the inner ring with radial stress ribbons in between. The structural design shows a feasible solution for the highest downward load, namely loads instigated by wind. The strength verification is performed on the maximum occurring force combination within a element group. Only the strength verification of shear stiffness in the bottom chord at the inside perimeter of the outer truss ring is not met. Which is a very localised effect and hence can be strengthened. Furthermore, the element groups of the rings show a undesirable utilisation distribution due to the non-circumferential perimeter of The New Feyenoord stadium. Large cross sections are required to provide stiffness to the entire structural system. The ribbons make use of their inherent bending stiffness to carry the loads in the long and short straight sides of the stadium. An elegant and stiff tensile force flow is found for the ribbons in the corners. At last, the designed connections for the ribbons which are attached to the timber fulfil the strength verifications. These connections consist of self-drilling dowels with slotted in steel plates, self-drilling screws, and glued in steel rods. Many steel fasteners are used to increase the efficiency factor of the joint. Suggested connections for the complex nodes in the ring trusses consist of slotted in steel plates with bolts and dowels, glued-in rods, and cast steel parts. The structural system is supported on roller bearings. The presented structural design only takes downward loading into account. Potential solutions for the severe upward loading are increasing the weight of the structural elements in the loaded area, tensile ties in the long and short side of the stadium, or tensile cables attached to the bottom side of the ribbons in the long and short side. An more in depth analysation of its stability against uplift forces and asymmetrical loading is needed to verify the proposed solutions. Recommendations are made to improve the design for The New Feyenoord stadium, for general possibilities for the chosen structural system, and for improvements and advice on the feasibility of special timber structures.

Since 2005, three 100-year return period droughts have occurred, the likes of which have the potential to turn the forest from a carbon sink to a source – meaning disastrous consequences for the planet. Monitoring of the Amazon is hence, indispensable. This study explored avenues for monitoring the canopy water dynamics in the region through ASCAT backscatter and dynamic vegetation parameters. These dynamic vegetation parameters are slope and curvature - the first and second derivatives of a second-order Taylor polynomial describing the incidence angle dependence of ASCAT backscatter data. A 10-year length of data from 2007-16 was used to find spatial and temporal patterns in the backscatter, slope, and curvature over Amazonia, and related them to climatic variables such as radiation and precipitation to find the driving force behind the parameters. The findings suggest that the spatial patterns of the ASCAT parameters match the distribution of major land cover types in the region, with significant differences between the major cover types. The evergreen forests have high mean backscatter and low mean curvature compared to other cover types, and weak seasonal variations. The savannas, on the other hand show much stronger amplitudes of seasonal changes. The wetlands, as well, have strong seasonality with especially high ranges in curvature. They also show a change in the backscatter-incidence angle relationship during flooding seasons, thus demonstrating potential for forest flood detection and monitoring. Consistent diurnal differences were observed especially in the backscatter of all regions. These diurnal differences are shown to be an interaction between vegetation phenological activity and precipitation seasons. In the dry season, the morning values are generally higher as the vegetation transpires water through the day. Water stress and a consequent decrease in backscatter are also detected during the Amazon droughts of 2010 and 2015. The spatial distribution of these negative backscatter anomalies matched that of precipitation deficits during the droughts. The anomalies were also seen to be strongest during the peak drought months. These findings indicate that ASCAT backscatter can detect water stress and droughts in the Amazon vegetation. Seasonal cycles in backscatter and dynamic vegetation parameters are visible in all regions. While backscatter follows the moisture availability in the canopy, the slope and curvature are related to variables of moisture demand (such as radiation and humidity) through a strong influence of vegetation phenology. In the radiation-limited Amazon vegetation, the slope peaks with the period of photosynthetic activity following the radiation maximum, while the curvature peak covers the leaf-flushing season. The ASCAT parameters show a relation to the vegetation water dynamics in all major cover types in the Amazon. There is, thus, a solid prospect for the use of ASCAT backscatter and vegetation parameters for long-term monitoring of the Amazon with respect to canopy water dynamics in a variety of land cover types, as well as events such as droughts.","Amazonia; active microwave remote sensing; vegetation; amazon forest; ASCAT; drought; Drought monitoring; Backscatter; vegetation water content; Seasonality; diurnal; Transpiration; slope; curvature; dynamic vegetation parameters; canopy water dynamics; scatterometers; radiation; water stress","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-11-01","","","","","",""

Recognizing its potential, the Norwegian Public Roads Administration is planning to use such technology, in creating a ferry-free highway that will connect the west coast of Norway. The objective of the present Master thesis report is to develop a model on a tether-stabilized SFT and investigate the static and dynamic load effects acting on such a structure in order to estimate how safe can such a structure be. The modeling of the SFT has been based on prototype designs, specifically developed for Bjornefjord in Norway. Focus has been put on capturing the Vortex-Induced Vibrations generated on the structure, when interacting with a current flow. Matlab has been used to describe the SFT and solve the dynamic problem. Facchinetti's wake oscillator model is applied to couple the tunnel motions with the vortex shedding. In the present report, the tether motions are not taken into account and, conservatively, tethers are modeled as springs. The 100-year current speed was used to excite the structure and it was found that the SFT is not influenced significantly. An SFT configuration with a free-span length of 210m, between two consecutive tethers along the total length, is capable enough to dissolve any VIV effects. Only when a free-span length of 700m is used, vibrations in the cross-flow direction make their presence felt. A simple estimation of the 100-year swell wave force was also performed, showing similar forcing magnitudes as the current force with an excitation frequency much closer to the 1st natural frequency of the structure. This renders the structure a lot more sensitive. Furthermore, the effect of an unexpected tether failure was investigated and showed that the system can safely reach to a new equilibrium position, without any progressive damage. Overall, despite all the hesitation around this concept, it has proven to be quite promising.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

This is attributed to the bridging effect by the Polyvinyl Alcohol (PVA) fibers used in SHCC in combination with the special material composition containing fine particles. This hybrid combination is able to satisfy the Serviceability Limit State (SLS) criteria for crack-width control by eliminating the requirement of additional reinforcement. Optimisation of micro-cracking of SHCC requires an investigation to study the influence of the interface in SHCC-Concrete hybrid beam and the type of fiber used in SHCC. This master thesis research is a continuation of the previous Msc. thesis study performed by Zhekang Huang [1] on the experimental flexural behaviour of reinforced concrete beams with a layer of SHCC in the tension zone. Variation in the bond interface property such as smooth interface profile, partially debonded, completely debonded and grooved interface profile are investigated to study their influence on the bearing capacity and crack-width control. To assess the impact of the type of fibers on crack-width control, commonly used PVA fibers are replaced with High Modulus Polyethylene Fibers (HMPE) based on pre-study. All hybrid beams are tested experimentally in a four-point bending set-up to generate cracks within the constant moment region and Digital Image Correlation (DIC) is performed to evaluate the crack patterns and the crack-widths. Numerical analyses of the beams are performed using Finite Element Analysis software Diana {version 10.3} with the modelling of similar interfaces and material properties used in the experiments. From the obtained results, it is observed that for all the beam specimens tested, varying the interface property did not have a significant impact on their bearing capacity as the interface within the constant moment region is only varied and the surface outside this region is bonded. For beam specimens with partial and completely debonded interface in the constant moment region, it is observed that the initial stiffness is reduced but the overall bearing capacity remains the same. Within the constant moment region, varying the interface property resulted in different crack patterns. The profiled and smooth interfaces, despite exhibiting different crack patterns, reached the maximum allowable crack-width of 0.3 mm at similar load steps of 69 KN and 71 KN respectively. This is because a sufficient bond at the interface is developed and as a result, due to local adhesion, the surface roughness plays a minor role. The beam specimens with completely and partially debonded interfaces localised at a much earlier load step of 45 KN and 50 KN respectively. This is because the stress generated in the SHCC layer is higher due to the severely cracked concrete layer on top. The beam specimens with smooth interface and HMPE fibers in SHCC perform similar to the beams with smooth interface and PVA fibers in SHCC. This is because of the additional constraint created due to the conventional concrete layer at the top in the SHCC-concrete hybrid beam. Despite the higher flexural capacity of the SHCC layer containing HMPE fibers, the concrete layer crushes much before the SHCC layer fails, thus, compromising the performance of the hybrid beam. By reducing the interface stiffness properties, an effort is made to reproduce the behaviour of specimen beams in four-point bending test through numerical modelling on Diana FEA. However, the prediction of the number of cracks formed and the crack-widths is inaccurate for all the beam specimens modelled. This is because the material models and interface properties available on Diana FEA to the authors knowledge, are insufficient in replicating the experimental cracking behaviour.","hybrid concrete beams; serviceability; interface; localisation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering","",""

The explicit share of the state variables, however, may cause privacy issues due to the confidentiality of the initial values. In this work, asynchronous privacy-preserving consensus average algorithms are proposed which enables the agents to reach the exact average of their initial values while preserving the privacy of them. The research aims to reduce the convergence time and computational complexity compared to the cryptographic solutions. Three methods are proposed and compared. The state decomposition and noise-obfuscation methods preserve the privacy of the initial values given that the semi-honest adversary is not able to listen to one of the neighboring nodes of the targeted node. The hybrid state decomposition approach proposes a way to overcome this assumption by using a minimum number of encryption operations. The initial values are shown to be private against an eavesdropper who is able to tap all communication channels as well as a semi-honest adversary in the system. It has been shown in all proposed approaches that as the noise variance goes to infinity, the adversary does not have any range to estimate the initial value. The noise obfuscation technique futures the same convergence rate as the standard averaging approach while providing a linear increase in the variance of the adversary's estimate with the increasing noise variance. On the other hand, the state decomposition technique futures a lower convergence rate compared to the standard averaging approach while providing an exponential increase in the variance of the adversary's estimate with the increasing noise variance. By optimizing the algorithm, it has been shown that the same convergence rate as the standard randomized gossip can be obtained. The state decomposition approach requires the addition of noise for a bounded amount whereas, the noise obfuscation method requires the addition of noise at each iteration. All three approaches, converges faster than a fully cryptographic approach while promising statistical security guarantees.","Distributed average consensus; Privacy-preserving; Noise-obfuscation; State decomposition; Asynchronous average consensus","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Signals and Systems","",""

Furthermore, Chile is prone to earthquakes and the resulting tsunamis, which can also damage the structural integrity of the bridge. The Chilean Railroad Agency (EFE) wants to realise a new railroad bridge crossing the Biobío river in Concepción, replacing the existing century old railway bridge. To prevent the failure of the new railway bridge, which can result in unnecessary economic damages, the morphological influence and damages due to scour, earthquakes and tsunamis, must be thoroughly understood and modelled.

Partial shading forces shaded cells into reverse bias leading to irreversible efficiency loss. The origin of the irreversible efficiency loss is the formation of defects in the shaded cell. The defects are going by the name of ’worm-like defects’. Understanding the mechanisms involved during the formation of worm-like defects can result in preventive measures to mitigate negative effects of partial shading. <br/><br/>The formation of worm-like defects involves a moving hot-spot across the cell. The exact mechanisms involved in the movement of a hot-spot is unknown. The problem in studying the mechanisms present in these hot-spots is an unknown current density and temperature. After rapid formation of worm-like defects severe changes in the solar cell are observed. <br/><br/>This work expands the knowledge on changes in geometry, composition and crystal structure after worm-like defect formation. X-ray diffraction results shows crystal structure of CIGS below worm-like defects has not changed. Energy dispersive X-ray results showCu rich areas near the back contact and areaswith high Ga and O content near the transparent conductive oxide. A band outside the worm-like defects is observed where Se is exchanged with S while Cu, In or Ga is exchanged with Cd. <br/><br/>Furthermore, a new experimental method is presented that allows control over locally applied conditions. The new method shows applied conditions can be controlled inducing features while resistive heating is suppressed.This enables future research on involved mechanisms.<br/><br/>Based on experimental results multiple possible mechanisms are proposed. In the authors view a plausible and major mechanism is electromigration of Cu towards the back contact. This migration is enhanced by the electromagnetic field and elevated temperature. Cu migration initiates a phase transformation of CIGS into a Cu rich and Cu poor phase. Subsequent to this phase transformation is a reaction of Ga and O. Further testing with this method is needed to investigate in which order mechanisms occur during worm-like defect formation.","CIGS; PV","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-09-17","","","","Materials Science and Engineering","",""

This project aims to understand the impact that interactions with technology currently have on users and to redesign a fitness tracker service to create more personal and meaningful experiences. These experiences enable fostering the users’ wellbeing and ultimately user engagement. The project explores the personality (conceptual characteristics) of the fitness tracker and its impact on user interaction. Moreover, it researches the meaning and value of health for the individual. These trackers are perceived by the users as very controlling in the interactions, which are mainly based on outputs and behavioral instructions leaving the user a passive role on the experience (conversation). The reason is that trackers follow a machine personality approach based on optimization and goal-seeking. Moreover, it has been found that the value of health for the tracker follows a different approach than the user. While the user values health to find balance and self-care based on doing holistic and meaningful activities, the trackers approach health as a predefined list of activities and are based on performing and achieving. This tracker approach zooms in on the activity (tangible meaning), difficulting for the user to see beyond and find the personal meaning that these devices can have to transform their lives (intangible meaning) into a healthier life. To design a more meaningful conversation user-tracker, five specific challenge areas related to this problem have been found: meaningless and impersonal goals, trainer tone of voice, linear and achievement focus, perceived lack of self-control and lack of health balance. The redesign is a new concept for the fitness tracker service (mobile and smartwatch app). It tackles the entire concept of the fitness tracker service (mobile and smartwatch app), rather than only data visualization because there needs to be a common ground regarding the personality of the user and the tracker (such as having a common approach to health) before the user-data conversations can become meaningful. The redesign zooms out from tangible activities and frame goals as journeys towards a healthier life. In this journey, the user is not only supported in the achievements but also empowered in the lower points of the process though self-reflective questions to learn from his unconscious behavior, which makes the service a platform for self-growth and gives the user a proactive voice in the conversations user-tracker. Moreover, a meaningful topic of conversation is established from the beginning of the experience by the “goal-setting” where the user can define holistic and personally meaningful goals to design his future-self. Finally, the motivation strategy of the app has been shifted from competition and achievement to share learnings with others (Self refections) regarding the journey, since it has been found that in this context, motivation related to de creativity. Therefore the user finds meaningful the experiences that inspire their behavior rather than instruct it.","positive design; fitness tracker; service; technology impact; Experience design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction | Medisign","",""

For developing an ontology, first the use case and existing ontologies for related topics were studied to obtain an overview of the concepts and relationships that are most relevant for AUVs that perform mine search operations. The ontology was then developed by formalising these concepts and relationships, and by identifying instances of these concepts that are specific to the use case. By implementing this ontology and developing a reasoning process for it, automatic inference of the capabilities of an AUV based on the components it is equipped with was realised. In addition, a data-driven methodology for performance assessment was developed and incorporated in the ontology to provide a basis for automatic inference of the expected performance of an AUV. This performance assessment methodology was tested by performing simulations with an AUV in a virtual underwater environment. These simulations showed that the developed methodology can successfully be used to predict performance under different conditions.","Ontology; AUV; Capability","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

Smart city can bring positive changes to citizens' lives but might also cause risk and conflicts. However, in most cases, the development of smart city is a top-down process that rarely involves citizens' opinions. Building upon the above background, this project aims at designing a playful experience to engage citizens in smart-city-related topics. In the research through design phase of this project, through conducting the generative session with citizens in Amsterdam, the project aim concretized into the design goal: To trigger citizens' awareness on the possible pros and cons of using the technology of data collection and analysis as a manner to make a city better, and further formulate their stands through more in-depth discussions on smart city topics that are more relevant to their daily lives in a playful way. In the ideation and prototyping phase of this project, two rounds of prototype test were conducted with Amsterdam citizens, and the insights generated contributed to the iteration of the design. The final concept: Future News Stand is a co-creatable opinion sensitizer which aims at engaging citizens in the discussions of the possible future scenarios in a city in a playful and speculative way. The design of Future News Stand consists of two parts. (1) Future News Co-creation Toolkit is a set of paper tools with instructions that help to imagine and generate future scenarios on a particular topic in a brainstorming session setup. (2) Future News Stand is a portable installation for evoking discussions about a particular future scenario with citizens on the streets. The combination of these two parts of design enables the co-creatable quality and the adaptability of Future News Stand. That is, the content on the Future News Stand can be easily changeable, and co-creatable depends on the (stakeholder's) purpose of usage. In this project, the future transport in Amsterdam was chosen to be the main topic for discussions. The final test with seven citizens in Amsterdam showed the promising abilities of the design to trigger citizens' interests in the future transport in Amsterdam and evoke discussions on it. Equally important, the experience was perceived as playful and enjoyable by the participants.

In the Netherlands, the potential for cost-effective geothermal heat extraction from sedimentary aquifers has led to the exploration of siliciclastic Triassic reservoirs in the West Netherlands Basin and Roer Valley Graben for their suitability. This thesis primarily focuses on two geothermal target wells namely NDW-01 and NLW-GT-01. These wells lie in the Nederweert and Westland areas respectively.NDW-01 comprises of 292m thick sandstone package which is scarcely studied. While the NLW-GT-01 well was drilled tapping depths of over 4000 meters and encountering temperatures of about 100°C. In contradiction to the pre-drill expectations of having appreciable porosity and permeability values between 10-500mD, the Upper Volpriehausen sandstones in NLW-GT-01 exhibited porosity and permeabilities ranging between 1.4% to 3.9% and ≤0.02mD respectively. The sandstones were highly compacted and severely cemented by dolomite and quartz. These cements blocked all the macropores leaving no visible porosity in the thin sections. Although, the cored interval was extensively fractured the measured permeability values were negligible. This thesis presents the results of an assessment of the factors leading to the deterioration of intrinsic porosity and permeability of Triassic aquifers lying in the Westland and Nederweert regions. In this project, grain-size analysis using core plugs, thin-section study, petrophysical data analysis, and FMI log interpretation were conducted to understand the depositional environment of the Lower Germanic Trias Group precisely the cored sections of the Nederweert Sandstone Member in NDW-01 well and the Volpriehausen sandstones in NLW-GT-01 borehole. Due to the complex tectonic history coupled with locally different paleoenvironments, the current depths of the Triassic deposits in the investigated area did not correlate with the reservoir quality of the adjacent shallower wells. In addition to the local depositional conditions in the basin, the variable precipitation in the source area, and the distance of sediment transport have defined the rock characteristics. The primary grain-textures, such as roundness, sorting, packing, as well as the detrital framework and authigenic minerals, were found to influence the sandstone porosity. The tightness of the reservoir was due to significant mechanical compaction and cementation described by a diagenetic reconstruction explaining the evolution of porosity with depth with a negligible generation of secondary porosity. The deterioration of the reservoir quality is correlatable to the burial history and its resulting consequences, namely mechanical and chemical compaction endured by the rock during periods of basin subsidence and uplift. These analyses have put the deviation of pre-drill results from those that were obtained through post-drill evaluations into perspective.","Naaldwijk; Nederweert; Triassic; Geothermal reservoir","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Petroleum Engineering and Geo-sciences","",""

The municipality of Rotterdam can not yet comply with national regulation regarding N Ox and the current levels of N Ox pose a health risk for society (Gemeente Rotterdam). The Port of Rotterdam and local government have set ambitious goals to reduce emissions and encourage the switch to sustainable alternatives. Companies transporting over water in the Rotterdam port area need to respond to this wider sentiment of zero emissions. The switch can be made by either transforming or replacing current fossil fuel vessels with battery electric vessels.Social relevance and the urge for more sustainable shipping have not yet resulted in large developments regarding full electric vessels. After the review of literature, a knowledge gap is formulated: ’The urge for full electric shipping and linkage to the adoption of a network of decentralised batteries.’ This research sheds light on Battery Exchange networks.Battery Exchange, the physical exchange of a discharged battery for a charged battery. Battery Exchange on vessels gives the opportunity to cope with range and charging limitations of the more commonly used stationary batteries. In this research the logistic operation of implementing a novel Battery Exchange network is elaborated upon. Research takes place at Skoon. Electrification of vessels using decentralised batteries provides major opportunities for Skoon, as the company specialises in managing battery networks. The ultimate aim of this research is to develop a model that can calculate the optimal battery exchange network configuration. The following research question is formulated:How can battery networks be implemented to supply ships with power?The Sargent model (Sargent, 2010) is one of the methodologies used to structure the research. It consists of a paradigm between the problem, conceptual model and comput- erised model. In order to create a conceptual model the framework by Robinson (2008) for conceptual modelling is used. Following the conceptual model, a functional model and consequently a computer model is developed to study the implementation of a battery pack exchange network.In order to test the model, a case study has to be executed. There are three main requirements to conduct research on modular battery electric vessels. The first requirement is the willingness of companies to cooperate in this research. The second requirement is the availability of data. Third, the energy demand of ships needs to be in the functional limit of batteries. Existing vessels can either be replaced entirely by an electric vessel or adapted to be battery compatible. An aim is to map and provide answers to the logistical challenges associated with the implementation of a new battery exchange network and investigate the financial feasibility. Interviews with various transportation companies in the Rotterdam port area were conducted to gather data and become familiarised with potential challenges. Companies include: the Watertaxi, VT group, Unibarge, Waterbus, Koninklijke Roeiers Vereeninging Eendracht, Bek &amp; Verburg and Spido. After scrutiniza- tion, the Waterbus, KRVE and Bek&amp; Verburg are deemed the most interesting candidates for electrification. The waterbus is the best candidate for electrification due to limited trip duration, frequent returns to fixed locations, a predictable schedule, potential for positive network externalities, Skoon brand visibility and data availability. Increased demand for sustainable transport, thus solidification of the waterbus as a daily mode of transport and an alternative to road transport has multiple advantages. First it can decrease road congestion. Second, the use of bicycles is promoted. Third, the need for road related infrastructure investments is lowered. Fourth it improves the connectivity to less accessible villages.The general functional model is turned into a computer model. Data on the Waterbus is incorporated in the model. The used Matlab model allows to minimise the costs, moreover the influence of variables can accurately be monitored. Battery Pack (BP) and charging infrastructure configurations can easily be switched and compared on both Capital expenditures and Operational expenditures using the model. In the model a genetic algorithm is used for optimisation, through sequential progression in generations the model tries to find the best configurations. Model input consists of the parameters and variables. Daily schedule, energy consumption, routes and exchange locations are fixed parameters. Moreover a variety of model alternations are tested: the battery pack capacity and installed charging power are altered. The model uses the various input variables and parameters to calculate the total amount of used BPs in model. Two exchange methods are tested. One approach is to exchange the BPs throughout the whole system. While another method is restricted BP exchange. Restricted exchange entails that the BPs are only used on one specific route. The former method is likely to require less total BP capacity while the latter methods constantly guarantees an optimal distribution of BPs. In this research we find a method to calculate and monitor the influence of variables and how it changes the optimal system configuration.Multiple experiments were executed on: price fluctuations, influence of charging strategies, change in energy consumption and different charging rates were monitored. First, price fluctuations were observed to have no influence on the total system composition. Second, also the influence of the charging strategies was limited, as only small changes on the amount of shore charging power were observed. With another division of BPs and relatively less charging power, charging strategies could have had more impact. Third, alternations in the energy consumption did have significant effect, the optimal BP capacity changed while the number of BPs stayed the same. In the last experiment the c-rate was varied with both a constant Battery Pack capacity and the solution algorithm searching for the most optimal solution. The hypothesis that: ’using BPs interchangeably throughout the network increases system efficiency’ is accepted for c-rates between one and two. However, the differences between the two exchange methods are marginal and route specific battery exchange does guarantee a steady distribution of battery packs.The most optimal network configuration given current suppliers is provided. The amount of batteries, effective Battery Pack capacity and required shore power on three different locations are depicted in the table, for a maximum c-rate of one. The research has a variety of limitations. First, the research is especially suitable for scheduled transport over water, application of the model for on-demand traffic would require alternations and incorporation of margins for uncertainty. Second, accessible data on energy consumption of vessels is a hard to find, the reliability of the data is an un- certainty. To cope with the uncertainty and test the influence of variability, fluctuations are incorporated in the model tests. Third, there are charging strategies which have been disregarded due to practical restrictions on the amount of model characteristics. Fourth, the impact of schedule changes has not been assessed.It is concluded that in establishing sustainable transportation over water, the model can help overcome range and charging time related limitations, while minimising required resources. Model optimisation and insight in the necessary resources the following advantages. Parameters can easily be adapted if changes occur in for example: the schedule, level of consumption or charging rate. Additionally, insight into the relevant information makes the operation of a battery exchange network more comprehensible for managers. Moreover, optimisation can make the implementation of a battery network and full electric propulsion financially more attractive. The research provides insights for Skoon in assessing the possibilities of battery exchange networks and serves as guidance in scrutinising other emerging markets.The main recommendations, for both Skoon and future research are enumerated. First, map battery lifetime, more specifically in-dept scrutiny on the relation between fast charging and battery degradation could provide new insights. Second, partner up for the development of a battery exchange method. Third, extend the model with extra vessels, linking additional customers to exchange Battery Packs with different clients in one network. Fourth, the integration of a visual display, to more efficiently communicate the model performance. Fifth, include more elaborate energy consumption measurements of vessels incorporated in the model.","Energy; Logistics; Exchange; Batteries; Port; Rotterdam; Swapping; Electric; Vessels; Sustainable; Network; Electrification; Decentralised; Optimisation; Simulation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-09-16","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

Four European ports - Port of Rotterdam, North Sea Port, Port of Hamburg, and Port of Gothenburg - entered into a cooperation to realise a platform for benchmarking. Currently, limited research is available on methods for assessing and comparing asset management performance. This research aims at filling the gaps in literature by developing an international benchmarking model for ports. In doing so, it provides asset managers a structured approach to develop benchmarks in order to measure and compare performance. By combining existing frameworks and the consultation of experts in the research field, a model design is obtained in a collaborative way. The model is demonstrated by means of a case study. Following this demonstration it can be stated that the benchmarking model provides asset managers a clear working method and supporting tools. The presented benchmark results, and the process itself, provides asset managers valuable insights into performance. Consequently, it provides support in the development of future benchmarks.","Benchmarking; Ports; Asset management; performance management","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Transport, Infrastructure and Logistics","",""

However, a lot of concerns have been raised about the impact of these decisions on people’s lives. In this work we focus on two main problems. The first one is that there might be discrimination between different groups of people with respect to their protected attributes in the aforementioned Machine Learning decision making applications. The second one is that there is lack of methods that actually interpret and explain the predictions of these Machine Learning systems which are then used to help decision making. Particularly, we focus on a specific aspect of these decision making applications, namely in Machine Learning training data for the problem of classification. Most research tackles solely individual aspects like trying to detect and mitigate bias and does not pay any attention to explain their reasoning in a human interpretable way. Also, the main method that they use is to balance the distribution of the training data with respect to the protected attribute. However, as we show, this is not always the solution to the problem. On the contrary, we study concurrently three steps (detection, semantic interpretation and mitigation of bias) to overcome these shortcomings and limitations and show that there is the presence of specific visual clues that leads to that bias. Finally, we perform an extensive evaluation of our method in order to verify its efficiency and effectiveness on the particular use-case Gender Bias in Profession Prediction from Images.","Bias Detection; Bias Semantic Interpretation; Bias Mitigation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore, in case of a non-prismatic beam, the vertical cross-section cut, on which analysis from the codes are performed, is no longer perpendicular to the centroidal axis, unlike prismatic beam. Moreover, due to the geometry, these beams are prone to shear failure which is mainly due to the vertical component of the inclined cross-section forces. The main focus of this study is to compare the cross-section results obtained on inclined and vertical cut and also to validate the inclusion of the vertical component of the inclined forces in the shear capacity equation.<br/>Different approaches are proposed to calculate the cross-section results on an inclined cut, with the internal forces in the global (horizontal and vertical direction) as well as in the local direction (perpendicular and parallel direction of the cut). From the procedure it was seen that in a prismatic beam, subjected to four point bending test, the cross-section results remains the same irrespective of how the analysis is performed. However, in case of non-prismatic beams, the bending moment resistance obtained on an inclined cut, which is perpendicular to the centroidal axis with the forces in local direction, is greater than that obtained on a vertical cut. Therefore to be conservative it is recommended to perform cross-section analysis on a vertical cut in a non-prismatic beam.<br/>A procedure to calculate the shear capacity of non-prismatic beam is determined in this study. First, the shear resistance contributed by concrete and stirrups are calculated at the assumed critical section. Then the inclined internal forces are determined for each load case and the capacity of the beam is either reduced or increased by the vertical component. This capacity is compared with the applied loading and is checked for failure. Since the shear capacity is influenced by the applied loading, failure of the beam is defined as the load for which the determined capacity is lower than the applied loading. The results obtained from this procedure are in good agreement with the limited experimental data available. Therefore, it can be concluded that the vertical component of the inclined cross-section forces should be considered in the shear capacity equation. <br/>Finally non-prismatic bridge deck is also studied and different errors that engineers make in practice is further analyzed. Due to the non-linear layout of centroidal axis, engineers find it difficult to perform analysis on non-prismatic beams. Therefore, the cross-section of the deck is modified, such that the centroidal axis remains linear. The results determined on a modified deck is equal to that obtained on the original model. Another error engineers make is ignoring the inclination of internal forces, which leads to underestimation of the capacity. This study shows that the vertical component of the inclined cross-section forces, which is considered in the shear capacity, should be determined based on the bending moment obtained for the load combination where applied shear force is governing. <br","Non-Prismatic Beams; Tapered/Haunched Beams; critical section; Cross-sectional analysis; Shear capacity","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","Suspicion of prostate cancer is based on diagnostic tests such as Prostate-Specific-Antigen (PSA) screening or a Digital-rectal-exam. Prostate needle biopsy can be performed to confirm the diagnosis and determine the stage of the disease. The golden standard in prostate biopsy is the trans-rectal biopsy under ultra-sound guidance (TRUS). TRUS is a relative cost-effective approach, though it has the limitation of having a low prostate cancer detection rate (PCa). A succesfull alternative approach is the trans-perineal (TP) biopsy under MRI guidance. Physicians often use this approach for rebiopsies. In contrast to TRUS, TP under MRI guidance is quite expensive. An MRI-safe biopsy system that can automatically sample, remove and store multiple biopsy samples can make TP procedure under MRI guidance more time-efficient. This thesis tackled several challenge related to the development of such an automatic biopsy system. <br/>First of all, the tissue sample should be removed from the biopsy needle without human intervention. The State of the Art research showed that vacuum-suction was the dominant removing technique in breast biopsy. In this thesis, vacuum-suction was not used for the automatic biopsy system. On the grounds that vacuum-suction only proved to be viable with 13G needles and not with 18G or smaller needles. Therefore, a novel technique to remove a tissue samples from a biopsy needle was developed. Flushing with saline showed to have potential during several pilot tests. The second challenge was to fire and reload the biopsy needle without human intervention. A concept was created that implemented both the first and second challenge. Here, a pneumatic cylinder both fired and reloaded the stylet. A compression spring fired the cannula while two pneumatic cylinder ensured automatic reloading. The concept was realized in a Proof of Principle prototype. The prototype was verified against the product specifications (PS). The PS were related to the stylet and cannula velocity, the tissue sample quality and the removing of the tissue sample. As sampling on live human prostate was not possible at this stage of the product development, sampling was done on raw chicken breasts. The samples were compared to the ones taken with a standard 18 biopsy needle. The results showed that the velocity of the stylet was acceptable, while those of the cannula was insufficient. This did not result in a reduction of the sample quality though. Surprisingly, the results showed the exact opposite. The samples taken with the automatic biopsy system were significantly longer that the ones taken with the standard biopsy needle. A tissue sample might appear to be longer if the parts of a fragmented samples are compressed together. This could be a explanation for the surprisingly increase of sample length. The automatic biopsy system presented in this thesis project had a fragmentation rate of 20%. This figure is already twice as low compared the vacuum technique. All this was accomplished with a two times smaller diameter. This thesis project showed the potential of the automatic biopsy system that uses flushing to remove the tissue sample from the biopsy needle.","Prostate cancer; Automated; Biopsy; MRI","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-09-16","","","","","",""

Users often share their experiences in various health - related topics like disease symptoms, drug treatments and other medical related issues in order to discuss with other patients dealing with similar conditions. During the production of a new drug, important drug properties like possible Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) are monitored through a phase of clinical trials. However, due to various factors that can not be easily measured in those trials, patients can potentially experience adverse events that were not related to their treatment before, or were related to it in a much smaller frequency. Therefore, the automatic detection of Adverse Events in online networks is gaining an increasing popularity among researchers in the biomedical community, as it can offer a valuable complementary source of information, next to the traditional approaches of reporting those events to the corresponding Food and Drug Association. From an NLP perspective, this task poses a significant challenge as there is a large gap between the informal language used in social media and the formal medical language used to officially describe a medical concept. Moreover, there is an absence of large annotated datasets, as the manual labeling of an adverse effect mentions is a time-consuming and often ambiguous procedure which also requires some sort of medical expertise. In this work we propose a novel machine learning approach to normalize Adverse Drug Effect mentions in user-generated text to a standard vocabulary from a medical Ontology.

Due to higher flame speeds and lower quenching distances, hydrogen-rich fuel mixtures are especially prone to boundary layer flashback (BLF). Research at TU Munich (Eichler 2011, Baumgartner 2014) has resulted in new insights into the mechanism of BLF, revealing a strong coupling between the flame and the flow field. This led to the development of a new BLF model (Hoferichter 2017) for flames confined in channels, built on the observation that BLF is triggered by flow separation at the flame front. A previous TU Delft student (Tober 2019) added a correction for low Lewis number flows on the turbulent flame speed, such that the model could be validated also for preheated mixtures.<br/>In this thesis, the model is further investigated with the goal of applying it to more complex burner designs. A new way to apply Stratford's turbulent boundary layer separation criterion (originally derived for boundary layers growing on airfoils) for flame induced flow separation is proposed and validated. This ""generalized"" criterion results in more realistic values for the computed pressure difference over the turbulent flame front. The effect of flame stretch and the Markstein length on the laminar flame speed and subsequently on flashback limits is then investigated and found to be of secondary importance compared to the Lewis number correction mentioned above. Using an unstretched laminar flame speed in the turbulent flame speed closure reduces the model complexity and gives better predictions.<br/>The BLF model is then coupled to CFD calculations. This is validated for flames confined in channels and then applied to flames confined in diverging burners with underlying adverse pressure gradients. First, a comparison of turbulence models is made with regards to their performance for diffuser flow. Then an automatic method to customize the generalized separation criterion by fitting the mean velocity profile in the diffuser is implemented in code. This captures the effect of flow retardation in the diffuser and the shape of the velocity profile on the flashback limits. Including the underlying adverse pressure gradient in the flame backpressure expression further increases the flashback propensity by increasing the critical gradient. However, to fully reproduce the increased flashback tendency observed in the diffuser experiments, the turbulent flame speed needs to be positively tuned. This indicates that the increased flashback propensity could be due to differences in the time-resolved near-wall turbulence in the presence of an adverse pressure gradient.<br/>Finally, the BLF model is discussed in the context of recently published numerical studies on the influence of the operating pressure on BLF (Endres &amp; Sattelmayer 2019). These simulations suggest flashback propensity increases with increased pressure, even when the magnitude of flow separation is reduced. If this is confirmed, future modelling efforts for validation at gas turbine relevant pressures should focus on the interplay between flow separation and flame quenching at the wall.<br","Gas Turbines; Hydrogen; Combustion Instability; Boundary layer flashback","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Traditionally, access to some data or service is achieved by means of some documents or a password. However, these methods are not very convenient. Alternatively, typical biometric systems can be employed that use fingerprint, iris, voice, face recognition or a combination of them. This project focuses on the task of face recognition from still images and investigates how different algorithms for face verification perform under various adverse conditions modelled by blur, salt-and-pepper noise and changes in illumination. Conventional pattern recognition algorithms are first presented. Pixel intensities, Gabor features, Local Binary Patterns (LBP) and 2D-DCT coefficients are considered as features while for classification the nearest neighbor (NNC), nearest mean (NMC), SVM classifiers, and Likelihood Ratio Tests (LRT) with Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) are examined. Out of all these methods, Gabor features combined with the linear SVM classifier are shown to produce best results across all degradations giving an average Equal Error Rate (EER) of 0:97% using the ORL face dataset. Then, emphasis is placed on deep learning and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Specically, VGG-Face with triplet loss training for face verification is suggested. VGG-Face achieves an average EER of 2:63% when both test images of a query image pair are drawn from the same degradation conditions and an average EER of 3:80% when only one image in the given pair is degraded and the other one is derived from the clean ORL dataset. We also experimented with the extracted VGG-Face features and NNC, linear SVM and Gaussian SVM and it is seen that a linear SVM gives an average EER of 1:10% by macro-averaging the Detection Error Tradeoff (DET) curves.","Face Recognition; Deep learning; Pattern Recognition; Computer vision","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Circuits and Systems","Face recognition using traditional machine learning algorithms and deep neural networks with application to face verification",""

Ten years ago, air space was the only WiFi-wasteland. Nowadays, it’s safe to say that WiFi on planes is very common now. AirFrance-KLM also implements the WIFI service on the plane. It creates a new customer touchpoint within the customer journey — the Onboard Portal. Passengers use this website to connect the WIFI with their own devices on the plane. The goal of the project is to explore the possibilities of improving customer experience via this touchpoint by providing possible ancillaries (commission-based products /services, travel-related information, etc.). This project proposes a new conceptual OBP including a set of ancillaries based on passengers’ personalities (big five personality model, Goldberg, 1990). The concept enables the target group to arrange their trips better with immediate transportation guidance or long-term travel plan. As Figure 1 shows, the project started with analyzing the brand value/business strategy of KLM. The result showed KLM wants to provide a memorable experience to its customers and enhance customer intimacy. Personalization and customization is the current focus, since they are good methods of enhancing customer intimacy. Then, an investigation of current OBP and its competitors were conducted. It shows the current OBP only provide limited ancillaries, and do not recognize the passenger. The usage rate of KLM’s OBP is low. By analyzing the previous market research results, the in-flight and post-flight experience of travelers with business and personal purpose ware chosen as a starting point to explore how to provide personalized services and enhance user experience. Multiple research methods including contextmapping, interview and online questionnaire survey were used to create their customer profiles and passenger journeys. Based on previous research results, eight intervention opportunities were identified as potential areas to create design interventions. Due to the constraints of time and access to the business travelers, the target group was narrowed down to the tourists. The theory of the big five model and personality traits was introduced for personalized services. Then, literature review and statements analysis were conducted to explore passengers’ needs, concerns, and expectations with different personalities. The results were using to generate primary concepts in creative sessions. All these concepts were tested to gain more insights. Meanwhile, a brainstorm session and an online questionnaire survey were conducted to discover more ancillaries. After comparing all results, one concept was chosen to continue as the final design direction, and the profiles of the target group based on the chosen personality trait(conscientiousness) were created. Accordingly, the final concept was developed after some iterations (concept evaluation with coaches and customers). In the last phase, the design concept was evaluated with customers and experts from KLM to get critical feedback and suggestions, from customer’s and company’s perspective. The recommendations and limitations were discussed as well in the end.","Interaction design; Passenger experience; User experience design; Onboard portal; Personality traits","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

Many parts of the world are, however, still lacking the data needed for flood risk management and risk reduction. The recent development of information and communication technologies has remarkably lowered the costs to collect data for flood resilience, which has accommodated the rise of community mapping projects to fill data gaps in resource-strained environments. This thesis utilises drainage data collected by the Ramani Huria community mapping project in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, to investigate if community mapped drainage data can improve flood predictions on neighbourhood scale. A coupled 1D-2D hydrodynamic model is developed of Kijitonyama ward, and is run with and without Ramani Huria’s drainage data implemented in the 1D schematisation. The simulated flood depth for the scenarios is validated with citizen’s observations on flood depth during a rain event on 3 March, 2019. The developed model is then applied to investigate the impact of solid waste accumulation in the drainage system on floods, by closing the drainage segments that were recorded as blocked in Kijitonyama ward by Ramani Huria staff the morning after the simulated event. An experimental scenario is also run, to examine the impact of blocked culverts. The results show that community mapped drainage data indeed can enhance the performance of hydrodynamic models, as the model output corresponds better with the validation data when implementing Ramani Huria’s drainage data in the 1D schematisation, compared with a scenario run with only a 2D schematisation. The scenarios run with solid waste blockages do not influence the model output when comparing with citizen’s observations, but increase the water level in the drainage segments located upstream of the blockages.","community mapping; volunteered geographic information; Ramani Huria; Flood resilience","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

The secondary objective is to study the time it takes for the reservoir unit to thermally recharge after production has stopped. Two reservoir simulators are benchmarked to decide which one to use for reaching these objectives. The Ammerlaan, Duijvestijn and DAP doublets, all targeting the the Delft Sandstone Member in the West Netherlands Basin, serve as a case study. A literature review is presented to gain a better understanding of the geological history and the structural setting. A box-model of the study area is created and used to benchmark the two reservoir simulators. A static reservoir model is developed in Petrel through seismic interpretation, structural modelling, facies modelling and petrophysical modelling. Populating this static model with dynamic properties allows us to perform reservoir simulations in Eclipse100 and study the propagation of pressure and temperature. A discrete parameter analysis aims to capture the uncertainties that are associated with reservoir modelling and simulation. In this study, data is used from seismic surveys, wireline logs, core studies, a cuttings study and the monthly production volumes of the Ammerlaan and Duijvestijn doublets. It is shown that interference on temperature has a long term (20-30 years) effect on the Duijvestijn (positively) and the Ammerlaan and DAP doublets (negatively). The combined total energy production of the three doublets over 100 years is small with a decrease of 3% due to temperature interference, compared to when running the doublets in stand-alone configuration. Interference on pressure has a short term (days) effect on the achieved flow rate when the injection well cannot reach its target injection rate and is constraint on the maximum allowable pressure at which it is allowed to inject. This occurs under the low permeability scenarios and can be observed when the pressure wave arrives at the neighbouring injector. The Duijvestijn, Ammerlaan and DAP doublets all benefit from this through a combined increase in energy production of 8% over 100 years of production, averaged over all scenarios. During thermal recharge after production, the average reservoir temperature increases asymptotically. Temperature recharges to 96.1% to 97.4% of the initial reservoir temperature after 1000 years of recharging under different thickness and conductivity scenarios. The absence of a thermal influx at the bottom of the reservoir model is limiting the capacity of the reservoir to recharge to its initial average temperature. Interviews are conducted to investigate the implications that the findings of this research have on the policy measures for geothermal projects. Suggestions for changes in policy are made to optimize the recovery of heat in the subsurface.","Geothermal; Interference; Pressure; Temperature; Eclipse100; DARTS; Simulation; Reservoir Modelling; Thermal recharge; Discrete parameter analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-11-01","","","","Petroleum Engineering and Geo-sciences","",""

In this thesis a variant of the HHL QLSA is studied, and the open challenges are investigated. Solutions for two of the challenges, namely the Eigenvalue Inversion subroutine and the Higher-Order Ancilla Rotation subroutine, are discussed. As part of the thesis project, these subroutines have been implemented in the QX Quantum Computer Simulator, and the subroutines are combined to form a complete Quantum Linear Solver (QLS), with the restraint that the implementation for the vector and Hamiltonian of the matrix must be provided by the user. A proof-of-concept QLS by Cao et al. is also implemented in the QX simulator, and using the implementation of the vector and Hamiltonian of Cao et al. the complete solver is tested. In the process of this thesis, a framework for basic Quantum Arithmetic is built providing three variants of Integer Adders, two variants of Integer Subtracters, one Integer Multiplier and one Integer Divider. In addition, gates not natively available in the QX simulator are implemented, and a number of improvements and extensions of algorithms presented in the literature are given, making the described algorithms function on the QX simulator and extending features.","quantum computing; quantum algorithms; quantum linear equation solver; numerical linear algebra; quantum simulator","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics | Applied Physics","",""

Individuals with a high risk of developing CVD are nowadays mainly treated with cholesterol lowering drugs. Although disease risk can be lowered by a maximum of 40% in this way, a significant untreatable residual risk is left. Therefore, there is a big quest to find novel medicines. The enzyme lipoprotein lipase (LPL) is a key player in lipid metabolism and has recently gained a lot of attention as novel druggable target for CVD risk reduction. Although identification of LPL-activating small molecules is eagerly awaited, screening of compound libraries is nowadays impossible, as it is extremely challenging to study LPL activity in an in vitro setting due to its complex mode of action, which requires direct crosstalk between endothelial cells and metabolically active tissue. Therefore, the overall objective is to use organ-on-chip technology to develop a predictable in vitro model for functional LPL activity. Such a model is a giant leap in CVD modelling, and will open the door for discovery and development of new therapeutics for this deadly disease. Study aims | My master thesis project was the start of the overall project, and therefore mainly focused on general characterization of LPL activity in different cell types, with the aim to 1) determine the difference in fatty acid uptake and LPL activity in the medium between cardiomyocyte monocultures, cardiomyocyte endothelial cell co-cultures and endothelial cell monocultures in vitro; 2) define optimal culturing conditions for high LPL activity; and 3) design a heart-on-chip model to co-culture 3D cardiac tissue and endothelial cells such that they are in direct contact with each other. The hypothesis is that co-culturing increases functional LPL activity. Methods | Fatty acid uptake and LPL activity was compared between human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived cardiomyocyte monocultures, cardiomyocyte-endothelial cell co-cultures and endothelial cell monocultures, using tri[3H]oleate and [14C]cholesteryl oleate double radioactively labeled triglyceride-rich lipoprotein (TRL)-mimicking particles. The heart-on-chip was designed with Solidworks software. Results | LPL activity in the medium, measured as triglyceride-derived fatty acid release, was highest in co-cultures. Fatty acid uptake by the cells also seemed to be higher in co-cultures than cardiomyocyte monocultures, although differences were not statistically significant. Endothelial cells consistently showed lowest fatty acid uptake. Importantly, incubation of TRL-mimicking particles with ApoC2, which is an essential co-factor of LPL enzymatic activity, drastically increased fatty acid uptake by cardiomyocytes and co-cultures. Conclusions | The results strongly indicate that co-culturing cardiomyocytes with endothelial cells, compared to monocultures, increases fatty acid uptake by the cells and triglyceride-derived free fatty acid release in the cell culture medium, both being indicators of increased functional LPL activity. For highest LPL activity, experimental conditions should include incubation of TRL-mimicking particles with at least 0.25 µL/well ApoC2 and a particle incubation time of at least 4 hours. The future goal is to repeat the current experiments in a 3D setting using the designed heart-on-chip model.","Organ-on-chip; heart; lipids; Cardiovascular disease; LPL; Endothelial cells; cardiomyocytes; 3D Model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-09-24","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","The objective of this master thesis research project is to determine the overall polarisation sensitivity of the Near Infrared Spectograph (NIRSpec) on board the JamesWebb Space Telescope (JWST). Understanding the polarisation sensitivity is important to correctly interpret the output data and accurately calibrate the instrument during operational lifetime. As experimental research on this topic for NIRSpec was limited, a numerical code has been built to simulate the light following the optical path of NIRSpec. This numerical code is effectively a ray tracer with polarisation state analysis functions. They ray tracer is designed to be modular, making it straightforward to add new functions or optical elements, either for future work on NIRSpec or application to other instruments. The analyses regarding the polarisation sensitivity were performed in three main categories: the induced polarisation through reflections by mirrors, the grating efficiencies and overall throughput, and the effect on the calibration process. The JWST is a large space telescope that aims to help better understand every time period of the universe from the Big Bang till the present. The launch is currently scheduled in March 2021. The JWST shall provide new data by observing thermal radiation from various celestial objects. It houses four main science instruments, one of which is NIRSpec developed by the European Space Agency. The optical design of NIRSpec is based on three three-mirror anastigmats and six main opto-mechanical assemblies. Two of those assemblies are the grating wheel assembly which houses dispersive reflection gratings and the calibration assemblywhich is used to internally calibrate the instrument. These optical elements introduce a polarisation sensitivity, meaning that the instrument output data will depend on the polarisation state of the incoming radiation. Even though NIRSpec will mainly observe unpolarised light sources, a degree of polarisation will always be induced via reflections by themirrors. The optical path of the calibration beam differs from the nominal science path, so a different degree of polarisation will be induced via the calibration path compared to the nominal science path. Application of the calibration measurements to the science measurements can thus lead to errors on the deduced signals. The induced degree of polarisation for the nominal science path will likely remain below 2%. This degree of polarisation is slightly dependent on both wavelength and initial incidence angle, but not significantly. The analysis of the grating efficiencies clearly indicates a polarisation sensitivity up to 20% for the medium resolution gratings and up to 40% for the high resolution gratings. Due to the low estimated induced polarisation below 2%, the maximumuncertainty in the output data for unpolarised incoming light would be lower than 1%. Observing celestial objects with an inherent degree of polarisation, however, could introduce a significant uncertainty in the measurements. Finally, the calibration process has also been examined and it can be concluded that the induced degree of polarisation by the calibrationmirrors before the light reaches the grating will be 1 to 2% higher compared the nominal science path. Whether or not this difference should be taken into account will depend on the application. Recommendations for future work can be divided into four categories. First, the reflection grating efficiencies should be analysed in more details as the accuracy of the presented results is uncertain. Second, the filters and detector are modelled as single layer Fresnel surfaces, while in reality they consist of multiple layers of different materials. It should be researched how this assumption affects the presented results. Third, configurations using the long-slit spectroscopy and integral field spectroscopy have not been analysed while the microshutter assembly is modelled as ideal transmitter. Analysing these configurations would provide a more complete understanding ofNIRSpec’s polarisation sensitivity. Fourth, validation through measurement data would help determine the accuracy of the ray tracer presented in this master thesis research. This data could come from eithermeasurements of NIRSpec during operational lifetime or comparable instruments of which measurement data is available.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

An equivalent formulation of the positive energy condition is obtained, allowing for a geometrical interpretation of this condition and which yields necessary conditions for satisfying this condition. By the theory of the Mackey machine, the strongly continuous unitary representations of such groups that are of positive energy are classified by corresponding stabilizer subgroups. In a specific case, these are fully determined up to equivalence.\\ Finally, a method is developed that embeds homogeneous bundles as eigenspace subbundles of trivial bundles that in particular applies to the bundles obtained through the representation theory of groups mentioned above.

Hydrological models exist that can report bottlenecks in urban infrastructures. However, these require accurate rainfall estimations with high temporal and spatial resolution. The fulfillment of these requirements is challenged due to high costs. This can be solved with cost-effective acoustic rainfall sensors, that can be densely distributed over a city. A (machine learning) prediction model is then needed to infer rainfall from acoustic data. It is infeasible to create or calibrate a seperate model to the specific characteristics of every acoustic sensor. This research focuses on domain adaptation techniques that transfer a model designed for one sensor, called the source, to a characteristically different one, called the target. A two-stage regressor model is devised that estimates rainfall intensity from acoustic data. In a supervised learning setting, this gave an average $R^2$ score of 0.67. Transfer Component Analysis (TCA) has been used as a semi-supervised domain adaptation technique, where no annotations from the target sensor are needed. This resulted in an average $R^2$ of 0.59. Finally, a supervised domain adaptation technique, where some annotations are used, is proposed using TCA and a mean matching method. Two flavours are researched. In the batched approach a small selection of target annotations are gathered, where after the rainfall is predicted with a delay. The online approach predicts in real-time, but adjusts the prediction model when a new target annotation is available. These resulted in an average $R^2$ of 0.52 and 0.32, respectively.","Domain Adaptation; Pattern Recognition; Rainfall estimation; Acoustic Sensor","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using Failure Mode, Effects Analysis (FMEA), the operating regimes under which gears and bearings can potentially get damaged are ascertained. A correlation between the damage operating conditions and the root cause of failure is analyzed using boxplots. In particular, a correlation between operating conditions and, the unusual and unexplained White Etching Cracks or axial cracking failure that occur frequently in the high-speed shaft bearings is studied. Additionally, this methodology is also used to complement the Artificial Neural Network model developed for anomaly detection.Finally, an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) based on a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is developed for fault detection. The model is trained on data when the turbine was operating normally, to predict gear bearing and gearbox lubrication oil temperatures. A stacked Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), a type of RNN model with two hidden layers resulted in predictions with the lowest mean squared error (0.14640퐶) and with good generalization. The difference/residual between the measured and ANN predicted temperatures are used to flag anomalies. The ANN-based condition monitoring method is validated through case studies using real data from wind turbines. The results from the case studies indicate that the RNNbased fault detection method can detect a failure in the wind turbine gearbox components as early as 3-6 months before it fails.","Wind turbine gearbox; Physics of Failure; Artificial Neural Networks; White etch cracks; Predictive Maintenance; Condition Monitoring","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-09-12","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

(mentor); Tromp, N. (mentor); Jamsin, E. (mentor); de Boer, Femke (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","This graduation project explores how the concept of problem sustaining interaction (PSI) patterns in mental development in adolescence can be used for design. In contrast to the currently used Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), which describes psychiatric disorders from only a psychological perspective, the concept of PSI-patterns describes mental health problems as interaction problems. This new holistic approach incorporates interactions within the individual, but also those between people and their environment. To concretise the concept of PSI-patterns, I used the knowledge of system theory. From the research is concluded that factors on multiple levels influence each other; from biological to cultural. The factors in a system form loops that together reach an equilibrium. PSI-patterns consist of smaller, reinforcing feedback loops of which multiple together cause a system to move towards a problematic state. Changing a system requires effort and outside support. By making the patterns insightful, it becomes clear what strategies can be used to create positive change. The physical, social and psychological changes during adolescence make them particularly vulnerable to develop mental problems. There is a taboo around talking about mental health and society turns a blind eye. This causes adolescents when they struggle mentally to feel abnormal and alone, to lack knowledge and understanding to talk about their struggles and to feel not taken seriously when told that troubles are ‘just part of life’. To support adolescents in their mental development I introduce the design concept “The Bumpy Road”. The Bumpy Road supports adolescents to learn to understand their feelings by recognizing them in others. It is a platform with a variety of podcasts in which adolescents share personal and authentic stories about times in adolescence where they struggled. The problematic patterns of the storyteller are unravelled and explained to listeners in conversation with a pattern expert. The patterns that are discussed in the podcast are linked to other stories on the platform that include their version of the pattern. By making patterns insightful, listeners understand why problems keep occurring and get direction on how to navigate towards a more sustainable situation. The Bumpy Road teaches listeners the language to talk about struggles, normalizes them and provides advice on how to help themselves or support others. This project brings PSI-patterns from a conceptual level towards a concrete and validated design service, and thereby proves that PSI-patterns are a suitable framework for design.<br","Mental Health; Adolescents; Patterns; Interaction; Design; Podcast","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

Though these two disciplines have the same basic requirements, there are clear distinctions in the technical sports gestures that the respective athletes employ. This is due to some fundamental differences in the vehicles used, one critical difference being that the trial motorcycle has a suspension system while the trial bicycle does not. This leads to incompatibility between the sports at a high level as cross-training can cause learned skill errors, where athletes adopt bad habits from practicing the other discipline. This is particularly problematic for trial motorcyclists, as there are various benefits from training with a bicycle, namely: bicycles provide a more complete workout for trial riders, bicycles are easier to maintain, laws restrict the use of motorcycles in certain areas, and the fact that many trial riders begin their trial experiences on a bicycle. To solve this problem, this project aims to answer the following research question: “Will the integration of a suspension system in a trial bicycle allow it to mimic more closely the usability of a motorcycle trial, in order to be suitable for cross-training of trial athletes?” To answer this question, I employ the Stanford d-school’s Design Thinking approach to create a functional prototype of a hybrid trial bike.

This study provides a proof of concept for a generative breakwater layout design tool, applicable to port projects all around the world. This is accomplished by investigating the most suitable optimisation method, by setting up a universally applicable methodology for the determination of the economic optimum and by establishing a robust and flexible model set-up. By validating it against a real case, the parametric model consistently comes up with breakwater layouts having cost estimates that are located within the desired accuracy range for the conceptual design phase. In addition, the parametric model is flexible, as it is able to efficiently deal with changes in design requirements and future port developments, therewith living up to modern design standards.

However, it lacks practical applications of changes to the design of the scour protection and fails to quantify the expected effects of these changes. In this study the extend to which marine life in the North Sea can be enhanced through improvements to the scour protection design for monopiles in wind farms is researched by comparing the habitat suitability in three situations (North Sea in absence of wind farms, North Sea with wind farms and scour protections as currently designed, and wind farms with enhanced scour protections) for four indicator species (Atlantic cod, European lobster, flat oyster, and the Ross worm). For the third situation (the enhanced scour protections), several habitat enhancements as well as some stock enhancements have been proposed and their expected effects and costs have been studied. The availability of hard substrate and the absence of (seabed disturbing) fisheries is what makes wind farms suitable compared to a sandy sea bed. These habitats can be further improved by using a large and narrow grading to provide shelter and stable attachment material and by placement of additional elements such as piles of rock, (concrete) tubes, and shell filled nets. Species which are not likely to successfully colonize the wind farm, such as the European lobster and flat oyster, are to be introduced by humans through stock enhancements.","North Sea; Monopiles; Nature; Scour protection","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering | Hydraulic Structures","",""

They govern the functions required for life, from metabolism to locomotion. In these networks, the presence of network motifs were identified, recurring elements supposedly kept by evolution. One of them is called the feedforward loop and has the function of a sign-sensitive delay element or noise-filter. Moreover, different combinations of several types of feedforward loops were identified in the transcription networks of Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, called complex feedforward loops. From this finding a question arises: do different types of combined feedforward loops have a specific function? Would this identified function be useful in synthetic biology applications? Answering these questions is the ultimate goal of a research direction in systems biology, studied at the Institute of Complex Molecular Systems at Eindhoven University of Technology. However, biological experiments are difficult to setup and conduct in a suitable manner to generate relevant results. Therefore, it would be highly effective to be able to predict the nonlinear dynamical behaviour of these (combined) feedforward loops. Nevertheless, in order to be able to achieve this, first a single feedforward loop must be fully modelled, calibrated and analysed. This master thesis focuses on this goal and is composed of three main elements: modelling, parameter estimation and structural analysis. The modelling section comprises of the methodology derived in order to transpose the biochemical reactions into equations and perform model reduction on the feedforward loop built at the ICMS. Then, a hybrid parameter estimation method was applied successfully and made it possible to perform numerical simulations of the system. Lastly, the focus was directed to structural analysis and obtaining insights about the behaviour of the network without knowledge of the parameters. This included the adaptation of metabolic network analysis tools, elementary flux mode analysis and flux balance analysis to be used on gene expression networks. As a result, it was possible to link the nonlinearity of the steady-states observed in the experimental data with the accumulation of certain compounds.","systems biology; modelling; Parameter estimation; Structural analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

They can be used to mobilise the electrical infrastructure, by providing an independent energy source for medium-consumption products, like decorative lighting. This thesis shows all aspects of designing and building an interior, solar powered lamp. First, the ideal position for indoor light harvesting has been investigated extensively, by recreating two typical Dutch rooms with 3D modelling software Blender. The light simulation tool RADIANCE was then used to compute the irradiance at various spots in the room, considering three standard sky types. Weather data from the KNMI was used to classify the sky conditions for every hour during two weeks in November, and the results were compared with pyranometer measurements, showing an error of 20% on a daily basis, and 5% over a five day period. The same simulation method was applied to predict the PV energy yield of four common solar cell technologies for a full year, for multiple room orientations and positions on a wall. Based on these results, three concepts were designed, corresponding to three specific room positions with different indoor light characteristics. Ultimately, one concept was chosen to be build as a prototype, with tailor-made, foil-to-foil laminated PV module, consisting of laser cut SunPower interdigitated back contact (IBC) cell technology. At standard test conditions, the measured short-circuit current was 2.37 A, with an open-circuit voltage of 21.5 V and a maximum power point of 35.9 W<sub>p</sub>, resulting in an efficiency of 20.3%. Furthermore, a charge controller with maximum power point tracking algorithm was used to charge a 12V polymer lithium-ion battery pack. The combination of pyroelectric infrared (PIR) motion sensor detector and a light sensor module assures a conservative use of a 2.4 W strip of light emitting diodes (LED).","indoor photovoltaics; IPV; interior light simulation; RADIANCE; Blender; PV module design; Prototyping; SunPower IBC technology; laser cutting; integrated sensors","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-09-30","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","Due to often existing subsea infrastructure or challenging seabed conditions, engineers are forced to design newnearshore pipeline trajectories that are not always in a straight line. Since subsea tie-in operations are often complex and relatively expensive, alternative methods like pulling pipelines into a curve are worthwhile. By means of this research fundamental knowledge of pipe pull operations into curved trajectories is acquired. This thesis research focuses on the soil - structure interaction between the sliding pipeline and the seabed. A more thorough understanding is obtained of the geotechnical processes that create lateral resistance of the pipeline against the forces applied by the installation vessel. The main goal behind this thesis is to expand the capabilities of pipeline installation by exploring the feasibility of curved pipe pull projects. The research is based on three fundamental elements: 1. An extensive theoretical study 2. A validated numerical soil-structure interaction model 3. A successful physical test campaign of thirty-two experiments The theoretical study of the thesis focuses on the physical processes that play a role during curved pipe pull operations. Research is conducted to gather knowledge of the three main subjects of research, being: 1. Structural behaviour of a concrete covered pipeline 2. Geotechnical behaviour of soil under lateral pipeline displacement 3. Geotechnical behaviour of soil under axial pipeline displacement Since this was the first known research into curved pipe pull operations, influences of dynamic environmental loads are excluded from the scope of research. The second stage of the research focused on creating an engineering model that enabled to predict to what extend partially embedded pipelines can be pulled into a curved trajectory on sandy seabeds. After considering multiple simpler structural models, the final result was a non-linear spring supported tensioned bending beam model. Within this computational prediction model: the lateral soil resistance is modeled by means of a P(Y) spring model, while the pipeline is represented by the tensioned bending beam. The applied lateral soil resistance model is computed based on researches ofWang et al. (2018) and Verley and Sotberg (1994). After themodel was completed, a purpose made test facility was created to pull scaled pipelines into a curved trajectory. During the test-campaign, five different model pipelines were tested on a scale range of 1/11.8 to 1/5.3. The physical test campaign provided valuable experimental data of thirty-two successful drained curved pipe pull tests. By means of the acquired set of experimental data the model was able to be validated. Since the model pipelines differed in diameter, specific weight and bending stiffness, the influence of those parameters is examined. From the fact that the majority of the model pipelines was pulled into a radius that was 0-30% lower than the computed radius,we can state that the numerical model predictions gives awell defined upper limit of the controlled pull radius of pipelines. Along the classified critical curved pulls, the imposed lateral force during the experimentswas within 20% of the maximum predicted force in 86% of the physical tests. From this observation we can conclude that the numerical model captures the maximum lateral pull force with a high accuracy.","Soil-structure interaction; pipelines; offshore pipelines; Installation design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-09-11","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

This includes its effort to predict the power flows in its lines and maintain the flows under a safety margin. Due to the said uncertainties and approximations, predicted power flows in the lines can exceed the acceptable limits. Under such a scenario, the responsible TSO has to take actions to ensure that this predicted violation won’t occur in the reality. It needs to be noted that the flow in the line that mandated these actions could be caused partly by power exchanges outside the borders of the TSO. The responsible TSO bears the costs of these actions initially. The incurred expenses can be split in a fair manner by partitioning the power flow in the line into power flows caused by the power exchanges of all zones. Full Line Decomposition(FLD) is an application developed by the FB4INV team at TenneT that calculates the power flow partitions. To compute the power flow partitions, it requires all power exchanges occurring in the system. The existing method of computing power exchanges(called the Bialek method) models the power network as a directed graph based on power flows in the branches. It traces the flow of power from the generator to the load(or vice-versa) along the paths available. If a power flow path is not available due to the directed modelling, an error of zero power exchange is introduced. There exists multiple ways of computing the power exchanges. This paper attempts to find an unquestionable method. A method of computing power exchanges based on electrical distance reflects the behaviour of the power system in distributing flows. Through the literature review, the superposition method was found that makes use of circuit theory to find generator-to-load power contribution. In the course of the thesis, the superposition method was found to have a flaw in the equations. A new approach was developed in this thesis where power exchange is computed by defining it as an optimisation problem. The objective function of the optimisation problem reflects the excepted behaviour of the power system. The optimisation process was implemented using a genetic algorithm. The existing and developed methods were tested on an IEEE 30 bus system.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-09-11","","","","Electrical Engineering","",""

This model is compared to measurements of the output signal of a real guitar and their corresponding spectra. From this comparison it is concluded that the damping term in the damped wave equation is sufficient to roughly describe the decrease in amplitude over time of the envelope in the output signal of an electrical guitar.<br/>The measured guitar signal also displays beating which has been considered to be caused by the interference of parallel and perpendicular modes on the guitar string with slightly differing frequencies. It is shown that the order of magnitude of this difference in frequencies between parallel and perpendicular modes is neither caused by different effective values of the damping coefficient nor by the influence of co-vibrating string boundaries.

This includes the segmentation of e.g. Light Optical Microscopy or Scanning Electron Microscopy images where each pixel is assigned to a material. Since some phases such as the γ-γ’ structure in nickelbased superalloys feature a high complexity and appear in a wide range of different sizes and shapes, segmentation is traditionally done by experts in a manual ap- proach . With Deep Neural Networks, a competitive method to automate this time-consuming, costly and inconsistent analysis, is found. Recently, their special instances of Convolutional Neu- ral Networks outperform any other machine learning algorithms in computer vision tasks by com- pressing the raw input image content to its most meaningful features. Applying these models to image segmentation demands for an adaption of their architecture, in order to maximize both, lo- cation and semantic information.

While there is a rising population with a rising demand for mobility, the limits of nature affecting society need to be considered. Avoiding mobility completely seems to be challenging considering a more globalized world, where everything is connected. For this reason, creating a strategy for sustainable mobility is relevant. For creating an innovation strategy several fields were considered and analyzed. Sustainability implications were made and the issues of mobility in terms of sustainability were found out. Since greenhouse gases is the most severe problem it was looked more deeply into different kinds of fuels, which can solve the issue of greenhouse gases. Furthermore, it was looked into strengths and unique characteristics of Embraer, its current situation and brand DNA. An analysis of stakeholders in aviation revealed current barriers that make it difficult for the aviation industry to act sustainably. Also, competitors and their innovation and sustainability strategy were considered. Mapping the context of sustainable mobility helped in identifying major opportunities and threats for Embraer and create trend scenarios that demonstrate possible future developments. Based on the analysis results search fields and a future vision were created. Within a one-day business case, the Embraer Business Challenge, 14 students generated ideas, that were later developed by experts. The final solution proposes to collaborate with a bus manufacturer, that produces hydrogen fuel cell busses. Through the collaboration, Embraer can learn about the technology of hydrogen fuel cells, which helps Embraer to launch its first hydrogen fuel cell 30-seater airplane in 2035. Also, creating and launching a prototype in the time frame between 2025 and 2034 supports Embraer in gaining more experience with hydrogen fuel cells and to convince stakeholders regarding the technology. While preparing the launch of the hydrogen airplane, Embraer uses the collaboration with the bus manufacturer to further invest into busses. Improving the entertainment offer, and connecting the bus experience to further modes of transport makes the offer of the bus more attractive to consumers. Through connecting the different mobility experiences, and offering using several modes of transport through a subscription, Embraer goes into the growing market of mobility-as-a-service. In 2035 Embraer can embed its hydrogen airplane in the MaaS system and promote the airplane through the established system in a better way. The strategic roadmap has been elaborated with several experts to validate the feasibility and desirability of the roadmap solution.","sustainable mobility; hydrogen airplane; roadmap","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

Uncertainty about the potential fuel savings makes ship owners reluctant apply wind-assisted propulsion on a large scale. The goal of this thesis is to develop a method that identifies the aspects of a vessel design, that can be optimised to minimise the payback period of Flettner rotors. <br/>This research identifies all cost aspects that are affected by Flettner rotors. Of these cost aspects the fuel costs have the largest influence on the payback period of a Flettner rotor investment. However, these costs are also the hardest to predict in an early design stage. Therefore, this research focusses on determining the fuel savings from Flettner rotors. <br/>To determine the fuel consumption of a ship with Flettner rotors, the Performance Prediction Program (PPP) has been developed. The PPP solves the force and moment balance equations in surge, sway, roll and yaw directions, including the physical effects from Flettner rotors. The physical phenomena that are a result of Flettner rotors lead to several operational characteristics whose occurrence could affect the benefits of Flettner rotors: throttling back Flettner rotors, applying constant rudder angles and changing the propeller operating point It is shown that the PPP provides accurate results, in close agreement with on-board measurements. The average savings that are predicted by the PPP differ slightly from the measured savings.<br/>The Weather Routing Program (WRP) has been developed to obtain an operational profile of a ship with Flettner rotors. This operational profile is used to determine annual fuel savings, and it determines the occurrence of the operational characteristics. <br/>The WRP simulates a ship's operational conditions using historical weather data. It combines the Flettner rotor performance from the PPP and actual sailing schedules as input for voyage simulations. In the voyage simulations the optimal route is calculated with the lowest fuel consumption. <br/>If analysis of the WRP results shows that an operational characteristic is significantly affected by Flettner rotors, related design aspects should be optimised. A case study that was performed on a case ship with Flettner rotors. The study demonstrates how the developed methods are used to identify aspects of a vessel design that are interesting to optimise, when Flettner rotors are applied. It was shown that the position of the Flettner rotor on the case ship has significant influence on the operational occurrence of large rudder angles and the corresponding rudder resistance. Choosing the optimal Flettner rotor location ensures adequate manoeuvring capabilities for the ship. With the Flettner rotor on its optimal position, no other measures are required to increase manoeuvring capabilities; no larger or more effective rudders are required, additional appendages do not have to be considered. The operational analysis in the case study also showed that the average engine load is significantly reduced as a result of Flettner rotors. This possibly allows to install a smaller main engine. This could reduce the Flettner rotor investment cost and decrease the Flettner rotor payback time.<br/><br","Wind-assist; Propulsion; Flettner rotor; Performance prediction; Voyage optimisation; Weather routing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Marine Technology","",""

This means that the scale of these heat pipes is typically in the order of centimeters. Zijm suggests that heat pipes could be used for geothermal applications, but literature is lacking. To further investigate the geothermal application of heat pipes, a large scale heat pipe is built. This thesis gives an insight in the typical design challenges that one faces when constructing a heat pipe of this scale. The heat pipe that is constructed can support a heat flow of 10 kW. The heat pipe is constructed from mainly 54 millimeter copper and glass pipes. The evaporator section is 1.5 meters long and facilitates controlled electric heating. Then follows a 4 meter long adiabatic section. The condenser section is 2.5 meters long. The total length of the heat pipe is 9 meters. The individual sections are held together by EPDM connectors. The dimensions of the heat pipe are compared to the operational limits posed by the Engineering Sciences Data Unit. Then the thermal resistances of the heat pipe sections are calculated and afterwards validated. The interfacial thermal resistance between the electric heaters and evaporator wall was reduced by applying thermal conduction paste to the band heaters. It was found that at coolant flows of 1000 l/h and higher, the vapour temperature in the heat pipe drops significantly. The drop in temperature facilitates a higher heat flow through the heat pipe. Also, the resistance across the evaporator and the condenser section gets smaller for higher coolant flows. The results found are supported by theory and formulae from the Engineering Sciences Data Unit.","Heat pipe; Geothermal; Design; Renewable energy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This is due to its energy demand, production and transportation of building materials, and its maintenance. Actually, the building industry is one of the most polluting industries that contribute to climate change. In the Netherlands alone, this sector is chargeable for 50% of the materials consumed, 40% of the total energy used and 35% of the total CO2 emissions. To limit the effects of climate change, the Dutch government has set several requirements for new buildings concerning energy use and emissions. The energy performance of buildings is a requirement to minimise the energy demand of buildings. The environmental performance is a requirement to reduce the environmental impact of materials used in the building. These requirements correlate negatively. Therefore, when the regulations get more strict, it will not be possible to satisfy both. Thus, the requirements will adversely affect each other. This thesis ‘When energy savings become a waste’ describes research about the design of facades to increase the sustainable performance of office buildings steered by the regulations energy performance of buildings and environmental performance of buildings. It is about the conflicting demand and how to design a facade in such a way that no energy will be lost because the energy reduction is less than the energy needed for the production of an element. The main research question that is answered in this research is ‘How can the Dutch building industry achieve sustainable buildings by designing according to both the energy performance and environmental performance of buildings applied on facades?’ First of all, the relation between sustainability, energy performance-, environmental performance- and circularity of buildings is established. In this research, sustainability is defined as a goal to minimize harmful emissions to the planet. This goal can be achieved in different ways , one of which is the circular building principal. A circular approach of building aims to no longer use new resources and produce no more waste. The energy performance of buildings and the environmental performance of buildings can help steer towards sustainable buildings. Next, the concepts of the environmental performance of buildings (MPG) and the energy performance of buildings (EPC) are introduced, and their current use in methods and tools is analysed. Several methods exist in which the energy performance and the environmental performance are combined. For this research, the ‘sustainability performance of buildings’ (DPG) will be used, which is an objective method combining the energy and material by converting the total CO2 emission in the energy performance to shadow costs and by adding this to the shadow costs as calculated in the environmental performance. Therefore, the sustainability performance indicates the total emissions of the whole life cycle of a product, process or building and the total costs required to bring the environmental impacts of a product, process or building to an acceptable level. The sustainability performance of buildings is expressed in shadow costs per square meter, €/m2. In a one-factor-at-the-time analysis, the environmental- and energy performance of buildings is calculated in different scenarios with a varying parameter in the design of the facade. For this analysis, a reference office building was used as a study case. This is a medium-sized office building with a curtain wall facade of aluminium and triple glazing. Eight variants are examined, in particular: type of glass, insulation value and insulation material, the ratio of open and closed parts in the facade, use of PV-panels on the facade, sun shading, facade composition, orientation and changing the building process from linear to circular. The most important results of the case study are as follows: •In types of glazing, vacuum glazing has the best sustainability score. Also, triple glazing with a total glass thickness of 12 mm is an improvement compared to the current thickness of 16 mm. The performance of HR++ glazing is only 1% worse than triple glazing and can, therefore, also be considered in use. •The insulation value, as well as the insulation material, has no significant influence on the sustainability performance. The reduction in energy by adding more insulation material is almost equal to the energy needed for the production of the extra material. •The percentage of glass in the facade has a tremendous impact on both the environmental performance and energy performance. Both the performances get worse with a higher percentage of glass. The trend in the design of office building is, however, to increase the percentage of glass. •The use of PV panels in the facade is beneficial for the sustainability performance. The revenue is small for PV panels on the north facade, and the investment will not pay off. In the other orientations the PV panels the payback time is between 11 and 15 years. PV panels on the south facade achieve the most improvement. •The addition of sun shading will only slightly improve the sustainability performance when no louvres are included in the design and the control system is optimal to reduce the heating and cooling demand. •A change in the facade system and materials can significantly reduce the sustainability performance. However, this is mainly caused because no louvres are added in the other facade designs. Therefore the addition of louvres is not sustainable; neither is increasing the height of the floors. The facade with wooden cladding has the best sustainability performance. •The orientation of the building can influence the sustainability performance without changing other parameters. For the reference building, the most optimal orientation is achieved by a rotation of 90 degrees. The windows are then orientated north and south. •The effect of different circular scenarios is calculated and compared to the reference scenario with a service life of 50 years. The scenario considering the reference situation with a realistic service life of 20 years, has the highest score of all. In the next scenario, the percentage of reuse is increased to 60% and the service life of the facade is 20 years, resulting in an improved sustainability performance of 2%. In the last scenario, the service life is extended to 100 years, causing an improvement of 4%. Conclusions of this research are only based on the sustainability performance and do not take into account social and financial aspects. Therefore in some variants, the most sustainable solution might not be feasible in practice. For example, vacuum glazing is very expensive, and consequently, triple glazing with a thickness of 12 mm is advised to use. One realistic variant is calculated with a combination of variants. In this scenario, financial and social feasibility are taken into account, and an improvement of 15,5% is achieved, showing the value of this integral approach. Based on this research, it can be concluded that the Dutch building industry can achieve sustainable buildings when the design is focused on decreasing the sustainability performance of buildings. An integral approach considering both energy and material use is essential when enhancing the sustainability performance of buildings. The goal of the Dutch government to steer on CO2 emission can help to improve the sustainability performance. However, the relationship between the sustainability performance and CO2 emission is not entirely linear. Energy and material use need to be balanced together to accomplish a sustainable built environment. To be able to use this knowledge in a broader context it is recommended to conduct this research for a combination of the used variants, take into account design aspects of the whole building, and perform analysis on multiple buildings. In this research, only the aspects of sustainability concerning the planet are taken into account. Aspects regarding people and profit should also be considered to determine the feasibility of sustainable measures.","Sustainability; Energy performance of buildings; Environmental performance of buildings; EPG; MPG; DPG; Sustainable facade design; Life Cycle Assessment; Energy Efficiency; Environmental impact; Circular building; Sustainability performance","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Building Engineering - Structural Design","",""

Urinary schistosomiasis is caused by the Schistosoma Haematobium (SH) parasite. The most common diagnostic method is manual microscopy, in which urine is manually examined to see whether SH eggs are present. This method requires expensive materials and well-trained staff, and is therefore often not available in remote areas. Therefore, a more accessible and automated method is being developed at the Delft University of Technology, based on the automated flow-based holographic analysis of urine samples. As the technology and its algorithms have become well developed and a context analysis for a diagnostic device using this technology has been performed, a clear need presents itself for developing the experimental setup into a functional and interactive diagnostic device and prototype. <br/><br/>To do so, the different components within the development of the diagnostic technology and product interaction have been separately developed in parallel design processes. Once the components were deemed sufficiently developed to meet the lists of requirements set out, they were combined into a single product embodiment design and prototype. This integrated prototype was designed to be both functional interactive, and all software required for this purpose was created. <br/><br/>The resulting integrated prototype was validated and optimized at the facilities of the Delft University of Technology using SH eggs in saline solution provided by the Leiden University Medical Centre. After this, an extensive field research was performed in Ivory Coast. In this, high quality data of urine samples was obtained using the prototype, and diagnosis was performed via manual microscopy to determine the number of eggs that could be potentially observed by the prototype. Aside from this, the overall performance of the prototype and its interaction in the envisioned context were assessed. The data gathered can be used in the future to reassess the diagnostic potential of the holographic technology, and optimize the reconstruction and classification algorithms within the existing prototype to turn it into a fully functional diagnostic device, capable of providing reliable and accessible diagnoses to rural areas of Africa. <br","Automated diagnostic; Digital holography; Urinary schistosomiasis; Schistosoma haematobium; Sodos; Neglected Tropical Disease","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-09-10","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

Migrating and rotating states are typically found in systems with homogeneous sizes. We show that these states are also found in binary systems. The migrating state has circulation of particles and this leads to segregation of the small and big particles. Small particles are more likely to be found in the tip of the group, while big particles accumulate at the tail. Active noise in the system plays a role in the degree of segregation.

There is a good chance that if this happens, you will have to deal with the subdistrict judge. In The Netherlands, this judge is the most accessible form for justice in (legal) conflicts. The subdistrict judge is relatively cheap, fast and deals with a big range of topics. However, in practice, questions can be put about the actual accessibility. Currently, defendants often do not take action when receiving a summons, appear at the wrong moment at the court or have wrong expectations of the subdistrict judge. As a result, there is a good chance that legal processes escalate unnecessarily and that defendants do not receive the right help for underlying problems. All these aspects ensure that the court cannot properly provide its core service: provide justice. Traditionally, the court can be seen as a wise old man on a hill, waiting for people on the top. However, waiting for the arrival of defendants at the court is often too late. Therefore, the court needs to take up an active role in activating, informing and guiding defendants before going to court. Precisely because of the neutral position of the court, the court should create a level playing field: offer equal access to all people. This new role should take shape by extending the service of the court with three new touchpoints: A visual leaflet as a neutral starting point, An online environment to experience the court in advance and An online and physical helpdesk for human guidance and questions. Hereby, the first session in court (roll session) can be changed to a more personal setting, without the formality and expectations of an actual judge. In this way, the roll session becomes a session fitting to its content: a qualitative moment for verbal responses. After implementing the service, more defendants are expected to take a right legal decision in their situation, to appear in court at the right moment and to have a better court experience. In the longer term, more people will have a realistic view of the court and the general sense of justice is expected to rise.","Service Design; Court; Subdistrict Judge; Defendants; Summons; Co-creation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

However, finding a new future for a church building is not as easy as it sounds, as it mostly result in protracted and complex processes in which involved stakeholders can hardly come to an agreement. In order to increase clarity, this article identifies different stakeholder perspectives on determining a future for church buildings in The Netherlands. By using Q methodology three shared perspectives could be identified, as well as areas of agreement, in dealing with vacant church buildings. The perspectives named: A) “church building as house for the public”, B) “making well considered choices” and C) “church councils in control”. The perspectives share awareness of the importance of church buildings for society and are all willing to retain those buildings for the future. However, they disagree on what possible future is preferred and how the process of defining a future should be shaped. Where perspective A mainly focuses on culture-historical values, perspective B has more eye for financial feasibility of reuse and perspective C stresses the importance of the religious meaning of the church building. The differences between those perspectives together with the secrecy of stakeholders is therefore seen as one of the most deciding bottlenecks in reuse processes of church buildings.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

In the current dynamic model of the Netherlands transmission system, negative load is used to represent wind turbines, however, this could be no longer sufficient if more wind turbines are connected to the grid.<br/>The purpose of this Master Thesis Project is the study and analysis of voltage response of wind turbines models based on the IEC 61400-27-1 standard and the WECCWind Plant DynamicModeling Guidelines, both of them currently implemented in several softwares.<br/>This project proposes a modelling methodology for distributed wind turbines, using a single turbine representation and a combined model instead of a negative load directly connected to the grid.<br/>PowerFactory and PSSE softwares are used for the modelling of wind turbines, allowing to compare the models based on the IEC standard and the models based on the WECC guidelines respectively.<br/>For the simulations performed in these two softwares, parameters suitable for comparing both of them are proposed. Besides, an analysis on the differences between both models is provided.<br/>The parameters proposed are used later on for the modelling of distributed wind turbines in the grid.<br/>The methodology for the modelling of distributed wind turbines was proposed and analysed using a region in the Netherlands as case of study and the PSSE software (widely used by transmission system operators) with the generic parameters proposed in the previous analysis.<br/>The proposed methodology and parameters show a more realistic behavior of the wind turbines compared to the use of a negative load. It also provides a grouping proposal depending on the types of distributed wind turbines connected to the grid. In some cases, when the wind energy connected to the system has low impact, the use of a detailed model instead of a negative load is not very representative. Therefore, this project proposes a calculation for the impact that wind energy has in each substation, making easier to decide what is the most suitable level of modelling detail.","wind turbines; IEC 61400-27; WECC; voltage stability","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-09-06","","","","Electrical Engineering","",""

Due to the severe consequences, blast puts a great threat to public security. Thus, civil engineers should take these extreme cases into consideration during the design process to ensure the integrity of the basic frameworks of the structures to provide the possibility to the following rescue works. Nonlinear finite element analysis is a useful method for civil engineers to check the integrity of the structures under blast loading. However, there could be lots of different solution strategies for the same physical situation that may lead to differences in the corresponding numerical results. A solution strategy is a certain combination of different options in all the steps during the setting-up of the finite element model, including the definition of loads, boundary conditions, material models, element types and element sizes. Therefore, to which extent can civil engineers simulate the dynamic behavior of experiments of concrete columns with blast loading by nonlinear finite element analysis is of great interest. In this thesis, 36 different solution strategies for the same physical situation are discussed. DIANA 10.2 Educational Version is applied to generate numerical results of finite element models with different solution strategies. The modelling of boundary conditions, bond effect between steel reinforcements and concrete, blast pressure profiles and the choice of element types and the order of element on the numerical results are investigated and discussed in this thesis by dividing the 36 models into 51 groups. And the question about to which extent can we reduce the computation time while the accuracy is still satisfying is addressed.<br/>Firstly, an investigation of literature is performed. Column CONV-7 from Test 1 of Siba’s report is selected. The blast pressure profiles at the bottom, and top of the front face of the column, and the bottom, the mid-height, and the top of the rear face of the column were recorded with pressure gauges. The displacement-time diagrams of the 1.0 m, 1.5 m and 2.0 m from the column footing of the rear face of the column were recorded while only the diagram at 1.0 m from the column footing was reliable. Then the finite element analyses with different solution strategies are performed and compared in groups. In this treatise, 36 finite element analyses with different solution strategies are performed. The numerical displacement results at 1.0 m from the column footing of the rear face of the column are compared to the experimental results.The errors of these finite element analyses with different solution strategies vary from 3.476% to 50.116%. Thus, the choice of solution strategies has a significant influence on the accuracy of the numerical results for nonlinear finite element analyses for this situation. However, there is only a limited number of solution strategies are discussed and only the displacement results at 1.0 m from the column footing are compared, therefore, the solution strategy with the lowest error may not be the most recommended one. The inclusion of the negative phases of the blast pressure profiles has an increasingly significant influence on the evaluation of the safety of those structures and structural components that are not destroyed before reaching the largest deformation in the direction of wave propagation, which differs from Karlos’ statement[17]. The modelling of damping effect with Rayleigh damping coefficients for the structures may not be very suitable, which disagrees with the example listed in the manuals of DIANA 10.2[1]. interpretation and modelling of the boundary conditions have an important influence on the numerical results, for the models with simplified geometries, modification of boundary conditions is required. The first-order elements, due to the uniform mass distributions and fewer degrees of freedom, are more recommended for both accuracy and efficiency reasons. The choice of mesh sizes in the support structure has a limited influence on the numerical results<br/>as the support structure is less sensitive to the blast loading. The modelling of bond-slip effect between the rebars and concrete would lead to limited differences in the numerical results, this may due to the overestimation of the shear stiffness of the interface elements between the reinforcements and concrete. The finite element models with plane stress elements generally yield to a conservative result in the displacement due to the neglect of the out-of-plane deformation and the confinement of the ties is not included due to the neglect of the transverse rebars in the direction that perpendicular to the wave propagation.","Explosions; Nonlinear Analyses; NLFEM; Transient Analyses; Solution Strategies","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-12-31","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

Platforms such as Airbnb have been raising rapidly in the past century, as a result of an increased online demand for peer-to-peer market places, on which all kinds of private goods can be shared with peers. This is also referred to as the sharing or collaborative economy. The major effects of the market these platforms provide are forcing local politicians to formulate policy plans on how to dealt with the disruptive innovations. But existing regulatory frameworks are often not complete, showing gaps or even non-existing. As a result, the environment where these peer-to-peer platforms emerge in, consists out of an ’institutional void’. Here, the ’rules of the game’ are lacking which results in high uncertainty and interdependence, leading to actors showing certain behaviour in response. This leads to an unstructured problem to be solved. The aim of this research is to gain understanding on how this interaction process between platform Airbnb and governments is taking place in search for reduction of institutional voids, and to gain insights in the complexity of this interaction. Therefore the objective of this study is to detect patterns occurring in the interaction process answering the research question: How do regulations on peer-to-peer sharing economy platforms in an institutional void come about in capital cities?<br/>In order to answer this question, the interaction process between the peer-to-peer platform Airbnb and governments in two cities (Amsterdam and London) has been reconstructed, as part of a multiple-case set up. This study focuses explicitly on the process. Therefore, the methodological approach process tracing is used to detect patterns. By doing so, different types of data sources have been used: public documents, news articles and a few supporting interviews. These sources have been analysed to reconstruct the course of events and detect the four sensitizing concepts that have been chosen to detect the patterns with in institutional voids: External events, actions, frames and values. ATLAS.ti has been used to code the data available and structure it in an efficient way. Incrementally, all information has been connected to establish a clear understanding of what events have occurred. Using the process tracing method has on the two cases has led to patterns that have been detected based on a numerous observations gained by analysing empirical data. The founded data was structured into four stages of institutionalisation: the ’steady stage’, ’minor adjustments stage’, ’crisis stage’ and the ’framework formulation stage’. The detected patterns were: 1)Actions and external events are clear causes as part of agenda setting, 2)The platform provider develops an adaptive strategy over time, 3)Governments struggle with public versus private contradiction, leading to them experimenting with a mix of alternative instruments over time, 4)The definition of the concept is an ongoing process in which a new phenomenon is parading as something existing: ""New wine in old bottles"". The found patterns must give better understanding to policy makers of the complexity of the interaction process in an institutional void, to recognize and be able to act upon in similar situations. These patterns have been shaped into hypotheses that can be tested into further research.","Peer-to-peer sharing economy platforms; Airbnb; Institutional void; case-study; process tracing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(mentor); Dodou, D. (graduation committee); Vallery, H. (graduation committee); de Winter, J.C.F. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","BACKGROUND - In a variety of patients with locomotive disorders gait efficiency is often assessed using mobile metabolic gas analysis during rehabilitative interventions. Conventionally, these measurements take 6 minutes per evaluated condition (e.g. with/without ankle-foot-orthosis; AFO). This duration is required since there is a dynamical delay between the instantaneous metabolic energy expenditure (ImEE), and the respiratory response measured at the mouth. Moreover, the breath-by-breath data is sparely sampled and noisy. Gait efficiency is therefore computed from an averaged (i.e. of 1-3 minutes) respiratory response during a steady-state metabolism (i.e. reached after 3-4 minutes). This is time consuming and can be exhausting for patients with severe gait impairments. In up-coming human-in-the-loop techniques, fast (2-3 minutes) predictions of the ImEE are made using an Instantaneous Cost Mapping (ICM) model. The ICM is based on a first-order response with a known time constant (τ) to a change in an external load (e.g. another walking speed). The τ is either identified on a subject-specific basis or set to a fixed average time constant already identified for healthy adults (42s; Selinger &amp; Donelan, 2014). It is unknown whether this technique could be applied in patient populations with additional gait impairments. When applicable, the ICM model could speed-up the assessment of the gait efficiency and open ways to make human-in-the-loop protocols feasible device optimization (e.g. AFO tuning) in rehabilitation. AIM - This study investigates whether the subject-specific and/or general ICM model could reduce the required measurement duration in a variety of patients that cope with gait impairments as consequence of a neurology or neuromuscular disease. Secondarily, it explores whether there are differences in the identified subject-specific τ among the pathologies.METHODS - Post hoc metabolic data, recorded in the period of 2006 to 2019 within the Amsterdam University Medical Centers (UMC) was collected, containing walking trials of patients with Multiple Sclerosis, Cerebral Palsy, several neuromuscular disorders, healthy adults and typically developing children. The ICM model was tested for the subject-specific and general τ to estimate the ImEE. First, using full measurement durations and later the identified reduced measurement durations. The model outcome was assessed for individually correctness. RESULTS - Results show (n = 28) that the ICM model correctly estimates the ImEE using the total conventional measurement duration (subject-specific: 96%; general: 89% individually correctness). For the identified reduced measure duration (subject-specific: 2m33s; general: 3m:04s) reduced the individually correctness to 57%. No differences among the groups were found for the subject-specific τ and the average (τ = 41.7s ± 13.5s) was similar to the reported τ for healthy adults. CONCLUSIONS - Based on the results, it can be concluded that the ICM model show similar results to healthy adults from literature. This offers prospect for the clinical application of the model in rehabilitation depending on the purposes of use. Clinicians should consider the balance between the individually correctness and measurement duration of the predictions. Results should be treated with caution due to the small and heterogeneous sample size. Future research is needed to identify differences in subject-specific τ among pathologies.","human-in-the-loop; instantaneous-cost-mapping; wearable device optimization; metabolic gas analysis; non-steady-state prediction; gait impairments","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

To better understand how the IoT platform market is evolving and to inform future decisions regarding the desired degree of openness between IoT platforms, this thesis aimed to develop a theory on the openness between IoT platforms by identifying, prioritizing and theorizing the interrelations between factors driving the decisions from IoT platform owners related to the openness of their platform towards other IoT platforms. To this end, a preliminary theoretical framework was developed which was used as input for 13 semi-structured interviews with decision makers and field experts. It was found that openness between platforms is mostly driven by complementarities. Due to the cyber-physical nature of the IoT, the domain is characterised by a high need for specialisation and platforms are often developed from a product-centric, bottom-up approach. This results in a fragmented market in which there are strong complementarities between IoT platforms. It is found that these complementarities are the main factor driving the openness between IoT platforms.","Internet of Things; IoT; Platforms; Openness; Interoperability; Decision Making; Governance","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","The connection of offshore wind turbines to the European grid has been growing in the recent years. Many European countries are adopting this renewable energy and are increasing the number of wind power plant additions into their electrical transmission networks. Due to the phase out of conventional power plants (e.g. fossil fuel fired), new challenges are arising in terms of inertia, frequency stability, voltage stability and power quality, being the latter the main focus in the present work. It is important to study the harmonic frequencies that the wind parks are going to introduce in the electrical grid and how the grid is going to respond to this sustainable energy addition. The classical methods to identify the harmonics frequencies and to assess the stability in an electrical power system are performed by considering single-input single-output (SISO) systems. Nevertheless, when modelling a power system as a SISO system, information about the dynamics of the elements in the system is neglected. To overcome this disadvantage, a representation with more than one input and one output, a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system, can be considered. The present works concerns with the development of a method for studying the harmonic frequencies of any electrical power system. Since the main elements in the grid that contribute to the creation of harmonic frequencies are the inductances and the capacitances of the transmission lines and underground cables, the present work will focus on these passive elements and it will represent the transmission lines as PI sections and the underground cables as ``fitted PI'' sections. These representations are SISO systems, because the have only a voltage signal, measured in the sending end of a transmission branch, as input; and a voltage signal, measured in the receiving end of a transmission branch, as output. Therefore, it is necessary to find an approach to build a MIMO system. This is done via a concatenation of SISO linear-time-invariant (LTI) systems to create a MIMO system. Afterwards, the MIMO system is studied with a powerful mathematical tool called the singular value decomposition that not only will give information about the harmonic frequencies in the system, but it will show it is also possible to study which input of the system is affecting the system the most and which output will be the most affected. To finish the research, a sensitivity analysis is performed with respect to the variation of the capacitances and inductances in the transmission lines and the underground cables. This analysis will evaluate possible variations in the harmonic response of the MIMO system.<br/><br/>The proposed method to investigate the harmonic frequencies of an electrical power system can be applied to any power system. For sake of illustration of application, two different power system models are addressed. First, to understand each step in the method a small size test system is studied. This study shows how to apply the method and illustrates how to interpret the evaluation outcomes. Subsequently, a synthetic model of the Randstad regional transmission network is used to test the method in a relatively larger system model. This case study is of great importance due to the new wind parks that are going to be connected to this region in the coming years. Therefore, the harmonic frequencies observed in the synthetic model of the Randstad region will be obtained and an assessment of which transmission line or underground cable is the most affected by the harmonics in the system will be performed.","singular value decomposition; multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system; single-input single-output (SISO) system; harmonic frequencies; Randstad region","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-09-05","","","","Electrical Engineering","",""

However, it also decreases the ride comfort in the mid-range of perceivable frequencies. The Unsprung Negative Skyhook (UNS) damper control method offers ride comfort improvement in the same frequency range but has its limitations. This thesis proposes two control methods with the aim of maintaining the benefits of the UNS while eliminating the drawbacks. One method is based on a Frequency-range selector (FRS) used in semi-active control. This method allows for a simple but crude frequency estimation by using single sensor information. The second method uses a Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) frequency estimator to determine the instantaneous frequency of the vibration. Depending on the vibration frequency, the controllers switch between Skyhook and UNS control to improve overall behaviour. The proposed control methods, as well as state-of-the-art control methods, are evaluated using quarter car and full vehicle simulations. For full vehicle simulations, the models are implemented in IPG CarMaker for realistic dynamic behaviour. Road profiles are obtained from the Gerotek Testing Facility for realistic inputs. Both proposed control methods show improvements for quarter car simulations. For full vehicle simulations, the FRS control method is not able to replicate these improvements. The STFT control method does achieve improvements for all simulations but is limited by its governing models. Finally, suggestions are proposed to further improve the effectiveness of the mixed control method.","ride comfort; vehicle dynamics control; skyhook; Active suspension","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-12-31","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

These activities range from meetings to individual work. Open plan offices (OPO) facilitate workplaces for office workers in a single hall. This causes office workers who perform distinct activities to share the same workspace. These different activities come into conflict with each other, since they produce different sound levels. Furthermore, the open hall of the OPO causes more co-worker interruptions in comparison with offices which are adjusted to occupants performing distinct activities. This thesis collaboration between Advanced Metropolitan Solutions (AMS) and the Living Office Design Lab (LODL) of the faculty of Industrial Design Engineering TU Delft, explores how to facilitate OPO occupants with distinct activities in achieving focus. Through 5 design interventions, a design guideline for achieving office focus is discovered, consisting of 3 elements. 1) Clustering office occupants based on their workstyle preference, decreases co-worker interruptions. 2) For workstyle-based clustering, office occupants need to communicate one of three workstyle preferences: “focus work”, “team work” or “social work”. “Focus work” workstyle communicates that the users don’t want co-worker interruption. “Team work” workstyle communicates that the occupant allows co-worker interruption, as long as the interruption is work related. “Social work” workstyle communicates that the user allows all interruptions, including non-work-related interruptions. 3) Workstyle preferences need to be communicated to the rest of the office by using indicators. Individual indicators are used for desk-to-desk workstyle preference communication. Zone indicators might enable occupants to find workstyle zones within the office. A set of tools that enables OPO occupants to communicate their workstyle preference, through personal and zone indicators, enables workplace selection based on workstyle preference. By enabling occupants to cluster through workstyle-based workplace selection, conflicting activities and co-worker interruptions are reduced.","open plan offices; activity-based working; activity-based offices; Design research; workstyle; workstyle-based; workplace selection; Flexible office; Flexible work","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

We targeted education group 4 and 5 students users, and focus on catapult games and bubble popper games as they are the most played. A set of features that could reflect students’ preference and emotion states are selected and analysed, including correct ratio, playtime, quitting possibility, etc. Using data clustering, we group students who have similar behaviour and predict their preferred game types. We identified three group of students, one shows high completion rate on all forms of questions, another shows rather low overall completion rate, and the last group has rather high completion rate on bubble popper games and lower completion rate on the catapult shooting games. Based on such findings, we conducted experiment on them to look into different gaming contents’ impact on their learning and engagement. A final experiment consists of a short math quiz and a follow-up questionnaire. The two-week online experiment receives 91 valid responses.

Those clay lumps can be reused for the construction of land reclamation projects, and hereby economic and environmental value is generated. Placement of the clay lumps<br/>in water result in a matrix of clay lumps and an interlump void space. The collapse of the interlump void space will cause large settlements and needs to be overcome before the site can be used for construction. Preloading is<br/>an effective method to close the interlump voids. Stiff clays soften over time due to unloading and swelling. As a result, the strength and stiffness of the clay lumps decrease over time. The presence of discontinuities accelerates<br/>the softening process. It was proposed by Leung et al. (2001) that the interlump void space closes under a reduced<br/>preload of 25 kPa. The interlump void space closes under a reduced preload because the lumps soften over time.<br/>The question rises if closure occurs within a normal construction timespan, i.e., 1 - 2 years, under this reduced<br/>preload. In this study, a combined experimental and numerical approach is applied to determine the influence of soil<br/>characteristics, softening and the presence of discontinuities on interlump void closure. The influence of softening due to chemical and hydro-mechanical swelling is tested by experimental swell-load tests on stiff overconsolidated<br/>Boom clay samples. Additionally, the presence of discontinuities is studied by CT images, and a miniature clay fill test is performed to study the softening time and the rearrangement effect. Furthermore, a numerical study is performed in which the influence of specific soil characteristics on void closure was researched by a sensitivity analysis. By the experimental tests, it is shown that a pore water chemistry change alters the degree of swelling and its compressibility. Furthermore, fissures were identified in the sample material by CT images. The smallest microfissures could not be identified due to the resolution of the images. Consequently, it is impossible to estimate the effect of fissures on the hydraulic conductivity. Therefore, literature data was used to estimate the hydraulic conductivity and this was used as the input in the calculations. In the numerical study, it was shown that MPM could model the softening behaviour over time. The sensitivity analysis showed that the MPM model responds consistently to parameter sensitivity analyses. This leads to the conclusion that MPM can be used as a investigation tool to increase<br/>the understanding of the influence of parameter variability on the final interlump void closure problem. The resulting strains of the numerical model comply with the theoretically calculated strains. It was expected<br/>that the numerical strains were smaller than the experimentally determined strains, due to the presence of interlump voids in the numerical model. But, the numerical strains are larger than the experimental strains. In the sensitivity<br/>analysis, it was found that the final strains and closure time are highly dependant on the soil characteristics. It is likely that the input of the MPM model differs compared to the true sample material and thus different strains result.<br/>The time until the interlump void space closes was determined by a simplified geometry in MPM under a preload of 25 kPa. For an unfissured Boom clay, interlump closure takes place after approximately 16 years while for a<br/>fissured Boom clay it only takes 2 months. Thus, closure of the highly simplified geometry takes place within a normal construction timespan for a fissured Boom clay. It must be kept in mind that the results are highly dependant<br/>on the geometry, lump size and soil characteristics. Therefore, these results can not be generalized into an estimate of the interlump void closure time for any stiff lumpy clay fill. In conclusion, the feasibility of MPM was explored and it turned out to be a promising method to model the interlump void closure problem. Further studies are required to check if the model gives plausible results for more advanced constitutive soil models and geometries. If the results are positive, MPM can be used as a investigation tool to increase the understanding of the interlump void closure time for more refined geometries.","Softening; Preloading; Reuse stiff clay; Lumpy clay fill; Interlump voids","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In an effort to become sustainable, many companies experience an increasing need to measure, manage and improve the negative economic, environmental and social impacts caused by their organizational behavior along corporate supply chains and product life cycles. Sustainability performance assessment methods are a means for business decision-makers to meet such needs. While sustainability performance assessment methods for economic and environmental dimensions are well-developed, the social dimension of sustainability is lacking in that regard. Social sustainability entails issues such as equity and human rights of company stakeholders such as employees, customers, local community members, value chain actors and society. There is an increasing concern to incorporate social sustainability by businesses so as to become sustainable in all three dimensions; however, an empirical tool is needed to for measuring the social impacts of the company operations and making improvements. The Social Life Cycle Assessment (S-LCA) tool was developed for the assessment of the social dimension of sustainability in a meaningful way for application in the business world. United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) and the Society for Environmental Toxicologists and Chemists (SETAC) developed S-LCA Guidelines and Methodological Sheets in 2009 and 2013, respectively, for assessing the social impacts of products and services across the life cycle. The UNEP/SETAC S-LCA methodological framework has been considered the “landmark in the field” of social sustainability assessment because it provides a view of the value chain, an aspect lacking in other social sustainability assessment tools. Even with recent increasing publications by S-LCA practitioners, however, S-LCA is still at an early stage of research and the UNEP/SETAC Guidelines leave a lot of room for interpretation. Thus, it is urged to conduct more research in the field of S-LCA, and a main way to contribute to its further development is through case studies. This research aims to contribute in this way by developing and applying a S-LCA methodology to a case study of the ZERO BRINE project in the Netherlands. The ZERO BRINE project is a European Union-funded partnership that works on zero liquid discharge technology for water, salt and magnesium recovery from brine effluents in the chemical process industry. The main objective of this thesis is to assess the social sustainability performances of the organizations in the ZERO BRINE system in the Netherlands using the UNEP/SETAC S-LCA framework as a reference, so as to determine the social impacts associated with the project as well as to contribute to the further development of the S-LCA methodology. Despite some limitations, in general, the approach proposed in this thesis succeeds in providing a profile of social sustainability which highlights the social hotspot areas that need improvements along the value chain. The results of the case study show the potential social hotspots in the ZERO BRINE chain, which should be considered when implementing the ZERO BRINE project. Personalized recommendations are offered per organization on how those hotspots can be improved. In this way, the advice may be valuable for members of management of the organizations wishing to increase the social sustainability of the business. In particular, the ZERO BRINE system may show a more positive social sustainability outcome if the recommendations of this thesis are implemented strategically.","Social sustainability; Social life cycle assessment; Corporate social responsibility; Social sustainability performance assessment","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One of the first is the concept design phase, which is needed to make a first assessment of the project's technical and financial feasibility. This phase is exploratory of nature, because of the early stage in the design cycle and consists of several tasks that often dependent on certain design choices. One of the most influential choices in the early stages of the design cycle is the stack equipment choice. It has a significant influence on the two primary deliverables of a concept design: the land use and the cost estimate.<br/> <br/>The problem definition holds that in practice, there is often only limited time available for the concept design phase. The short duration of the process affects the design effort by engineers in two ways. First, not all possible stack equipment options can be considered in detail, which generally is solved by an expert judgement based design freeze early in the process.<br/>And secondly, not all designs that are considered are visualised, as often only the preferred design option is visualised at the end of the process. A quick visualisation would help to better understand the design itself, and the interaction with its environment.<br/><br/>An important consequence of the above work method is that not all potential solutions are being assessed throughout the design process. This limits the adaptability of the design process and can potentially lead to suitable solutions being overlooked. To improve the design process, more stack equipment types should be considered and evaluated throughout the process, and all considered design options should be visualised. This is as yet not possible in the limited time available time in the concept phase with the currently available tools. This problem leads to the following research question:<br/><br/>What are the consequences of accelerating the generation and visualisation of concept level terminal designs, by modelling the automatable tasks, on the concept design phase? <br/><br/>A typical concept design process, as defined in this report, consists of six stages and has an indicative duration of four to eight weeks, depending on the exact outline of the project and the local conditions. The tasks that correspond to the generation of the various terminal concept design options (i.e., concept level calculations, layout generation, cost estimation and visualisation) are considered to be automatable. An examination of currently existing design tools demonstrated that there is currently no available tool that meets the requirements and therefore, a specific design tool must be developed. Parametric engineering is the chosen method for automating the concept level design process as it allows for different solutions to be explored and provides for flexibility during the process. Based on both expert interviews and studied literature, it has been decided to build the design tool using a combination of two packages in which Python is used for concept level terminal calculations and Grasshopper is used for layout generation. The developed tool can calculate the required terminal elements (e.g., storage capacity, quay length, equipment numbers), arrange these elements into a layout, make a cost estimate and instantly produce a 3D visualisation of the corresponding terminal concept design. <br/><br/>A case study is used to validate the output of the tool and to demonstrate the tool's ability to evaluate all types of stack equipment in parallel throughout the process. During this research, the design tool was used exhaustively for a wide range of terminal designs, of which the required durations were logged. In the end, this averaged to an estimated reduction in the required time for the concept phase of around half of the original four to eight weeks. It should be noted that this number is indicative and that many factors influence this number, such as the complexity of the project, the amount of 'tailoring' required and the experience the terminal planner has with using the tool. Nonetheless, based on these findings, it can be concluded that the tool allows for evaluating more options in less time.<br/> <br/>To further explore the tool's capabilities, the design tool is used to investigate the effect of four prominent local cost parameters (i.e., cost of land, labour, fuel and electrical power) on each of the considered stack equipment options. The results show that the cost of labour has the most significant influence on the terminal's cost estimate, but that the most significant discrepancies between the stack equipment options are observed when increasing the cost of land. Although the cost of labour and land are considered to have a significant influence on the concept phase, the results demonstrate that for a medium-sized container terminal located in Western Europe, the most economical stack equipment option is the RTG, regardless of the influence of the examined local cost parameters.<br/><br/>Based on the results from the case study and the exploratory research, the tool's impact on the concept design can be described as follows: firstly, the tool is able to consider all potential stack equipment types in parallel throughout the process. This new working method, therefore, enables a design freeze much later in the process than before, providing improved flexibility as changes can be anticipated throughout the concept phase. Furthermore, the time saved as a result of the design tool can now be used for more extensive expert judgement throughout the concept phase. The more time available for expert judgement, the better the terminal planner can assess the solution space of suitable design options and improve the 'fit' with local conditions. Finally, instant visualisation of the considered design options creates the ability to obtain a better understanding of the design itself and the interaction with its environment.<br/><br/>To conclude: the developed automated design tool is able to accelerate the generation and visualisation of concept level container terminal designs and thereby evaluate more design options in less time. This newly established working method is able to improve the concept design phase in three ways: i) the design process is a lot more flexible and allows for all stack equipment options to be considered during the process, ii) the time-savings enable more time for extensive expert judgement throughout the concept phase, and iii) the instant visualisation of all potential options provides the terminal planner with the ability to better assess the terminal design itself and the relation to its surroundings.","Container terminal; Design; Concept design; Design tool; design automation; Acceleration; Parametric Design; Parametric Engineering; Concept Phase","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","",""

Material variations were largely focusses on the resin fraction of the blade. This is since the matrix has the biggest impact of all materials and has a big impact on the available waste management options that are available. Material and waste management scenarios were largely selected based on a literature review. This knowledge was combined with the knowledge and current direction of LM to determine the investigated scenarios. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology was applied to calculate the potential emissions and resulting environmental impacts. To calculate the impacts, the Ecoinvent 3.5 database was used in combination with the ReCiPe 2016 Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA) methodology. Analysis showed that Sub Critical Water (SubCW) hydrolysis likely is the waste management method with the lowest impact for the current used glass fibre - polyester design. However, two design changes can potentially lead to big reductions in total single score impact scores. These two are: designing for reuse of blade sections and interchanging thermoplastic resin for the currently used thermoset polyester resin. Both are beneficial because of the relatively direct reuse/recycling of material. This research can be extended to more resin types and waste management methods of these resin types. This will shed a broader light on the matter. When waste management methods reuse methods should be prioritized over recycling methods and ’clean’ recycling methods (i.e. methods that do not lean on heavily polluting processes) over dirty recycling methods.","Wind Energy; Materials; Composites; Life Cycle Assessment; Resin","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-09-04","","","","European Wind Energy Masters (EWEM) | Rotor Design Track","",""

(mentor); van Kranendonk, J (mentor); Ramirez, Andrea (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","Zero Emission Fuel (ZEF) has the goal to create affordable high-grade methanol, produced from absorbed carbon dioxide and water from the air. The methanol is produced in a solar methanol (MeOH) farm, consisting of 13225 micro-plants which are powered by PhotoVoltaicsolar panels (PV panels). The solar capacity of the solar MeOH farm is 12 MW and produces 7.8 tons of grade AA methanol per day (grade AA methanol has a purity of 99.8%). One of the main goals of ZEF is to produce methanol with a smaller environmental impact compared to the currently commonly used production methods. A part of the research focuses on an advice for the type of PV panels to use. The main goal of the research is to determine the environmental impact of methanol produced by the solar MeOH farm. The results lead to an advice for ZEF concerning reducing their environmental impact, also the research advises on further research.<br/>To determine the environmental impact a life cycle assessment (LCA) is performed according to ISO 14040 and ISO 14044 standards, using the ReCiPe 2016 method. The midpoint impact categories researched are the global warming potential (GWP), the mineral resource scarcity, and the fossil resource scarcity. The functional unit of the LCA is one ton methanol. A set of assumptions is made concerning the solar MeOH farm, which are tested in the sensitivity analyses. A second LCA is performed, which compares different PV technologies. This LCA focuses on the endpoint impact categories, and the goal of this LCA is to show which PV technologies have the least environmental impact. The PV technology with the smallest environmental impact, polycrystalline silicon PV panels, is used in the LCA concerning the solar MeOH farm. One ton of methanol produced by the solar MeOH farm has a GWP of -835 ± 50 (6.5%) kg CO<sub>2</sub> equivalent, proving that the methanol produced by ZEF absorbs CO2. When the end-use of methanol is included, approximately 40% of the methanol produced by ZEF should be used for the production of plastic and chemicals to produce zero-emission methanol. After 7.9 ± 0.8 years of production, the solar MeOH farm has reached the CO<sub>2</sub> break-even point. The mineral resource scarcity of one ton methanol produced by the solar MeOH farm is 10.7 ± 0.7 (6.3%) kg Cu equivalent, the fossil resource scarcity is 127 ± 13 (10%) kg oil equivalent, and the energy payback time (EPT) is 6.9 ± 0.7 years of methanol production. The most crucial factor that influences the environmental impact is the amount of equivalent sun hour (ESH), therefore, the solar MeOH farm should operate on a location with a high amount of ESH to decrease the environmental impact. A 1% decrease of micro-plant efficiency increases the environmental impact with more than 1%. The recommendation is to focus on lifetime and efficiency when designing new subsystems, since lifetime is a more important factor than the materials used.<br","CO2 absorbance; Methanol; Sustainable methaol; LCA; Life Cycle Assessment; ZEF; zero emissions methanol","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-09-04","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

Compassion impels us to treat others with fairness and respect, and bring us closer together. A place where the impact of compassion could be explored is the courtroom of criminal law. In the courtroom, we pay attention to the suffering of victims as a result of crimes, but the suspect suffers as well. His suffering prevents further crimes and provides retribution for the victim, but it stands in the way of his willingness to cooperate. Being treated with compassion would allow the suspect to find himself in a courtroom where he is encouraged to participate (Tyler &amp; Blader, 2003), and willing to take responsibility for his actions.Compassion is seen when people aid others that are suffering. Recognising that the sufferer’s needs are not met, and acting based on the understanding of the situation is what defines compassion. The act of alleviating someone’s need through compassion is patient, dignified, and without judgement. This knowledge allows for a strategy to design for compassionate interactions. A model is created that aids designers when designing compassionate interactions, which is used throughout the project.In the courtroom, suspects are judged and given punishment for violating the law. This is done by the judge, as retribution and to prevent further crimes. The public prosecutor as the suspect’s enemy and the lawyer as the suspect’s teammate argue on opposite sides to convince the judge of their story. If present, the disadvantaged party contributes to their statement about the consequences of a crime. While the courtroom is about the suspect, it is seen that he is submissive in his role, he is there to cooperate with the investigation. The current interactions with other courtroom actors, the room itself, and the values of the suspect during the procedure make the suspect suffer throughout the procedure.The suspect is suffering because he doesn’t feel he is acknowledged. Suspects should be given a chance to share their point of view in the courtroom and participate. A design vision is created to support this goal and define the interaction of the design intervention that proposes a compassionate interaction in the courtroom. The experience the concept evokes should be vulnerable, yet comforting, determined, and mediated. The created concept is a procedural change that allows the suspect to participate when he is not given a role. Requesting an opportunity through the press of a button to participate, increases the perceived acknowledgement of the suspect. Additionally, it makes the suspect feel like a courtroom participant who can gain information as well during the process. This increases his engagement throughout the hearing. This procedural change is evaluated, and recommendations are made for the intervention to be more impactful.","Design for Emotion; Compassion; Courtroom; Justice; Suspect; Acknowledgement; Suffering; Engagement; Experience design; Criminal Law","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

An important aspect of wind turbine generator control is the phase-locked loop (PLL), a method to synchronize the output current with the grid voltage. In the case of voltage distortion, an error occurs in the estimated phase-angle of the PLL, which results in an additional distortion in the output current. This research focuses on 5 different variants of PLLs and compares their behaviour when implemented in a grid-side inverter of a wind turbine. The comparison is based on deriving the equivalent small-signal output impedance of the inverter for each PLL, which can be used for stability analysis of the wind farm connected to the onshore grid by a typical cable connection. A conclusion is drawn on the effect of each PLL variant on the output distortion as well as the stability.","phase-locked loop; offshore wind power plants; Voltage Source Converter; harmonic distortion; small-signal; stability; equivalent impedance; grid-side inverter","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-09-01","","","","Electrical Engineering | Electrical Power Engineering","",""

Among the many urban surfaces that have been studied to be used to generate solar energy, roads are one of the most enticing but controversial as well. It is first of all crucial to understand if their energy potential will be sufficient to make solar road installations a reasonable investment to begin with. As rooftop irradiation maps start to become the hotspot in the branch of solar energy modelling, the same attention should be directed to solar roads. This research aims to develop a modelling methodology to easily and quickly estimate the potential of solar roads and provide the first irradiation and DC yield potential map of solar highways in the Netherlands. The map could serve as a useful tool for advisory of research, private industry and governmental projects that helps to individuate optimal sites for solar road installation in the Netherlands. The average irradiation along highways is found to be around 880 KWh/ m2/y, 35% less then the potential of an optimally tilted conventional PV installation in South Holland. The most irradiated highways result to be A31, A5 and A200, with an average irradiation between 980 and 1000 KWh/ m2/y. The analysis of the sky view factor along the highways, discloses that in most of the cases highways are in almost free horizon conditions. This makes them an appealing location for PV installations. The DC yield potential of solar highways is obtained assuming three different technologies: mono crystalline silicon, poly crystalline silicon and CIGS. The scenario of having the entire Dutch highways network renovated into solar roads is considered unrealistic. Therefore, a glueable solar road technology is assumed. Solar highways can generate on average a DC yield of 138 kWh/m2/y in the Netherlands if poly crystalline silicon is assumed. This value can increase up to 174 kWh/ m2/y if mono crystalline silicon technology is implemented. In total, covering the entire Dutch highways network with solar road modules could generate between 3.4 and 6.6 TWh/y of electricity. This could be used to power 36% of the national street lighting demand. In addition to that, a model is developed that aims to address another compelling question regarding solar road feasibility: what is the impact of traffic? Two case studies are conducted on two of the four busiest roads in the Netherlands, the A12 and A16, based on real traffic data. It is found that traffic accounts for an average of 3% reduction of solar road irradiation potential, with maximum reduction of 7% in particular locations, such as bridges and in the nearby of ramp roads. The value does not drastically impact on the output power but still needs to be taken into consideration when designing the PV system of a solar road.","Solar energy; Solar road; Highways; LiDAR; Traffic shading","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-08-29","","","","","",""

By subjecting these objectives to mechanical constraint penalties, the vicinity of reference continuous optimum could be explored more effectively to steer the discrete solutions towards feasible design regions.

However, this growing preference comes along with brands that use purpose as an opportunity for marketing purposes, creating skepticism in consumer’s mind about the authenticity of the brand. As a consquence, purpose-driven brands encounter an intention-behavior gap. Thus, there is a need for brand authenticity in brand development. This thesis draws links between purpose-driven, brand authenticity and brand development literature, of which a theoretical framework is developed and applied to a case study for Forestwise to build a beauty consumer brand. Forestwise is a Dutch social enterprise, located in Indonesia, offering harvested rainforest ingredients for the food, beauty and personal care industry (B2B market). The thesis resulted in designs for Forestwise that are a stepping stone for the new brand to inspire potential partners and use as a discussion tool to further develop the new brand. 1. Roadmap 2.

In this work we optimise the front surface field (FSF) and apply rear hydrogenation to the poly-Si IBC structure developed by the TU Delft PVMD group. An investigation is also made of a PECVD tunnel oxide as a replacement for NAOS oxide currently used. The PECVD method allows greater control of the layer thickness and stoichiometry, as well as the ability to grow and cap the oxide layer without breaking vacuum. This process also leads to the development of poly-SiOx passivating contacts, which exhibit lower parasitic absorption as compared with their poly-Si counterpart. The optimised PECVD oxide is implemented into FBC solar cells. In the optimisation of the FSF the best performance came from the a-Si:H/SiNx:H stack using thicknesses of 18 and 75 nm respectively. It achieved an iVoc of 731 mV and a J0 of 4 fAcm-2 on undoped textured samples. This was owing to the high hydrogen content of the materials, but had the disadvantage of parasitic absorption from the a-Si:H layer. The stack was tested against different FSF doping levels and with varying thickness to reduce the parasitic absorption. The best performance remained on the undoped (No FSF) case with 18 nm a-Si, achieving 731 mV and 13.5 fAcm-2. The selected a-Si thickness for implementation into IBCs was 9 nm. This was estimated to provide lower parasitic absorption whilst still achieving high passivation. A peak value of 722 mV was obtained for No FSF case. A study of rear hydrogenation options revealed the a-Si:H/SiNx:H layer provided the best results. The layer thicknesses were 6 and 75 nm respectively. This led to an overall passivation of 725 and 709 mV on poly-Si IBC BSF and emitter symmetrical samples. This was due to the high hydrogen content in the layers raising the passivation quality of the poly-Si passivating contacts on the c-Si interface. The implementation into IBCs was unsuccessful owing to shunting of emitter and BSF regions. The SiNx layer was too thin to withstand the post-metalisation annealing and both poly-Si regions were contacted. Peak values of 7.22% efficiency and 600 mV Voc were obtained. In the investigation of the PECVD tunnel oxide measurements different layer thicknesses were made. After a 3 minute reaction time of c-Si in N2O plasma a thickness of 1.22 nm was achieved. Growth saturated after 21 minutes at a thickness of 1.98 nm. Implementation in flat n-poly-SiOx passivating contacts showed that the oxide with 1.97 nm thickness, oxide 18, obtained the best result of 723 mV. On flat p-poly-SiOx passivating contacts the 1.85 nm oxide, oxide 12, achieved the best result of 668 mV. On textured n-poly-SiOx passivating contacts oxide 18 again performed best, with 710 mV. As the p-poly-SiOx was limiting, oxide 12 was selected for implementation into FBC cells. The implementation into FBC cells revealed that the oxide layer had a very high contact resistance value that limited performance. The best Voc of 517 mV came with an FF of 89%. A TLM measurement showed that for oxide 12 contact resistance was 3.71 kOhm-cm2. This was therefore restricting the flow of current within the cell.","IBC solar cell; FBC solar cell; PECVD tunnel oxide; poly-Si carrier selective contacts; poly-SiOx carrier selective contacts","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-09-02","","","","","",""

Y. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution); Technical University of Denmark (degree granting institution)","2019","The demand for better performing structural designs gives rise to the interest in topology optimization. An accurate geometry description is fundamental in the optimization process. The Cut Finite Element Method (CutFEM) can describe the object surface on a fixed grid with an immersed boundary. To this level set method, multiple techniques from the density method can be added. In this thesis project, the performance of 3D topology optimization using CutFEM is tested. A topology optimization model using CutFEM was developed. For the elements on the boundary (Cut Elements), a cut is made to split the element in a solid and fluid part. The Gauss points that represent each part are calculated in order to find the stiffness of the Cut Elements. The performance has been tested by performing finite element analysis with CutFEM. In order to perform topology optimization, the sensitivities are calculated with the adjoint method, a filter was used with Heaviside projection and mapping, and the Method of Moving Asymptotes (MMA) is used in order to find the design of the next iteration. In order to increase the length scale, an optional robust design method was implemented which creates an eroded and dilated design. The performance of topology optimization using CutFEM was tested by optimizing a structure for minimum compliance for a set of loading conditions. This was compared to topology optimization with classical Solid Isotropic Material with Penalization (SIMP) method. Firstly, it was found that Cut Elements are an accurate method to perform a finite element analysis. Next, it was found that topology optimization using CutFEM is able to obtain a better objective function than topology optimization using the SIMP method. The computational costs of the CutFEM method are substancially higher. In 3D topology optimization using CutFEM, the design changes can happen everywhere on the boundary, so that the initial structural design is of less importance than for 2D. Next, it was found that the robust design method works well in increasing the length scale, but the objective function is decreased and the initial design is more important. It is thought that CutFEM could best be used to perform optimization with the initial design computed by the SIMP method. Finally, the CutFEM method has been used in a Navier Stokes fluid solver with Brinkman penalization implementation. It was found that this does not work, and a fluid solver with a hard boundary method is required. It is recommended to implement the CutFEM method in a fluid solver with Nitsches method.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","European Wind Energy Masters (EWEM) | Rotor Design Track","",""

(graduation committee); Wendt, E.A.F (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","The static stability of stones on mild slopes under wave attack is investigated by this research. First it was checked whether there are any numerical models that could be used to describe the stability of mild slopes. As such, there is no existing model at this moment that can accurately model the stability of mild slopes. To model this correctly, the model has to be able to model plunging and spilling waves, include bed sediment transport and to model the velocity and acceleration due to a breaking wave over multiple layers in depth. The existing models do comply mostly with one of these specifications. To get accurate results, the stability should be modelled with all of the specifications and not one model complied with this. Therefore, it was decided to investigate the stability of stones on mild slopes under wave attack with physical modelling tests at the research institute Deltares. The physical tests were executed with a constant slope angle of tan α = 1:10 and a constant nominal median stone diameter. The wave steepness (that determines the type of breaking for a constant slope angle), the significant wave height, the number of waves and the layer thickness are varied in between the tests to determine the influences of each parameter on the stability. Of each test an erosion profile is made by photogrammetry from which the profile-related damage parameters can be determined. In the bed strips with coloured stones are laid down to follow the transport of the stones. According to these erosion profiles three damage parameters were determined. The damage level, S, as used by Van der Meer (1988), the erosion depth, de, and the damage depth, E3. The damage depth, E3, is used to describe the damage for mild slopes. The range of the damage depth for start of damage to failure is from 0.5 to 2.3. These values are only applicable for a layer thickness of 2.5dn50 and a slope angle of tan α = 1:10. The development of the damage depth is investigated for multiple parameters. The breaker type gives a change in development of the damage depth. For a wave condition with plunging breakers the damage depth development is higher per increasing wave height than for a wave condition that includes both plunging and spilling breakers. For the transition zone from plunging to spilling breakers the damage depth increase is very small if the wave height increases. The damage depth is influenced by the number of waves, because after about 11,000 waves the development of the damage depth is still linearly increasing with the number of waves. The damage depth was not stabilized towards a maximum value after this number of waves. It can be concluded that the transport of the stones is mainly all below the still water level. This also followed from the damage zones. These indicated that the total area of the damage is in between the -2Hs and SWL. The maximum area location is around -0.8Hs w.r.t. the SWL. The transport is mostly upslope, which is attributed to the mechanism whereby wave forces are strong in upslope direction. The location where the most stones are picked up depend on the breaker type, the wave height and the layer thickness. Plunging breakers cause damage more downslope than spilling breakers. Plunging breakers cause more local damage and have a much smaller runup than the spilling breakers. Per increasing wave height, the location of damage is shifted more downslope due to the increase in breaker depth.","Stability; Van der Meer; Damage depth; Spilling; Plunging","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-08-28","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","",""

We aim to explore the nature of the connection between speech and body movements. More specifically, we stress on the person-specificity of speech. Many studies have shown that speech always comes along with unconscious body behaviours. There is a strong correlation and synchrony between speech and body movements. Previous research has proved that human behaviour is highly person-specific. In other words, in our experiment set- up, the accelerometer data distributions collected from different persons are different. Based on the two considerations discussed above, our work contains two phases. In the first phase, we investigate utilizing convolutional and recurrent neural networks for learning informative representations from raw body acceleration readings. The model we proposed outperforms the state-of-the-art approach presented in [5] by 6 % (Area Under the Curve) with the same data. In the next stage, we visualize the features extracted by the proposed model. The results show that distributions of data obtained from different individuals can differ (also known as person-specificity of the problem). We adopt two approaches of multi-source domain adaption [6] based on the features extracted by our model, aiming to form a personalized speech detection model for each person in our dataset. The first approach is called transductive parameter transfer (TPT) [5]. It deduces the personalized model of the target domain from the known well-trained models of several source domains based on the assumption that distributions of individuals with similar marginal distributions should also have similar decision boundaries. The second strategy is a sample re-weighting based method where the training samples from different persons are re-weighted with respect to the similarities of their conditional and marginal distributions to the target person. We use those re-weighted samples to train a personalized model for each target person. The approaches we adopted only achieved a relative performance increase compared to the general neural network model trained on all the data. We then discuss the possible reasons why these two methods did not bring significant improvement and what can be the alternative solution in the future.","Speech Detection; Neural Network; Multi-source Domain Adaption","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
