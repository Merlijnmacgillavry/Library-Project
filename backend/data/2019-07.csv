The high efficiency of fuel cells could help to decrease emissions in marine power generation. Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) are the most fuel flexible among fuel cells, the high operating temperature and the possibilities for direct internal reforming (DIR)makes this technology of great interest for natural gas fueled systems. SOFCs operating in hybrid system configuration could even achieve higher efficiencies, due to effective utilization of left-over fuel in anode off-gas and adequate system heat integration. In literature extensive research is found about hybridization of SOFCs and gas turbines. For such hybrid configurations high efficiencies are projected, however poor part load performance and high system complexity are tempering the interest for marine applications. SOFC integration with an internal combustion engine (ICE) also has high projected efficiencies and is expected to enable system integration in marine applications with limited complexity, higher robustness, and lower costs compared to SOFC-gas turbine integration. However, due to the novelty of SOFC-ICE hybrid systems, not much research has been published as of yet and the research that is found shows a variety in system configurations and performance results. This observation justifies additional SOFC-ICE hybrid system research, particularly if the system has to operate on marine applications. In this work an integration of an SOFC and ICE is proposed. Both SOFC and ICE share the load on the system: the SOFC can operate on a base load, while the ICE can handle majority of the transient load. A pre-reformer is proposed, which supplies partially reformed methane to the SOFC. The ICE is supplied with natural gas mixed with excess fuel from the SOFC-anode. This additional natural gas supply to the engine makes it a combined cycle, instead of a bottoming cycle, and allows better dynamic load control and increases reliability. Also system heat integration is an essential requirement, as the steam required for methane pre-reforming is produced with heat from engine exhaust system. System component models are developed and individually analysed. Thereafter both component models are combined to an SOFC-ICE hybrid system model and a study is conducted to investigate the sensitivity of the following operating parameters and system configurations on system performance and efficiency: SOFC current density, SOFC fuel utilization, anode off-gas recycling, methane pre-reforming ratio, pre-reformer integration, and power split ratio. The SOFC component model provides insights of performance behaviour when varying operating parameters. The ICE model clearly indicates the advantages when hydrogen is added to natural gas, both improved engine efficiency and improved combustion stability are demonstrated. Finally, it is found that operating the hybrid system model consisting of a 375 kWe (AC) SOFC and a 375 kWe ICE leads to an electric efficiency of 45.7 % (LHV). This is a 5 to 10 percent point improvement compared to conventional diesel engines operating in this power range [1]. In this hybrid system the SOFC current density is set to 5000 Am¡2, anode off-gas recycling is not applied, and 30 % of the SOFC fuel is pre-reformed. The SOFC fuel utilization is set to 86 % in order to avoid too large hydrogen-natural gas blending ratios at the ICE intake, which are currently not substantiated with engine experiments. Future modeling of the ICE should make it possible to extend the hydrogen-natural gas blending ratio, such that even higher hybrid system efficiencies can be demonstrated. This work demonstrates that the SOFC-ICE hybrid system operating at a 50 % SOFC and 50 % ICE power split provides a firmefficiency improvement compared to conventional diesel driven power plants in the range upto 1MW. An higher efficiency means a lower fuel consumption and thus a CO2-emissions reduction. Also NOx-formation is reduced, due to the absence of expansive high temperature combustion in the fuel cell part of the system. Considering volumetric power density, the SOFC-ICE hybrid system installation volume is more than twice as large as conventional marine power plants. Taking the energy conversion efficiency into account, the LNG storage space for proposed hybrid system is two times larger than that of a diesel fueled generator set. A 50 % SOFC and 50 % ICE power split leads to these numbers, depending on the operating profile a different power split can lead to other efficiencies and volume and weight constraints. The impact of power density and energy density depend on the practical application (e.g. ship design, required power, endurance, operating profile, and costs) and must be considered case-by-case.","SOFC; ICE; Hybrid system; Internal combustion engine; Marine power plant","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

There are for example criteria for motions, noise and vibrations. The criteria for motions are nowadays often defined as comfort limits on the accelerations in the ship motions. However, from other industries it followed that the rate of change of the accelerations, the jerk, can also have an influence on the sense of comfort of passengers and crew. The goal of this thesis is to investigate whether it would be useful to add jerk criteria to the comfort assessment of ships. Jerk cannot be measured directly (yet), so it has to be obtained from acceleration measurements or calculations. For this goal filter and processing procedures are defined. To be able to make comparisons different ways of quantifying the jerk are established. One is aimed at peak values, since these are often determining the limit for comfort and operability. The other is focused on quantifying the non-linearity of the response. Research is performed on what the physics behind jerk are, and what phenomena are likely to cause large jerk values. The prime cause is found in slamming. The jerk following from slamming is influenced mostly by the shape of the bow and the speed of immersion in the water. Using the measurement data of two different hulls from other research the effect of varying conditions on the jerk is investigated. From this research it follows that there can be a difference in seakeeping behaviour when looking at jerk instead of accelerations. Since jerk is the third derivative of displacement to time, the non-linearity in this response is relatively high. Therefore non-linear codes are required to calculate the jerk response correctly. The use of a Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) code proves to be able to predict the jerk behaviour correctly. In this thesis only model test measurements and calculations are used. The scaling of jerk to full scale, and difficulties that it might impose, are only discussed theoretically. The general conclusion is that jerk is worth investigating to compare the seakeeping behaviour of ships. Until quantitative limits are available only qualitative comparisons are possible, but these can already give additional insight.","Ship motion; Jerk; Seakeeping; Ship comfort; Ship response; Non-linearity; Hydromechanics; Slamming","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Marine Technology | Hydromechanics","",""

This comparison is made based on the steady-state power output when the harvester is excited at its eigenfrequencies.

Three configurations of the coupled oscillator harvester concept are presented, which have been optimized with respect to the magnitude of the electromagnetic damping and the ratio between the two masses. <br/>It was found that a coupled harvester with two electromagnetic dampers performs as good as an array of two single degree of freedom harvesters. When using the same proof mass for all concepts, a coupled oscillator harvester with only one electromagnetic damper generates less power than one with two dampers. <br/>A prototype has been built to validate the simulations.

The grouping of faces based on their identity is an important aspect as it provides an overview of the person in question and their connection with scenes, objects and other people. In this work, we propose a fuzzy approach to the hard partitioning problem of face clustering for the specific field of forensic investigations. We constructed a pipeline consisting of deep models for face detection and feature extraction, a method for transforming the resulting feature vectors to a graph representation and a<br/>graph-based clustering algorithm for the final partitioning. Focusing on the clustering step, we propose to assign face images to identity clusters using confidence values (rather than a hard cutoff) based on the average similarity with images present in the cluster relative to other clusters. Compared to existing methods, the approach is not only fuzzy but also embraces na¨ıve linking, and instead of transitively merging the links it uses a graph-based algorithm to produce the clusters. Furthermore, we propose an adapted version of the MaxMax algorithm because the original method only returned fuzzy results if weights were exactly equal. However, similarities between images are continuous, making it unsuitable for the case of face clustering. Evaluation of the performance on the Labeled Face in the Wild (LFW) dataset and the challenging IARPA JANUS Benchmark B (IJB-B) shows promising results comparable with state-ofthe-art face clustering algorithms.","Face Clustering; Deep Learning; Fuzzy Clustering","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To establish a connection between the cytoplasm and nucleoplasm, tiny pores named Nuclear Pore Complexes (NPCs) span through such membrane. The biological function of the NPC consists in regulating the bidirectional transportation of small molecules, like ions and transcriptional proteins, between the two compartments by imparting a selective barrier. FG-Nups are key proteins in this process, as they line the inner channel of the NPC and are responsible for the selective behaviour. Despite many models have attempted to explain the mechanism behind selectivity and substantially agree on the importance of FG-Nups in the context of nuclear transport, the exact details about how FG-Nups arrange within the NPC lumen and interact with translocating cargoes are still debated. In the current project, we illustrate an in-vitro approach to study the behaviour of purified FG- Nups, that takes advantage of DNA-origami nanotechnology. We show that it is possible to recreate a minimalistic version of the NPC by using an octagonally shaped DNA-origami as a scaffold while keeping low concentrations of magnesium in solution (&lt; 1mM). The NPC mimic was built by coupling FG-Nups to specified locations along the inner wall of the origami. We characterized the DNA-origami structure, under different buffer conditions, before and after functionalization, by means of negative staining transmission electron microscopy and liquid atomic force microscopy. A volumetric comparison between the bare and FG Nup-coated DNA-origami provide quantitative confirmation of the success of the protein administration. We show that the incubation of a 10 times excess of proteins per binding site on the DNA-origami successfully couples the complexes together.

Attraction is one type of interest that can occur between interacting people and understanding the modeling of it can help understand how to model other types of interests in human-human interactions because similar methods can be used to model the non-verbal behavior that reveals interest. Previous research in psychology and social signal processing fields showed that synchrony and convergence of both audio features and body movements of people during an interaction are indicators of interest. However, audio features require recording people's voices during interactions and it can be disturbing for people especially during more personal conversations. In addition, capturing nonverbal cues from video mostly requires recording people with a camera from front and it might make people more aware of being recorded and intervene with the naturality of the interaction. Moreover, processing the videos to extract specific nonverbal behavior can be costly. Based on these ideas, we decided to use motion channel and hypothesize that movement synchrony and convergence features can be used to automatically quantify and predict attraction. We propose a novel method of estimating romantic, social and sexual attraction between two people by quantifying their bodily coordination using wearable sensors in a speed-date setting. We developed simple synchrony and convergence features, inspired from the literature and specifically adapted to be extracted from accelerometer data. To our knowledge, this is the first time that motion convergence is used for estimating attraction. Our features could predict one-way social attraction with a 73% Area under the ROC curve (AUC), out-performing previous work in a similar setting. We also showed that prediction performance increased when the male and female data are separated, aligning with the theories in psychology studies. We could also predict mutual romantic attraction with an AUC of 80%. We found that different types of attraction can be estimated better using different feature types, more specifically we could predict social attraction better using movement correlation features whereas for romantic and sexual interest mimicry features were better indicators. Moreover, features extracted from different types of signals recorded from accelerometers showed varying performances for different attraction types. Additionally, asymmetric features out-performed the symmetric features and our synchrony features showed better performance than convergence features. Finally, we a<br/>have seen that motion convergence can occur in people having an interaction regardless of attraction.","attraction; synchrony; convergence; wearable acceleration; dyadic interactions","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-07-30","","","","Computer Science","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","Additive manufacturing (AM) or Rapid prototyping, more commonly known as 3-D printing, has been termed as one of the most disruptive technologies in the recent years as it offers a paradigm shift in the engineering design and manufacturing due to its ability to build parts with complex geometries, free usage of tool and functional part optimization. However, the process is characterized by complex thermal cycles with fast solidification rates that leads to residual stresses, process induced defects and an inhomogeneous microstructure. Therefore, there is a need to fully understand and optimize the process parameters during AM manufacturing as well as developing favorable post processing treatments in order to completely explore the advantages offered by AM and continuous research is being undertaken in that direction. The current study aims to understand the high temperature mechanical behavior of functionally graded Inconel 718 produced by Selective Laser Melting (SLM). Two different laser sources of 950 W and 250 W power were used to build cylindrical specimens having a columnar coarse-grained core and a fine equiaxed-grained shell. Additionally, cylindrical specimens were manufactured with only 250 W and 950 W laser source and the comparison was made with the developed functionally graded material (FGM). The post processing variants included combinations of solution treatment, double ageing and hot isostatic pressing (HIP). The dominant mechanism at the stress and temperature range used in this study (800-1000 MPa/630 °C) was identified to be dislocation power-law creep and the effects of size and volume fraction of γʺ, the principal strengthening phase, on the creep rate were explained. It was observed that the material built with 250 W laser source and a post process treatment comprising of solution treatment (980 °C/1h) and double ageing treatment at (720°C/8h/620°C/8h) resulted in the lowest creep rate and was found to be comparable to the reference wrought material. Furthermore, the effect of orientation relative to the build direction after the post processing treatment was found to be insignificant on the creep rate and was further confirmed by the residual stress analysis in the as-processed and post-processed condition. The creep strength of FGM was found to lie in between the material built only with 250 W and 950 W laser source, confirming the expected composite-like behavior of the produced FGMs.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

However, the AMA’s spatial structure and social geography have come under increased pressure. Unprecedented population growth as well as economic activity is concentrated within the AMA’s epicentre, and dichotomies in the social fabric are becoming more evident. Simultaneously, the region’s natural landscape is under threat due to fragmentation of green space, and an increase of the built-up environment, especially in Amsterdam. In order to relieve pressure from the AMA’s epicentre while preserving the original landscape, flows of working and living environments need to be redistributed, and new ways of arranging the local economy and the built environment need to be uncovered. To achieve this, this report suggests a more polycentric structure for the AMA, while also drawing upon the knowledge economy as an economic system that is more inclusive and may facilitate the dispersion of population and economic pressure on the region’s epicentre. In order to accommodate the AMA’s growing population, this report suggests the implementation of the ‘built environment as a service’, a more circular approach of utilizing (existing) space. Additionally, an in-depth analysis of Almere is presented in which location-specific strategies are articulated to make the region more economically competitive, resource-efficient, and liveable.","Polycentricity; Knowledge economy; Liveability; Built environment; Circular Economy; Spatial Justice","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Urbanism","AR2U086 R&D Studio – Spatial Strategies for the Global Metropolis","52.3667, 4.8945"

This analysis is performed by means of sources found in literature and by comparing two case studies: Bucaramanga and Amsterdam. Bucaramanga is chosen due to its current solid waste challenge as a result of the problems caused by the local sanitary landfilling site. Amsterdam, on the other hand, is taken as a best practice. From the analysis of Amsterdam lessons are derived that are considered valuable for other urban areas aiming for a higher level of circularity. Additionally, a framework is provided to assess and quantify the circularity of an urban system. By means of the selected circularity indicators in this framework, the level of circularity of the two case studies could be quantified and compared. It is argued that this framework provides a valuable first assessment of circularity and is suitable for both data-rich and data-poor urban areas. It is concluded that the current urban metabolism in terms of municipal solid waste management of Bucaramanga is highly linear. Furthermore, the objectives and activities as currently formulated by the municipal government of Bucaramanga are considered to be too general to tackle this challenge effectively. Lessons obtained from Amsterdam and derived from the performed scenario analysis and governance research are provided and are argued to be valuable to Bucaramanga in constructing a governance strategy towards circularity. Generally, this research provides a number of tools and recommendations that can be used for the analysis and enhancement of circularity in MSW management. By doing this is it contributes to reducing the risk on environmental and public harm as a result of inadequate MSW management. Additionally, the opportunities and limitations of transitions towards a circular economy are explored, providing lessons that can be used by urban systems interested in this transition.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Metropolitan Analysis, Design and Engineering (MADE)","",""

Due to their location and design, causeways are exposed to storm waves generated in the North Sea. During coastal storms, some waves are able to overtop the barriers, damaging cars and potentially washing vehicles off the barrier. Due to overtopping risk, the barriers are closed to vehicles around five times per year, with the number of closures increasing. Closures are manually operated by policeman who are sent to barrier. Their responsibility is watching overtopping situation and close the barrier when they it is too dangerous to drive across. This Master Thesis aims to provide insight in the optimal strategy of reducing wave overtopping volumes and frequency of closure of Churchill Barrier No.2, by investigating overtopping volumes of plain and recurved wave walls for various closure frequencies, and exploring tolerable wave overtopping volumes in line with local condition. Because barrier locate in relatively uninhabited area, design closure frequencies are between 0.2 to 5 times per year, which is much higher than normal design. In order to simulate wave overtopping, boundary conditions are required. Since wave conditions at barrier toe are of complete lack, extreme offshore waves are transformed to barrier toe by Numerical Model SWASH. The results of SWASH are used as input of statistic model that can generate wave condition and water level at barrier toe for each design return period. Afterwards, wave overtopping volumes are simulated as a function of no wave wall, present wave wall, plain vertical wave wall with various height, and recurved wave wall with bullnose with various height and bullnose angle. The simulation uses most up-to-date and suitable empirical equations obtained from academic research. Wave volume of present wave is used for evaluating policeman's estimation on closure. It shows that policeman did a good job in estimation. However overtopping splash is a very dynamic process, the evaluation is subjected to many limitations. Wave volumes of plain vertical wave wall and recurved wave wall are used for wave wall design. Various sensitivity analysis is carried out the find the optimal wall height and bullnose shape. It is proved that recurved wall is more effective in wave overtopping reduction than plain wave wall. Afterwards, cost-benefit analysis (CBA) is undertaken to explore the most economical wall design and its return period. CBA concludes that optimal design is recurved wave wall of three years return period. Wave wall is 1.7m high with 70 degree bullnose angle. With this wall, barrier need to be closed only once in every three years. In the end, some recommendations are given to general approach and method to collect raw data and accumulate engineering experience of local overtopping situation, which will contribute to an automatic road gate system in the further.","overtopping; wave wall; flood risk; Hydraulic structures","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-07-29","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","",""

These processes can be devastating for local ecosystems and lead to dissolved oxygen depletion, which applies considerable stress on aquatic organisms. For ecosystems to preserve their status, stop and reverse the negative effects of eutrophication, regular estimation of corresponding indicators has to take place. In this direction, mostly process-driven models have been used, but the presented project argues that freely available remote sensing data can also provide useful insights for the oxygen saturation of the water. The proposed methodology uses Sea Surface Temperature and Chlorophyll-a estimations from AQUA and ENVISAT satellite sensors for the period 2003-2011 to predict the dissolved oxygen content in the Dutch coastal waters. It does so by implementing various Machine Learning models, namely Random Forest, Artificial Neural Network and Gradient Boosting Regressors, with the latter demonstrating the best results. After extensive data pre-processing, the results show that dissolved oxygen can be predicted with an average Root-Mean-Squared error of 0.8 g/m3. Important steps towards a lower error include the use of gap-filled variables and their decomposition into their temporal components as inputs for the model. Furthermore, the effect of the Sea Surface Temperature on the dissolved oxygen is documented through its contribution in the estimation of the latter’s seasonal variability, while the estimation of the maximum dissolved oxygen values is attributed to Chlorophyll-a. Further feature engineering and model development can possibly improve the estimation of the minimum dissolved oxygen values in the coast and the overall prediction in more complex intertidal areas, like the Wadden Sea.","Remote Sensing; Eutrophication; Water Quality; Machine Learning; MERIS; MODIS","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement","52.29767, 4.217074"

Reliability analysis in literature rarely considers the existence of a relation between explanatory variables and component reliability, and includes strict assumptions on independence of events and underlying distributions. This disregards the complex nature of aircraft operations, where the probability of an event may be influenced by various operational and maintenance factors. This research develops new insights from operational and maintenance data about the impact of operating environment and ageing of components and fleet on reliability of the components by incorporating these factors in an extension of the Cox regression model. The research was performed in cooperation with KLM Engineering &amp; Maintenance, a Dutch MRO company. Examination of results obtained from analysing historical data of a set of three components with respect to installations and removals indicate that the natural environment at the hub airport, maintenance history of components, the age of the aircraft on which the component is installed and different modification designs are useful significant predictors of the time-on-wing duration of the component.","Survival analysis; Proportional hazard model; Predictive Maintenance","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-07-29","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Since then, the experience a consumer has when interacting with a brand (Brand Experience) has been a frequently discussed topic in research and practise. Different disciplines propose measurement scales to capture this brand experience (BE). However literature does not agree on one generally accepted method. The marketing practise extensively utilises simple evaluative surveys such as the NetPromotorScore (NPS) and CustomerSatisfaction (CSat) to evaluate the BE of a consumer. As the world is becoming more and more digital oriented, consumers leave digital behavioural traces. This brings new measurement possibilities. Accordingly, this thesis proposes a data- driven method for measuring BE. The method is manifested through the design of a digital tool. This resulted in the MerkMonitor, a digital dashboard which analyses the experiences consumers have when interacting with a brand. Originating back to psychology, literature identifies that this brand experience consists of Sensorial, Affective, Cognitive and Behavioural responses. Literature shows a call for new types of measurement to capture these dimensions. The design process proposes a set of variables (measurements) to give insight in the four dimensions. Each dimension is made up of three attributes, which can be measured either with observant variables or surveying variables. Measurements are mostly done at digital touch points, such as social media, the website of the brand or through surveys via for example e-mails. As different attributes are valuable for different clients of GP, a selection toolkit is made. When a selection of fitting variables is decided upon, they form the metrics of the dashboard together. The thesis proposes a dashboard containing ten variables as starting point. When the dashboard is implemented and used right, both GP and the client will be able to analyse the BE and anticipate on this analysis. The launch of the dashboard will make GP able to monitor BE through real-time measurement. This contributes to GP being an expert in BE. Finally, the Merk Monitor was evaluated through six sessions with Strategists, Technology experts and clients. Also a MVP was developed and a prototype was explored to ensure feasibility. This led to recommendations for futher developping and implementations of the product.","Brand; Experience; Measurement; Data-driven; Dashboard","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

It is said that 3D printing can greatly increase accessibility to medical equipment in low resource settings because it enables local production and radically reduces costs. Within the Delft Global Initiative there are several research teams experimenting with the use of 3D printing for local production of low cost medical equipment in Sub-Saharan Africa. They quickly discovered that 3D printing in this setting is not as easy as it might sound. For one, the operating conditions were found to be much harsher in African, than in Western settings. According to researchers from Penn State University, current 3D printers lack in user-friendliness and robustness required to impact rural healthcare. Therefore, the goal of this project was to (1) identify the challenges for 3D printing in Sub-Saharan Africa, and (2) develop a final design proposal for a 3D printer for healthcare in this setting. The project started with an extensive analysis phase, where Kenya was chosen as a case study of a Sub-Saharan African country. The goal of this phase was to get a deep and qualitative understanding of the context of Kenya, and identify important implications for the design.

Solutions were developed to make the printer (1) able to operate on an unstable grid, (2) able to deal with excessive dust and high temperatures, (3) maintain a maximum printing uptime, (4) allow the printer to be used by anyone and finally (5) to allow the printer to be compactly transported. The first deliverable is a list of valuable insights that provides a deep and qualitative understanding in the context of Kenya in relation to 3D printing. This can primarily be used for the development of a 3D printer for low resource settings, but might also be valuable for initiatives working on closely related products in a similar setting. The second deliverable, in the form of a final design proposal, consists of a Prusa i3 printer adapted to fit the context of Kenya. It features a flexible power supply with backup battery, protection against dust and high temperatures, an automatic part ejection system, easy use through smartphone and lastly it is can be compactly transported and quickly assembled. The design proposal was evaluated by a panel of experts from Kenya and the US. They rated the final design to fit the intended user and context very well, but also stressed that it could be tailored more to the healthcare sector. The proposal was considered a better solution than what is currently on the market. More work should be done in the field of usability.","3D printer; healthcare; Sub-Saharan Africa","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

Of the waste generated in households in Lagos, plastic makes up a large percent of the non-organic waste found in dwellings. Waste from residences often end up pooling by the street side, and recycling is slow in gaining traction within the city. In addition, tropical cities like Lagos use HVAC systems to deal with high temperatures; this gives rise to high energy consumption in dwellings and offices alike. This is noteworthy because high energy consumption usually translates to energy expenses and in this city, with a population of 22 million, about 8.5% live in poverty with the middle-income earners toeing the line. Although a passive strategy like the use of thermal mass in buildings could improve energy efficiency, it is deemed more effective in regions with a significant difference in diurnal temperatures (&gt;10°C). In Lagos state, however, there is no such significant range in temperatures. This served as the motivation for the inclusion of another strategy to support what is already existing – thermal insulation. This study explored the impact of thermal insulation made from plastic waste on energy savings and energy costs with the aid of DesignBuilder used to model dwellings with the climatic conditions of Lagos state. The focus of this study was on middle-class citizens in Lagos State and a survey was conducted using an online tool called Survicate, to assess their perception of the use of plastic waste on their facade. From the data, it was deduced that there is a possibility that people are willing to use plastic waste as thermal insulation when they are aware of the reduction of energy costs. For this study, five variations of thermal insulation were constructed, and experiments were carried out with the use of a hotbox to determine the thermal conductivity of these samples. The first sample was made from PET bottles with its cavity filled with textile waste; the second sample, a mould created from melted PET plastic that had been cut into tiny bits; the third variant was constructed from PET bottles with its cavity filled with water sachets (LDPE); the fourth sample, was built from crushed PET bottles and water sachets; and the last sample was made from empty PET bottles stacked on top of one another. The test sample with the least capability produced an expense reduction of N774.36/m2.year (€1.94/m2.year), while the best performing had a cost reduction of N1100.57/m2.year (€2.75/m2.year). Regardless of which insulation sample is applied, there would be savings in energy consumption, the cooling load demand of RAC (residential air-conditioning) systems would also decline, and there would be monetary savings as well. Resulting from the study’s outcome, it was recommended that a physical model be built in Lagos State to be studied further to see how well the materials perform under the actual climatic conditions in Lagos.","recycling; sustainabilty; waste; insulation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

There are four process modifications initiated over time: first, a shift from garnet sand to calcite pellets as seeding materials for pellet softening process. Second, the elimination of acid dosing in the pretreatment plant at Loenderveen (LVN). Third, a set point adjustment in total hardness level to 1.4 mmol/L from 1.5 mmol/L. Finally, a switch from the acid (HCl) dosing to CO2 dosing for conditioning of softened water for further treatment process. The existing pellet softening models with linear calcium carbonate crystallization kinetic (Rietveld, 2005, van Schagen et al., 2008a) describing calcium and pH profile over the height of the bed and the supersaturated calcium concentration after bypass mixed water, are not capable to cope with these process modifications. Therefore, an improved prediction model for softening process and a set of optimal operational configurations is needed. Recent researches (Chiou, 2018, Seepma, 2018) showed the first improvement path by using a prediction model based on bi-linear kinetics and hydraulics (Hout, 2016, Kramer, 2016). Hence, in this research a model is developed on the basis of new knowledge on kinetics on 4 regions depending on saturation ratio and hydraulics in the reactor and proposed optimal operational configurations. The proposed new prediction model is based on experimental data from Continuous Stirred Batch Reactor (CSTR) and Plug Flow Reactor (PFR). The chemical model is described in 4 regions depending on the level of supersaturation. The kinetic rate constants for calcium carbonate crystallization on seeding material for these 4 regions are taken from CSTR and PFR experiments. The model is calibrated and validated based on previous experimental data from WPK and full-scale treatment plant (Schooten, 1985, Seepma, 2018, Schetters, 2013). Finally, the calibrated and validated results from studied model were compared with model outcomes proposed by Rietveld., 2005. Calcium Carbonate Crystallization Potential (CCCP) is the amount of supersaturated calcium in the effluent and determines the efficiency of the entire pellet softening process. A scenario analysis is performed for summer and winter based on bypass, linear velocity and fluidized bed height, aiming for the lowest CCCP, high reliability, minimum cost and sustainability. CCCP determines the amount of chemicals used and principal cost of pellet softening process. The high reliability of the process comes from the full-scale plant operations over 30 years. The cost minimizations takes into account the chemical cost of NaOH and CO2 (dosing chemical). Ultimately, an optimal operational configuration will lead to a sustainable operational approach for pellet softening by using as little chemicals as possible. The outcomes from the scenario analysis provided an operational window of 15-25% bypass and linear flow velocity of 69-85 m/h for pellet reactors depending on temperature (0-24°C). This choice of optimal configuration comes with a cost reduction between 3-4% both in winter and summer. Previous optimum configurations suggested a bypass of 50% with linear velocity of 60-70 m/h (Rietveld, 2005) and a cost reduction of 10%. This reduction of cost is less pronounced because of process modifications, improved prediction model with 4 regional kinetics and the set of operational windows. Therefore, the process modifications induced a different set of operational criteria for optimum outcome in the pellet softening process at WPK.","Chemical Modeling; Pellet softening process; Calcium Carbonate Crystallization; Fluid bed pellet softening reactor; Kinetics; Drinking water","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Water Management","",""

Moreover, by cost reduction, they become more attractive for utilization in developing countries, where the research of new biomedical technologies has been restricted due to a decentralized healthcare system, lack of infrastructure and shortage of investment. This research focuses on developing a low-cost, disposable and easy to use mass sensor utilizing diamagnetic levitation. Diamagnetic levitation is the only stable form of levitation at room temperature and does not require external sources of energy, feedback loops or cooling for stable levitation. It is a low cost, easy to use, disposable sensor that makes it suitable for potential point-of-care applications. The sensor consists of a pyrolytic graphite plate that levitates above a checkerboard arrangement of permanent magnets with alternating magnetization. The system is actuated using electromagnetic excitation and the material properties of the sample are extracted by conducting a multi-modal analysis of the resonance frequencies and mode shapes; measured using a laser Doppler vibrometer (LDV). An opto-electronic phase lock loop utilizing the LDV is used to bring the levitating pyrolytic graphite into sustained mechanical oscillation controlled by a PID controller. The experimental mass sensitivity is measured by analysing the frequency shift associated with the placement of glass beads. The frequency stability is measured by computing the Allan deviation and the experimental precision of mass sensor is then computed. The results show that the precision of a diamagnetically levitated resonant mass sensors decreases with the decrease of the size of the levitating oscillator. The precision of a levitating oscillator of side length 2mm and thickness 0.08mm is found to be 14.4pg at a gate time of 0.1s for an instantaneous change in frequency.","Diamagnetic Levitation; Mass Sensor; Resonance","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-07-26","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Dynamics of Micro and Nano Systems","",""

Offshore wind turbine installation has been situated mainly in the North Sea, which is not very seismically active. As a consequence, wind turbine installation jack-ups have been designed and analysed for low seismic excitations. The offshore wind industry is expanding to East Asia, where it finds itself in seismically active regions where seismic excitations are significantly higher. Therefore, operators are requesting GustoMSC to supply input for risk analyses of their jack-ups and its crane. GustoMSC requires a tool to conduct ultimate limit state analyses of a jack-up and its crane under seismic conditions. This tool has been created and applied in this work. <br/><br/>The main challenge of this thesis is related to the estimation of the probability of exceedance of a predefined structural limit of a crane on a jack-up given a set of seismic ground motions. To tackle this challenge, suitable models of the jack-up and crane substructure are developed and verified. With use of a data package, containing two months worth of wind turbine installation data, a Monte Carlo analysis is conducted to determine the probability of exceedance of the structural limit in a 50-year period.<br/><br/>When constructing the jack-up model, the mass and stiffness distribution of the jack-up is important for an accurate response, a slight eccentricity in the mass of the jack-up leads to a very different response.

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","The Earth is subjected to 100,000 year cycles of glaciation and deglaciation. The deformations induced by glacial and oceanic loading and the continuous attempt at recovery of the isostatic equilibrium within the solid Earth, are referred to as Glacial Isostatic Adjustment (GIA). This process is ongoing still and yields a large contribution to present day surface deformation and sea level change in formerly glaciated areas. In order to accurately model GIA, the lateral viscosity variations within the interior of the Earth are accounted for (Kaufmann et al., 2000; Steffen et al., 2006; Wu and van der Wal, 2003). Additionally, an increased level of accuracy is obtained by adopting a combination of linear and non-linear viscoelasticity as demonstrated by Barnhoorn et al. (2011); Forno and Gasperini (2007); van der Wal et al. (2013);Wu and Wang (2008). <br/><br/>During the Last Glacial Maximum, the British-Irish and Fennoscandian Ice Sheets covered large parts of Northwestern Europe. The interior of the Earth in this area is known to consist of material of very heterogeneous tectonic origin (Artemieva et al., 2006). Additionally, research in this area is promoted by the availability of the independent regional ice model Bradley2018 (Bradley, personal communication), an RSL observation database for the Rhine-Meuse Delta (Hijma and Cohen, 2019), and a collection of GPS derived uplift rates throughout Europe (Teferle, personal communication). <br/><br/>At the Astrodynamics and Space Missions research group of Delft University of Technology, a 3D GIA FEM model has been developed to model GIA in Antarctica (Blank et al., 2017). This model follows the work by Wu (2004) and van der Wal et al. (2013), and is complemented with an iterative algorithm to solve the sea level equation in accordance with Kendall et al. (2005). This research aims to provide a single GIA model best suited for the prediction of GIA induced vertical surface deformation in Northwestern Europe, by adapting the existing model. In doing so, a better understanding of the interior of the Earth in Northwestern Europe can be achieved.<br/><br/>The response of the Earth is dictated by the composite rheology creep flow laws for olivine (Hirth and Kohlstedt, 2003). By varying the grain size as well as the water content of the mantle material, and by implementing a global temperature model of the Earth’s interior, four 3D composite rheology Earth models are obtained. The fifth Earth model considered is the radially symmetric VM5a viscosity profile developed by Peltier et al. (2015) in conjunction with the global ice model ICE-6G_C. The performance of all five Earth model configurations in combination with both the ICE-6G_C model and the Bradley2018 model is analysed in terms of relative sea level and uplift rates.<br/><br/>It is found that the Bradley2018 model is the preferred ice model for GIA modelling in Northwestern Europe. The ICE-6G_C model outperforms the Bradley2018 model at far-field RSL sites, which is attributed to its superior representation of global eustatic sea level rise. The 3D composite rheologies lead to improved fits to RSL observations for the majority of the investigated measurement sites compared to the 1D scenario. The dry 4 mm grain size rheology yields the best overall performance out of all rheological configurations considered. A preference towards wet rheology exists in regions of Sveco-Norwegian tectonic origin. The strongest rheology is preferred in the mid-west of Scotland. No definitive connection is found between the local tectonic origin and preferred rheology fromRSL simulations. It is believed that this analysis may benefit from the inclusion of laterally varying grain sizes and water content inferred from geophysical observations, as well as the extension of the variable space for the water content.<br/><br/>For both ice models, an improved fit to observed uplift rates can be obtained through the application of a 3D composite rheology. The GPS derived uplift rates can be reproduced best using the dry 10 mm grain size rheology in combination with the Bradley2018 ice history. This model is deemed to be best suited for simulation of GIA induced uplift rates in Northwestern Europe. The second-best performance in terms of uplift rate is found using the 1D Earth model. In Scandinavia the 4 mm dry rheology yields uplift rates equal to roughly half the observed uplift rates, while the uplift rates for the 10 mm and 4 mm wet rheologies are near-zero. In the far-field, where other surface deformation mechanisms may infer a larger deformation rate than GIA (Fokker et al., 2018), no model could reproduce the observed uplift rates. <br/><br/>The presence of a high viscosity anomaly beneath Eastern Fennoscandia is captured by the 3D rheologies and results in a shift of the centre of positive and negative uplift rates. As the spatial distribution of minima and maxima in both uplift rates and RSL change rates is sensitive to the inclusion of a 3D rheology, this should be accounted for in future regional sea level change and surface deformation projections.<br","Glacial Isostatic Adjustment; Relative sea level; Composite rheology; GPS; FEM; Fennoscandia; British Isles; Postglacial rebound; Viscoelasticity","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

These problems force society to make a transition, from a system driven by fossil raw materials to a sustainability-based system. Hydrogen can play a part in shifting from fossil fuels to more sustainable energy flows, as a renewable energy carrier, to decrease the CO2 emissions. However, the major obstacle of hydrogen use is the low volumetric energy density at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. Therefore, hydrogen must be compressed, liquefied or attached to a carrier to use it for storage or transportation purposes. The most cost-effective method to import hydrogen is yet unknown, and therefore a better understanding of the costs of the hydrogen supply chains are essential. The objective of this research is to: (1) understand the different costs for each individual element of the supply chain, (2) design a hydrogen supply chain that integrates the individual elements into a single framework to be able to compare the different carriers to each other and (3) create a more profound perspective on the investment decisions for a hydrogen import terminal. A case study for the port of Rotterdam is performed to validate the operation of the general supply chain for a specific case, resulting in a more in-depth understanding of the import terminal. This research covers four hydrogen carriers: ammonia, MCH, liquid- and gaseous hydrogen. The answer for objective one, is that for ammonia and MCH the import terminal costs are the highest, for liquid hydrogen the conversion plant costs and for gaseous hydrogen the transport costs. The hydrogen costs for ammonia, MCH and liquid hydrogen decreases as long as the demand increases, up until an amount of 500,000 t/y, whereby for gaseous hydrogen this decline holds for values beyond this amount as well. In general, for distances up to 3,500 nm gaseous hydrogen is preferred and for intermediate to long distance ammonia. The discrepancy in costs between ammonia, MCH and liquid hydrogen is almost negligible. Regarding the second objective, it can be stated that it makes no difference when choosing one carrier, or the other at ammonia, MCH and liquid hydrogen for intermediate to long distances. To conclude, the optimal hydrogen import supply chain for the estimated demand of Rotterdam is obtained from gaseous hydrogen exported from Tunisia with a cost price of 2.3 €/kg.","Hydrogen; Terminal; Supply chain; Parametric model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","",""

Out of this 40%, a large portion is related to the operational phase involving heat losses through a buildings envelope. To reduce this loss, several materials have been developed to reduce the thermal transmittance through a façade, even though they carry a heavy environmental burden. Furthermore, the unregulated and rapid expansion of urban environments led to a considerable amount of problems. Among them, the urban heat island effect demands special attention as it has been responsible for an increase of the energy consumption to higher mortality rates. In part, the use of materials with high thermal admittance is responsible for these effects. Vertical green systems have shown to be a potential solution to improve, among others, the thermal demands of buildings and to mitigate the urban heat island effect. However, due to the uncertainty associated with their design process and operation, the implementation of vegetation as a construction material in an urban setting is often overlooked. Therefore, an in-depth study of their performance under different configurations and climate conditions is needed. <br/><br/>The optimization study was based on the parametrization of a green façade and a living wall system which aimed to identify their response under variable initial conditions. A analysis of the essential parameters in the vegetation model was performed. Consequently, the leaf area index showed the highest effect, followed by the substrate thickness, leaf angle distribution, leaf surface albedo and finally by the moisture content of the substrate layer. Furthermore, a state-of-the-art computational work flow was developed through the integration of ENVI_met, Rhino/Grasshopper and modeFRONTIER, in combination with Python 3 scripting, to evaluate the performance of vertical greenery systems. The evaluation focused on the heat transmission through the façade of a single building, in comparison to a reference model. The work flow allowed the study of the impact of each parameter in the behavior of the system and led to the development of several design guidelines. The optimized result was tested in an urban setting to evaluate its potential as a mitigation strategy for the urban heat island effect. <br/><br/>The largest reduction in thermal transmission took place in equatorial, fully humid climate due to the low vapor pressure deficit; while the lowest in a temperate climate during winter conditions, suggesting the lower efficiency of the systems under cold weather. Furthermore, living wall systems have a significantly higher performance in comparison to green façades. On the other hand, the latent heat release associated with the evapotranspiration process has a strong correlation with the leaf area index, given the simultaneous action of the aerodynamic and bulk surface resistance. The optimized configuration of the vegetation was then derived based partly on this correlation. Moreover, the leaf angle distribution displayed a high correlation with the solar zenith angle and the leaf surface albedo with the intensity of the solar radiation and the ambient temperature. Additionally, among the substrate properties, the substrate thickness indicated a large potential in reducing heat transmission. <br/><br/>The effects of vertical green systems in an urban setting suggested an improvement of the environmental conditions. While the leaf area index is directly related to the decrease of wind speed and evaporative cooling, the leaf surface albedo influenced the amount of reflected shortwave radiation in a façade. Furthermore, the highest cooling potential was observed in desert climates as a result of the high vapor pressure deficit with temperature drops of up to 0.25 C. <br/><br/>The outcome of this research indicates that an optimized vertical greenery system is a suitable replacement for artificial insulating materials as a passive alternative to reduce energy demands in buildings. Indicating a decrease in heat transmission from 8% to 50% of the original heat flux. Furthermore, the findings of the urban study suggests that a decrease in the ambient temperature and an overall reduction of the negative impacts related to the urban heat island effect is possible.","Green wall; Vertical greenery systems; Urban heat island; Heat transfer; Urban setting; Evapotranspiration; Parametric study; Optimization Procedure; Integrated workflow","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Building Engineering","",""

This impulse response method is a time-stepping method which iteratively approximates the non-linear force by a sequence of short impulses and employs the response to a step force to calculate the response to each of them. The response to a step force consists of the summation of a particular and homogeneous solution of the governing partial differential equation, where the latter employs complex modes, and satisfies the initial conditions at the start of the time interval. To validate the impulse response method, it is compared to the classical modal reduction methods. Two modal reduction methods are distinguished, the first one employing real-valued modes (a) and the second employing complex modes (b), which in principle both violate the boundary conditions and result in an inaccurate response, especially at the boundary where the damping is located. The real-valued modes, corresponding to the undamped beam in free vibration, and the complex modes, corresponding to the beam with the boundary dashpot in damped free vibration, are determined to perform the methods. Elaboration of the impulse response method, and comparing it to the modal reduction method (a) leads to the general conclusion that the impulse response method is a suitable method to calculate the non-linear dynamic response of a cantilever beam with viscous damping at the top boundary. Three important requirements for the numerical procedure, (1) convergence, (2) stability and (3) accuracy, are met, under the assumption that the modal reduction method (a) approaches the exact solution.

The region is facing a rapid retreat of the coastline, threatening the livelihood of a large part of the population. The main cause of the erosion is the deforestation of the green belt of mangroves. This has disturbed the delicate sediment balance in the area drastically. This MSc thesis was carried out within BioManCO. This is a project of Delft University of Technology and Universitas Diponegoro and aims to develop a bio-morphodynamic model for mangrove-mud coasts. This will eventually be used to identify the conditions under which autonomous reforestation of a sustainable mangrove green belt will take place, restoring the natural coastal protection. Semi-permeable dams are already being implemented to restore the sediment balance in the area. In this approach, however, the existence of a fluid mud layer is neglected. The observation of relatively steep slopes of the interface between mud and water indicates potential mud transport within the mud layer. Such a transport would contribute to the shoreward flux of sediment and thus to the restoration of the coastal profile. If a hybrid dam is implemented, it will block the flow of sediment and might therefore defy its own purpose; attenuating flow and waves in order to capture sediment and restore the eroded coastal profile. The objective of this thesis is to assess wave damping as a driving mechanism for set-up of the fluid mud layer at the coast of Demak and to identify under what conditions such a set-up can exist. Significant attenuation of waves can be achieved by viscous dissipation of wave energy in the mud layer. The set-up of the fluid mud interface is hypothesised to be balancing the wave force resulting from the reduction of wave energy in shoreward direction. To gain insight in the damping of waves and, more generally, in the dynamics of the coastal system of Demak, a field campaign has been carried out. Based on these measurements a SWAN-Mud model has been set up and has been coupled to an idealised model that calculates the equilibrium slope based on modelled wave-damping. The field observations show that the interface level is indeed sloping upwards towards the coast. This slope, however, does not seem to change significantly during the field campaign, indicating that the occurring waves are not able to move the layer. A strong daily variation in wave height and period, dependent on the prevailing wind system, is observed. SWAN-Mud is able to reproduce these measurements convincingly, even with the simple schematisation used in this thesis. The damping of the waves is influenced by the water depth and the wave period, and to a lesser extent by the wave height. It is also strongly dependent on the thickness and viscosity of the mud layer. The use of a fluid mud module to model the dissipation of waves at the coast of Demak is proven to be necessary. The developed conceptual model assumes a balance between the wave force in the mud layer and a pressure gradient due to a set-up of the fluid mud interface. This model shows that waves are able to force positive slopes in shoreward direction. However, for the range of mud parameters, water depths and wave characteristics as measured in Demak, these calculated slopes are too mild in comparison with the observed slopes. The adopted approach neglects the yield stress in the fluid mud layer. This internal strength might be able to balance and thus maintain the observed slopes after first being forced by the waves. Over time, this could lead to a build-up of sediment against the coast which could potentially be colonised and fixated by mangrove species. This build-up has a possible implication for the management of the coastal area of Demak. The hybrid dams might indeed be blocking a restoration mechanism of the mud coast which defies the original purpose of building these dams.","fluid mud; Building with Nature; mud coast; erosion; sediment transport; Wave Attenuation; wave damping; radiation stress; fieldwork; SWAN; SWAN-Mud; viscous damping; indonesia; Demak; mud; conceptual model; hybrid dam","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","BioManCO","-6.901509, 110.503917"

Transcription refers to the conversion of genetic code to a readable format for the cell, while translation refers to the conversion of this code into polypeptide chains using ribosomes.

In this report two simpler models and its mathematical abstractions are examined. These two are independent random walks on a grid Zd and the totally symmetric exclusion process on Zd where we allow a maximum of one particle per site. Since transcription and translation deal with particles being added and removed, we also consider the two models under which a source is placed in the origin for particles. Starting with independent random walkers, we find a principle called duality. This says that we can describe the independent random walks of a whole configuration by letting a single particle execute a random walk starting from x and evaluate the random walk at a later time t. Since precise quantitative behaviour is rather dificult to extract without further assumptions, we instead turn towards invariant distributions. It is proven that the Poisson measure is invariant on Zd, with and without a source in the origin for independent random walkers.","","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics | Applied Physics","",""

Within the last decade, bubbly drag reduction has yielded its place to air layer drag reduction, in which a thin, continuous air layer is produced under the ship’s hull. Reductions in friction drag have shown to be between the 80 and 99% and net energy savings of around 8-12 % have been predicted, which is however probably not enough to compensate the complexity of the system. Nevertheless, by coating the lower part of the hull with a superhydrophobic coating, C. Peifer et al. (2019) showed that air ﬂow requirements to obtain a stable air layer diminished by a factor of three. Thereportpresented here is a ﬁrst study of the mechanisms that enhance the air layer stability when combined with a superhydrophobic surface. Water impact dynamics and free surface - turbulence interaction are studied experimentally and numerically respectively. Water behaviour upon impact has been investigated through an ascending jet impacting on the underside of four diﬀerent surfaces with contact angles ranging from 45 to 150 degrees, obtaining the plate forces and top and side views of the water spread on the surface. Interesting results regarding the collapse of the spread area when a modiﬁed Weber number is used has been obtained. Two characteristic dewetting mechanisms for surfaces with low and high contact angle have been identiﬁed and explained by a simple theoretical model. Furthermore, possible independence of the friction coeﬃcient on the surface wettability characteristic has been found. When plotted against the streamwise Reynolds number all surfaces collapse in the theoretical Blasius laminar friction coeﬃcient, which suggests that once the surface is fully wetted (Wenzel state), the lower dimensional drag seen in (super)hydrophobic surfaces is due solely to their smaller contact area. To the best of our knowledge, these comprise the ﬁrst experiments in which area and force were measured in a scenario in which viscosity, inertia, surface tension and gravity shape the water ﬂow characteristics. On the other hand, a numerical model based on the classic elastic membrane concept has been employed to represent the deformations due to turbulence pounding in an air-water interface. Although further adjustments are needed, the model has been able to predict the tow tank experiments in C. Peifer et al. (2019) by using the surface-dependent water spread obtained in the water impact experiment. The dependence of the critical air ﬂux to form a stable air layer on the surface wettability characteristics can therefore be predicted.","Superhydrophobic Surfaces; Air Layer Drag Reduction; Drag Reduction; Multiphase Flow","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

This master thesis proposes a mobile game which enables the target group to receive food literacy and report their diet through gameplay. The game is about dragon raising; it builds a connection between the game world and the real world by encouraging users to feed their dragons with what they buy and eat in real lives. The project started with literature research and a user survey in the supermarket to explore the factors that influenced people’s food choice. The result showed there were mainly two reasons why low SES people were not having healthy food behavior, unwilling to learn food knowledge or report diet: lack of motivation or lack of ability, which is in line with Fogg's Behavior Model. After further research on the characteristics of people with low SES and contextual factors that influence food behavior, the reason became more specific: 1. People didn't have motivation due to the lack of direct feedback about the short-term and long-term benefits of having good food behaviors. 2. People lacked the ability to learn food literacy or report their diet because they were hindered by more pressing matters in their daily life, e.g., financial difficulty, busy lives. Self-Determination Theory and Persuasive Game Design Model were applied together with Fogg's Behavior Model to help with analyzing the user characteristics and contextual factors. After that, the design guideline was made that the design should focus on simplifying the using and learning process (to increase ability) and deliver food knowledge in an attractive and enjoyable way that may relate to their basic needs (to enhance motivation). Before entering the design phase, an analysis of existing food informatics products, including dietary apps and gamified healthcare apps, was conducted to find the typical functional features and most frequently used game elements. Personas and scenarios of two types of user groups were also created based on the research results, leading to the design requirements. During the design phase, creative sessions were carried for idea-generating, followed by two rounds of prototyping test and iterations. Two game concepts with different game elements and design focuses were further developed and tested with users to check to what extent could the concepts meet the design goal and requirements. The final concept was created according to the insights from users' preference and feedback. In the last phase, the design concept was evaluated with experienced designers and dietitian in related fields to get critical feedback and suggestion. The recommendations and limitations were discussed as well in the end.","Persuasive Game Design; Food literacy; Interaction Design; Low SES","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

In real-world settings, selectively directed attention cannot be monitored by relating physiological signals to known event markers. Determining the similarity of physiological responses across individuals in a group (i.e., physiological synchrony - PS) may provide a solution to this problem, as it has been shown reflective of shared attentional engagement toward audiovisual stimuli. This study was aimed at examining whether PS in autonomic and neural measures are suitable markers to recover selectively directed attentional focus and moments of emotional or task-related relevance in a composite auditory stimulus.<br/>Electroencephalography (EEG), electrodermal activity (EDA) and cardiac inter-beat interval (IBI) were monitored from participants who heard a composite auditory stimulus, consisting of a narrative<br/>audiobook, interspersed with short stimuli.

Hence, there is a crucial need for developing the current state of material and process understanding, in order to increase the technology readiness levels of automated, out-of-autoclave production processes. Laser assisted fiber placement (LAFP) is a well-researched, automated production process which has been used in developing various thermoplastic composite demonstrators. Theoretically, this process does not require an autoclave consolidation cycle. However, one of the remaining challenge in the process, is the relatively high void content in the produced laminates (&gt;1%). This high void content is impeding the development of thermoplastic composite structures with mechanical strength comparable to structures produced through traditional processing techniques, such as an autoclave. One of the main reasons for the remaining void content in the laminates after consolidation by the roller, is thermal deconsolidation during the rapid heating phase of the process. This is a very less researched aspect of LAFP, due to which, not much is known about the changes that the incoming material undergoes, due to the rapid laser heating and which mechanisms govern these changes. Due to this, thermal deconsolidation is also not included in predictive models for the process and hence the accuracy of these models in predicting the final part quality is poor. Therefore, this research focuses on gaining a better understanding of thermal deconsolidation, in the context of rapid laser heating during LAFP, through experimental investigation.The influence of five process variables was studied in this work: heating time, heated spot length, cooling rate, nip point temperature and the polymer type in carbon-fiber reinforced thermoplastic pre-impregnated (prepreg) tapes. The deconsolidated state of prepreg tape specimens was captured after rapid laser heating and the changes were characterized. The main results revealed that thermal deconsolidation due to rapid laser heating is governed by multiple mechanisms. Some previously unreported and non-intuitive results were observed in the material response to rapid laser heating, which are suspected to have a strong influence on the quality of the laminates produced through LAFP. Based on a qualitative and quantitative study of the influence of studied process variables on thermal deconsolidation, some mechanisms were identified and later verified with confirmatory experiments. The results of this study can be used as a starting point to develop predictive models for estimating the deconsolidated state of thermoplastic prepreg tapes, at the end of the rapid heating phase, in future work. Various topics for further research prevail. These include but are not limited to: studying the influence of tool temperature on the deconsolidation response of the prepreg material, evaluation of the deconsolidated state with superior characterization techniques in order to obtain in-situ microstructural data, overcoming experimental limitations of a static laser heating setup and studying the influence of the deconsolidated tape state on intimate contact development under roller compaction pressure. By investigating these additional aspects, a robust and accurate predictive model for thermal deconsolidation can be developed in future work, which shall help improve the accuracy of a high-fidelity process model for LAFP, which is currently in development at TU Delft.","Thermoplastic; Prepreg; Deconsolidation; Laser Assisted Fiber Placement (LAFP); In-situ consolidation; Out-of-autoclave","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering | Structures and Materials","",""

Following the successful development in Western Europe, offshore wind is quickly gaining momentum in the Asia-Pacific region. At variance with North Sea-based offshore wind turbines, structures installed in the Asia-Pacific region are prevalently exposed to typhoons, giving rise to severe wind speeds and, consequently, extreme waves. Such conditions have become design driving for support structures. Considering that the response of the support structure due to these extreme waves is dependent on soil stiffness, a state-of-the-art foundation model accounting for non-linear, hysteretic soil-monopile behaviour is included in integrated time-domain simulations. Besides considering load-dependent hysteretic damping, the foundation model accounts accurately for the unloading-reloading stiffness. This multi-directional macro-element model has been primarily developed and verified for fatigue limit state analyses. In this thesis, the results of additional 3D finite element verification analyses are presented to identify potential model limitations under ultimate limit state conditions. With regard to different geotechnical and loading scenarios, it is observed that the macro-element model satisfactory predicts load-dependent stiffness and damping, even for the extreme load levels relevant to the Asia-Pacific region. To capture the offshore wind turbine dynamic response to extreme loading, time-domain analyses are performed with two foundation models: 1) the current industry standard based on non-linear elastic API p-y curves, and 2) the non-linear elasto-plastic macro-element model. These models are calibrated against the API p-y curves and also against load-displacement curves from 3D finite element analyses. From the models calibrated against the API standard, the effect of accounting for the load-dependent stiffness and damping on the response at interface for extreme load cases is determined. A reduction of the moment at interface level is observed, due to an improved soil stiffness and damping estimation. Further, as the API p-y curves do not account for the correct initial stiffness, the response at interface level is additionally evaluated with the macro-element model calibrated to 3D finite element analyses. The results show a further decrease of the response, that may be attributed to the (initial) stiffer response of the monopile at mudline from 3D finite element analyses. One of the recommendations is to numerically evaluate the contribution of hysteretic damping with regards to the system damping. Therefore, the validity of the often-used linear damping estimation strategy is investigated for the non-linear system. The interference term in the response at mudline has shown to cause a phase difference, with respect to similar response that does not account for the interference term. The applicability of the logarithmic decrement method that is currently used for system damping estimation is therefore questioned. To evaluate this further, it is suggested to perform additional studies that account for a more adequate representation of the response spectrum.","Hysteretic damping; Dynamic response offshore wind turbine; APAC region; Macro-element model; Monopile foundation; Non-linear hysteretic model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","European Wind Energy Masters (EWEM)","",""

A local initiative opting to improve the environment gained interest in the idea and asked Arcadis NL for help. The weir complex at Driel lays in a key position in the Dutch river Delta and regulates the flow to the IJssel and Nederrijn, both important parts of the flood protection and important shipping routes. In the Nederrijn 2 other hydro-power plants have been built at weirs. Driel was considered as well, but at the time could not be made feasible due to the low head difference at Driel. Developments in low-head hydro-power have given new possibilities and reason for reassessment. First the location has been analysed, in particular the flow situation. Except for the low head difference, the location lends itself well for a hydroelectric plant. The crux of the research is therefore in making the most of the available head. 4 variants have been worked out: a copy of the downstream hydro-power plant of Maurik as a reference, several variations on low head Kaplan turbines and an Archimedes screw have been assessed. A special variation of the Kaplan is the Venturi enhanced Kaplan, which uses part of the discharge to increase the head difference over the turbine. To estimate the annual production, first a simple approach, assuming a turbine can create a certain head difference, and later a hydraulic model incorporating hydraulic losses and using turbomachinery theory, has been used for the Kaplan design variants. The result of the comparison is that the regular Kaplan variant number 4 with 5 turbines, a combined capacity of 3.160kW and a LCOE of 0,154 € per kWh (using interest rate of 3,3%), has the best economic performance and is therefore recommended for further development. A good second option with a lower initial investment (9,6 million euros versus 20,5 of variant nr. 4) is design variant number 1 with a set of 2 Kaplan turbines having a combined capacity of 1.475kW and a LCOE of 0,161 € per kWh. Despite the regular Kaplan performing better economically, the Venturi Enhanced Kaplan Turbine certainly has potential for low head run of river hydropower and is therefore recommended for further research as well. The increase in power and produced energy gives reason to believe that further optimisation and detailing will lead to a competitive design compared to the regular Kaplan turbines.","Low head; hydro power; Kaplan,; Archimedes Screw Turbine; Venturi enhanced Kaplan; economic feasibility","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering | Hydraulic Structures","","51.964339,5.806348"

Up to date, hull flexibility still cannot be efficiently incorporated into aero-servo-elastic-hydro simulation tools, and the possible influence of hull flexibility has not yet been well-understood. Consequently, it is necessary to identify the significance of hull flexibility and the possible effect of it.<br/><br/>Recent researches have been investigating the influence of hull flexibility on substructural internal load, global responses and dynamics of the system. However, little has been done from a tower design perspective. Moreover, tower design for a floating foundation has also been seldom documented. To fill the knowledge gap, two research questions are defined: What is the difference in tower design with a floating foundation? and What is the effect of hull flexibility on tower design?<br/><br/>To answer the first research question, a FEM model with rigid hull is built based on four floating concepts designed for DTU 10MW wind turbine. The tower fore-aft bending natural frequencies are compared between fixed foundation and floating foundation. The second research question is answered by developing a FEM model with flexible hull based on a spar-buoy concept. The rigid hull model and the flexible hull model are compared by implementing structural analysis and fatigue damage estimation under waves load.<br/><br/>The result shows that the 1st tower bending natural frequency increases significantly(except for TLP) from a fixed foundation to a floating foundation, making it difficult to achieve a soft-stiff tower design. Furthermore, it is indicated that hull flexibility can decrease the 1st tower bending natural frequency, and the magnitude varies with different tower designs. A stiff-stiff tower decreases more while a soft-stiff decreases less. Lastly, the fatigue damage estimation implies that a soft-stiff design can be lack of fatigue strength to survive from waves load. <br/><br/>In conclusion, a soft-stiff tower design is difficult for large size floating wind turbine partly due to the increase in 1st tower bending natural frequency from fixed foundation to floating foundation, and partly because of strength requirement for fatigue load. As for a stiff-stiff tower design, without considering hull flexibility, there is a high uncertainty in the 1st tower bending natural frequency. As a result, for large size floating wind turbines, inclusion of hull flexibility is necessary for the tower design.<br","Floating Wind Turbines; Hull Flexibility; Dynamics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-07-23","","","","","",""

This is the result of a resource and knowledge gap around a concept, leading to challenges in adoption into an organisation resulting projects losing momentum, and ultimately being abandoned. The aim of this project was to develop a solution, in collaboration with Studio Kraftwerk, which tackled this knowledge and skill gap between the two parties, in order to ensure concept proposals have a better chance of being adopted and eventually reach the market. Research was conducted both through field interviews and in literature, to understand how this phenomena happens in practice and how it can be overcome. The findings of this identified a misalignment of expectations between design agencies and client organisations, resulting in neither party explicitly focusing on how to relate a concept into an organisation. Further to this, the literature research identified the organisational empathy framework, which highlights the key aspects required tackle this knowledge gap. This research fed into the development of the Bridging workshop, which is an approach to facilitate a knowledge exchange required to relate a concept to a client organisation. Through this approach, based on the organisational empathy framework, designers and their clients assess the alignment between a concept and the current state of the organisation. Following this, suggestions on how to create better alignment are made, whether that is through changes to the concept or proposed organisational transformation. While the Bridging workshop was developed within Kraftwerk's practices, this is not a unique challenge to their agency, and as such this approach can be applied by either design agencies or stakeholders within an organisation.","Valley of death; alignment; design thinking; client relationship; client-contractor relationship; Client expectations","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Traditional materials and methods are reaching their limitation when demanding and special applications are considered.<br/><br/>The current growth in WAAM applications will boost the WAAM consumable material development in the coming future. WAAM applications mostly refer to small batch production or prototypes, which often requires special wire compositions or can benefit from tailoring the consumable composition for the desired components. On one hand, solid wire production is only economically viable when large volumes are involved. On the other hand, metal-cored wires are particularly suitable to produce tailored or small-batch consumable compositions, which is very attractive for WAAM. However, only limited research has been carried out in the use of metal-cored wires in additive manufacturing. In this research, the focus is to explore the use of metal-cored wire in WAAM applications. Two chemical compositions, one ferrous, medium carbon low steel alloy (AM-XC-45), and one non-ferrous, Stellite 6 (cobalt-based superalloy), metal-cored wires were investigated based on industrial interests at RAMLAB.<br/><br/>The microstructure of the WAAM AM-XC-45 thin wall was characterized using optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. Pearlite, ferrite, bainite, and martensite are present in the deposited wall. Columnar grains are found near the fusion line. The repeated thermal cycles cause the grains to become finer from the top to bottom layers. The mechanical properties including microhardness and tensile strength were tested and compared with the traditional processing methods like casting, milling, and forging. It showed a comparable or superior microhardness and tensile strength to the traditional process whereas the relative lower elongation of the deposited AM-XC-45 thin wall indicates that further post heat treatment is needed to improve the ductility of the part.<br/><br/>Stellite 6 is a cobalt-based superalloy, which has good wear and corrosion resistance and retains these properties at high temperatures. In this study, Stellite 6 metal-cored wire (WEARTECH® WT-6 GMAW-C, AWS A5.21 ERCCoCr-A) is selected and optimized to obtain results comparable to the commonly employed and more costly laser deposition, in terms of microstructure and mechanical properties. The optimal deposition parameters were developed using the S355 steel substrate, and then adopted on depositing on the AISI 420 stainless steel substrate. Characterization showed that Stellite 6 layer mainly contains Co-Cr-Fe solid solution with FCC crystal structure as the matrix and the Cr7C3 and Cr3C2 were identified in the microstructure through SEM, EDS, and XRD. These carbides can contribute to the strength. In addition, the identified Co4W2C carbides can contribute to the wear properties of the Stellite 6 WAAM deposits. The dilution and hardness of the WAAM deposit can reach the same level as laser deposition.<br/><br/>Additionally, a 3D temperature distribution model is developed by adopting the moving mesh technique to numerically study the WAAM process. The model helps to gain a better understanding of the physical phenomena (heat and mass transfer) during the WAAM deposition. The AM-XC-45 was used to validate the developed model. The simulated and experimental results were compared. The dilution and HAZ of WAAM deposited single bead was used as validation criteria. The A1 line (1100K) simulation is in a good agreement with the experimental result. The fusion line (1800K) shows some deviation. Compared with laser deposition, the main differences between the two processes lie on the heat source, the boundary conditions, and the material responses to the process.","Wire and arc Additive Manufacturing; Metal-cored wire; AM-XC-45 Medium carbon steel; Stellite 6; Microstructure; Mechanical properties; Thermal modelling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-07-23","","","","Materials Science and Engineering","",""

This phenomenon is widely known, and used in for instance sonars. Electrons that reflect off of boundaries within conductors should abide this law as well, due to the particle-wave duality. However, it was recently discovered that for disordered graphene boundaries electrons scatter diffusively even when their wavelengths should be long enough not to. Graphene is a 2-dimensional semiconductor with linear dispersion at low energies, making it a widely researched topic as its applications in future electronic parts are promising. Its bilayer counterpart is made by connecting two layers on top of each other, which in contrast has a quadratic dispersion at low energies. In this work, the specularity of electron reflections within bilayer graphene were studied. This was done by constructing a tight-binding model, where random potentials on the outermost atoms represented imperfections of the lattice. Subsequently the variance of the scattering angle and the scattering phase was analysed, which can be derived using the scattering matrix of themodel. This was done numerically for both, and analytically for the phase as well. It was discovered that the variance of the scattering angle increases cubically with the Fermi wavelength of the electrons. This happens no matter what the distance between the Fermi energy and the disorder mean is, as long as the disorder strength is nonzero. The behaviour of these reflections is the exact opposite of what the law of reflection states. Furthermore, the variance of the scattering phase remains constant when the Fermi energy is close to the disorder mean, and changes inversely proportional to the boundary periodicity if the Fermi energy is further away. Consequently, the variance of the scattering phase versus the Fermi wavelength and the variance of the scattering phase versus the boundary periodicity do not share the same trend in bilayer graphene. More research is needed to verify this phenomenon, which could be done using the continuum description or a magnetic focusing device.","Solid State Physics; Law Of Reflection; Breakdown; Quantum Tinkerer","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics | Applied Physics","",""

The topic of research is the impact of climate change, unsustainable agriculture and urbanisation towards 2050, on the agricultural landscapes in the metropolitan region of Amsterdam, in the Netherlands. With the challenges and the problems that arise from these, it becomes inevitable to design a transition of the [food] landscapes in the region. Therefore the following research question is defined: ‘‘How to design a new perspective on the food landscapes in the metropolitan region of Amsterdam towards 2050 for a landscape that is resilient to the effects of climate change, to restore the ecosystem (in the freshwater) of the landscape and create opportunities for new activities to start that will strengthen the connection between cities and landscapes, for a resilient &amp; attractive region?’’ A new method is used to find solutions for the three challenges in an integrative way, as there is a lot of potential in the synergy of the solutions. The maximization method provides an overview of individual solutions for the problems in the region, which can be used if the challenges change over time. Subsequently, in the optimization phase, the solutions with the most potential to be combined are given (water storage, new food types, a circular water system, purifying nature &amp; greenhouses). In the final integration phase, the solutions are integrated into the landscapes of the region. An innovative element in this research is the addition of scenarios for the future transition of agricultural landscapes to the maximization method to create climate resilient, purifying agriculture or recreational [food] landscapes. This, together with interviews, results in a new perspective on the [food] landscapes in the region, that is a design for the landscapes created by the synergy between the solutions for the challenges (with a focus on the purifying &amp; climate resilient scenarios). With a new perspective, pilot projects are designed to give an example of the new perspective solutions through the scales and by using the unique characteristics of the agricultural landscapes in the region (in Waterland, Haarlemmermeer, Zaanstreek &amp; the Beemster). In the conclusion, the new perspective combined with pilot projects will create solutions for the challenges in the metropolitan region of Amsterdam towards 2050.","Agricultural landscapes; Climate change; Ecosystem pollution; Urbanisation; Metropolitan region of Amsterdam; Maximization method; Synergy solutions; Scenarios; Pilot projects","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Urbanism","","52.3702157,4.8951679"

Circular economy, founded on three basic principles, advocates for all materials to be kept in use for as long as possible. This takes a concrete shape, for example, in the importance of recycling materials.<br/>However, recycling materials can be a trickier business than one might think. Nowadays materials are so complex and specialized, that recycling them properly requires precise knowledge of their composition and content. In a way, then, it can be argued that the exchange of this knowledge, from material manufacturers to recyclers, is a core enabler of circular economy. As information exchanges happen mostly digital, data becomes then the key asset in this depicted scenario.<br/>Data exchanges are as well not an easy feat. Looking only at a business to business market, several obstacles refrain companies from sharing data more liberally. For once, openly sharing data exposes companies to threats from competitors and losses in their negotiating power.<br/>Circularise, the start-up this project has been developed for, has come up with a technical solution for a data exchange system that relies on a distributed ledger. Thanks to their technological protocol, circularise can enable secure collaboration between material manufacturers and the rest of the supply chain, all the way to recyclers.<br/>Despite the technological feasibility of the protocol, Circularise is struggling with finding clients. Currently the start-up has developed a value proposition that caters mainly towards material manufacturers and, as a consequence, material manufacturers are the only paying customer segment for them. In order for the protocol to have an effective impact and benefit on circular economy activities, expanding the client range is necessary for Circularise. This can be accomplished by expanding the start-up’s business model portfolio, so to speak. This means running two different business models at the same time, one being the existing one, catering to material manufacturers, and another one ensuring that a new customer segment receives an offer worth paying for.<br/>This is the opportunity this project is built around. In the course of this graduation project a digital platform has being design and is explained in this report, together with a new business model for Circularise to cater to automotive OEMs with a tailored offer.","Circular economy; Business Model Canvas; Automotive industry; Digital Platforms; Blockchain technology","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A dissipative bending component and a conservative component due to elongation.<br/><br/>After this the different types of damping were introduced. Of which structural damping was most important, it is experimentally found to be approximately constant for many materials over a large band of frequencies. The loss tangent and quality factor for this type of damping are both constant. The physical origin of this behaviour isn't really understood. But there have been ideas hinted that it is due to surface imperfections~\cite{Kippenberg}.<br/><br/>To simulate dissipation dilution a spring system has been developed. In this system part of the energy is stored in torsion springs and another part in elongation springs. From this model it is observed that the effective spring constant of the total system depends on the initial strain. At low amounts of strain the spring constant is similar to that of torsion springs while at higher strains it becomes more like the elongation spring model. The quality factor of the beam is found to increase linearly with the strain.","nano; mechanical; nanomechanical; resonator; resonators; dissipation dilution; doubly; clamped; quality factor; loss tangent; loss angle; damping; structural damping; torsion; elongation; stretching; transverse motion; mass; spring; springs; model; beam; Euler Bernoulli; Euler Bernoulli Beam; Deformation; Stress; Strain; Engineering; spring constant","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Physics","",""

Most marketplace operators try to mitigate this behavior by serving as the central authority. This approach requires user data collection and is not privacy-friendly. In an attempt to build a foundation for solving the fraud concerns and privacy issues, this paper elaborates on the design and implementation of a simple marketplace system using peer-to-peer (P2P) technology in combination with a Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) solution. The P2P network ensures no single points of control, reduces risks of a big data breach and simply costs less to operate. The SSI solution makes sure that users cannot create multiple accounts to whitewash their dishonest behavior. Ensuring every user has only one identity makes the platform Sybil-resistant. In contrast to other identity verification systems used in marketplaces, such as Facebook Login, SSI aims to put the user in control and to not collect personal data. Users know what data are asked and give explicit consent for each request. This user-centric approach makes them privacy-friendly. Reaching Sybil resistance without having a central authority in a marketplace has not been done before. In the future a reputation system can be built on top of the Sybil-resistant P2P system, ensuring users’ behavior can not be whitewashed. Several methods are used during the design and the implementation process. They include the Scrum framework, MoSCoW prioritization and Class-Responsibility-Collaboration cards.

Following the successful development in Western Europe, offshore wind is quickly gaining momentum in the Asia-Pacific region. At variance with North-Sea based offshore wind turbines (OWTs), structures installed in the Asia-Pacific region are exposed to a high risk of strong earthquakes. To reasonably manage these risks a solid understanding of the physical process of seismic loading is required. Moreover, accurate and effective design procedures to account for this complicated type of loading, need to be developed. Considering that the response of OWTs to earthquakes is affected by the the interaction with the soil, the current thesis is aimed at providing a modelling method to accurately account for the effects of soil-structure interaction in the seismic design of offshore wind turbines. More specifically, the complicated load transferring mechanisms between the soil continuum and the most often applied monopile foundation are addressed. The accuracy of the currently applied design methods is questioned. The uncoupled lateral springs as used in these methods cannot capture the non-local reaction of the soil towards the rigid monopile. Moreover, these methods do not account for the effects of seismic wave diffraction as they use free-field ground motion to introduce the seismic action. For these reasons, the currently applied methods may provide inaccurate estimations of the seismic loads. Hence, more accurate modelling approaches are required. In establishing the modelling method, it is suggested to benefit from the accuracy of a 3D model as it automatically captures the complicated 3D soil-structure interaction mechanisms during earthquake loading. For this reason, a 3D finite element model is provided that simulates the seismic loading of a monopile-supported wind turbine. The 3D modelling approach is however computationally too expensive to replace the simple, 1D models used in the design of offshore wind turbine structures. Therefore, to combine the speed and simplicity of a 1D model with the accuracy of the 3D model, the current thesis presents a method to obtain a 1D effective model that mimics the 3D modelled response. In establishing the effective modelling approach, the 3D model is not only used as a target solution. The 3D model is directly employed to capture the 3D soil continuum reaction and the seismic excitation loads acting on the monopile. These components are incorporated into an effective model by making use of the substructuring method of analysis. To extract the 3D reactions of the soil, the non-local method of Versteijlen \cite{Versteijlen17} is used. The soil stiffness matrices obtained by this method are integrated into a 1D beam model. The ground motion required to introduce the seismic action into this 1D model is determined in a separate step; the ground response analysis. This analysis is performed using a 3D model of the soil subsystem, that incorporates an excavation at the location of the embedded pile. This cavity is included to account for the effects of wave diffraction.\\ To assess, the performance of the provided modelling approach, a comparative study is performed between the 3D soil-structure model and the 1D effective model. This study showed that the 1D pile response closely matches the response of the 3D model - for both horizontal and vertical earthquake motion. Hence, it is proven that the developed design method effectively combines the accuracy of a 3D model with the simplicity of a 1D model.\\ Furthermore, the effective modelling approach is applied to assess the influence of 3D continuum soil-structure interaction effects on the structural response to earthquakes. These analyses indicate that the diffracted component of the seismic wave field does not significantly affect the earthquake excitation load acting on the monopile. As a results, the seismic wave diffraction can safely be neglected. This makes it possible to use free-field ground motion to introduce the seismic action into the effective 1D model. Moreover, the frequency dependent characteristics of the soil are evaluated - which are associated with geometric damping and inertial effects. An initial study on the influence of this soil frequency dependence, showed that the geometric damping results in a considerably reduced structural response for high frequencies. The effect of the soil inertia forces on the response to earthquakes is limited.","Soil-structure interaction; Structural Dynamics; Offshore wind turbine; Seismic loading; Earthquake Engineering; Monopile; Effective 1D model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering","",""

Therefore to ensure their survival over time, it is necessary to determine the loads that these structures will face during its lifetime. However, load prediction on lighthouses is troublesome due to the multiple factors that affect the loading. First, the geometries of lighthouses vary considerably from one to another, not usually representing the classic cylindrical shape by which they are modelled in laboratories. Second, climate change transforms the statistical properties of the sea states and will bring more extreme events in the near future. As so as sea level rise. Lastly, the bathymetry around a lighthouse is considerably different to the ones used to model lighthouses in labs, which can affect wave propagation and breaking. Therefore loading is affected. As the traditional physical methods are both expensive and time consuming, researchers have developed computational tools to accurately represent reality. In this report, waves2Foam (a toolbox within OpenFOAM) will be used to reproduce some tests performed on a physical wave flume. The goal is to represent the conditions of the lab in the computational model so that this model can then be used to represent different geometries and wave loads over lighthouses in an easy and cheap way. Additionally, the most of the current tests were performed with waves directly hitting the lighthouse structure. However in this study, the waves break over a shoal and then the mass of water reaches the structure. This causes a smaller maximum load but the load is applied during a longer time that when a wave breaks directly on the lighthouse. In this study the physical model performed by Piermodesto Caputo (year 2017/2018) and supervised by Professor Renata Archetti and Dr. Alessandro Antonini (co-supervisor) will be modeled using waves2Foam (OpenFOAM).

Wind and solar energy are generated on land, whereas wave, windand tidal energy generators are getting attention in the offshore domain. Anovel extension of onshore solar energy is the concept of offshore solar energyusing floating platforms. As little research has been performed on the conceptof offshore solar energy generations, main challenges in the field are relatedto consequences to the marine ecology, economics and production and structuraldesign of the platforms. In this thesis, a numerical model to assess wrinklingbehaviour of thin, floating sheets with application to the structural design ofoffshore solar platforms is developed.<br/>Since wrinkling of thin sheets, in general, isinitiated by a structural instability (i.e. buckling), the developed modelconsists of an arc-length method that is capable to deal with bifurcationpoints and to switch to bifurcation branches. In this way, buckling andpost-buckling behaviour of thin sheets are modelled and wrinkled shapes can beassessed without imposing <i>a priori </i>definition of unbalancingimperfections or loads. The computational model is developed using a shelldiscretization with Isogeometric rotation-free Kirchhoff-Love elements, whichare higher-order elements with a B-spline or NURBS basis with global supportand global higher-order continuity of the solution. For the illustrativepurpose and future use, a similar Euler-Bernoulli beam model was developed andnumerical solvers for static, dynamic, modal and linear buckling analysis wereimplemented.<br/>The model was verified using various benchmarkstudies for static, modal, (post-)buckling and dynamic analysis. In particular,the post-buckling solver was assessed by modelling the collapse of a sphericalroof and using buckling (post-)bucking of a cantilever strip. Both benchmarkshave shown excellent agreement with previous publications. Additionalverification was done on the approaching accuracy and prediction of bifurcationpoints. It was found that this accuracy showed the accurate prediction of thebifurcation point, although slightly underpredicted for finer meshes and higherorders. Additionally, the model wasapplied to three cases where wrinkling is involved. In these cases, sheets withlow bending stiffness were modelled such that their post-buckling shapes showmultiple half-waves and thus wrinkles. Based on the model of a floating sheetsubject to surface traction (e.g. wind or current), design parameters werevaried. From this case, it follows a decrease in foundation stiffness or anincrease in flexural rigidity (either by varying Young's modulus or thickness)implies the number of wrinkles to decrease and the wrinkling instability tooccur for lower loads. Thirdly, based on the wrinkling geometries of a quarterdisk, design consideration for VLFTSs for offshore solar energy generation weregiven. These are: (i) adding reinforcement to arrest wrinkles and to introducestructural hierarchy for structural reliability; (ii) consider the effect ofdifferent mooring system connections to the (reinforced) platform; and (iii)investigate the effect of holes and point loads on local wrinkling behaviour. Basedon the results of the study, it is concluded that the isogeometric thin shellformulation is suitable for different structural analyses and that in particularthat robustness and accuracy on a per-degree of freedom basis is observed inthe isogeometric post-buckling analysis. This adds post-buckling analysis tothe seamless integration of Computer Aided Design (CAD) and Analysis ofIsogeometric Analysis. Suggestions for further studies include severalimprovements of the current implementation (patch coupling, boundary conditionimplementation), utilization of nonlinear material models for modelling ofrubber-like materials, adaptive re-meshing using THB-splines to capture localwrinkling phenomena and Fluid-Structure Interaction computations with anonlinear structural and fluid description of VLTFSs in large waves.","isogeometric analysis; Arc-length methods; Post-buckling analysis; Offshore energy; Buckling Analysis; Thin Structures","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Marine Technology","",""

Since the design of offshore wind turbines includes conservatism, the actual accumulated fatigue damage can be lower than what the turbine is designed for. In this case, the operator can make a decision on life time extension of existing wind turbines. Therefore, it is important to estimate the actual accumulated fatigue damage to support decision making on life time extension, and for optimization of support structure design. However, fatigue critical locations are located near mudline where it is unfeasible to install strain gauges to measure the accumulated fatigue damage. The first purpose of this thesis is to investigate if data-driven approaches (linear regression and feed-forward neural network) can be applied to estimate the accumulated fatigue damage both in individual turbines and farm-wide levels. The second purpose is to determine the minimum number of sensors and quantity of data required for accurate estimation. Towards this goal, real measurement data of two offshore turbines in the same wind farm have been used. Specifically, the data-driven approaches have been applied with real measurement data from the SCADA system, measurements at the top and bottom of the tower, and data from a wave measurement system. This data was used to estimate the accumulated fatigue damage at multiple locations (tower bottom, transition piece and two levels on the monopile) in the form of damage equivalent loads. Throughout the study, 10 min. statistical properties of the measurement data have been used as input to the learning algorithms. One remark is that the estimation has not been performed for the fatigue critical location near mudline itself, but it is expected that estimation with these approaches can be expanded to the fatigue critical location if accurate response estimation at multiple locations on the support structure is possible. The results of this thesis show that the data-driven approaches can give accurate estimates damage equivalent loads on individual turbine level at multiple locations on the support structure when moment or inclination signals at tower bottom is used. For farm-wide level load estimation as well, it has been proven that the data-driven approaches can give quite accurate estimates the damage equivalent load. However, it should be noted that the turbines used in this study have similar dynamic properties. Therefore, the farm-wide level load estimation with the data-driven approaches should be further investigated in the future.","Machine learning; Load extrapolation; Virtual sensing; Offshore wind turbines; Neural network; Fatigue","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-07-21","","","","European Wind Energy Masters (EWEM)","",""

Although many improvements in aspects of design, fabrication, inspection, and maintenance have been achieved over the years for such bridge decks, fatigue remains a predominant problem, mostly because of the complexity of prediction methods. Many researchers have tried to investigate this component through experiments. However, performing only experiments may not lead to a cost-effective solution. Therefore, it is necessary to combine the experimental data with the numerical approaches. Particularly Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics (LEFM) allows to model and analyse the crack propagation until subsequent failure, and significantly reduces the requirement of experiment. ABAQUS® provides an enriched feature, commonly referred to as the Extended Finite Element Method (XFEM) which incorporates two enrichment function namely the discontinuity function which represents the gap between the crack surface and asymptotic function which captures the singularity and thus can be used to model discontinuity independent to the finite element mesh. To evaluate the modelling efficiency and validate the simulation methodology, two XFEM-model based on LEFM and Virtual Crack Closure Technique (VCCT) are developed and the simulated results are compared with the experimental data. The first phase of the thesis deals with the numerical simulation to investigate the crack propagation rate in Compact-Tension (CT) specimen for different stress ratios. The results of two-dimensional (2D) model are found to be in good agreement (within 1.48%) with the fatigue coupon test results. As most of the work concentrates on 2D shell model, the extension to three-dimensional (3D) solid requires the investigation of related parameters to consider through-thickness effects. Nevertheless, the mechanism of 3D model is studied, and the simulated results match with the 2D results for fatigue crack growth (a, N). Moreover, a reliable technique of computing Stress Intensity Factor (SIF) is obtained by comparing with the ISO 12108 standard formulation. However, when the SIF and fatigue crack growth are combined, the crack propagation rate in 3D is overestimated (about 26%) when compared to the experimental data possibly because of the imperfection in the application of boundary conditions. The second phase deals with the numerical simulation in welded connection of OSD to determine the Paris law constants (C, m) by correlating the numerical result of fatigue crack growth with the beach mark measurements obtained in the fatigue experiments. Prior to automated XFEM simulation, a set of finite element analyses are performed to determine the vertical deformation, longitudinal stain distribution and hotspot stresses to validate the numerical model as per the test setup. The results of numerical analyses showed a good correlation (within 18%) with test data and Paris law constant C is predicted to be lower than the recommended value by IIW standard. The validated methodology is then applied on large scale to an existing bridge (Suurhoff bridge) structure which was built in 1971. In this case study, a crack length of 230 mm was detected in the deck plate originating from the root of the stiffener-to-deck plate welded connection between the cross-beams using TOFD measurements. To verify the problem, a numerical model is developed based on the dimension of the bridge to evaluate the crack initiation period and the crack propagation period. The crack initiation period is predicted using hotspot stress method and the crack propagation period is evaluated using automated XFEM simulation. Overall, the total fatigue load cycles are predicted to be 7.86 million which is equivalent to 48 years. A similar crack length was however detected after a service life of 44 years. This overestimation can be possibly explained as the model did not take residual stresses and other welding defects into account. The numerical model showed a good correlation with the real scenario and is therefore used to predict the permissible limit of deck plate crack length of 500 mm. The model predicted 8.02 million load cycles for a crack length of 500mm, which is equivalent to 34 years after the crack initiation period. Nevertheless, the fracture mechanics approach showed improvements in the assessment of fatigue life.","Orthotropic steel deck; XFEM; Fatigue crack propagation; Compact-Tension specimen; Linear Elastic Fracture mechanics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

For static loading, two different modelling approaches have been created. Both account for shear-induced microscopic matrix damage and matrix cracking within each ply orientation of a laminate. In one approach the residual transverse tensile and shear moduli of a ply are determined by equating the energy density of the undamaged ply to that of the ply with damage, for a same applied load. Predictions excellent agreement with test results for cross-ply laminates, while stiffness degradation is for shear dominated layups. The other static approach applies energy equivalence only to the transverse tensile behavior of a ply. For shear, it predicts the residual shear modulus by accounting for the creation of permanent shear strains. Agreement with test results is excellent for cross-ply laminates, and excellent to good for shear dominated layups. The physical foundation behind this model is not as rigorous as the previous one, and as such needs more work. The proposed fatigue model assumes the matrix strength of a ply to be randomly distributed. Kassapoglou’s residual strength model for fatigue loading is used to express fatigue life as a function of matrix strength. The static model is then used to estimate stiffness degradation as a function the same matrix strength. Connecting the two, stiffness degradation as a function of fatigue cycles is obtained.

As the catchment is situated between and in close proximity to the larger Nederrijn and Waal rivers, intercatchment groundwater flow (IGF; groundwater flow crossing topographic divides) might have a significant influence on the water balance of the Maurikse Wetering catchment. As the IGF cannot be measured directly and due to the complex nature of the IGF, the IGF is considered to be one of the hardest fluxes to quantify in conceptual hydrological modelling. The objective of this thesis is to express the IGF as a function of easy-to-measure variables. <br/>The most common method used to estimate the net IGF to a catchment in conceptual hydrology is to equate the IGF to the missing water in the water balance of the catchment. A different approach is analyzed in this thesis. To quantify the IGF, the Maurikse Wetering catchment and the surrounding area is modelled in the groundwater model MORIA. The direction of the groundwater flow shows that the groundwater flow in the region is heavily influenced by the Nederrijn and Waal rivers. A multiple linear regression (MLR) analysis was performed to study the influence of variables affecting the water balance of the Maurikse Wetering, e.g. the water level in the Nederrijn, the groundwater level in the Maurikse Wetering catchment and the precipitation, on the IGF. The resulting relations reliably model the IGF. The fact that multiple easy-to-measure factors have a relation to the IGF, shows that there are alternative methods to equating the IGF to the missing water in the water balance. This provides a basis for the usage of IGF relations in predictive modelling. <br/>To analyse the effect the IGF has on conceptual hydrological models, the catchment is modelled in WALRUS. The model is calibrated, modelled and validated both without IGF data and with the IGF as modelled by the derived relations. Including the IGF in WALRUS shows an improvement in modelling the variation in groundwater level over smaller time steps compared to the WALRUS model without IGF, the latter only showing a seasonal change in groundwater level. During validation, the model with the IGF relation retains a higher efficiency in modelling the average groundwater level in the Maurikse Wetering than the model without an IGF flux. The results with and without the incorporation of IGF into the model show that the IGF can contribute to significant improvements for conceptual hydrological models.","Hydrology; Intercatchment Groundwater Flow; IGF; Maurikse Wetering; Conceptual modelling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Water Management","","51.937448, 5.384485"

However, large software systems throw up a lot of roadblocks on the way, with complex and slow build processes impacting the developer's productivity to higher and higher degrees as the software system grows. To help developers stay productive, we need new, more powerful ways of assisting them during their activities.<br/><br/>In this thesis, we present our development cluster as a part of the solution to developing software at scale. The cluster provides a high-performance infrastructure that can be used by developers to build and deploy their applications during development. By moving these build and deploy processes to a cluster during development, we can benefit from more powerful computing resources which help developers work more effectively. We evaluate our development cluster in a number of different categories, comparing build speed, system startup and general developer workflows. Additionally, we evaluate how well our solution scales and what the impact on network load is for a company integrating with this system.<br/><br/>This move to cloud-based development brings along new challenges, but also many new possibilities in terms of tooling, developer collaboration and software engineering research.

The aim of this graduation project was to create a persuasive game design that teaches managers in an international context how to work with cultural differences. For this, the game makes use of the the cultural theoretical model that was created by Fons Trompenaars and the most extensive database on cultural values. Through interviews and context research was concluded that managers want to learn personalised and pragmatic knowledge in a quick time frame that can be easily translated to the business domain. The game should be played individually and in preparation before the cultural encounter. After a brainstorm and showing my initial ideas to possible end-users was concluded that a boat travel narrative was most accessible, and a playthrough was worked out. Multiple visual styles were explored for the design resulting in three visual concepts. These were evaluated on scalability and through paper prototype tests. The chosen concept was slightly altered to become the final concept. A minimum viable game (MVG) has been created based on the Italian culture that takes managers through a narrative in which they have to travel to an island. During the journey they receive tips about culture and on the island they have a simulated meeting with three Italians, each having a slightly different culture based off the Italian culture. This MVG has been evaluated with the target group within a limited scope to confirm that the firstly described goal of the game had been reached. Finally, the project closes with future recommendations for the game.","Persuasive Game Design; Culture; Business; Trompenaars Hampden-Turner; Serious Game; Interaction design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

In terms of production time FARbot outperforms all other robots in this research field. An earlier produced, non-monolithic prototype shows resonance at the desired eigenfrequency at which its stride length is amplified by a maximum factor of 22.74 for constant energy demand.

It is important for large oil companies like Shell to determine the position of wells with a certain degree of uncertainty. Therefore, the main objective of this thesis is to assess the uncertainty in the nal well position of MSA corrected survey data. Two methods are investigated in this thesis to determine the positional uncertainty; Multi-Station Analysis in combination with the Minimum Curvature Method and Multi-Station Analysis in combination with the Covariance analysis method. In addition to Multi-Station Analysis, a second method has been investigated to determine sensor errors estimates and their uncertainty, namely the probabilistic estimation from Weighted Least Squares method. The methods with their assumptions are discussed, whereby the Covariance analysis method is discussed in more detail. Thereafter, the methods are tested with various test trajectories. The test results are compared to subsequently draw conclusions. It is clear that Multi-Station Analysis is the most reliable method to estimate sensor errors with their uncertainty. However, it was striking when the azimuth angle is not xed but varies, that certain errors are very poor. In addition, it could be concluded that the choice to systematically or randomly consider positional uncertainty has a major in uence on the positional uncertainty that arises.

The vessel will be able to install monopiles for the offshore wind and oil and gas industry. The main objective of this thesis is: Making a model that is able to predict the motions of the vessel as well as the forces induced by the monopile on the vessel during the monopile installation process. First the most suitable upending technique has been chosen for the Stella Synergy. The upending of a monopile can be seen in figure 1. The different techniques are analysed in a multi criteria analysis. Upending with the gripper turned out to be the best choice. The gripper design has been chosen the same way. The two rotating arm gripper and linear four arm gripper score highest but have almost the same score, therefor one of these two grippers is advised. The hydrodynamic parameters of the vessel are obtained using AQWA, then a model of the vessel is made in Matlab to decide on the best location for the gripper with the least severe motions. The calculated RAOs are compared with the measured RAOs by Marin and are almost similar. When the crane hoisting curve is taken into account only two possible upending locations remain: x = 42m and x = 70m. Both locations are on the starboard side of the vessel. At the location x = 70m the motions are far less severe, so the dynamic forces will be less high. A disadvantage of this location is that only monopiles up to 100 m can be placed into the gripper without coming to close to the secondary crane. <br/>The forces on the crane and gripper during upending and the workability of upending have been examined using a model in Matlab, the upending process is split up in six phases. Because the monopile is partly under water during four of the six phases the wave forces, added mass and damping that act on the monopile are calculated using AQWA. The viscous damping is calculated using the drag coefficient of a cylinder. The dynamic forces are the biggest during phase 3, where the monopile is only submerged with a small part far away from the vessel. The static forces during phase 1 to 5 are really low, therefor the workability of upending in phase six is computed, the workability is 34.3%. The workability of the vessel while it is hoisting a monopile from a barge onto the gripper is investigated using a ten degree of freedom model. The natural frequencies of the model are calculated and compared with the RAO plots. The total workability for a hoisting cable length of 64m is 29.9% and for 80m is 27.9%. Increasing the offlead angle from one to two degrees will increase the workability to 44.0% for 80m and 36.7% for 64m. It is advised to look into increasing the maximum offlead angle of the crane.","Monopile Installation; Upending; Workability","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-07-19","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

(mentor); Scherp, L. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","Airline schedules are constantly being updated to deal with disruptions originating from crew absence, upstream delays, mechanical failures and other sources. A robust schedule is capable of dealing with- or absorbing negative effects of such unexpected events. Schedule robustness, accounted for proactively in the scheduling g phase, is extensively researched for the crew scheduling problem, but the subproblem of simulator-based crew training is neglected. Airlines periodically train cockpit crew members for legal licensing purposes (recurrent training) and crew conversion between fleets and ranks (conversion training). This operation involves up to thousands of working days for large airlines. Any disrupted training activity potentially impacts crew availability by means of missed due dates in case of recurrents or postponed employment in case of conversion. The vast cost and risk related to this problem has led to the development of a robust cockpit crew training schedule. First, an integrated Training Scheduling &amp; Assignment Model (TS&amp;AM) is developed to construct a training schedule. A Monte Carlo Simulation is then applied to generate disruption scenario’s, which are then solved using a rule-based recovery heuristic. The output of the recovery model is captured in features that translate into expected recovery cost, which are then used in a feedback loop. Two feedback variants are tested: (1) Proportional Feedback (PF) and (2) Neural Network (NN) feedback. The feature dependent expected recovery cost is then used in another cycle of the TS&amp;AM to output a robust training schedule. As a final step, the robust training schedule is tested using the same simulation evaluation framework. Experiments have shown that a 16.75 percent improvement on recovery cost or cost of crew unavailability due to missed due dates can be achieved by learning ways of introducing schedule robustness. The lowered recovery cost also translates to a 1.11 percent overall cheaper operation of the training schedule.","Robustness; Cockpit crew training; Neural Nework; Integrated; Monte Carlo simulation; Rule based recovery","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-07-16","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

The demand for reliable and economical design of offshore wind turbine foundations has driven the research for analysis of the structural behaviour under the combined action of loads and the study of the parameters that could influence it. The present master thesis deals with the dynamic analysis of the response of an offshore wind turbine monopile, one of the most common types of foundations, subjected to the application of hydrodynamic and earthquake loads. This study focuses on the understanding of the dynamic properties contributing to the dissipation of energy experienced by the structure. More specifically, the sources of damping leading to reduction of the structural vibration in time are investigated, of which the numerical determination is considerably uncertain, while emphasizing on the hydrodynamic and the soil damping. A numerical approach for the estimation of the hydrodynamic viscous damping is presented based on the calculation of the drag coefficient CD and its dependency on the Reynolds number (Re), the Keulegan-Carpenter number (KC) and the surface roughness (k/D). The drag coefficient, and accordingly the hydrodynamic viscous damping, are derived over the length of the monopile where the waves act, highlighting also the consequences of the changes in diameter and depth. Furthermore, the soil radiation damping due to the seismic waves is studied by including the interaction of the soil with the structure. Particularly, the supporting soil is modelled around the monopile with frequency-dependent springs and dampers to represent the soil stiffness and damping, respectively. The estimation of the soil coefficients is accomplished by integrating in the model of the structure, an advanced soil model developed by Dr. J. De Oliveira Barbosa, which gives the dynamic impedance function for the desired band of frequencies. The analysis of the structural response is executed by examining three load cases for the hydrodynamic and earthquake loads. The overall outcome reveals that a noticeable amount of energy is dissipated because of the presence of the soil radiation damping, drawing also the conclusion that the soil-structure interaction should be considered as frequency-dependent during earthquake. Despite the fact that the approach for the estimation of the hydrodynamic viscous damping constitutes a more precise method, its participation in the specific tested cases is limited to the total amount of damping.","Soil-Structure Interaction; soil damping; hydrodynamic damping; Earthquake; frequency-dependent","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

Overheating of piston is avoided with engine oil through spray cooling and gallery cooling processes. In this research project, evolution and disintegration of oil jet used for piston cooling by DAF Trucks N.V., is studied numerically using Large Eddy Simulation (LES) and Volume of Fluid (VOF) methodologies. A robust CFD model is built with major focus on the significance of grid resolution in multi-phase LES, and is used to reproduce two test cases. This is followed by characterization of physics involved in oil jet breakup through qualitative inspection. Parameters relevant to the two types of cooling techniques are estimated to see the impact of jet development at different flow rates. Based on the results obtained, the need for grid refinement is assessed and performed for certain cases. Finally, turbulent atmosphere within the crankcase is estimated through a separate simulation and its effect on oil jet is investigated. Results show that for oil in quiescent atmosphere jet turbulence is the dominant force and is the primary cause for disintegration. A clear transition to turbulence is captured with increase in flow rate, as the jet behavior is more and more chaotic with droplet formation and spreading. Importance of grid resolution on droplet capturing is recognized and an isolated analysis shows more droplets being captured with fine meshes. The level of refinement necessary to capture all the droplets still remains an open question. With turbulent atmosphere, no significant change in the jets is obtained until primary breakup and the inertial force of the liquid phase is found to dominate the surrounding flow effects. However, secondary breakup is found to be affected, as aerodynamic interactions increase disintegration and spreading, impacting both the cooling techniques. Results obtained from this research work will be used as primary inputs for further studies in the company on spray cooling and gallery cooling (sloshing flow) leading towards optimization of the piston cooling process.","CFD; LES; piston cooling; Oil jets; Jet breakup","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-07-01","","","","Aerospace Engineering | Aerodynamics and Wind Energy","",""

Single layer randomly placed armour units are widely used in breakwater designs as they are more economical due to the less volume requirement. But these single layer units have a much more “brittle” behaviour and strength of the units becomes a critical factor. As the stresses developed after the impact is difficult to measure directly in the scale models, currently percentage rocking is used as a design criterion. But a clear relationship between this quantity and breakage has not been identified. Even though the single layer armour unit types are widely used the knowledge on the rocking behaviour of this type of units are limited. Therefore, to get a better insight into the rocking behaviour of single layer armour units a previously proposed technique of instrumented unit with embedded sensor was adopted. This technique was found to be promising in detecting the rocking motion in standalone mode. However, one issue of that technique was relatively lower sampling frequency. Because of that, enough data could not be captured to resolve the rocking motion in time very accurately.<br/><br/>Therefore, in this report the measurements with standalone IMU sensor embedded in 3D printed model armour unit has been developed further. Firstly , different techniques were adopted to get the optimum sampling frequency and sampling frequency was increased from 25 Hz to 100 Hz.<br/><br/>This report includes further details on the processing method and obtained results after performing the 2D physical model testings. It is the first time that stand alone rocking motions are reported for single layer armour units. By increasing the sampling frequency from25 Hz to 100 Hz, rocking events can now be resolved in time by 5-10 measurements points. Gyroscope data and accelerometer data were combined to separate the linear acceleration from raw accelerometer data. Upward and downward rotational motions were distinguished, and impact velocities were calculated based on both accelerometer and gyroscope. By analyzing the data it was observed that the angle of rotation during the rocking event is small and usually unit returns to its original position after a full rotation.","Rocking; Single layer armour units; Instrumented units; Impact velocity; Rotation; translation; IMU","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-07-16","","","","Coastal and Marine Engineering and Management (CoMEM)","",""

The main idea of the semi-analytic solution is that a target illumination or a surface given in terms of Zernike polynomials can be solved analytically and expressed again in Zernike polynomials. The Zernike polynomials are set of complete and orthogonal polynomials that are already used in the field of optics to describe wavefronts of optical surfaces.

The results suggest that by following the correct design and governance strategies, platform firms can orchestrate a large network of complementors and proliferate a variety of complementary product offerings.","platform; Platform strategy; Platform Openness; Exclusivity; Boundary Resources","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-07-15","","","","","",""

Medical self-management by asthma patients will be of essential importance to keep the burden of disease as low as possible. <br/><br/>Medical self-management is critical in obtaining asthma control. Research suggests that the majority of patients can obtain asthma control, yet most adults are still living with uncontrolled asthma. Both extensive literature research and qualitative research with asthma patients and healthcare providers were executed to uncover what the barriers are that asthma patients face in medical asthma self-management. <br/><br/>The research uncovered three main problems that form barriers to efficient self-management.: beliefs, low motivation, and inability. Each of these problems has its underlying causes. Beliefs are caused by (1) paternalistic care, (2) lack of stimulation, (3) shortcomings in knowledge sources. Low motivation is the result of (1) paternalistic care, (2) lack of awareness, (3) discouragement due to inadequate tools. At last, inability is caused by (1) lack of knowledge, (2) lack of skills (3) lack of insight.<br/><br/>Several opportunity areas to enhance the self-management of asthma patients were discovered: (a) patient education, (b) self-tailoring, and (c) increasing competence.<br/><br/>Patient education can be enhanced by creating awareness and providing a better knowledge source through (1) personalization, (2) spreading knowledge. Enabling the patient to self-tailor can induce more active participation of the patient. Increasing the asthma patient’s competence can be done by (1) increasing self-knowledge (2) enabling action.<br/><br/>To overcome the barriers to self-management a design was proposed: vea. Vea consists of an app and a physical product. <br/><br/>The app enables the user to set goals and supports the user to achieve these goals. Through working on the goals, the app learns about the user and gets personalized. The physical device supports the app by measuring the air quality in the home of the user and gives feedback on this.<br/><br/>Key user benefits of the design are:<br/><br/>Personalization <br/>Vea is designed to match the patients’ needs. Through personalizing its approach and content, the app becomes relevant to the user.<br/><br/>Being in control<br/>The user is in charge of the goals they want to achieve. The app assists them by making the once invisible complaints and effects of self-management explicit.<br/><br/>Increased capability<br/>Vea provides structured tools that increase the capability of the user to self-manage their asthma. Through seamlessly collecting data and providing relevant feedback and tips, the user is motivated and capable of acting.<br/><br/>User evaluation demonstrated that the proposed design is undoubtedly promising. Both asthma patients and general practitioners indicated that the design could lead to increased insight, motivation, and enhanced competence of medical self-management.<br/><br/>The main limitation of this master thesis is, however, determining the long-term effect of the design. Although the design has shown to be promising, unfortunately, no statement can be made of the long-term effect of vea on the actual improvement of medical self-management. To be able to do so, the design should be further developed and tested in the long term. <br","Asthma; self-management; persinalization; Journey","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

This is an independent design and consultancy agency for healthcare. They designed this game as part of their ‘Met Elkaar Durven Doen’ toolbox, which they use in trainings and workshops. The Haga Hospital is the co-design partner of the game, and during the week of patient safety, a first version of this prototype was played by healthcare professionals of the Haga Hospital. The main aspect of the game are the question cards. These cards are divided into three themes: Patient Experience, Risk Management, and Culture and Behaviour. Within these themes, the players get knowledge based questions, questions to discuss, or small assignments. In a questionnaire done by MEDD in the Haga Hospital and through the reactions of the healthcare professionals that played the game, can be concluded that these three themes are themes that healthcare professionals would like to learn more about. The assignment within this project is to further develop the existing design and make it applicable to other hospitals and healthcare organisations. The Safety Game is meant to create awareness and a deeper knowledge an understanding of safety and quality within hospitals. To provide background to why this is necessary, a literature review and field research are done. From this research can be concluded that an open culture is important to manage risks in the hospital. Unfortunately, most hospitals have a blame culture, where healthcare professionals don’t correct each other or speak up in fear of the consequences. To change this blame culture into an open culture, the behaviour of the healthcare professionals needs to change. To make healthcare professionals aware of their type of culture and how to change this, a serious persuasive game can be used. To design this serious persuasive game, the Persuasive Game Design model is used. The research provided the insights to fill in the Real World Experience and the Gamification Design. From the research the goal was defined: Designing a meaningful, serious, persuasive game for healthcare professionals to gain lasting awareness on their behaviour regarding safety and how they influence their own safety and that of others. In the ideation phase, three concepts were developed. From these three, a concept was chosen that is based on the idea of an escape room idea. The final design consists of a small house that represents the hospital, a patient card, question cards in the earlier mentioned themes, a padlock to lock the hospital, three puzzles in the same themes as the question cards, and puzzle pieces. This design is tested in the Haga Hospital with healthcare professionals. The final design, the game ‘Cultuur rondom Veiligheid’, is proven to create awareness regarding culture and behaviour, and how this influences (patient) safety, thus reaching the design goal. The base of the final design can be used to be adjusted to fit other healthcare organisations or keep the game up to date by MEDD.","Healthcare; Serious Game; Persuasive Game Design; Medisign; safety; Safety Culture","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This is not straightforward, particularly when the number of them is small and their response can be unreliable.

Vertical structure elements, such as steel gates, are vulnerable to damage caused by impulsive wave impacts, potentially exposing the coastal zone to flooding and erosion. Existing formulas to determine impulsive loadings in engineering practice are limited to purely vertical structures. Research has shown that openings along the surface of structures relieve wave impact pressures, but there are currently no design methods available to quantify this pressure release. The stochastic nature of impulsive impacts and uncertain influence of air adds to the problem complexity. This study aims to investigate the influence of ventilations to reduce wave impact loadings on vertical structures with horizontal overhangs, applying a theoretical pressure-impulse approach and computational fluid dynamics. In this study, the pressure-impulse model is implemented for experimental cases in two and three dimensions using a finite difference numerical scheme and validated against semi-analytical solutions with high accuracy. Boundary conditions are modified to include and assess the influence of venting holes on the pressure-impulse contours. To achieve the largest efficiency in the reduction of pressure-impulses, rectangular ventilations are located at the critical corner between vertical wall and overhang and spaced across the structure width. Based on physical model dimensions, the open source CFD software OpenFOAM is also employed to simulate standing wave impacts on structures. Waves are generated in the CFD model using the waves2Foam toolbox, in conjunction with the OceanWave3D utility. Convergence of the CFD model is achieved by gradually refining the mesh near the wave impact region. Validation between simulated and experimental total wave forces on the vertical wall shows very good agreement for both overhang sizes considered. The distribution of first impact pressure-impulses along the vertical structure show similar trends among the pressure-impulse theory and CFD models. While large discrepancies are observed for predicted maximum pressure-impulses, the relative error of total impulse at wall between both models is low. From both CFD and pressure-impulse model results, empirical relations are derived between relative venting area and total impulse release. The assumption adopted in the theory of zero pressure-impulse at the venting position is not reproduced in CFD results, which leads to overestimation of the impact mitigation effects of ventilations using the pressure-impulse theory. This divergence in the venting boundary condition is possibly linked to the omission of convective acceleration terms in the pressure-impulse model. Two ventilation design methods for vertical structures with overhangs subject to wave impacts are proposed based on the research conducted in this study. The first design method employs the derived empirical relations, standing wave theories and theoretical pressure distributions to determine the total impulse affecting the structure. The second design method applies the splitting approach of measured impulsive forces with low-pass filters to calculate the total impulse, requiring numerical or physical modelling. Further research is needed to support the models with small and large scale experiments using ventilations and expand the validity range of the results.","wave impacts; pressure impulse; computational fluid dynamics; coastal structures","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Coastal and Marine Engineering and Management (CoMEM)","",""

(mentor); Luijendijk, A.P. (mentor); de Winter, Renske (mentor); Storms, J.E.A. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","Accelerated sea level rise (SLR) is predicted to have multiple adverse impacts on the coastal zone, aggravating phenomena such as coastal erosion on sandy coasts. For climate change adaptation planning and informing policy, morphodynamic changes occurring at coastlines are becoming increasingly important. In this study, a calibrated Delft3D model forced by real-time wave conditions, was applied to simulate and assess the morphological behaviour of the Delfland coast in response to accelerated SLR over a 30-year time period. The calibrated Delft3D model uses a novel acceleration technique called brute-force merged (BFM) proposed by Luijendijk et al. (2019), which enables the modelling of multi-decadal predictions, with significant gain in computational effort. An assumption of the study was that no nourishments take place, i.e. no additional sediment supply. The Sand Engine (Zand Motor in Dutch), currently located along this coast was also excluded from the model, thereby assuming a straight unnourished coastline. A selection of six SLR scenarios was simulated, including a no SLR scenario used as the reference case. The chosen scenarios covered the full bandwidth of accelerated SLR projections translated for the Dutch coast up to 2100, assuming increased mass loss from the Antarctic ice sheet, a hypothesis proposed by DeConto and Pollard (2016). These projections therefore exceed those presented in the IPCC AR5. Based on the recent literature, the SLR rates selected, ranging from 3 mm/year to 120 mm/year, are assumed plausible and useful for the modelling study. Model outputs that are assessed include erosion and sedimentation plots, and volume changes, particularly erosion volumes. Analysis shows that no major change to the general coastal system behaviour occurs due to accelerated SLR; erosive sections in the south remain erosive and accretive regions in the northern part remain accretive. This is influenced mainly by gradients in alongshore sediment transport and presence of structures. Erosion volumes increase with higher SLR rates, indicating an increase in erosion rate due to accelerated SLR. Volume changes were calculated in different alongshore sections and in different depth/elevation zones in the cross-shore direction in order to identify regions more vulnerable to accelerated SLR. It is determined that the southern section is most impacted by SLR causing increased erosion, particularly in the subtidal zone. Processes driving the observations and trends are discussed in the study. With significant SLR, dune erosion also occurs due to water levels and waves being able to reach higher elevations. The dunes along the Delfland coast are the primary sea defence which protects the hinterland from flooding, therefore it is critical to consider potential dune erosion due to accelerated SLR. Implications of the model study’s findings are briefly discussed, in the context of coastal maintenance policy and implementation of nourishments. Evaluating the added value of Delft3D as a coastal impact model is another objective of the study. Delft3D shows a number of benefits, including detailed analysis at multiple spatio-temporal scales. Another is the inclusion of transport processes in both alongshore and cross-shore directions, which is not the case for the Bruun Rule or 1-D coastline models. A limitation of Delft3D is that it does not include aeolian transport processes, and so dune growth cannot be simulated.","Sea level rise; Sandy coasts; Morphodynamics; Delft3D; Coastal erosion; Process-based modelling; Climate change; Sediment transport","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Coastal and Marine Engineering and Management (CoMEM)","","52.018516, 4.148583"

They include earthquakes, tsunamis, volcanic eruptions, and hurricanes. In this research the focus is on hurricane events and the impact they have on a community. The ability for a community to bounce back is defined by their disaster resilience which, in turn, depends on their ability to identify vulnerabilities and prepare for the inevitable. Within this line of research, one of the main challenges is defining local risk due to hurricane events, especially when considering more than one hurricane-induced hazard. Furthermore, the challenge becomes even greater when analysing risk in locations around the world where data availability is scarce. This study aims to clarify and improve the existing methodology to define multi-hazard risk due to hurricanes. This methodology is verified by applying it to the case study of St. Martin, in order to delineate hurricane risk on the island. St. Martin was chosen to investigate, as it is a Small Island Developing State in the Caribbean that recently suffered immeasurable damages during Hurricane Irma (September 2017), and is still struggling to recover. The two hazards that were considered, in the application of the methodology, were hurricane-induced winds and hurricane-induced coastal flooding. In the case of St. Martin, hurricane-induced winds were found to contribute to 98% of damages due to Hurricane Irma, when compared to the coastal flood damages. Coastal flooding was found to be due to both increased storm surge levels and wave-induced flooding, showing that neither one is negligible for a reef island like St. Martin. Storm surge variation around the island was found to be minimal due to the scale of the island, and the fact that storm surge was predominantly pressure driven. Validation of the models to simulate hazards and impact on St. Martin proved to be challenging. An unconventional data source was used to validate the flooding model, which included analysis of Twitter data of images posted during Hurricane Irma. This is an example of a solution of how to deal with data scarcity in hazard modelling. The risk assessment of St. Martin involved simulating synthetic hurricane track scenarios and determining their respective wind and flood damages on the island. Combining the respective damages was done by including a damage threshold to ensure combined damages did not exceed 100%. The applied framework resulted in a hurricane risk map of St. Martin indicating Expected Annual Damages per community. The intention of the improved methodology is to apply it to a hurricane risk prone region, like St. Martin, and to use the outcome to delineate hurricane risk. This indicates hot-spots in the region of interest and improvements to disaster resilience can be discussed. The approach of Build Back Better is highlighted in this research to show how this risk map can be interpreted and what the results mean. Three branches are discussed, namely building back stronger, which involves ensuring infrastructure can resist more extreme events in the future.","Multi-Hazard; Hurricane Risk; Hurricane-induced wind; Hurricane-induced coastal flooding; Data scarce regions; Disaster resilience; Saint Martin; Sint Maarten; St. Martin; Risk methodology; Flood Risk; Wind Risk","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","",""

One way to monitor the distribution network is by state estimation. Although previously this method was established only for the transmission networks, its use has begun to also make sense for the distribution networks, due to the increased availability of smart meters. Typically, state estimation is a non-linear iterative procedure. Research aims to overcome this problem, by creating a non-iterative procedure. To achieve this, linearity of measurement function is a necessity. Although linearity is always desired, the measurement inputs or the procedure renders the state estimation problem difficult to formulate it in a linear fashion. The scope of this thesis is to create a linear state estimation algorithm for the distribution network. To achieve linearity, a reformulation of the states for the state estimation was used at this thesis. This reformulation created a linear optimization problem, which is easier and faster to be solved (Weighted Least Squared method). Since the measurements are not enough to provide full observability, based on these methods, additional assumptions were made. As an alternative to the primary method used for the state estimation, another optimization method was used, which is called Least Absolute Value. This method will be based on the same inputs as the previous method, but different optimization goal. The goal was to compare the two methods and find each one’s limitations. Measurements used for this thesis were provided tracked and provided by DEPsys S.A., by their main module, called GridEye. GridEye devices are synchronized SCADA-type devices, installed on cabinets of the distribution grid, based on the DSO needs. All measurements provided were from real networks within Switzerland. The smart meter device data were provided by collaborative projects of DEPsys S.A.. Smart meter devices were installed in different low-voltage consumers. Both methods were implemented correctly and were compared. Based on the results, it was obvious that the Weighted Least Square outperformed the Least Absolute Value method, in the absence of bad data. Moreover, the effect of the number of GridEye metering devices on the State Estimation was compared. While numerically and visually the outputs are comparable, the effect of having multiple devices is still important for different scenarios. Finally, bad data cases were examined for both methods under different types of errors for the smart meter devices. The smart meter devices were manually introduced to bad data, to understand the algorithm’s capabilities and limitations. An additional algorithm, in addition to the state estimation one, was implemented to not only detect and identify the location of the bad data occurrence but to correct the bad data inserted.","State Estimation; Distribution Grid; weighted least square; Least absolute value; GridEye; Smart meters","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-12-31","","","","","",""

Computational models are usually subjected to linear and rotational inputs to simulate shaking scenarios. In existing studies, the head’s rotation center is kept fixed over time during shaking. However, the infant’s head is unlikely to rotate around a fixed pivoting point in real life due to the flexibility of the infant’s neck and the external imposed shaking motion by the perpetrator. It is currently unknown how the location of the rotation center changes over time and how this manifests itself in the expression of the injury mechanisms associated with IHI-ST.<br/>In this study, the variation of the rotation center of an infant’s head during shaking and its potential effect on injury mechanisms were analyzed. First, dynamics of the infant’s head were obtained in shaking experiments with an infant surrogate. Next, the variation of the rotation center was calculated and relations between characteristics of the participants and shaking variables were analyzed.<br/>Key findings: during shaking the location of the head’s rotation center varied in both anterior-posterior and vertical direction with respect to the head, causing the head’s radius of curvature to vary six orders of magnitude. Therefore, head-dynamics and injury mechanisms underlying IHI-ST are possibly simulated incorrectly when using a fixed rotation center. It remains unclear how this affects the validity of IHI-ST injury risk assessments and the injury thresholds on which these assessments are based. Future research should therefore evaluate the performance of head-dynamic simulations regarding IHI-ST.<br/><br/>Part II:<br/>Computational model simulations are extensively used to analyze inflicted head injury by shaking trauma in infants (IHI-ST). Infant head models are usually excited by dynamic inputs, which are applied to a specific point with respect to the head. In existing studies the load application point is assumed to be fixed over time; thereby neglecting spatiotemporal variation of the rotation center during shaking. Therefore, this assumption may be inappropriate, because the location of the heads’ rotation center is in fact not constant over time during shaking. It is unknown to what extent head dynamics are correctly simulated when using a fixed rotation center, hence simulation results regarding injury thresholds and shaking trauma assessment could be invalid.<br/>In this study, loading-methods used in IHI-ST simulations were evaluated for their temporal accuracy in replicating external head-dynamics. First, a mathematical model incorporating spatiotemporal variation of the head’s rotation center was proposed. Secondly, head dynamics were calculated using the proposed mathematical model and existing model-loading methods. Finally, the calculated head dynamics were compared to a reference dataset.<br/>Key findings: in all of the 29 cases from the reference dataset, implementation of a time-varying load application point resulted in an improved temporal replication of shaking dynamics compared to existing model-loading methods. Accelerations of the head in x- and z-direction had a two and four times smaller absolute error over a typical shake cycle than any previously existing finite element model (FEM) for IHI-ST. It remains unclear how implementation of a time-varying load application point affects the dynamics of fluids and tissues inside the skull. Future research should therefore focus on re-evaluating the results of IHI-ST assessment studies and injury threshold studies employing FEM head-models.<br","Closed head injuries; Child abuse; Biomechanics; Forensic pathology; Finite element models","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-07-18","","","","Biomedical Engineering | Medical Instruments and Medical Safety (MIMS)","",""

To act, rather than react, nature-based solutions (NBS) involving vegetation and wetlands are being explored on top of conventional solutions like dikes. WHY? There was a dire need for global study quantifying the potential of vegetation in reducing flood risk and eventually make a decision support tool which enables quick assessments about flood risk reduction in a vegetated hydrodynamic system. WHAT? The developed tool can predict flood risk anywhere in the world without rigorous modeling through user defined conditionalization of in-situ hydrodynamic or vegetation characteristics. HOW? Multivariate dependence among parameters of schematized system can exhibit characteristics of vegetated hydrodynamics. To ensure global representation of vegetated hydrodynamics a copula-based multivariate stochastic model has been developed which caters global ranges of each parameter, their probability distributions and the inter-parameter dependencies through ranked correlations. Numerical modeling has been carried out through XBeach non-hydrostatic model by resolving full spectrum of high and low frequency waves. A non-parametric Bayesian network-based flood risk prediction tool has been developed from the synthetic dataset developed from the simulations. SO? Bulk results conclude that saltmarshes attenuates waves by 87% and mangroves by 94% as a mean value. Wave attenuation, flood risk reduction and wave run-up manifests maximum dependence on offshore wave height, water depth, drag coefficient, vegetation height, frontal width, and forest length and least on offshore slope and vegetation density. NOW? The flood risk prediction tool would help decision makers in implementing NBS, in making better informed decisions about early warnings and policy making related to flood risk reduction and climate change adaptation by incorporating vegetation. NOVELTY? To the author's knowledge no such study exists which captures natural variability of hydrodynamics and vegetation together in a probabilistic model over global scales. Additionally, no such study exist which applies non-parametric Bayesian networks to predict flood risk. The dependence modeling of global vegetated hydrodynamic environments is also unique which skims out the most critical parameters.","Flood Risk; Disaster risk reduction; Climate Change; Nature-based flood defences; Building with Nature; Vegetation; Hydrodynamics; Infragravity waves; XBeach Non-hydrostatic; Non-Parametric Bayesian network; UNINET; Decision Support Systems","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-07-15","","","","Coastal and Marine Engineering and Management (CoMEM)","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","The majority of cardiovascular clinical events, which are the main causes of mortality and morbidity worldwide, are caused by atherosclerotic plaque rupture. This biomechanical event occurs when the local plaque stresses exceed its strength. The plaque stresses can be assessed by computational models to predict these events. Current approaches to obtaining the plaque material stiffness properties that these models require as input have large computational costs and are therefore far from being implemented for clinical use. This study aims to develop, validate, and apply for the first time, an approach to obtaining the material stiffness properties of atherosclerotic plaque tissue much faster by employing the virtual fields method (VFM). With this method, the virtual work principle is employed with boundary problem specific, kinematically admissible virtual fields to solve energy balance equations for the material stiffness parameters that are of interest. In this study a method is presented for obtaining the virtual fields for the specific application of intraluminally pressurised atherosclerotic plaque tissue. For the purpose of validation, full field displacement maps were computed at 100 mmHg using Finite Element (FE) models based on histological slides of atherosclerotic plaque tissue. To mimic a realistic situation, the resolution and noise levels of a clinical and high frequency ultrasound scanner were used. Although higher resolution deformation maps with smaller noise levels were shown to provide more accurate results, the VFM-based technique demonstrated good performance for both the high frequency and clinical ultrasound scanner settings tested. VFM was also used in a single case study to estimate the c<sub>1</sub> material parameter for a Neo-Hookean incompressible material model in the case of an atherosclerotic human coronary artery. The estimated c<sub>1</sub>-values for this case were: 21.5 kPa for diseased intima, 13.3 kPa for lipid, and 23.6 kPa for wall tissue. These values were in good agreement with the reported values from literature. In this study, VFM was applied successfully for the material characterization of atherosclerotic plaques for the first time. It is more attractive than current approaches as it is computationally less expensive and has a great potential to be extended for material characterization of even more plaque components than employed in the current study.","Atheroslcerosis; Virtual Fields Method; Material properties; Mechanical characterization; Ultrasound","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-07-18","","","","","",""

(graduation committee); van Telgen, Michael (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","An organized process is necessary to ensure that the building is built on time and within budget. This does not always go well however and four major difficulties can arise. One of the current solutions is performing variant studies. Designing variants is costly however, which limits the amount of analysed variants. The focus is set on improving this process, which will indirectly affect the four named issues. The advantages of structural parametric design (SPD) have the potential to increase the amount and complexity of variants. However, the disadvantage of large structures is the uncountable amount of possible calculations and parameters. Current SPD-tools have the same functionality in general, but differ in key ways which influences the choice for a tool. These mostly focus on some form of optimisation. This research however, focuses on generating options. The connection between a visual programming software (Dynamo) and FEA software (RFEM) named the DRC is chosen to achieve this. Attempting every possibility for the support structure is difficult. A method is therefore proposed called the ""translation by component method"" (TC-method), which gives the ability to more easily modify parametric models. This made it possible to divide the problem over several smaller scripts, called variants. Each variant is able to produce models, called options, which provide information about the critical load combination, the type of failure and the unity checks for most eurocode demands. The structural engineer can learn from each variant and apply this knowledge on subsequent variants. The engineer’s creativity is thus used to limit the amount of parameters and calculations. This process directs the engineer towards a solution. Options provide information for the architect as well, namely: the geometry of the support structure, the optimized cross sections and the costs of the option. The architect can use this information to weigh options against each other to fulfil the demands of the SoR as well as possible. This process is named optioneering. After the first variant was created, nine variants and 35 options were generated, analysed and reported within two weeks. Optimized options were obtained within 15 to 30 minutes. By learning from previous variants, it was possible to find a support structure which barely modifies the aesthetics of the structure. The options obtained during this process mostly have unique advantages and disadvantages which can be compared by the architect. A recommendation and summary is given for these results. The applied method for the DRC enhanced the process of the variant study by increasing the amount and complexity of variants. More information can be obtained and by learning from previous variants more informed decisions can be made for subsequent variants by the structural engineer. The architect has more freedom to choose the placement of structural elements and information of costs is earlier available. This can be used to better implement the demands of the SoR. The architect can take costs earlier into account as well which can be used to better estimate the costs-appreciation ratio of a certain choice.","Structural parametric design; Preliminary design; parametric design; Dynamo; RFEM; Variant study; buildings; Architect; structural engineering","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering | Structural Mechanics","",""

Works have been done to stack two wafers with superconductive interconnections as a demonstration for feasibility of 3-D qubit integration.But all of them use an extra layer of adhesives, indium in particular, to join two neighboring planes.Indium is a good choice of adhesive for wafer bonding at cryogenic temperature. However, there are potential issues to employ this extra layer of adhesive. First, the critical temperature (Tc) of indium being 3.4K means it is suitable preferably for superconducting qubits, but not good enough for qubit implementations or other cryogenic that have above-4K expectations. Second, one general problem in wafer bonding is that alignment is not accurate. Adding an extra layer of anything increases the degree of misalignment. In this work, the extra adhesive layer is abandoned and two wafers are bonded by direct-bonding technique. First, niobium nitride (NbN) is chosen to be the skeleton for this 3-D structure due to its high Tc (18K) as well as its simple composition hence easy fabrication. Sputtering is the method used to fabricate such metal nitride. Sample with Tc=15.6K has been measured so far. Second, both wafer-scale and miniaturized pattern are designed to measure contact resistance of direct bonding of NbN films in room and cryogenic temperature. This work shows the potential of direct-wafer bonding in 3-D chip integration at cryogenic environment, and could further lead to scaling up of quantum processors.","direct bonding; contact resistance; superconducting film","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-07-02","","","","Electrical Engineering | Microelectronics","",""

(mentor); Dachwald, Bernd (mentor); Ohndorf, Andreas (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","With all major bodies within the Solar System explored by at least a single fly-by, modern-day missions are becoming increasingly more demanding, up to a point where classical chemical propulsion can no longer supply the required ∆V. Increasingly more is relied upon low-thrust propulsion, characterised by its (very) low thrust force; long continuous thrust arcs, often lasting months at a time; and high specific impulse. To even further increase the possible ∆V budget, thereby allowing more intricate missions, more payload, or a lower transfer time; use is made of low-thrust propulsion combined with gravity assists. <br/><br/>With traditional low-thrust gravity assist optimisation tools heavily relying on astrodynamics and optimal control theory expertise, often requiring an initial guess and heavy modification for each new mission scenario; there is a need for a smart low-thrust gravity assist trajectory optimisation tool. Such a tool should be independent from an initial guess, optimise a trajectory from only a broad description of the mission, and be applicable to a wide variety of mission scenarios.<br/><br/>It was the goal of this thesis to develop such a smart low-thrust gravity assist trajectory optimisation tool, which was found in extending the global low-thrust optimisation software package InTrance. InTrance tackles the problem from the novel perspective of artificial intelligence and machine learning using a method termed evolutionary neurocontrol (ENC), which combines biologically inspired artificial neural networks (ANNs) with evolutionary algorithms (EAs). The internal parameters of the ANN and initial conditions of each phase are optimised by the EA, which then serves as an agent; supplying the spacecraft with a steering strategy at each integration step. <br/><br/>A novel tool capable of optimising the low-thrust gravity assist problem has been developed and has been shown to find more optimal results than available reference trajectories in select cases. Two prominent low-thrust gravity assist missions have been re-optimised: a double-asteroid rendezvous mission with an intermediate Mars gravity assist similar to the Dawn mission, and a low-thrust version of the New Horizons mission to Pluto with an intermediate Jupiter gravity assist. InTrance found a low-thrust New Horizons like trajectory which used 41% less propellant for a similar flight time as the actual mission, even though having a higher drymass and being launched with a lower C3. The results of the Dawn re-optimisation showed excellent agreement with the actual Dawn mission in terms of flight and dwell times, and used significantly less propellant. The efficiency increase due to the inclusion of the gravity assists has furthermore been investigated. The gravity assist at Jupiter in the New Horizons trajectory resulted in a decrease of 3.5% in flight time and over 75% in propellant saving. Dawn’s mission could be flown without a gravity assist w.r.t flight time and propellant usage, however, the inclusion resulted in an increase of 20% in dwell time at Vesta.<br","Low-thrust; trajectory optimisation; Reinforcement Learning; neurocontrol; neuroevolution; gravity assist","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Interactions between failure mechanisms can take place in this part of the levee failure process. An interaction refers to one failure mechanism influencing the probability of another failure mechanism, where positive interaction is defined as a reduction and a negative interaction as an increase of the failure probability. The main problem is a lack of knowledge about the interactions of failure mechanisms and their influence on the failure probabilities of levees. Several studies (Calle, 2002; ’t Hart et al., 2016; Kok et al., 2017) suggest that there is an interaction between different failure mechanisms. However, only the effects of overtopping on slope instability (de Visser et al., 2018) and a reduction of the shear strength in slope instability due to uplift (Kanning and van der Krogt, 2016) is currently included in the statutory assessments of levees (Rijkswaterstaat WVL, 2017a,d). This research aims to quantify the influence of the interaction between the failure mechanisms backward erosion piping (BEP) and slope instability (SI) on the safety of a levee. The parametric study of this research assesses whether the occurrence of a failure mechanism (BEP or SI) affects the parameters' present states in the limit state functions of the other failure mechanism. A model was created to calculate this interaction between SI with BEP. After a slope instability, the remaining profile is assumed to contain a berm. This change in levee profile, does not result in the immediate breaching of the levee, it can however influence the probability of BEP. The model sequentially executes a stability analysis, a displacement analysis of the sliding plane and a BEP analysis. The degree of interaction is defined as the difference between the safety factor of BEP of the original profile (prior to sliding) and the safety factor of BEP of the remaining profile (after sliding). The modelling study shows that the degree of interaction from SI to BEP is significantly affected by the presence of cracks in the berm. A consequence of these cracks is that the exit point moves and is now located in the berm. The degree of interaction also depends on the shape and size of the sliding plane, because it determines the size of the berm of the remaining profile. A vast majority (50\% to over 75\%) of the considered scenarios of the seven considered levee profile cases result in a positive interaction. However, in all the considered cases, negative interactions were found that give a reduction of 50\% to 2\% on the original safety factor, which could lead to an overestimation of the safety in the assessment of the levee. All of these negative interactions result from the assumption that large cracks can form in the soil after sliding.","Interaction; dikes; dike assessment; levees; Levee; backward erosion piping; slope instability; slope stability; Piping; uplift; heave; Residual strength","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering | Hydraulic Structures and Flood Risk","",""

The first step was conducting a literature review, in order to identify knowledge gaps. It was found that current design methods do not take the freeboard of the crown wall into account when calculating the vertical force acting on it. Recent research has established that when the freeboard is increased, this force is reduced while the portion of the crown wall base that is wet is reduced as well. However, there have been different approaches to increasing the base freeboard, that could lead to different effects on the loading. Moreover, parametric investigations regarding the vertical force have been very limited. Furthermore, the current design formulas assume that the maximum horizontal and vertical forces occur simultaneously but research suggests that there is a time lag between the two.<br/>Based on these knowledge gaps, the study goals were defined. In order to achieve these goals numerical model simulations were prepared and ran, where the freeboard was varied with two different approaches, as well as simulations with varied breakwater slope. The selected CFD numerical model is OpenFOAM® making use of the waves2Foam toolbox, implementing the volume of fluid (VOF) method. <br/>It is found that the currently used empirical methods fail to predict the changes in loading for increasing freeboard. For an increasing base freeboard, less part of the base becomes wet and that the vertical force, as well as the critical weight are reduced. On the other hand, the horizontal force increased. It is concluded that when increasing the base freeboard by means of lowering the water level results in lower loading compared to an increase of freeboard by elevating the crown wall element. Additionally, for the latter approach, a larger portion of the base slab is wet. Also, it was confirmed that a recently proposed reduction coefficient by (Bekker et al., 2018) for calculating uplift pressures can provides more accurate results in the case of freeboard increase.<br/>Examining the uplift pressure distributions, it was found that for a zero base freeboard the pressure distribution follows an S-shaped profile, which with increasing base freeboard reverses. The peak pressure is located slightly inwards instead of the seaward end of the base, followed by a reverse peak. In order to propose a generally applicable profile shape more data are required.<br/>The results indicated the presence of a time lag between the maximum horizontal and vertical forces. This time lag results in lower critical loading on the structure than when assuming simultaneous maxima. Nonetheless, further research is necessary, as these findings are a result of only one wave condition.<br/>A finding which contradicts the predictions made with empirical methods is that gentler breakwater slopes resulted in higher loading. This is considered to be a result of an increased internal set-up for gentler slopes.<br/>Further research is recommended, especially on tests with varying wave conditions and geometries, which should make these conclusions more generally applicable.","crown wall stability; crown wall loading; uplift pressure; freeboard; time lag; phase lag; numerical modelling; CFD; VOF; waves2FOAM; OpenFOAM; wave impacts","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Coastal and Marine Engineering and Management (CoMEM)","",""

Submerged Floating Tunnels (SFT) have been recently emerging as a cost-effective feasible crossing technique to connect fjords in Norway. However, only very little research has addressed the vehicle-structure interaction, with attention to the passengers, so far. In the current thesis, an algorithm was developed to study the Fluid-Structure-Vehicle-Interaction (FSVI), where the tunnel has been modelled as a Euler Bernoulli beam, the train car as a 6DOFs system, the supporting cables as linear springs, and the fluid by the Morison's hydrodynamic force expression. The Sperling ride quality and comfort indices were used to address human comfort while crossing the tunnel. It is found that, due to the low-frequency hydrodynamic environment, the influence of the FSVI on the Sperling's indices is limited, i.e. ""just noticeable"" from the classification table. Low-frequency flow field may cause motion sickness rather than cause comfort/discomfort during the ride. The illness rating, which is the indicator of the motion sickness, gave positive outcomes due to the small amplitude of the accelerations, and therefore no illness is expected to be felt by passengers. This study shows that displacement and acceleration can be controlled and kept inside the proposed boundaries under storm sea states, and the comfort while crossing can be guaranteed. The approach here used can be applied to other sea states with higher frequency content to address the comfort in a storm with smaller return period, which may also be important to address the fatigue resistance of the structure.","Dynamics; SFT; FSVI; Comfort Assessment; Sperling Index; Motion Sickness","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","Submerged Floating Tunnel",""

The first part covers the research into the current situation of waste collection, including the specifics of how waste is collected in the city, the policy of the municipality and the factors that drive the recycling behaviour of people in general. The second part is about finding an ideal future scenario for the city, which can be compared to the current situation to find the factors that a design can improve. This part begins with a definition for the ideal scenario which is as follows: ‘In the ideal scenario, the amount of material from the waste stream that is being reused in the production of new consumer goods is as high as possible’. Next, this part shows the results from researches into the context of a new high-rise district in Rotterdam, followed by an analysis of how the waste collection is more successfully managed in other cities around the world, and on current and future technologies by which the recyclable wastes are sorted. The research part is concluded in a set of considerations for the municipality of Rotterdam to approach becoming a more circular city, and these considerations are used as design principles for the following design phase. The design part of the report shows how the design was approached, starting from a map of the different stakeholder concerns over the multiple stages of the context of waste collection. It was followed by ideation and the formation of concept directions. After some iteration, the concept directions culminated in a final concept, which is the Re-Posit system. The Re-Posit system aims to increase the convenience of separating and disposing of recyclable waste from the moment that a person starts living in one of Rotterdam’s new high-rises. It does this by offering the residents a space to collect their waste separately inside their own homes, as well as a system that takes most of their waste through one single receptacle and sorts the waste into the right containers automatically. Additionally, it includes the provision of all the information that the residents need to participate in the recycling efforts, as well as enabling the municipality to offer feedback and/or other incentives for the recycling behaviour. The design showcase starts with an overview of the Re- Posit system, and shows its daily use by the residents. The next parts goes into the different parts of the system in detail, and shows the considerations that were made during their design. The final part of the report discusses topics such as how the system relates to the current and future context, how it can be managed and paid for, and an evaluation that was done to verify the desirability of the system.","Recycling; waste management; Concept Design; High-rise buildings","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We considered a methodology to be more accurate if its success rate is greater than that of a baseline or random guess. We considered a methodology to be consistently more accurate if the average of the success rates over a specified number of runs, say one hundred, is greater than that of a baseline or random guess. As a result, we discovered that the analysis of news, though readily available with modern day technological advancements, does come paired with some problems. 1. The widespread availability of news has made it more difficult to find that news which is of importance to us, news can cover anything and everything. 2. The content of news can discuss events happening anywhere from far past to the far future, making consistent analysis difficult. 3. Most financial news sources tend to block any mass datamining attempts. These problems can mostly be solved by making use of so-called 8-K reports. These reports only cover major events of companies sorted into nine different categories. The 8-K reports reduce the time interval the news impacts from the far past and far future to an interval of five business days, as the reports ought to be published within four business days. Finally, since companies are obligated to publish these reports by the U.S. securities and exchange commission, the reports are readily available and easily accessible through the U.S. securities and exchange commission website. We can then use these texts and analyze them using a rule-based or automatic text analysis approach. However, the rule-based text approach, using lists of positive and negative words for the analysis, tends to be unreliable as text contains a plethora of challenging cases. This problem is solved by using an automatic text analysis, using predetermined scores for texts. The form of automatic text analysis used, is a decision tree approach. Though single decision trees we construct have the characteristic to over-fit, we can construct random forests of decision trees on subsets of our input data to solve this problem. For our analysis we looked at the stocks prices of Tesla, Microsoft, EA and Amazon, due to their varying values. We gave scores to the texts of the 8-K reports using the stock price movement of the day of publishing. We did this for up to 4 business days prior to publishing as well. We also compensated for the market movements using the variable for days zero to four. We gave scores from -1, 0 or 1 dependent on the price movement. This generally resulted in success rates greater than our considered baseline of 33.33% of random guessing.

Thus, electrical sustainable energy is an ever growing field. Investigations into performance improvements and extraction of maximum benefits from Renewable Energy Sources (RES) is the need of the hour. In particular, wind power contributes to a significant share of renewable electricity generation and has seen great leaps in terms of implemented technologies. The advancements in wind turbine technology have introduced converter based generation, thereby affecting the electrical grid's inertia and short circuit current contributions. These short circuit contributions have been of particular interest for protection engineers in the development of protection systems worldwide. TenneT, which is the TSO of the Netherlands, faces the challenge regarding the protection scheme implementation for their upcoming offshore wind farm connections involving Type 4 Wind Turbines (WT). The lower magnitudes of current flow, post fault and the presence of balanced currents irrespective of the type of fault are some of the major challenges. The system starting from the busbar (where WTs are connected) is owned by the system operator and the WT along with the cable connecting to the busbar, or the Point of Common Coupling (PCC) is an asset of the Wind Park Operator (WPO). Non-technical issues such as the ownership of components at the point of common coupling between the wind park operators and the system operators together along with the technical challenges described earlier necessitates the development of a standard protection scheme that provides satisfactory performance. Implementation of end-to-end connection protection system for the individual component protection is also challenging considering the challenges associated with the ownership of the assets. Therefore , it is necessary to analyse the performance of conventional protection systems (single unit operation). The performance of definite time overcurrent, directional overcurrent, under voltage and distance protection have been studied for faults on PCC and the infeed WPO strings. The study aims at finding the right choice of primary and back up protections that are independent of the type of short circuit currents available by the generation technologies. In addition, the research aims to develop a new busbar protection scheme that can detect and identify the fault location with the challenges explained before. Following the undesirable behaviour observed with overcurrent and directional overcurrent protection system the author then proposes two new schemes using conventional protection systems. The considerations regarding successful operation of under voltage protection and distance protection are further addressed. Finally, a new scheme involving fault generated travelling waves to detect fault on the network is extensively tested. All the protection systems are then compared to describe their merits and demerits to make a decision about the primary and backup protection implemented.","protection; windfarms; type 4","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-07-17","","","","Electrical Engineering | Electrical Power Engineering","",""

Climate-change-driven sea level rise, coral reef decay and changes in (storm) wave climate will lead to greater chance and impacts of wave-driven flooding, posing a heavy threat to these coastal communities. Early warning systems (EWS) are effective for risk management and disaster reduction, however, the vast majority of the world's inhabitants of coral reef-lined coasts have no such system in place. Unfortunately, the complex hydrodynamics and bathymetry of reef-lined coasts make it difficult to establish a global flood prediction model for these areas. This thesis aims to develop a set of 'cluster profiles' that can be used to accurately represent coral reef-lined coasts around the globe. By representing an expansive variety of reef morphology, the cluster profiles are capable of predicting the wave runup over thousands of different coral reef profiles with a fraction of the number. The cluster profiles could be input into a tool such as a Bayesian probabilistic network which can be trained to provide real-time wave runup and flooding predictions given local bathymetry and offshore wave conditions, thus establishing a simplified global flooding EWS. The methodology includes two stages of data reduction. First, cluster analysis techniques are used to group thousands of coral reef profiles into 500 clusters based on morphology alone. Second, agglomerative hierarchical clustering is used to further group the profiles with similar morphology and wave runup response, resulting in a final set of 311 to 45 cluster profiles.

(mentor); Lathouwers, D. (graduation committee); Perko, Z. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","Purpose/Objective: The aim of the thesis project is to design and build a sample-holder that is suited for radiobiological experiments on cell and tissue level in Holland PTC. In order to create accurate dose plans for radiobiological experiments, dosimetry and range calculations need to be worked out. Finally the sample-holder is used for the first radiobiological experiment at Holland PTC. Materials and Methods: The sample-holder is constructed as a slab phantom that allows secure and easy positioning of a 6-well cultivating plate, fully made out of polystyrene. Water equivalent thickness (WET) measurements are used to calculate the density of the slabs, which can be used for dose calculations in treatment planning and Monte Carlo software. Radiochromic EBT3 film is used to perform dosimetry during experiments, the films are calibrated using an ionization chamber to be able to perform absolute dosimetry. A 70 MeV single pencil beam is delivered to the sample-holder with EBT3 films in between the slabs to compare a reconstructed Bragg peak from the relative doses of the films with dose calculations performed in RayStation and TOPAS MC. Cell survival experiments with U2OS cells are performed by irradiating with X-rays and protons. Circumstances where such that the influence of cells being on room temperature for several hours and cells being without medium inside the wells during irradiation could be studied. With protons, cells were irradiated both in the plateau region and in the Bragg peak. LETd calculations are performed in TOPAS MC in order to study the RBE-LET relation. Results: The slabs of the phantom are uniform and have a density of either 1.04 g/cm3 or 1.06 g/cm3 Using these density values the range of a 70 MeV can be calculated with a 0.5 mm accuracy using TOPAS MC and RayStation. The relative central axis dose profile calculated with TOPAS was accurate within 5% compared to the measured values with EBT3 film. This was 20\% for calculations with RayStation. Absolute dose measurements with EBT3 film inside a RW3 phantom agree within 1\% with the delivered dose according to the ionization chamber. In the polystyrene sample-holder this difference is 11%. For X-ray irradiation, incubated cells were able to form more colonies after irradiation compared to cells that had been on room temperature for four hours. Cells that were irradiated without medium in the well had a higher surviving fraction than cells that had medium in the well. For proton irradiation the results are limited since all cells that received more than 0.91 Gy had died, but from the available data it can be seen that irradiation in the Bragg peak results in more cell death compared to irradiation in the plateau region. In addition to this, cells that had medium in the wells during irradiation formed less colonies than cells that had no medium in the wells, which is consistent with the results after X-ray irradiation. Dose-averaged LET (LET_d) values are calculated at cell depth for proton irradiation in the plateau region and in the Bragg peak and are 1.30 keV/um and 3.78 keV/um respectively. Conclusion: The sample-holder is well defined for use in RayStation and TOPAS MC and range calculations of a 70 MeV pencil beam are accurate within 0.5 mm. Absolute dose values obtained with EBT3 film inside the sample-holder are higher than expected, additional measurements are recommended. Cell survival experiments show that there is a difference in irradiating cells that are in medium vs cells that are not in medium and that long exposure to room temperature increases cell death after irradiation. Radiobiological experiments should be performed with cells that can be prepared and stored on site. The obtained LETd values are comparable with values found in literature. Due to the limited amount of cell survival data after proton irradiation, not link between RBE and LET can be studied.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-07-17","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

The risk of complications for the patient is high and simulation-based training is therefore preferred. However, surgical training in cadavers and virtual reality is not satisfactory. A phantom is a model of organs or tissues consisting of tissue mimicking materials. Anthropomorphic phantoms could solve most of the issues related to VR or cadaveric models and could be used for neurosurgical planning, education and training purposes. For this master thesis, it was chosen to focus on one specific type of surgery, namely endoscopic endonasal neurosurgery. The goal of this study was to find out if an anthropomorphic head phantom could improve endoscopic endonasal neurosurgical planning, education and training. This research project is partly initiated by Philips, as they benefit from a head phantom for two different research projects concerning neuronavigation systems. By reviewing relevant literature and attending an endoscopic endonasal surgery, important anatomy is selected for the design of the head phantom. Also, different phantom characteristics described in literature were reviewed in order to select the correct materials and methods for the production of the head phantom. A head phantom is created from a high-quality CT scan of an anonymous female adult. 3D slicer is used to segment a patient-specific model consisting of three parts, namely the skull, brain and face. In order to segment all structures correctly, a radiologist helped with inspecting the scan. The head phantom is produced in three parts: the skull, the brain and the face. The skull phantom is 3D printed using an Ultimaker 3. It is made of PLA with calcium for the bone parts and MP Flex for the cartilage parts. A mould is 3D printed for the brain phantom using an Ultimaker 2. The brain phantom itself is made of water and coolant with 6 wt% PVA and 1 wt% barium sulphate. The face is 3D printed using an Ultimaker 2 and is made of PLA and MP Flex. The three phantom parts can be fitted together easily and securely. Each part is scanned using an XperCT scan at Philips. By measuring the Hounsfield units, it has been shown that there is significant contrast difference between the skull and the brain phantom. An indention test has shown that the brain phantom does not exactly match the mechanical properties of real brain tissue. The produced skull and the brain phantom have been compared with the original 3D models and the error in size difference between the two scans ranges from 0-1 mm. Neurosurgeons and residents inspected the head phantom, after which they filled in a questionnaire. The questionnaire has been used to evaluate if the anatomical structures are represented correctly and if the head phantom can improve neurosurgical planning, education and training. The anatomic accuracy and appearance of the nasal cavities, sphenoidal sinus, sella turcica and pituitary gland are found realistic by the surgeons. The results of the questionnaire show that surgeons found the use of a patient-specific head phantom for surgical planning purposes useful. The overall impression was that a patient-specific head phantom will not only improve surgical planning for endoscopic endonasal neurosurgery but would also be desirable other types of surgery. The qualitative study also suggests that the head phantom may be valuable for neurosurgical education and training. Surgeons from different hospitals would like to use the head phantom for a training day, to let residents practise the use of an endoscope. An augmented reality neuronavigation system is tested with the head phantom at Philips in Best. The tests showed that the head phantom can also be used for research purposes and testing of neuronavigation systems.","Brain; Phantom; Skull base surgery; Neurosurgery; Tissue Mimicking; Surgical training; Surgical procedure; Surgical planning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-07-17","","","","Mechanical Engineering | BioMechanical Design","",""

This thesis will describe the manufacture of P(VDF-TrFE-CTFE) actuators with inkjet printed carbon black electrodes.

Furthermore we conjecture that given a uniform redistribution measure and Beta distributed propensity to save, the resulting wealth distribution cannot be Beta distributed either. The absence of Beta distributions in the wealth distribution shows that there cannot be product stationary measures in these cases. We also extend the model by assuming zero propensity and that the stationary product measure of one agent is conditionally Gamma(α;β)<br/>distributed, where we condition on α be independently distributed as well. We find that the class of distributions for α defined by ψ(α) = α<sup>-k</sup>, k an integer always leads to the wealth distribution for agent 1 to be heavy-tailed.

For years, Yangon Port has been suffering from limited accessibility due to the sedimentation in the channel and currently daily dredging is required in order to let ships enter the port. <br/>The main characteristics of Yangon Estuary are; tidal range of 6 m, high suspended sediment concentrations (up to 6 g/l), a monsoon climate and the presence of a confluence within the tidal range. Research to the cause of sedimentation is done by making a conceptual model of the estuary based on a study area analysis and a literature study to estuarine, riverine and sediment processes. In addition, numerical models are used to improve the conceptual model in a quantitative manner. The conceptual model resulted in the following findings.<br/>The fluctuations in SSC are dominantly determined by the tide. During the monsoon season suspended sediment is brought in the system mainly by the Yangon River discharge, causing for averaged SSC values of 1 g/l during the season. In dry season, the SSC shows a fortnightly rhythm caused by the spring/neap cycle. Strong spring tidal currents cause for high bed shear stresses on the shoals, exceeding 1 N/m2, which erodes the stationary fluid mud layers. Due to the dispersion of the mud, the SSC rises rapidly up to 5 g/l. During neap tides the bed shear stress is much less, enabling the fine sediments to settle on the shoals and restore the fluid mud layers. Hence, the SSC values reduce to less than 0.5 g/l. During the monsoon, the spring flood current is reduced due to the seaward directed river discharge. Therefore, the spring flood currents are insufficient to erode the stationary fluid mud layers, hence the SSC are less than during spring tide in the dry season. <br/>In contrast to the fluctuations in erosion and deposition of mud on the shoals, almost continuously deposition and consolidation of mud is possible in Monkey Point Channel. This is possible because the channel is located in the stagnation-zone where both during flood (bifurcation) and ebb (confluence) the flow velocities and bed shear stresses sufficiently low to let mud settle. After deposition the mud is not resuspended, and consolidation causes the mud layer to become thicker and become problematic for the ship traffic.<br/>To conclude; the combination of high SSC with the possibility of consolidation of deposited mud in the stagnation-zone results in too hard layers to sail through. This potential cause corresponds with the dredged material from the channel bed and the sedimentation rate in the channel. <br/>It is recommended to relocate the navigation channel outside the stagnation-zone. The combination of land reclamation at the western estuary bank downstream of the confluence and a dredged channel shows the most promising results. However, more research is required to determine the long-term sedimentation rates in the new channel. <br","Estuaries; Confluence; Bifurcation; fluid mud","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","",""

The emergency of this issue, exacerbated by climate change, has alarmed international organisations and national governments that have been demanding for robust risk assessments to guide the development of resilient adaptation strategies. In SIDS, the paucity of local data, required to perform such kind of coastal risk analyses, hinders the application of highly detailed models that therefore need to rely on inaccurate and publicly available data, thus introducing uncertainty in the assessment. This thesis aims to investigate the uncertainty in input data and its impact on coastal flood damage estimates. This study examines prominent uncertainty sources in the coastal flood risk modeling chain, namely: the stochastic variability of (i) significant wave height and (ii) storm surge water level, the quality of (iii) bathymetry data and (iv) digital elevation models and (v) the choice of depth-damage function. To account for risk temporal changes, two other inputs are included, specifically (vi) different sea level rise projections and (vii) socioeconomic developments. A methodology is developed to test the afore-mentioned inputs through global sensitivity analysis, using an ensemble of hydrodynamic models (XBeach and SFINCS) coupled with an impact model (Delft-FIAT). The impacts of these sources on the flood damage estimates are evaluated in a case study on the islands of São Tomé and Príncipe. Model results indicate, for the current time horizon, depth-damage functions and digital elevation models as the inputs with the most significant contribution to the overall damage estimation uncertainty, yielding a variation in the output prediction of a factor 16 and 10, respectively. As future climate and socioeconomic development uncertainties are introduced in the system, sea level rise projection becomes, followed by digital elevation models and depth-damage functions, the most relevant input for the year 2100. Neglecting economic growth in the risk analysis leads to an extremely high underestimation of damages. However, given the constrained intrinsic uncertainty for the projected societal trends, its sensitivity on the risk output is limited. The scarcity of accurate input data proves to have an enormous impact on risk assessments in Small Island Developing States, leading to considerable prediction error and affecting the model outcome uncertainty. New emerging data collection techniques, such as unmanned aerial vehicles, could augment the trustworthiness of risk assessments by providing more accurate datasets for bathymetry and topography. Furthermore, research efforts could be directed towards developing knowledge on the physics of damages and their implementation in a risk modeling scheme. The uncertainty framework presented could be applied in projects with the aim to support risk communication to stakeholders by portraying the implications of the various inputs used and assumptions made, but also to guide the allocation of limited economic resources towards the acquisition of the input data that matters the most in terms of reliability of damage estimates.","uncertainty analysis; Small Island Developing States; Digital Elevation Models; XBeach; SFINCS; Delft-FIAT; Impact Assessment; Sensitivity Analysis; Data scarce regions; Coastal flood risk","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Coastal and Marine Engineering and Management (CoMEM)","","0.186400, 6.613100"

However, researchers have suggested that stimulating the acceptance of car sharing is a promising solution for dealing with these issues. Therefore, the goal of this graduation project was to support the car sharing company Greenwheels in growing its corporate car sharing business. In order to accomplish this goal, an innovation strategy for Greenwheels was created.<br/> The innovation strategy was constructed by executing a considerable amount of internal and external analyses. The resulting insights established the foundation of a future vision for corporate car sharing in 2025. This future vision describes what needs to be achieved by the innovation strategy, in order for Greenwheels to develop a future proof corporate car sharing service. The future vision is defined as: <i><b>""Realising a personalised, zero emission, corporate car sharing service, with a motivated and knowledgeable community of users.""  </b></i>In order for Greenwheels to achieve this future vision, three design solutions were developed. These design solutions will be implemented at different points in time, building onto each other and thereby creating valuable synergies. The proposed solutions are: Experience Workshop: An interactive workshop day for new users, offered as an additional service to corporate clients. Unity platform: An online car sharing platform based on gamification and online learning in order to train and motivate the end-users over a longer period of time. Smart Shared Fleet: Optimising the shared car fleet by utilising bi-directional charging technology, connected car technology and personalisation of the car sharing service. The implementation of these solutions is presented in the form of a tactical roadmap. This roadmap provides an actionable step-by-step approach for moving towards the desired future vision of 2025. It does so by presenting a comprehensive overview of the main value propositions, the value created for different stakeholders, the features of the design solutions, the required technology and data streams, the corresponding revenue streams and the internal and external resources that are needed. Additionally, one of the design solutions was further conceptualised in order to showcase a tangible example. The next steps for Greenwheels include: estimating the total market demand more accurately, creating validated revenue models, establishing new partnerships and further refining the design solutions through extensive user-testing.","Innovation Strategy; Greenwheels; Car sharing; Consumer behaviour; Sustainability; Product Service System","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

The aim to reduces has let to an increase in the production of renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar energy. However, there are more major energy resources available in the oceans, such as wave and tidal power. The estimated potential global energy resource in waves is around 2 Terra Watt. Over the years, many different technologies have been developed to harvest this high-density energy source. Yet, the harsh weather conditions are challenging the survival of the energy converters. A potential device that avoids the risk of high environmental impacts and has a reduced vulnerability is the Neptune: The Neptune is a fully submerged wave energy converter. Inside the structure, a weir and internal air pocket separate two water columns. One column acts as an oscillating water column to pressures of the incident waves. During its oscillations, the inner free surface level exceeds the weir and spills water into the second column. This column acts as a reservoir, and the overflow water is drawn off through an exit pipe, including a turbine. From the net flow through the columns, energy can be extracted. This design has the advantage of being fully submerged and has a single moving part, namely the turbine. The first work on this type of wave energy converter dates back to the mid-1970s. In 2008 a 1/20th scale model was built and tested in a wave basin. However, the work and experiment didn’t include the effects of energy generation. The objective of this thesis is to form a more scientific base concerning this device. A numerical model is made to predict the dynamic behaviour of the system. The equations of motion of the water columns are derived from the equations of conservation of mass and momentum. The excitation forces are obtained from the linear wave theory for regular undisturbed waves. The hydrodynamic coefficients are determined from associated literature. The dynamics of the internal air pressure is derived from the conservation of mass and the pressure density relation for an adiabatic and reversible thermodynamic process...","Oscillating Water Column (OWC); Wave Energy Converter (WEC); Mass transfer; Submerged WEC; Time-domain simulations","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Unfortunately, many people die in car accidents around the world. Research shows that the number of fatal casualties in car accidents has been increasing for the past decade and that the largest cause of these accidents is the human driver. For this reason, research on fully autonomous vehicles has gained a lot of attention. However, currently autonomous driving is only implemented to reduce the errors of human drivers. More research is necessary in order for fully autonomous vehicles to be implemented and to remove the human driver completely. A robust navigation algorithm which is able to run in real time is one of the challenges in development of fully autonomous vehicles. Important topics in navigation of autonomous vehicles include the path planner and the motion controller. The path planner ﬁnds a path for the vehicle from its current location to the target location. At the same time the path planner avoids obstacles and fulﬁlls the non-holonomic constraints of the autonomous vehicle. The motion controller tries to follow the path the path planner made as close as possible by controlling the vehicle. These two topics inﬂuence each other and are therefore dependent. In literature little research is done on integrated algorithms that combine path planning and motion control. Therefore, this thesis will research navigation of autonomous vehicles by using an integrated algorithm that includes both path planning and motion control. The objective of this thesis is to develop a Lyapunov stable control algorithm that is capable of planning a path for all possible vehicle maneuvers. Besides path planning the proposed algorithm must be capable of controlling the vehicle along this path. Furthermore, the algorithm needs to include obstacles and the non-holonomic dynamics of an autonomous vehicle. The main contribution of this thesis is an integrated path planner and motion controller for navigation of autonomous vehicles.

Cleaning performance, use(r scenario), and aesthetics were essential pillars in the process. Oral hygiene is essential for people’s overall health. Poor oral care is a significant concern among the elderly, especially in nursing homes as older people struggle to take good care of their teeth because they sometimes do not know how, and on the other hand, they are not capable anymore. Proper oral care is necessary for people with their teeth, but also for people with a denture, what a large number of people have in nursing homes. With dentures, infections can quickly occur. Food can be easily trapped between the teeth and will rot as the person does not feel this himself. The current way of cleaning a denture is time consuming, dirty, and it is often forgotten. The starting point of the project will be ultrasonic cleaning, as this technique shows promising features. Testing In order to perform all the test in the same way, a standard test is created. Because dentures with ‘real’ dirt, dentures which are used by people, are not all the time available, fake dirt needed to be found to imitate real dirt. With the created standard test, multiple tests were performed to determine per parameter if changing it improves the cleaning performance a lot. Cleaning agent: a cleaning agent (soap or a denture cleanser) makes sure the denture is better cleaned however, the improvement is not very large. Cleaning a denture alone of upper and lower together: there is no significant difference because at some places it cleaned better and at some places less. Time: a longer cleaning period than five minutes does fit. It is certainly a recommendation to clean longer than five minutes, probably even longer than thirty minutes.<br/>Temperature: The advice concerning cleaning temperature is that a higher temperature than twenty-five degrees is definitely preferable. A temperature between fifty and seventy degrees would be optimal, taking into account that the water also heats up during the process. Orientation: The conclusion from the orientation tests is that the side facing the piezo is cleaned the best and therefore it might be convenient to use multiple piezo’s in one cleaner in order to not have to turn the denture around. Distance: The advice for the parameter of distance to piezo is that it should be as short as possible, as the vibrations are there the strongest. The water is damping the vibrations when the object is placed further away from the source. Final design When the Sonic 1 is turned on, an heating element at the bottom of the tank, heats the water up to fifty degrees Celsius. The sensor keeps on measuring during the cleaning process; if the temperature rises above seventy degrees, the piezo’s are switched off for a certain period of time in order to let the temperature degrease until fifty degrees again. Then the cleaning process is started again. The cleaning process is taking up half an hour, with the piezo’s switching every 1.5 minute. During the whole cleaning process the denture is soaking in the water, which makes the filth looser and easier to remove. When the first piezo removes certain filth, the filth layer below has time to soak and can be easier removed when the first piezo is back on. After the cleaning cycle, the basket is moved upwards out of the water in order for the dentures to dry. At the same time, the motor is also pressing the lid open so air can come in. <br/>Unique selling point of the product As the denture cleaner is specific designed for the nurses of a nursing homes, it has some unique selling points over all other ultrasonic cleaners and other ways of cleaning dentures: The denture cleaner is easy in use as it is possible to pick the cleaner up from the charger by the handle, walk to the sink and fill the product. With disposing the water it is similar. Other ultrasonic cleaners are lacking a spout and/or have the cord attached which makes is harder to walk towards a sink. The denture cleaner is cleaning all sides of the denture as there are more piezo’s in the product. <br","Design; denture; cleaner; elderly; nursing home; Integrated Product Design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

Furthermore, with current power distribution networks primarily designed for unidirectional power ﬂow, the introduction of reverse power ﬂows by renewable feed-in strategies has been shown to negatively impact grid stability, security and system protection. For residential grid-connected microgrids (MGs) wishing to increase their renewable generation, these issues along with economic considerations often highlight that optimal operation can only be achieved through an increased self-consumption of locally generated renewable energy. Recently, researchers have highlighted that these issues can be addressed by the application of demand side management (DSM). Broadly speaking, these DSM strategies can be considered as programs which attempt to modify ﬂexible user demands in order to achieve objectives such as reduced energy costs or increased RES utilization.<br/><br/>To achieve these optimal energy management goals, this thesis focuses its eﬀorts on the application of hybrid economic model predictive control (EMPC) strategies for the DSM of small to medium sized grid-connected residential MGs, containing both local photovoltaic (PV) generation capabilities and thermal energy storage (TES) devices. In particular, the investigation exploits thermal energy storage properties of switched domestic electric water heaters (DEWHs) to optimally schedule energy demand for the minimization of MG operating costs. By considering the time varying electricity tariﬀs, it is shown that the implementation of EMPC is able to simultaneously target reduced electricity costs while also encouraging the self-consumption of local PV generation.<br/><br/>Finally, to address the unavoidable presence of uncertainty in domestic hot water (DHW) user demand, the thesis additionally explores the use of stochastic and robust variants of EMPC. By explicitly considering uncertainty, these control frameworks are able to provide more robust system operation. Speciﬁcally, the work implements min-max and stochastic scenario-based frameworks, which were shown to drastically reduce the violation of user comfort constraints when compared with their deterministic counterparts.","Economic Model Predictive Control; Model Predictive Control; EMPC; MPC; Scenario-based EMPC; Stochastic and Robust; Demand Side Management; Mixed Logical Dynamical Model; Smart grid; Microgrids; MILP","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

Recently, the industry is faced with growing environmental uncertainty that may result in new challenges, consequently giving rise to a different set of needs concerning B2B relationships. These needs may present opportunities for alternative B2B platforms to further reduce friction in SME trade. Therefore, from the perspective of platform providers, it is valuable to assess what factors drive SMEs likeliness of using alternative platforms. Objective: This study extends existing research on IT switching behaviour by linking it to organisational innovation theory. According to extant literature, environmental uncertainty may lead to increased innovativeness and adaptability in organisations. The aim is to assess how perceived environmental uncertainty affects the propensity to switch in the context of B2B platform technologies. Method: A research model was developed by adapting the Push-pull -mooring model. It was extended with context-specific antecedents. The model was empirically tested with PLS-SEM using 68 responses from a survey with managers of Hong Kong SMEs. Results: We find that switching propensity is directly predicted by pull (attractiveness of alternatives), push (satisfaction with incumbent) and mooring (perceived switching cost) factors. Further, perceived network size is found to influence switching propensity mediated by satisfaction. Environmental uncertainty is found to positively affect the attractiveness of alternatives and top management innovativeness. Conclusion: The results have several managerial implications. Since attractiveness of alternatives was found to have the largest effect, managers may be advised to focus on differentiating their offerings from incumbent products. Further, the results suggest that within-group effects play a role for platform switching. More research is needed to further explore this hypothesis.","adoption of innovation; Platform strategy; TOE framework","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

The method works for nonlinear DDEs, which are linear DDEs in the unperturbed case. The validity of the method is proven under certain conditions, such as a Lipschitz condition on the perturbation, and we illustrate how the method can be applied by working out several examples. We consider a delayed version of Mathieu's equation, which is especially useful, because it can be used when one linearizes a nonlinear oscillator around a period soluction. We also consider a quadratic perturbation. For these examples we have to analyse the relationship between the solutions of the characteristic equation. There already exists a perturbation method for DDEs, for which one solves a corresponding ODE, and uses this solution as an approximation. This method is only applicable when the influence of the delay is small, and is not always accurate due to the different natures of DDEs and ODEs. We study an example for which this method can be used, and show when it fails to give an accurate approximation. We then show how to use our perturbation method for this example, to obtain an accurate approximation.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Due to the fast-fashion phenomenon and our linear economic model, there is a growing demand for and pressure on cotton. This, combined with the increasing amount of clothes that are discarded and collected, asks for a systemic change: to work towards a more circular system. Since Amsterdam is internationally known as the jeans capital of Europe, the Dutch government wants to strive towards a circular denim industry in the Netherlands and involved House of Denim to work towards this goal. Increasing the use of post-consumer recycled cotton in denim production is defined as the first step. Increasing the use of recycled cotton in denim production is a complex systemic challenge. Designing for this challenge, asks for a systemic and holistic approach to be able to have a deep understanding of the current system and its complexity. Therefore this project is executed with a relatively new design approach: Systems Oriented Design (SOD). The project can serve as an example in incorporating systemic ways of designing in an educational programme. The main research question in this project is defined as: How can the demand for post-consumer recycled cotton in jeans production, started from within the Netherlands, be increased by triggering the key actor(s) or interaction(s) within the cycle? The research consisted mainly of interviews with experts of different parts of the value chain. By getting to know the different points of view, knowledge about the difficulties in producing and using PCR cotton, the role of all actors and the relations between the actors is gained. Three key problems are defined. 1. Brands have a negative perception of PCR denim. They perceive it as difficult, expensive and low quality fabric. 2. In order to work with PCR cotton, individual brands are given a complicated logistical challenge that results in a time consuming and expensive process. 3. The use of PCR fabric is not adopted as a common practice due to the lacking supply and demand of the fabric. Recycled denim products are not conventional in the shops and consumers do not actively demand it. The concept presented in this project is the Dutch Denim Programme.  The Dutch Denim Programme is a collaborative and action-oriented program to work towards a Bright Blue loop: a circular denim industry in the Netherlands. The Dutch Denim Programme (DDP) helps brands to raise the demand for recycled cotton by stimulating them and facilitating a collaborative value chain. By setting up the network and initiating the material flow, the DDP will push participants to develop new recycled denim fabrics. Besides that, the DDP will launch the Bright Blue Loop label: a label for denim fabrics and products that contain 20% Dutch recycled cotton. By showing a joint effort, the industry can push the government to incentivize the use of recycled cotton. If the key-actors would participate in the Dutch Denim Programme, House of Denim would be able to realize a growth in the use of recycled cotton in denim production, which would reduce the environmental impact of the highly polluting denim industry.","Systems Oriented Design; Circular Economy; Denim industry; Systemic change; Post-consumer recycling; Recycling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

With the increasing interest in Visible Light Communication (VLC) and a crowded radio-frequency spectrum, static lights in our offices and rooms might not be ideal anymore. VLC can add extra services like high quality communication and localization. These services benefit from optimal circumstances as we can find in the hot spot below the lights. Outside the hot spot, the intensity of the lightbeam starts to drop rapidly. This research is dedicated to the aspect that the static lights are lacking which is mobility. Instead of having static lights we create a light source that is able to move along with persons in a room. In this work, which consists of the design and evaluation of our system, we create a mobile platform which includes enhancement of an existing gondola system, the design of a small mobile LED-transmitter and a smartphone as receiving device. We designed a system for the light to follow a user. The smartphone can locate the light and it calculates the location offset through image processing. New coordinates for the light are send to the gondola system to move the light and keep the transmitter and receiver in sync. The system was tested by installing it in the Embedded Systems laboratory of the TU Delft and evaluated in terms of illumination, communication and energy efficiency compared to a static light network. We can conclude that a mobile light can add extra services to VLC by ensuring a constant high illuminance and signal-to-noise ratio by using individual focused hot spots that follow the user in real-time, with an average position error of 1.74 cm, which the static light network can not do causing a performance degradation. The mobile light is in most cases also more energy efficient than a full hot spot static light network coverage.

Annually 1% of the worldwide dam reservoirs storage capacity is lost, caused by sedimentation. The inflow of sediment and reduction of flow velocity and turbulence in the reservoir pro- vides favourable conditions for settling. Several sediment transport mechanisms are responsible for this, one of these is the turbid density current. The turbid density currents settle as the reservoir becomes wider, and it is affected by forces along the top and the bottom of the current. Recently, focus on reservoir engineering has shifted from primarily structural dam design towards complete sediment management strategies. In order to improve the sustainability of dam reservoirs, many management techniques are developed that inhibit or mitigate sedimentation. However, the effectiveness of these techniques is not yet known. This thesis provides an additional concept for sediment management in dam reservoirs consisting of channelling of turbid den- sity currents in dam reservoirs. The channel provides controllable parameters. The aim is to study the effects of channelling turbid density currents.<br/>The study starts with a literature review, to describe sedimentation, sediment transport, and turbid den- sity currents in dam reservoirs, including their analytical and numerical descriptions.<br/>Two computational models study the concept: a steady-state model and a numerical model. The steady- state solution and is based upon an equation for open channel flows modified for turbid density currents. This model is used to investigate the effects of hydraulic radii and slope of the channel on the turbid density current — secondly, the dynamic numerical solution. An analytical description is provided using the one- dimensional shallow water equations, consisting of the continuity, momentum and particle conservation equations. The solution includes four sources: deposition, erosion, gravity and friction. It omits water en- trainment and bed deformation. The model is discretised using the Generalised Lax Friedrichs method. First validation and investigation of the quality of the source terms are done. Subsequently, the model, including the four source terms, is used to study the effect of slope, hydraulic radii, concentration and sediment size in the channel. Expanding the numerical study by a Water Injection Dredging case in which local velocity, concentration and height are increased along a certain length to study possible effects.<br/>To conclude, channelling turbid density currents is a viable solution to improve sediment transport. The slope and depth of the channel have the most significant effects. The generalised Lax Friedrichs method provides a valid and straightforward discretisation method for the numerical model.

It has been known for millennia that there are other planets and other bodies in the solar system. Moreover, as recent as, 1995 it has been confirmed that other stars also host planets. But how did they form? This is the main question that planet formation research has been trying to answer for at least a century. Since planet formation can not be observed directly due to instrumental limitations and limitations on human life times, this takes many generations. Each project contributing a small part to the puzzle that is planet formation. This thesis aims to address a small part of this puzzle. Planets are formed from same material as their host star. Interstellar space houses vast clouds of gas and dust. Under the influence of interstellar radiation, turbulence, magnetic fields, gravity and gas dynamics, pockets of higher density are formed in these clouds, called molecular cloud cores. Upon the collapse of a molecular cloud core (MCC), the material in the MCC will divide itself between the central body, the protostar, and a disk of material orbiting the protostar. This disk is mostly made up of gas and ∼1% of dust. Because planets are formed from these disks, these are referred to as a protoplanetary disks (PPDs). Observations of both PPDs and exoplanets are improving. However, current instruments are not able to observe planet formation in action. Therefore, models are used to predict the conditions and activities inside PPDs. This is where the availability of the thermo-chemical protoplanetary disk model ProDiMo presents the opportunity to link the observed composition of exoplanets to their formation path. ProDiMo is a 2D steady-state simulation code that solves the radiative and chemical equilibrium selfconsistently. Moreover, it generates a great deal of information about the PPD model. The temperature, pressure, density and chemical composition are just a few of the properties that it provides. Firstly, to benchmark the code, ProDiMo models are compared to a set of simple disk models. The comparison shows that ProDiMo is a very advanced code that is able to predict the PPD environment much better than other models that try to link the formation path to the composition. In addition AA Tau is found to be the most suitable PPD to perform planet formation. Because it is has parameters that are found close to median values. The ProDiMo model is used in combination with a mass accretion scenario. The formation scenario that is applied is called pebble accretion. In this scenario it is proposed that pebbles formed from dust at large radii drift to the inner disk where the pebbles are accreted by a planetesimal. As a result, the planetesimal can grow in mass up to tens of Earth masses (푀⊕), and is now called a core. The moment the core has a high enough mass and the pebble accretion has terminated early in the disk life time, before ∼3 Myr, it becomes a gas giant. This is done by accreting a massive amount of gas from the disk, and thereby clearing an annulus of gas from the disk. In the case of the AA Tau model, gas giants only form at radii between 2 and 8 AU. The largest gas giant at 4 AU has a mass of 110 푀⊕. By combining the model of AA Tau with the pebble accretion scenario, the composition of the resulting gas giants is determined. Planetesimal accretion leads to a stellar C/O of the ices in all of the cores formed between 0.5 and 25 AU. The atmospheres of gas giants formed between 2 and 4.8 AU, with C/O between 1.3 and 13, are up to an order of magnitude away from other similar models and observations. From 4.8 to 8 AU the model predicts a slowly decreasing C/O from 2.2 to 1.3. Compared to observations the C/O ratios computed for the AA Tau model are similar for planets formed beyond 4.8 AU.

For safe and effective proton therapy, the proton range in a patient’s body must be accurately determined. Current treatment planning is based on X-ray computed tomography images, which might cause uncertainty because of the different behaviour between protons and X-rays. As an alternative, proton Computed Tomography (pCT) has been proposed to directly measure the Relative Stopping Power (RSP) map in the patient and reduce this uncertainty. During a proton CT scan, a high-energy proton beam is directed at the patient. Then, the proton’s residual energy and position are measured with a detector placed behind the patient. This information is used to calculate the volumetric RSP. In the case of using a pixel based detector, a tracking algorithm is required in order to increase the proton intensity capacity of the detector. A proton track reconstruction system has been already developed by Pettersen [1], however, it has some limitations on the track density that can be reconstructed correctly. The algorithm is based on the track-following scheme, in which a growing track searches for deeper- laying activated pixels. This thesis introduces proton therapy and the advantages of pCT and proton radiography for treatment planning. Then, the main track reconstruction techniques found in the literature are reviewed. Improvements in the reconstruction process are proposed and their efficiencies are discussed. While current algorithm begins from the layer closest to the patient, in the present study a new reconstruction algorithm is developed. It differs by starting the reconstruction process from the distal end of the detector. Based on this new algorithm, studies related to its optimization are conducted. Lastly, an algorithm based on the identification of the most probable scenario is developed. The potential algorithms are evaluated on data simulated with GATE (based on Monte Carlo interactions) and PROCASIM (design to simplify the physical interactions between protons and the detector). The fraction of correctly reconstructed tracks and the computational eciency of the algorithms are analyzed to determine the most viable one. [1] H. E. S. Pettersen.

(mentor); van Westering, Werner (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","The aim of this research thesis is to use machine learning models to distinguish owners of heat pumps from non-owners of heat pumps based on load profiles and temperature data only. As is the case with data mining project, its workflow can be divided into business understanding, data gathering, analysis, modeling and interpretation and deployment. As of the time of the time of this writing the models have not yet been deployed. The necessity to conduct this master thesis arises from the growing popularity of heat pumps in the Netherlands, and the potential issues associated with this spread on management of low-voltage distribution grids, in particular the rising electricity demand in the heating season. Before such issues can be analyzed however, the number of all heat pump users needs to be determined. This master thesis aims in determining precisely the overall number of heat pumps users by examining individual load profiles.<br/><br/>Data available for the purpose of thesis consists of load profiles of owners and non-owners of heat pumps provided by Alliander, load profiles of London-based non-owners of heat pumps, referred to as baseload profiles, load profiles of heat pumps only spread across the UK, temperature records for De Bilt in the Netherlands, London and Nottingham. The above-mentioned data was cleaned and manipulated before features were extracted from it. In particular, synthetic load profiles of heat pump owners were created by pairing baseload profiles with the pump only load profiles. Next all load profiles were normalized in order to diminish the importance of confounding variables, more on that later, and only night-hours were kept so as not to account for PV production. Such normalized load profiles were paired up in two sets: Alliander's set which consisted of load profiles of heat pump owners and non-owners provided by Alliander and simulated set which consisted of baseload profiles and synthetic load profiles of heat pump owners. It is worth mentioning that a confounding variable was present in Alliander's set, mainly the size of house since owners of heat pumps all lived in single standing houses as compared to non-owners, majority of whom lived in apartments.<br/><br/>Subsequently, the following four features were extracted from normalized night-time load profiles within each two sets: (1) average daily electricity consumption in January and December (this period is also referred to as winter or heating period), (2) ratio of average daily electricity consumption in January and December to average daily electricity consumption in July and August (it is also referred to as summer or cooling period), (3) slope of the curve representing mean daily temperature on x-axis and daily electricity consumption in y-axis, and lastly (4) coefficient of determination of curve representing mean daily temperature on x-axis and daily electricity consumption in y-axis.<br/><br/>Three main evaluation criteria were set for the performance of machine learning models: True Negative Rate, True Positive Rate and Precision. For simplicity, the mean score was used as well, which is equal to the average of True Positive Rate, True Negative Rate and Precision. Benchmark for all evaluation metrics was set to 90\%. Five models that were used to distinguish heat pump owners from non-owners were Logistic regression, Decision Tree and Support Vector Machines with Linear, Polynomial and Radial kernels. The evaluation procedure was the following: first hyperparameters for all the five models were tuned by using 10-fold cross validation with test and training set being features extracted from Alliander's set only. Next, the models with optimal hyperparameters were trained on features extracted from Alliander's set and tested on features from simulated set.<br/><br/>The results show that none of the models managed to reach the benchmark of triple 90\% for True Positive Rate, True Negative Rate and Precision. In the hyperparameter tuning stage both True Negative Rate and True Negative Rate were close to reaching 90\%, however, this has been achieved at the cost of low Precision, reaching just above 50\%. This was the case due to the propensity of the models to commit type I error, that is false positives. On the other hand, at the evaluation stage when the simulated set-features served as test set, it was noticed that precision was at a significantly higher level, approximately 75\%, which came at a cost of lower True Positive Rate, around 50\%. True Negative Rate though did exceed 90\%. These results show a strong tendency of making type II error, that is false negatives. The best performing model, which was the Support Vector Machine with Radial Kernel, achieved a mean score of 75\%.<br/><br/>The divergence of results from the hyperparameter tuning stage to the evaluation stage is caused by the fact that there are different usage patterns of heat pumps between the owners of heat pumps in Alliander's load profiles and in the synthetic load profiles of heat pump owners. Particularly it is the case that owners of heat pumps in Alliander's set, do use heat pump in the night, as compared to synthetic users, which do so to a much smaller extent. As a result the features extracted from the simulated set of load profiles are less indicative of heat pump ownership than the features extracted from Alliander's load profiles.<br/><br/>This master thesis could be improved by trying out more machine learning models, improving the process of normalization of load profiles and acquiring better heat pump only load profiles which are more similar to Alliander's set in terms of usage patterns among many others. Further work can be built upon the results of this thesis. Once heat pump owners have been identified based on load profiles, similar work can be done for identification based on voltage profiles. The advantage of using voltage profiles rather than load profiles is the fact that voltage profiles are not as privacy sensitive. Furthermore, providing more insight into the kind of heat pumps the users are utilizing (air-to-air or water source or geothermal) might provide further insight. Last but not least, the models developed in this master thesis could be deployed in Alliander and used to investigate heat pump ownership among entire dataset of 120k load profiles at the disposal of Alliander.<br","heat pump; machine learning; classification; electricity grid","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

The aim of this research is to find out what strategies can reduce and deal with value conflicts that can be identified when designing a decentralized energy system considering the properties of a city district. A specific city district is analyzed, i.e. 'De Vruchtenbuurt' in The Hague, the Netherlands. The research starts with an identification of values, conversion factors, governance models and technical designs which are important when changing to a decentralized energy system in 'De Vruchtenbuurt'. Following the Capability Approach is used to structure the different components and the relations between them. Subsequently, a translation of the components into a simulation model is made, using the values to evaluate the acceptability of the capabilities. By analyzing the values that are conflicting (for different conversion groups) for different input parameter settings, insights are gained about possible value conflicts that can emerge in 'De Vruchtenbuurt' and possibly also in other city districts. Finally, an analysis on strategies is developed that can be effective to limit the emergence of the identified value conflicts and therefore possibly support the change to a decentralized energy system in 'De Vruchtenbuurt' and in other city districts. Policies (financial instruments and supporting innovations) that create more feasible solutions for the heterogeneous households are effective to limit the context dependent value conflicts. It is not realistic to eliminate all value conflicts, since some of the values are inherently in conflict with each other. For these conflicts thresholds can be formulated that should be met for every value. Given that value conflicts exist, focusing on the process of the change to a decentralized energy system is seen as important factor for support and participation.","Value Conflicts; Decentralized Energy Systems; City Districts; Acceptability; Capability Approach; Agent-Based Modelling; Exploratory Modelling and Analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","","52.070597, 4.257098"

The collapse of coastal bridges due to tsunami wave impact represents a huge obstacle for rescue works. The need to understand tsunami effects and develop tsunami-resilient bridges became apparent in the aftermath of extreme tsunami events in the Indian Ocean (2004), Chile (2010) and Japan (2011). <br/><br/>Different coastal topographies affect tsunami propagation near shore. Varying wave characteristics lead to various failure mechanisms of bridge decks. Together with the wave characteristics, the bridge properties and the settings around the bridge play a major role in this failure, think for example of shear keys, seawalls or inclination of the bridge.<br/><br/>To find out more about these failure mechanism and what role all these measures have in the failure, a laboratory experiment is executed and a numerical SPH model is set up to investigate the impacts of various wave characteristics, a seawall, shear key and inclination of the bridge deck. The numerical SPH model is validated with the help of wave gauge data and tracked bridge deck movement from the executed physical tests. <br/><br/>In this thesis the focus is on the movement of the bridge deck, what kind of effect do the different interventions have on the movement of the deck. Since the movement is highly dependent on the forcing on the bridge deck, the forces are analyzed thoroughly. From the force time series countermeasures are proposed and modeled in the SPH model. <br/><br/>Wave forces from different type of waves are simulated with the SPH model. The overall behavior of the hydrodynamics and the deck movement are validated and suited for qualitative analysis.<br/>Some disadvantages of the model are the lack of bottom friction and air bubbles in turbulent regions.<br/>The 3D model represented the movement on the deck in a very good way, runtimes and storage capacity formed an obstacle. A 2D model was used to do qualitative analysis of the changes of wave characteristics and the effects of the structural measures.<br/>The limiting factor in the commercial use of SPH is the computation time. In future models this could be accelerated by the use of GPU processors instead of CPU processors which are able to solve many parallel processes at the same time.<br/><br/>Apart from wave heights and inundation heights, the wave phase appeared to be a major decisive factor in the failure method of the bridge deck. If the wave breaks near the shore and reaches the bridge structure as a propagating wave front, the hydrodynamic situation results in high horizontal forces and a sliding failure mode is apparent. When a wave is still in a surging phase and the fluid particles still have their rotational movement, the dominant forcing on the bridge is in vertical direction. Since the vertical force applied to the bridge deck moves from seaside to shore side, the sea side of the bridge deck has a higher vertical velocity which initiates rotation. <br/>A seawall causes the water to confine underneath the bridge deck. Which will result in higher vertical forces, thus a rotational failure mode follows. Inclination of the bridge deck has significant effect on the vertical forcing. Positive inclination lead to a decrease of upward forcing and negative inclination lead to an increase of upward forces. The introduction of shear keys resulted in higher moments, since the point of rotation is set at the point the deck interacts with the shear key, which creates a larger distance around the point of rotation.<br/><br/>Possible countermeasures that are introduced are a sacrificial beam and a different geometry of the deck. A sacrificial beam was effective in lowering the total horizontal forces on the combined structures. The deck itself was not exposed to a high horizontal impact force. Different geometries are tested to see how the forces on the structure would chance. A wing shaped geometry has positive effects in mitigating the horizontal forces on the bridge deck.","Bridge; SPH; Smooth particle hydrodynamics; LS-DYNA; Laboratory experiment; CFD; Tsunami; wave; Flume experiments","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","",""

In numerical solutions of the mean field approximation the relation between the variance of the ordered stationary distributions and the system parameters is given by a square root function. Cauchy distributions form a good fit to these steady state distributions, although they are not the analytic stationary solutions.

A common way to store and use 3D data is by using 3D city models. In 3D city models, geo-information can be stored at different levels of detail. CityGML, the most commonly used data model and encoding for 3D city models, uses five levels of detail in order to model increasing geometric and semantic complexity. These levels of detail may be interpreted as a model quality measure, and as a guideline for users that need data for a certain application. CityGML consists of several thematic modules, each with their own level of detail specification. Some of these modules have a more further developed level of detail specification than others. Recently, several authors have proposed improvements to the Transportation module. This has led to proposals for various changes, especially concerning road data. However, these proposed changes have not been encoded yet. The main critiques are the lack of a level of detail specification for linear representations of roads, no ability to model networks, no representation of intersections and general ambiguity in the level of detail specification. Many road data use cases might potentially benefit from improvements on these points. In this thesis I attempt to improve the current level of detail specification of roads in the CityGML data model. The improvements are encoded in CityJSON, a JSON encoding of this data model. I assess the shortcomings in the current CityGML transportation module. After, a road data needs analysis is performed on three use cases: transport modelling, navigation and road maintenance. The data needs are compared to modelling approaches of other road data standards. This has resulted in several encoded improvements. A topological structure has been added to CityJSON. This includes the addition of two new modelling classes: Nodes and Edges. This structure is general such that it can be used by other thematic modules as well. Moreover, the level of detail specification for roads has been further developed to include both the linear representations and less ambiguous areal representations. This includes a prescription on how to model intersections and roundabouts at different levels of detail. Finally, I provide a structure which enables one to link the linear and areal road data together. This link is made at the scale level of the object, which data providers may choose themselves. This way one object can be modelled in two representation types without needing a one-to-one mapping between linear road segments and areal triangulated surfaces. These concepts are then tested by creating a CityJSON road data file for all new levels of detail.","3D city model; Roads; Intersections; CityGML; CityJSON","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geomatics","",""

This occurs often around the grounding line between the ice sheet and ice shelf. At this grounding line area, a micro climate exists above the blue ice, which increase surface melt, due to a combination of decreased albedo and warming due to the mixing of cold and warm air. Detection of surface melt on this blue ice is important because this warmer surface melt water results in the increase of hydrofracturing and as a result, the decrease of ice shelf stability. Radar imagery above snow areas is a effective method to detect surface melt, which also ensures a continuous data record. Above blue ice, this is continuous data record of surface melt is also desired, but not done yet and therefore the focus of this thesis is surface melt detection on blue ice with radar imagery. By using the method of Hui et al., 2014 to classify blue ice areas, it is shown that the blue ice area extent (non-stable blue ice) is increasing over the years in the peak of the melt season. However, the extent is slightly decreasing during the non-melt season (stable blue ice). The data of Sentinel-1B is used during the austral summer of 2017/2018, to detect<br/>surface melt on blue ice. This is done via interferometry (and the corresponding coherence) and with the backscatter coefficient. Coherence turns out the be an unreliable method to detect surface melt, since the influence of wind and precipitation on the decrease of coherence is dominant. Thus, surface melt detection via this method is difficult. Backscatter showed some potential to detect surface melt on blue ice, but due to the larger standard deviation than the actual decrease of backscatter (assumed due to surface melt), a clear distinction between blue ice and surface melt can not be made. Melt features, such as rivers, lakes and ponds are detectable with the backscatter, due to their distinctive shape. Since these melt features are linked to surface melt, backscatter can indirectly be used to detect surface melt on blue ice.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Earth Sciences","",""

Since there is no cure available yet, asthma treatment is aimed at asthma control, to minimize patients’ symptom experiences and to prevent patients of having exacerbations (lung attacks). A key driver in this, is the extent to which patients adhere to their prescribed medication treatment, also called ‘medication adherence’. It has been found that one third of Dutch asthma patients show poor adherence to their treatment. <br/><br/>The client of this project, the pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca, has developed a smart inhaler in combination with an application. This technology makes it possible to measure medication adherence and present the adherence data to patients and healthcare providers. However, if the motivation of patients remains low to take their medication as prescribed, such interventions will likely not succeed because patients may ignore the reminders sent. Therefore, the aim of this graduation project is to develop a proof of concept for a self-management eHealth intervention that motivates patients to adhere to their medication treatment.<br/><br/>This thesis describes the development of Ademgenoot, an asthma self-management application connected to a smart inhaler. Ademgenoot uses narrative game-elements to motivate asthma patients to adhere to their prescribed medication treatment. In this, Ademgenoot focuses on the positive outcomes of taking the daily maintenance medication. Moreover, the application gives the patients the opportunity to try-out the daily intake of the medication, by offering them a six weeks challenge linked to a personal goal. During this period Ademgenoot visualizes the process of the medication intake in a playful way to make the effect of the medication visible and to prevent disengagement. At the end of the challenge, patients should have gained insights on the effect of the intake of the daily medication and their improved symptom control within their daily lives. <br/><br/>The design process from investigating the user’s needs and values to various idea directions towards the final design will be discussed. In addition, this thesis includes the different research that was conducted to gain a better understanding behind patients’ motives to not follow their treatment, the conducted research on the difficult step of motivating people to change their behaviour and the different user tests that were set up. <br/><br/>A WhatsApp prototype was built to test the concept of Ademgenoot in practice. Patients received screens responding to their medication use for a couple of days via WhatsApp. The end user test delivered the proof of principle that the concept of Ademgenoot has the ability to motivate patients to adhere to their prescribed treatment. In addition, participants expressed to be enthusiastic about the concept and stated that they would like to use the application in their daily life. A positive side-effect appeared to be that some participants mentioned that it would help in the creation of a habit. <br/><br/>Follow-up studies are recommended on finding additional ways to track the development of the patients’ daily wellbeing within the application.

As our country is urbanising and the influence of Transit Oriented Development (TOD) is growing, the smaller station turns into an instigator for new urban developments just outside of the ring highway in cities like Amsterdam, where 50.000 new dwellings will be realised by the year 2030, in existing built environments.<br/>In the peri-urban sphere, at the urban fringe, stacked apartments next to station areas are offering the density that lets many more inhabitants benefit from living in the city, through the infrastructure network: living somewhere, travelling and working somewhere else, connected on a city scale. But at the moment, these peri-urban railway stations are small and outdated, and often unattractive. Spoorbouwmeester Eric Luiten (Spoorbouwmeester, 2018) points out how changes in the transit network through the years have especially impacted smaller railway stations in peripheral areas: gradually, increased efficiency and technology have resulted in ticket offices at<br/>these stations going vacant. No more amenities are needed today at these stations than a ticket machine and a platform. These stations show that they have no social significance or added qualities, locally, which in turn reflects onto the quality of their surrounding public space. The station areas were designed only as a necessity.<br/>The perceived issue is that the transit oriented city diminishes local values and qualities and replaces them with infrastructure, nodes and efficiency on a non-local scale. At this moment when new urban developments focus on public transport nodes, the railway station is in the middle of this change as something that is both part of the network and part of the local built environment.<br/>Today, contrasting developments are taking place: we are designing our cities with TOD focusing on the efficiency of the connected city, but at the same time aim to enhance the quality of local public space around station buildings and peripheral neighborhoods. We are building mixed-use buildings that are extremely well connected to amenities elsewhere in the city while also offering as much as their inhabitants need inside or near the building itself. Architects and urban planners as well as Bureau Spoorbouwmeester are looking to redevelop railway stations together with their environments as an integral master plan. This integral approach was used for the first time with the NSP program for the six largest railway stations in the Netherlands. As a result of this successful program, the interweaving of station and urban plan has become a standard in the vision of Bureau Spoorbouwmeester and the appointment of a Landscape Architect as their director ensures this new policy.<br/>With this duality of city network and local qualities, a great challenge is taking shape for the peri-urban railway station. On one hand, there is the realisation that we need to integrate the station into its local environment to enhance the quality of the surrounding public space and liveability of the neighborhood which in many cases of post-war neighborhoods is considered an issue. On the other hand these stations and new urban developments are advertising connectivity and mobility within the city network as the new way of living, a diversification of life through the possibilities of the transit oriented city and the sharing of spaces that it offers. The station area now has these two very different perspectives, but the next step should be to study these two perspectives alongside eachother, and to start blurring them: the station as the perfect mediator, offering a place that is connected to city life and at the same time extends this city life and its livelyhood into the local public sphere.","Station development; Railway station; peri urban areas; architecture; Transit Oriented Development; amsterdam; lelylaan; Strategic Design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","City of the Future","52.357638, 4.834053"

Emerging as a response to the changing global trends of climate change, territorial claims and rapid melting of ice in the Arctic region; this research evolved as an investigation into the theoretical concepts of Architecture x Power x Territory within the context of the Arctic. To understand the complex conditions and factors that have influence within the Arctic Ocean a process of mapping conflicts – defined as disruptive forces – documented the interactions and relations between assemblages and ecologies existing within past, present and future organisations of territory. The overall methodology and investigation into the mediation of this planetary condition unravels through Levi Bryant’s Onto-Cartography and his three dimensions of geophilosophy: cartography, deconstruction, and terraformation (Bryant 2014). The political practice of cartography combined with the deconstruction of the theoretical concepts establish a point of intervention, mediation and negotiation of relations between assemblages and ecologies through an iterative process of mapping, analysis, deconstructing and redefining. The deconstruction of the key concepts – Architecture, Power and Territory translates and shifts the application from the territorial context of land and constructed landscapes into the context of the ocean, challenging the current understanding, dynamic and interaction of the concepts. Where Territory is explored through the notion of Terrain, a term that considers volume, the three-dimensional space or verticality of territory (Elden 2017), Power is expanded to include earth Forces and Architecture is inherently linked to Environment and its critical ecologies. Finally, the terraformation dimension or the “building of alternative worlds” (Bryant 2014) materialises as an alternative path of movement - enabling humans the ability to escape existing conditions such as those of extractive measures, creating the possibility of projecting new realities through the relations and intermingling of ecologies and the built environment. Thus, projecting an alternative future for the territory by rendering ecological and intrinsic processes visible. <br","Arctic; Ecology; power; territory; architecture; conflict; extreme; polar; environment","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Furthermore, the ambition is to empower the local culture of fashion craftsmanship and create a sustainable alternative for shopping in the city centre of Bandung. Designing both a fashion incubator and a public market has facilitated this sustainable alternative. This project focuses on the methodology of the Shared Heritage Lab within the Architectural Engineering graduation studio. First, a thesis was written on low-tech climate strategies in colonial buildings in Bandung. The conducted theory was the leading theme of the design process, in which the existing colonial building of Hotel Swarha is taken as a case study. This resulted in the re-use of the existing concrete building, a new wooden structure, a bridge, an enclosed courtyard garden and a new roof that extends both constructions. By using existing resources and a low-tech building approach, newly built buildings can be more sustainable, reducing building waste and energy consumption. By hosting craftsmen and entrepreneurs from the local fashion industry, the local community is encouraged to develop a more sustainable style with a regional character. The heart of the existing building serves as a learning platform for designers. The ground floor, the new building and the roof act as a public and independent market that is semi-outdoors, which extend the urban footprint of the city centre of Bandung. This design project and case study of Hotel Swarha is a successful example of the reuse of shared heritage and passive climate technologies, focusing on context, climate and community. The results of the design project show that this low-tech design requires minimal energy consumption while aiming at a high level of comfort, ultimately benefiting the urban microclimate. In addition, creating an open market is a reinvention of the shopping experience in Indonesia, with a focus on the growth of local entrepreneurs and sustainable production.","Shared Heritage; Passive Climate Systems; Low Tech; Bandung; Indonesia; Fashion Industry; Craftsmanship; Adaptive Re-Use; Wood Construction; Renovation; Colonial History","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","Shared Heritage Lab Bandung","-6.921291, 107.606360"

The result of the deployed experimental design is a non-dominating set of solutions where the trade-off between cost and time is clearly recognised. A policy where both cost and time are considered, with emphasis on time, results in a reduction of both performance indicators.

Through substantial growth, the organization has been pushed into a new position. The niche market was given up for a place among the leading brands in the outdoor industry. The new situation results in fundamentally different market requirements and consumer expectations. A long-term vision for the brand and the development of the product portfolio is more critical than ever. It is, therefore, the central question of this thesis if the organization should expand its offer into new categories. <br/>A variety of strategic design methods, involving various stakeholders and especially consumers in the process, were conducted to analyze the current situation critically. <br/>Internally, a clear vision of the strategic setup of the product &amp; service portfolio was missing. Directly linked to that is the understanding of the brand, its uniqueness and positioning in the market, which is not distinct. The uncertainty results in a tentative culture, through which important industry trends or the right longterm decisions might be missed out. <br/>Reviewing the internal perspective of the brand with external stakeholders revealed that there is a discrepancy between intended brand values and the perceived image. Another discovery was that the growth of sales increased the risk of market saturation and overheating. With the product portfolio getting more and more directed at a broad group of consumers, the brand starts to dilute. <br/>To further grow in revenue and to establish a leading market position in the next 5-10 years, it is crucial to solving the internal and external problems by a strategic approach. The redefinition of the brand was identified as a suitable solution to tackle future orientation from an overarching perspective. <br/>The revised brand defines the primary brand purpose and brand promise, which is to enable lighthearted mountain experiences. This purpose can be realized through the harmonic conjunction of three, typically opposing elements: Serious functionality, cheerful style and nature. This specific combination is unique in the market and differentiates Ortovox from the competition. The new brand DNA builds the base for an innovation process, that translates the brand promise and core values into products and services. <br/>Five concepts with the most promising characteristics and the best brand fit are further elaborated. Care is an after-sales concept that revolutionizes consumer services in the outdoor industry. An emergency GPS is increasing consumers‘ safety during mountain sports. Two typical mountaineering products helmet and harness are enhanced by innovative features, which provide real value in the existing market. The range of concepts is completed by the digital Guide concept, which solves several user needs while broadening the brands‘ value proposition towards many touchpoints in the user journey. An analysis of the commercial viability of three of the concepts is intended to be a basis for decision-making.<br/>By combining a brand-driven approach with consumer-focused methods, this thesis provides strategies and concrete products and services that will help Ortovox to stay successful in the changing context of the next years.","Strategy; Brand; Innovation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

In this project I started out with performing an in depth literature research to get a good understanding on what is expected to change. My expectations that the design and solutions for a self-driving car can be motivated by other factors than human controlled cars is confirmed by this research. These incentives of autonomous transportation and the implications are used as input for the development of a vision for a shared autonomous car for the city in ten years. Scenarios that show different possible types of vehicle with different function were created and a twoseater urban commuter vehicle was chosen to develop further. The different functions of the interior, such as doing work or relaxing instead of driving, but also the wish to sit facing forward and looking outside and the need for a sense of dependability and trust because you are not in charge of the car's movement are integrated in the final design. Considering the small footprint combined with a desired seating layout and ergonomic seating position, affects the exterior and makes for challenging design boundaries in terms of volume. This project is a collaboration with raw material supplier SABIC and therefore another consideration is how this changing system affects the plastic material business and how SABIC can influence this change in the future automotive development. The car is being used for the daily commute, but during off-peak hours it can be hailed by other users with similar needs (urban travel with one or two persons and some room for storage). The shared character of the car makes that it is going to be used more intensively than a privately owned car and therefore the material requirements are different. I decided upon a car that uses polycarbonate for the greenhouse and different grades of polypropylene compounds for panels and glass fiber reinforced polypropylene for structural parts. Additionally, the car operates in a system where the fleetowner that deploys the cars and brings the car in for service, can repair worn out or damaged parts by replacing them with new components. With plastics this is more convenient than with metal panels and the replaced parts are recycled and brought back into the system as building blocks for newly manufactured parts. The opportunities and challenges of designing with thermoplastics are identified and accounted for in both the design of the interior and the exterior. Places where different parts meet in the exterior design are showing deliberate transitions, masking the thermal expansion of the plastic components and hiding misalignments when parts are replaced over time. Also the potential of the integration of visual sensors needed for autonomous handling in polycarbonate greenhouse parts is highlighted. In the interior the working and relaxing functions are implemented by showing a clear division between the working side and relaxing side of the car.","Autonomous car; Design; Interior; Exterior; Plastic; Recycling; Automotive; Self driving; SABIC","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","Throughout the years, incremental iterative approaches have been shown to be excellent tools in describing the complex behaviour of structures under a wide range of circumstances. However, robustness issues arise for quasi-brittle structures due to the potential lost of convergence during the development of abrupt fracture mechanisms. In order to overcome these robustness issues, the framework of sequentially linear analysis (SLA) has been proposed: an event-by-event strategy in which a sequence of scaled linear analyses with decreasing secant stiffness is performed, representing local damage increments. The current SLA-framework is based on a fixed crack approach, potentially causing the development of severe spurious stresses and inaccuracies due to the misalignment of the crack with the principal stress directions. To this end, Hendriks and Rots proposed a model consisting of several parallel fractions or layers, from now on called the sublayer model. Each of the layers is elastic-perfectly brittle, but has different properties, chosen such to represent the overall constitutive softening behaviour as accurate as possible. The layers fail independent of each other and have their own specific crack direction. The main idea is to mimick a rotating crack by a superposition of sublayers with a fixed crack direction. The main goal of this thesis is to further elaborate, generalize and verify the sublayer model for quasi-brittle materials and capture the influence of rotating cracks on the structural response within the framework of existing regular sequentially linear analysis. In this thesis, the frameworks of regular SLA and the sublayer model were connected by a general transition from any saw-tooth law to sublayer material properties. An externalized procedure was created to automatically generate an input file for DIANA FEA and thereby facilitate verification of the sublayer model. Furthermore, the 2-dimensional framework of the sublayer model has been extended towards 3-dimensional structures to broaden the range of application. On top of that, concepts were proposed to improve the sublayer model: the tapered ripple band, reducing the required number of sublayers to reach a specific state by adding more saw-teeth near the end of the softening curve, and an improved algorithm, making use of the fact that the order of brittle fracture of the sublayers is known in advance, such that only those integration points that can actually become critical are monitored, thereby reducing computational efforts significantly. In this thesis, the sublayer model is proved to mimick a rotating crack within the framework of existing regular sequentially linear analysis based on a set of structural case studies (notched beam, shear notched beam, DEN-beam, full scale facade and full scale concrete dam). Compared to regular SLA, effects of stress locking are reduced, less wide localization bands are found and a more realistic collapse pattern is observed, thereby making the sublayer model more interesting for application in engineering practice. Furthermore, it has been shown that for the 3-dimensional framework of the sublayer model the same conclusions as for 2D can be made. In the authors opinion, the contributions of this thesis are a step towards a robust generally applicable computational method to simulate the complex structural behaviour of quasibrittle materials.","Sequentially linear analysis; rotating crack model; fraction model; quasi-brittle materials; mode I; Concrete damage; orthotropic damage","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

The rapid pace of unplanned urbanization trends in the hill stations of India has resulted in the degradation of the quality of public space networks of hill stations which are of primary importance to the structure and quality of the urban environment. The present scenario of development in hill stations have resulted in extreme pressures in the built environment such as problems related to congestion, overcrowding, pollution and inadequate infrastructure which has resulted in a change in their morphology. Urban identity is a concept which entails a certain quality of life for the urban residents and can be used as a tool for maintaining quality of life in the face of rapid urbanization. Form, activity and meanings are the aspects which contribute to sense of place and it is these aspects which contribute to identity of a place. Due to change in building typology from the low-rise bungalow typology to the midrise apartment buildings which now graze the skyline of the neighbourhood this shift has seen a neglect in the urban infrastructure (movement networks) which provide accessibility as well as behave as a public realm. This neglect has been noticed in the rise of unsafe neighbourhood streets. This thesis aims to identify aspects of the urban environment, both tangible(physical) and intangible (mental and social), which contributes to the making of urban identity. It aims to provide a strategy, based on the qualities of urban identity, for one of the oldest townships of Shillong city which had seen a gradual decline in the quality of the network of public space structure which exists in the neighbourhood in order to bring back life to the network of public spaces in order to make them safe and also provide a better living environment for the residents. Drawing on such understandings the aim is to create a design strategy which aims at recreating these informal pedestrian streets as the social and public realm of the city.<br","place identity; Place Making; Public realm; informal pathways; Hilltowns","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","","25.5788, 91.8933"

All students joining this graduation lab focus on the question ‘How to evolve important heritage structures and areas of Bandung, in order to realise inclusive, thriving, and healthy environments for working, living and leisure?’. Within the scope of this question the issues found in the Pasar Baru Area in Bandung are addressed in the research and the design of this graduation project. The area is located in the middle of the city centre, has always been one of the major trade hubs of Bandung and is the old Chinese and Arabic neighbourhood. During the Dutch colonialization of Indonesia, the area developed in an interesting spatial way, as the city blocks, are characterized by an ‘inner’ and an ‘outer world’. The outer world consist of the periphery of the city blocks, where the shophouses, owned by Chinese merchants, define the spatial and urban character of the area. Behind those shophouses, in the middle of the city blocks which is called the ‘urban pocket’, the local Sundanese community resided in their kampung houses. This urban development resulted in an interesting spatial, social and economical balance in this part of the city. Nowadays, however, this balance is under threat, because of commercial investments, densification and pollution. In order to stop the process of decay in the Pasar Baru area and to create a pleasant environment for working, living and leisure, the design aims to restore the former balance in the area and to create a comfortable place for all the inhabitants, traders and customers. In this design the values of the heritage, the community and the environment are taken into account. This results in an urban strategy focussed on the restoration of the balance between the ‘inner’ and the ‘outer world’ of the city block, whilst still allowing for further densification to happen in this urban context. These rules guarantee a comfortable environment to live, work and relax, for a diverse group of people and also stimulate the use of more traditional building techniques in the architecture, in order to create a new local atmosphere in the area, and to take the issues of climate change into account. This strategy is further elaborated into an architectural design for the urban pocket, which consists of an expandable kampung house based on easy-to-understand building methods using only timber and bamboo. This house allows for cheap and comfortable housing and guarantees a pleasant residential environment for all the residents of the urban pocket. In order to guide the process of densification and commercialisation in the area, the urban strategy is also focussed on the design of the architecture in the periphery of the city block. To provide space for small businesses and to reintroduce housing into the area, four existing shophouses are retrofitted into a mini-market for street vendors and small shops and on top of those a timber high-rise structure is designed to house small studio apartments. The flexibility and the climate adaptivity of the building is created by the design of several movable panels in the interior and in the façade. Felt and glass panels in the interior allow the residents to arrange their own privacy and comfort, whilst a system of louvre and woven bamboo panels in the façade allow for enough natural ventilation to create a comfortable indoor climate. The bridge between the urban pocket and the periphery is created by low-rise apartments for families, where a similar building system is applied. The use of plants and grasses in the roofs, the facades and in the public realm of the urban pocket, create a comfortable environment for all residents and finalise the strategy, where all the urban pockets together are the lungs of the Pasar Baru area, both metaphorically as physically.","Southeast Asia; Bandung; Shared Heritage; Pasar Baru Area; Urban densification; Climate resiliant inner-city live-work typologies","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Heritage & Architecture","Shared Heritage Lab Bandung","-6.918786, 107.604134"

It is essential for automotive engineers to combine the knowledge of vehicle dynamics and control theory to develop useful applications that meet requirements of improved safety, comfort and performance. A road vehicle is equipped with several actuators that can assist a user during a dynamic driving task and ensure overall system reliability. Using all available actuators effectively to make a vehicle move in the desired manner is necessary. Typically, the available actuators outnumber the states of motion to be controlled. Such mechanical systems are referred to as over-actuated.<br/><br/>An effective way to control an over-actuated system is through the use of control allocation (CA). CA ensures coordination between, and the optimal use, of all available actuators. This strategy also considers the limits of the actuators. Despite its features, a lot of CA methods have a drawback that actuator dynamics are neglected. This drawback has been addressed with a method called model predictive control allocation (MPCA). The behaviour of mechanical actuators is usually approximated by simplified models. Un-modelled system dynamics are always a source of uncertainty. Also, the aging of actuators introduces the element of uncertainty. The ability of MPCA to handle uncertainties is investigated and a solution is proposed to overcome this shortcoming. The proposed solution is the combination of an online adaptive parameter estimator with the MPCA strategy. This way, the CA solver is constantly updated with the parameters of each actuator. This technique is used to design vehicle stability controllers and their performance on simulation is reported.<br/><br/>The results indicate that the proposed control allocation technique is effective for vehicle stability control in various scenarios. However, scope for betterment has been recognised and relevant recommendations are made, to conclude this work.<br","vehicle dynamics control; Control Allocation; Automotive Applications; systems and control","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Vehicle Engineering","",""

In this work, the ideas of Erik Verlinde are presented as well as the field equations of CEG. The aim of this thesis is to find experimentally verifiable results for CEG. From the field equations we derive a general gravitational lensing formalism for CEG that is applicable to general lensing systems. This thesis also includes an attempt at an expanding universe model for a vacuum or matter dominated universe. Subsequently, a numerical algorithm is presented to solve for the non-linear differential equations in CEG and MOND in Newtonian regimes for general matter distributions using Fourier transformations. A faster version of this algorithm for cylindrical symmetric matter distributions using Fourier-Bessel transformations is also presented. This algorithm is tested on both the Sun and galaxy NGC6503. Next, the rotation curves as predicted by CEG and MOND of 132 galaxies are compared to the observed velocities using the SPARC data set. The velocities are fitted using three fit parameters and a Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm. Both theories show good fits to the observed velocities. We conclude that no differences between the predictions of CEG and MOND can be made on the basis of rotation curves, but that covariant features (such as gravitational lensing) might be used to distinguish between the two theories. An important test for both theories can be provided by a comparison between strong lensing measurements and rotation curves for a single galaxies.","Gravity; Emergent Gravity; EG; Covariant Emergent Gravity; CEG; Rotation Curves; SPARC; Gravitational lensing; Modified Newtonian Dynamics; MOND; Theoretical Physics; Fourier-Bessel transformations; Galaxies; Cosmology; Astrophysics; General relativity","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics | Applied Physics","",""

Three models have been developed for a spatial logistic network, on which packages are delivered by vehicles and another<br/>model was developed to describe interactions between the customers, the stores and the deliverers, which does not explicitly take delivery time into account like before. The former three models consist of an agent-based model (ABM), and two different (differential) equation-based models (EBMs). One of the EBMs is built from the bottom up, and was created by averaging the randomness in the ABM. The other EBM was built top-down and involved optimizing a general model with respect to some parameters, such that its solution resembles the<br/>ABM solution as closely as possible. These three models were tested and compared in the first half of the thesis.<br/><br/>In the second part of the thesis, the focus shifted to a generalized model (GM) approach of underlying interactions on multi-commodity dynamical <br/>flow networks; especially the dynamics describing order placement,<br/>scheduling and delivery. Such a network is cyclic and contains a feedback loop, where customers are less likely to order more products if they were recently delivered. This can range from someone not needing to purchase a<br/>car if they just bought a brand new one to one not needing to order dinner when they just did so. Such networks are in general described by four kinds of elasticities in this thesis, namely the elasticities to stock, inventory level,<br/>saturation, and co-production. These influence different parts in the network. For example, the negative elasticities to inventory level model that high inventory levels inhibit more inventory production, to prevent build-up,<br/>and low inventory levels allow for larger inventory production, to prevent drainage. The other elasticities fulfil similar roles. This model was tested using a bifurcation analysis, a statistical ensemble method and by computing influences and sensitivities of parts and nodes in the network.","Agent-Based Modeling; Differential Equations; Generalized Models; Dynamical flow; Multi-commodity; Logistics; Bifurcation; Package transport","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics | Computational Science and Engineering","",""

People suffering from ET are restricted in their ability to function in everyday life, due to a constraint of performing delicate movements. Simple tasks, such as drinking and eating are a great challenge for individuals diagnosed with ET. <br/><br/>STIL B.V. works on the development of an alternative solution to dampen a forearm tremor. STIL B.V. is developing a product that dampens the tremor by actively counteracting the movement of its users. With this, the product offers tremor patients a solution that does not involve surgery or use of medication. <br/><br/>The project focuses on finding improvements for the STIL product by developing a solution for recently diagnosed ET patients with an invalidating forearm tremor. The final goal was to create a product that would improve the life quality of its users, by giving individuals with ET back control over their arms. ET patients often mentioned that it is difficult to be in a group or participate in a social activity. Awkward situations occur frequently, making them socially shy. The objective was to help patients regain social confidence by making use of the product. <br/><br/>The final product proposal exists of two parts, a brace and an active dampening element (Exshell). The brace is used to connect the Exshell to the arm. The Exshell contains an active dampening element to stabilize the arm. At the start of this project, the development of the brace, the part that has contact with the skin, was not yet started. A simple elastic band combined with a coarse vibration measurement principle was used for the prototypes. <br/><br/>An efficient attachment method to the users arm and a connection to the Exshell have been designed, made and tested. Additionally a set of different brace sizes has been developed to create a comfortable design for an as large as possible target group. <br/><br/>To stimulate the use of the product, a brace has been designed that is as comfortable as possible. This has been done by making an optimized ergonomic design for ET patients. The brace can be worn all day by the user and when needed the Exshell can be slid over the wrist and actively counteract forearm tremors. <br/><br/>An ergonomic test on healthy individuals has been conducted in order to discover the fit of the different developed brace sizes. The used scaling method for different sizes proved to be effective and by offering five different sizes a comfortable fit can be offered to almost everyone. <br/><br/>The usability and functionality of the brace design has been validated during a patient test. The test showed that the brace is easy to use for tremor patients.<br/><br/>The final design result presents a proposal of how the future product of STIL BV. might look like.

Moreover, they require additional data to train translators, hindering efficient extension to new languages. In this work, we introduce a Language-consistent Open Relation Extraction Model (LOREM). By adding a language-consistent component to the current state-of-the-art open relation extraction model, we enable exploitation of information from multiple languages. Since we remove all dependencies on language-specific knowledge and external NLP tools such as translators, it is relatively easy to extend our model to new languages. An extensive evaluation performed on 5 languages shows that LOREM outperforms state-of-the-art monolingual and cross-lingual open relation extractors. Moreover, experiments on low- and even no-resource languages indicate that LOREM generalizes to other languages than the languages that it is trained on.","Open Relation Extraction; Natural Language Processing; Information Extraction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science","",""

They can additionally benefit from a high energy environment, for example, strong currents and waves could disperse fish farm waste. However, an open water environment accompanies longer or steeper waves and harsher weather conditions where the structures could be exerted by a higher environmental loading and damaged by larger displacements or motions. Therefore, non-linear interaction between wave and structure needs to be investigated to get a better understanding of an accidental phenomenon which might impact on structures.<br/><br/>The collar structure above nets, shaped typically in a torus, consists of either single or double pipes, usually made of high-density polyethylene.

This building material is used twice as much as all the other building materials combined. Furthermore, the United Nations predicts that human global population will reach 10 billion inhabitants by 2050. Correspondingly, it is projected that due to global migration from land to cities, almost 75% of the world’s population will be urbanized. For the building industry, this means that in thirty years we will roughly equal the entire volume of the construction made in the world’s history. In other words, the consumption of concrete is predicted to double over the next three decades. Given the importance that concrete has for the building industry, the ability to optimise the material usage can have a global impact in reducing both pressure from the natural environment and carbon footprint. To fully exploit the potential of concrete in a cost-effective and environmentally sensible way represents one of the greatest challenges posed to building technology today. The research question has been formulated based on this problem statement: How can a prefabricated structural concrete slab be designed to optimise the use of concrete, minimise material waste and allow for efficient (dis)assembly and reuse to extend its exploitation life? Currently, one of the main issues to reuse concrete elements is the implementation of steel rebars as reinforcement. This type of reinforcement corrodes and causes internal cracks in the concrete elements. This means that after time, the element cannot be reused as its structural capacity is compromised. This has led this research towards investigating novel strategies to provide concrete with tensile strength. Fibre reinforced concrete (FRC) emerges as a potential solution. However, it is well known that the performance of FRC largely depends on the orientation of its fibres. To achieve this, production methods that can achieve a controlled fibre orientation are also reviewed. Here, 3D printing concrete (3DCP) emerges as an approach worthy to be explored. It has been observed that the fibres orient parallel to the deposition of the concrete layer. If this strategy is applied, this means that a printing path can be programmed and, the fibres will orient accordingly. A general outlook of 3DCP characteristics is reviewed in this research. Consequently, such characteristics are applied to the design of the reusable 3DCP slab. Besides the material characteristics, Circular Economy (CE) presents strategies to exploit the full potential and retain the optimal value of the physical environment. Principles of the CE are reviewed in this research through literature study. Special consideration has been put in the principle of Design for Reuse (DfR) as the objective of this research is to enable multi service-lives of the new 3DCP slab. Suitable aspects have been identified and applied to the design based on the properties of concrete and fabrication techniques. Here, the engineering of dry mechanical connections is sensible as the 3DCP slab can be efficiently demounted without the need to break or cut part of the slab. The simplicity of the connections is crucial in this research as this translates into savings of energy and CO2 emissions due to a rapid building process. Furthermore, the simplicity of the connection means an easy replacement upon damage without affectation to the whole concrete slab. The engineering and mechanical performance of the connections are addressed in this research. To conclude the research, the utility of the reusable 3DCP slab is studied. The results are compared to those of a traditional concrete slab and conclusions are drawn to assess the relevance of this new approach to reduce concrete consumption. Economic utility, policies and business models are excluded from this research as they are not the main focus and due to time constraints. This master thesis answers the research question by designing a concrete slab that can optimise the usage of concrete. This is achieved both by material characteristics, production process and the engineering of demountable connections. However, further physical research and testing are needed to properly evaluate the production process and its applicability to the current design. Nevertheless, the result looks promising.","concrete; concrete slab; design for reuse (DfR); circular economy (CE); dry connections; 3D printing concrete (3DCP); fibre reinforced concrete (FRC)","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Building Technology | Sustainable Design","",""

Observations point towards a diverse range of potential drivers; however, without uncovering why the identified factors are found to control diurnal ET-VPD hysteresis. Modelling efforts have laid a theoretical foundation to unravel the compound effect of surface and atmospheric states on this hysteresis. However, so far these models have been unable to realistically incorporate the non-linear feedbacks between atmosphere and surface, and lack a vegetation representation that reflects the underlying biological mechanisms. To unravel in what manner the characteristics of ET-VPD hysteresis are controlled, multi-scale observations spanning biology, meteorology, and hydrology from the CloudRoots campaign are combined with modelling in a novel manner. For the first time a proof-of-concept is delivered for reproducing ET-VPD hysteresis with a model that incorporates both surface-atmosphere feedbacks as well as a mechanistic vegetation component. Observations are used for parameter initialization and evaluation to ensure that the modelled hysteresis curve and underlying processes represent a realistic case. Next, this calibrated model is used for a sensitivity analysis. The results show that both the early morning state of the surface and the state of the atmosphere influence the characteristics of the hysteresis loop with respect to its width, height, and initial slope. Via control of the stomatal aperture, soil moisture stress and the vegetation’s capacity to assimilate CO2 for photosynthesis affect the height and width of the curve. The height of the hysteresis loop is significantly affected by entrainment of warm dry air, while its width is minorly impacted. The characteristic fingerprint of entrainment is distinctly different to that of soil moisture stress and the capacity for CO2 uptake. The sensitivity analysis applied to our observationally inspired case, appears to facilitate quantification of the strongest model responses to changing external forcings and parameters. Therefore, the presented approach offers a promising tool, allowing further research into the controlling mechanisms of ET-VPD hysteresis.","evaporation; modelling; Boundary Layer; atmosphere; sensitivity analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","CloudRoots","50.9, 6.5"

A characteristic of this communication is the high trial-to-trial spike variability. To explain this variability, balanced network models have been introduced. The interaction between excitatory and inhibitory neurons in those models, can perform active decorrelation of spike trains, resulting in uncorrelated asynchronous inputs. This asynchronous regime is important, because it can realistically mimic different types of cortical activity. Inside the asynchronous regime, classical and heterogeneous asynchrony, supporting respectively small or large fluctuations in instantaneous rate, can be distinguished. The latter is proposed to enable better separation of stimuli. Because classical balanced network models neglect the differences in network configuration between layers, this study aims to investigate the effect of different network configurations on the expressed regime of dynamics in a locally connected balanced network. The locally connected network model consisted of layer 2/3, layer 4 and a thalamus. Results showed a heterogeneous asynchronous regime of dynamics in layer 2/3, suggesting highly variable single-neuron firing rates. These findings are in line with the expectation that single-neurons in layer 2/3 would exhibit highly variable single-neuron firing rates to improve separation between stimuli. The classical asynchronous regime identified in layer 4, enables this layer to accurately transfer information to layer 2/3. Slight differences between the different network configurations in layer 2/3 were found, showing that compositions that contain fewer inhibitory neurons favor heterogeneous asynchrony. Future research should further extend the research to different network configurations, as this might provide more realistic network dynamics.","balanced network; local connectivity; network configuration; asynchronous state","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-07-05","","","","Biomedical Engineering | BioMechatronics","",""

The project focuses on the future demands of the Amsterdam Municipality in which they expect an increase of 70.000 new households and 50.000 new working areas over the coming 30 - 40 years in Havenstad area. More people are moving from their village to the city or the suburbs, creating a full expanse of the city boundary and less space to accommodate the residents. However, the Municipality acknowledge the fact that this growth also brings difficulty in the accommodation of the expected households. Amsterdam Havenstad has been chosen to be the new urban core for these developments. The area is well-known for its extensive industries and enterprises, making this area rich and profound for the economic heart of the city, which will make its shift towards a mixed-use region for industry and residents. To accommodate these amount of people, the Municipality sees new opportunities in technological innovations and sees the use of a car as a potential problem in terms of land-use and health. Therefore, project HUMAM will analyse and research the Sloterdijk area, to accommodate a transportation hub for the city. This hub enables the district to ban the car and put the focus on Automated Vehicles and shared possibilities. To keep Sloterdijk connected, the hub will perform as the catalyst for the area.

Despite its wide use, the model is focused on vehicular trips and fails to represent the demand of walking activity. The limited work that has been performed to address the misrepresentation of walking in the context of the FSM, still does not address the last step of the four step model, the assignment of the walking trips to the network. Stemming from this literature gap, and the need to enhance the role of walking activity within the transportation modeling, the main question of this thesis is to develop a method for the assignment of the walking trips to the street network. This research suggest a methodology to model large continuous space and walking trips on it. Thus, the focus is on modeling walking space taking into account the pedestrian scale for the model. To implement that, the size of the spatial analysis zones of the FSM is adjusted to walking scale. Next, continuous walking space is defined by the BGT spatial dataset that offers information for the land covers. In order to model continuous walking space two space discretization techniques are compared; first, Constrained Delaunay Triangulation (CDT) is applied on the walking area polygon, second, a regular quadrilateral grid is overlaid with the walking area. Walking activity is modeled on the network that is formed with the dual graph of each discretization method. In a subsequent step, the trip injection is performed with zone centroids and connectors which were created with the point clustering algorithm DBSCAN having as input points the graph nodes. Finally, A* algorithm is used for deterministic an all-or-nothing network assignment. The results of the applied methodology show that addressing walking within the FSM requires a finer grained approach due to the more localized scale of walking activity. Walking space needs to be defined as a continuous surface. In order to model such surface at the scale of the FSM, a discretization method is required to handle continuous space at large scale. Comparing the result of the two discretization techniques, polygon triangulation and regular grid, the triangulation dual graph results to the ’skeleton’ of the polygon while the regular grid dual graph offers a more dense and homogeneous polygon representation. Additionally, in the trip injection process, the nodes of the regular grid perform better than the triangulation graph nodes. Overall, throughout the whole implementation, the performance of using a regular grid, outweighs the polygon triangulation as discretization method.","walking trips; pedestrian trip assignment; four step model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Literature research and the field study conducted in this project show that menstruation is very negatively experienced by women, regardless of how heavy their menstruation is experienced. Their moods are mostly influenced by pain and the inconvenience of bleeding, while the study also showed that the biggest obstacle in daily life is the fluctuating moods caused by hormones. These fluctuations exist in personal patterns, but no literature nor this project’s field study shows universal patterns in mood fluctuations. The most practised mood strategies are rest, withdraw and repress. The study shows that female students do not want to show weakness, they want to work as well as they normally do at university and take painkillers to do so. They ignore all other struggles which tends to exhaust them, resulting in a lack of energy when they arrive home. This is when they finally rest and withdraw, as desired. This project presents the product ‘Mood Booth’ as a solution to these problems. The Mood Booth is a room, centrally placed in every university, for menstruating students to withdraw in. The room is designed for these students to perform a ritual in. This ritual is based on the two resilience-focused mood-regulation strategies most valuable to most menstruating women: embrace (embracing and accepting moods) and detach (distinguish between self and mood and engagement in mindfulness). The design of the Mood Booth’s interior stimulates the practise of these two mood regulation strategies in a twenty-minute ritual, which is guided by light changes. A visit to the Mood Booth should result into a more positive mood, a calmer state of mind and more strength on the long-term to benefit both the academic performance and the quality of personal time during menstruation. The outside of the Mood Booth is a statement, through both location and through the message on the front of the Mood Booth, against the stigma attached to menstruation. The Mood Booth aims to improve moods and does so by stimulating resilience-focused mood-regulation strategies, which answers closely to the design brief. The Mood Booth is also created to answer to the issues found in the research, while also tackling the stigma around menstruation.","menstruation; design for mood; mood resilience; female university students","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

While first observed as host-based infections with low activity, the release of an efficient browser-based cryptomining application -- as introduced by Coinhive in 2017 -- has skyrocketed cryptojacking activity in recent years. This novel method of monetizing Web activity attracted both website owners and cybercriminals seeking new methods to profit from. Website owners installed a cryptominer on their domains, while cybercriminals deployed cryptominers in large campaigns spread over numerous domains. Several studies developed detection methods to identify these browser-based cryptominers on websites, but none of these studies focused on the extent and coordination of campaigns deployed by adversaries. Furthermore, the prevalence of cryptojacking on websites is not well estimated yet and the potentially largest attack vector -- a man-in-the-middle attack -- has never been researched before.<br/>In this thesis, we perform multiple large studies on cryptojacking to fill these gaps. After crawling a random sample of 49M domains, 20% of the Internet, we conclude that cryptojacking is present on 0.011% of all domains and that adult content is the most prevalent category of websites affected. We show that this percentage is significantly larger in the popular part of the Internet. This led to the conclusion that surveying solely domains listed in the Alexa Top 1M to estimate cryptojacking prevalence results in an overestimation of the problem. Furthermore, we show that infection rates on different Top Level Domains (TLDs) differ widely, as the Russian zone is home to a disproportionate number of cryptojacking domains, while other large TLDs -- such as .com -- show a significantly lower number of infections.<br/>In another crawl, we have identified 204 cryptojacking campaigns on websites, an order of magnitude more than previous work, which indicates that the extent of these campaigns is heavily underestimated. The results of the two crawls combined reveal that 48% of all cryptojacking activity on websites is organized. The identified campaigns ranged in sizes from only 5 to 987 websites and we discovered that cybercriminals have chosen third-party software -- such as WordPress and Drupal -- as their method of choice for spreading cryptojacking infections efficiently. With a novel method of using NetFlow data recorded in a Tier 1 network, we estimated the popularity of mining applications, which showed that while Coinhive has a larger installed base, CoinImp WebSocket proxies were digesting significantly more traffic in the second half of 2018.<br/>We have reported about a new attack vector that drastically overshadows all other cryptojacking activity. Through a firmware vulnerability in MikroTik routers, cybercriminals are able to rewrite outgoing user traffic and embed cryptomining code in every outgoing Web connection. Thus, every Web page visited by any user behind an infected router would mine to profit the adversaries. Based on the aforementioned NetFlow data, weekly third-party crawls and network telescope traffic, we were able to follow their activities over a period of 10 months. We report on the modus operandi and coordinating infrastructure of the perpetrators, which were during this period in control of up to 1.4M routers, which is approximately 70% of all MikroTik devices deployed in the world. During the peak of this attack, more than 440K routers were infected concurrently.<br/>We have discovered that half of the infected routers are patched within 18 days after compromise, but 30% of the infections last longer than 50 days. Additionally, we observed different levels of sophistication among adversaries, ranging from individual installations to campaigns involving large numbers of routers. The combination of datasets allowed us to link tens of seemingly different infections to one actor.<br/>Our analysis of cryptojacking with a focus on organized campaigns has shown that cybercriminals have successfully discovered a new method for monetary gain. With the discontinuation of Coinhive due to decreased Monero prices in March 2019, the cryptojacking landscape has changed enormously, and we are curious who will fill this power vacuum. As browser-based mining is not anywhere near as profitable as it was in early 2018, we believe that singular cryptojacking activity -- by individual website owners -- will decrease. However, we expect adversaries to find possibilities of deploying cryptojacking at an even larger scale to still be profitable. This stresses the importance of researching campaigns, as the reuse of techniques, tactics and procedures in deploying them provides an effective angle to detect and mitigate these malicious activities. With prices decreasing throughout 2018, one would expect that this problem will eventually solve itself. Apart from the discontinuation of Coinhive, there is no clear indication that this is the case, as Monero prices have started to recover in the first months of 2019. If this trend continues, we expect to experience another outbreak of large cryptojacking campaigns, as robust defenses are still not widely implemented.","cryptojacking; cybercrime; cybersecurity; Cyber Threat Intelligence; Cyber-attacks","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-03-01","","","","Computer Science | Data Science and Technology","",""

Impact hammering is the conventional method for installing offshore monopiles but has several disadvantages. Time-consuming installation procedures, high noise emissions and steel fatigue due to the high impact are problems resulting from this installation procedure. GBM Works is a start-up that is currently developing the Vibro-drill: a new method for installing monopiles, aiming to solve the stated problems associated with the hammering method. The Vibro-drill is mounted at the bottom of monopile and uses vibrating elements that simultaneously jet water, aiming to reduce the soil resistance. As a result, the monopile can penetrate the soil to target depth under its own weight. The monopile foundation is designed to support an offshore wind turbine throughout its lifetime of about 25 years. As the wind turbine is primarily subjected to lateral loads, one of the major design requirements is the stability of the pile in terms of lateral bearing capacity. Hammered piles have shown to provide sufficient lateral bearing capacity and this method has been used world-wide to install monopile foundations. Because the Vibro-drill machine is a unique and new concept, there is insufficient knowledge about the installation effects. Therefore, the lateral bearing capacity of a Vibro-drill installed pile is yet unknown. Before this new method can enter the offshore wind market, it needs to be researched and demonstrated that this new method provides sufficient bearing capacity for an offshore wind turbine. To that end, this thesis contains a study regarding the possible soil effects and resulting bearing capacity of Vibro-drill installed monopiles. Predictions of the monopile response were done with a finite element model in Plaxis 3D. The numerical model was verified based on data from monopile tests in Cuxhaven from 2014. During these full-scale field tests, three pile pairs were installed in dense sand by vibro-driving and hammering. The effect of the methods was quantified by lateral load tests on both piles. The input parameters for the Plaxis model were derived from CPT measurements using empirical relations based on relative density recommended for monopile design. The FEM predictions show a fit with the field-measurements during initial loading where after the curves start to deviate. The differences between the FEM prediction and the field measurements are discussed, expected is that they are caused by creep effects that occur in the field. As no soil effects as result from Vibro-drill installation have yet been measured, a worst-case approach was taken to identify the risks concerning the lateral bearing capacity. A hypothetic soil disturbance as result of Vibro-drill installation was generated based on studies regarding soil effect due to existing vibrating and jetting methods. Different worst-case scenarios of possible soil effects were sketched to study the resulting pile reaction due to a horizontal applied load. This was done by comparing the monopile response of a hammered and vibro-drill installed pile and increasing the pile size of the Vibro-drilled pile iteratively until a similar reaction to the hammered pile was obtained. In this way, the effect of a Vibro-drill installation was quantified in terms of additional pile material. For the studied scenarios, an additional proportion ranging from 17% to 29% of the embedded pile material was required to compensate for the softer pile reaction. Also, a study on the effect of pile size has shown that for larger piles, a lower proportion of additional pile material is required to compensate for a possible softer pile response resulting from Vibro-drill installation.","lateral bearing capacity; Vibro-drill; vibratory driving; monopile; wind turbine; offshore installation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","European Wind Energy Masters (EWEM)","",""

The PCA framework is a design approach consisting of three phases; form-finding, performance evaluation and optimisation. The conventional workflow in regard to sun shading design is defined as a combination of tools for each of the PCA framework phases. The feasibility of this conventional workflow is explored based on an example case. This example case refers to a fictional office high-rise building in a tropic climate with an all-glass exterior, which is optimised on visual and thermal comfort. The selected sun shading system is an adaptation of the egg-crate system, which has an increased potential over other shading systems for this specific building typology in tropic climates. All further assumptions for the fictional example case are based on common trends in architectural design. Based on the optimisation results of the example case using the conventional workflow, the challenges limiting the feasibility of the workflow are identified. Proposals for overcoming these challenges resulted in the development of the next generation workflow. The core concept of this next generation workflow is to split up the workflow in three parts; preparation, execution and interpretation. First tests using the next generation workflow indicated it is significantly faster on a single high-end computer, compared to the conventional workflow. In addition, the next generation workflow offers a solution to some limitations in running sun shading optimisations in grid- and render farm environments.","Performative computational architecture; Visual comfort; Thermal comfort; Evolutionary optimization; Sun shading; Building technology; Design informatics; Building physics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","",""

A 19 MW ATES system containing 23 cold and 23 warm wells to a depth of 180 meters is needed. Cooling during summertime is not sufficient to charge the system to meet the winter heating demand; therefore an additional solar thermal collector field of 35.000 m2 is needed.

Architecture is often meant as a mediator between bodies and their surroundings, however, actually realising this aspiration is rather difficult. In the research it is argued that simply defining what bodies are and what their needs are—and then creating designs based on these definitions—can be a problematic approach with regards to topics of empowerment and inclusivity in architecture. Namely because this approach can create norms on which bodies matter (and which do not) and on how bodies should behave in certain spaces. The approach leaves no space for body-surrounding-relations to grow and change and—finally—it ignores the interdepency that exists between bodies and their surroundings. Bodies are never not somewhere, and this somewhere is never not shaped by our bodies being there. With this project, I set the ambition to reject all knowledge about what bodies are and instead focus on what it is that bodies can do somewhere, sometime. I chose to engage with my own neighbourhood: Bospolder-Tussendijken, in the city of Rotterdam. More specifically, with an organisation called the Zelfregiehuis, which focusses on empowering the residents of the neighbourhood through the organisation of various activities. What bodies can do somewhere is influenced by a great variety of factors. For this project, I identified three factors—or considerations: (urban) regulations, tools and techniques and the construction time and place. These can be seen as knowledge fields within our profession, meaning that we—as architects—can care for, think about and incorporate these considerations when designing and intervening somewhere. The interventions that are proposed give the sites new ‘base layers’, which allow for more spontaneous uses, without compromising on aspects like safety and technical performance. Additionally, the interventions are made so that afterwards, fewer specialised tools and techniques are needed for use/adaptation. Finally, the construction processes are divided up into events, to turn the affecting of surroundings into something that is done together, and that is open to continuous change (just like our bodies).","norms; bodies; architecture; standardisation; definitions; mediation; situated knowledges; affordances; potentials; situated practices; feminist practices; alternative spatial practice; urban regulations; tools and techniques; construction time and process; metalogues; thinking sites; empowerment; constantly becoming; considerations","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","",""

The proposed unit of measurement is comprehensive of outdoor and indoor spaces, the latter comprising both residential and non-residential space. As a test case, the Haven-Stad project in Amsterdam was chosen, specifically its second phase, Sloterdijk One, envisioned by the municipality of Amsterdam to host 11220 households and 7480 working places by 2040. The sizes of typical households, as well as a series of other KPI’s (Key Performance Indicators) were computed in different neighbourhoods of Amsterdam based on their similarities with the vision of Sloterdijk One. In the second part of this thesis, the resulting size of the households were used as a design parameter in a custom-made prototype tool to generate semi-automatically several design proposals (called scenarios) for urban developments. Additionally, each scenario can be converted into a Geo format to visualize it in web-based virtual platforms such as Google Earth and Cesium JS. Significant differences among the resulting design proposals based on this new unit of measurement were encountered, meaning that the average size of a household plays indeed a major role.","Urban Planning; Parametric Design; virtual city models; size of living space","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","Stad van de Toekomst",""

Reducing this load is a key step towards minimizing India's greenhouse gas emissions. One culprit is the routine use of fully glazed façades which are chosen for aesthetics but are neither energy efficient nor effective at providing adequate thermal comfort. A double skin façade (DSF) can help reduce the heat gain of a building by exhaustion heat through cavity ventilation, while still providing the aesthetics of a fully glazed façade. The higher thermal resistance can also help provide better indoor thermal comfort to occupants. However, due to the high cost of DSFs, their complex thermal behaviour and overheating risk in the cavity an assessment of the effectiveness of the system in warmer climates of India is needed. This study evaluates the energy saving potential and thermal comfort enhancements with mechanically ventilated DSFs in different climate zones of the Indian subcontinent. A numerical model created in the MATLAB/Simulink platform, employing the zonal approach and verified against Design Builder was used for simulating the thermal behaviour. Optimization of the façade design was based on three parameters: 1) cavity width, 2) cavity ventilation rate and 3) glazing systems. The sensitivity of these design parameters to the performance of the DSF was analysed before proposing optimized configurations for different sites based on their local climate. These optimized configurations are then evaluated against a single skin fully glazed façade. The parameters used for evaluating the energy saving potential are annual heat gain and annual heat loss. For thermal comfort and overheating risk, the temperature distributions were analysed. In comparison with a single skin façade, it is found that the façade orientations with the highest incident solar radiation, usually the South, East and West facing façades, provide the most improvement, up to 50% reduction in heat gain annually. Heat loss was reduced by 25-35% at each site, however, this proves to be irrelevant for sites with mild winters. This corresponded to the arid, semi-arid, humid subtropical and montane climate zones found in India. Thermal comfort was maintained by the DSF for both warm and cool walls. This was also found to be the case for the single skin façade, hence, no additional improvement to thermal comfort was achieved with respect to radiant asymmetries. Overheating in the cavity was mitigated through the application of tinted glazing in the external envelope, ventilation rates of up to 80AC/hr and larger cavity widths. Optical properties of the external envelope have the largest impact on the reduction in heat gain regardless of the façade’s spatial orientation and façades with low direct solar radiation were found to be insensitive to changes in cavity width and ventilation rate. The findings of the study suggest that DSFs have an important energy saving potential in warm climates and the design recommendation can be utilized to mitigate overheating and excess heat gain which is seen as an issue even in cooler climate zones.<br","double skin facade; numerical modelling; warm climate; energy efficiency; thermal comfort; India","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Building Engineering","",""

Flood defences must meet requirements which are based on an allowed flood probability. Safety assessments are performed to check whether flood defences meet these requirements. Uncertainties are explicitly included in safety assessments. Uncertainty in soil behaviour is one of the major contributors to failure probability of dikes. Therefore reduction of this uncertainty in soil behaviour leads to potential savings in reinforcement costs. One of the uncertainties in soil behaviour is the effect of aging on the behaviour of soft clays in compression. Compression behaviour of clay is strongly dependent on the transition from overconsolidated to normal consolidated soil behaviour. This transition phase in plain-strain conditions is indicated by the yield stress. The development of the yield stress due to aging is described by isotach models in terms of creep strains and stiffness parameters. Examples of isotach models are the abc-model and PLAXIS’ Soft Soil Creep model (SSC-model). According to those isotach models, a yield stress induced by aging is similar to a yield stress induced by unloading. This study verifies the development of the yield stress predicted by abc-models based on K0-CRS tests. The test material is remoulded, highly organic, silty clay with a liquid limit of 165% and a plastic limit of 56% (OVP-clay). The determination of the abc-parameters is not straightforward. The value for the creep parameter is easily overestimated due to a slow decrease in excess pore water pressure during a constant stress phase, resulting in stress-dependent strains instead of creep strains. The b-parameter is affected by the gradual transition from overconsolidated to normal consolidated behaviour and by the development of structure during aging. The development of structure is not included in the isotach models and could result in a higher yield stress than predicted by the isotach models. The possible increase of the yield stress due to the development of soil structure is not visible in the test results, but the performed tests indicate softening behaviour after aging phases. The SSC-model simulates no increase in lateral stress during aging. Some studies present data showing that the lateral stresses increase under a constant effective stress in time. Unfortunately, the development of lateral stresses cannot be quantified based on the performed tests due to stick and slip behaviour in the K0-ring during laboratory testing. Based on the test can be concluded that a minimum yield stress in time can be predicted based on isotach models. An important note is that a yield stress is always obtained with respect to a certain isotach which is dependent on the loading rate and the creep parameter.

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","The city is in a throes of a gigantic transformation process, due to modernisation, globalisation, technological innovation, urbanisation, explosive population growth and climate change (Brotchie, Newton, Hall, &amp; Nijkamp, n.d.; Cohen, 2006). Within a time of change, whereas technology integrates progressively in our lifestyle, and where man is increasingly designing its environment according towards its own needs – the development and future expansion of the city is becoming a challenge. This lead to the main problem statement: What is the new kind of future habitat that can respond to the socio-technological dimensions, recognising the uncertainties of the future? In order to answer the main problem statement, the project will start with a literature study, followed by a case-study / prototype design. The literature study consists of two part: 1) Starting with the technological revolution, the first part will try to reveal the changing dynamics ofthe socio-techno system (within the global urban context) and which consequences these changing dynamics has on our lifestyle and on a broader scope, 2) Secondly, the aim of literature study is to expose the spatial implications of this socio-techno transformation on the urban structure of the global city. Firstly, we have seen that technology is a part of growth, acceleration and the expansion of the city. Technology has facilitated us with increased speed and a more inclusive network ever seen. Users of this network, supported by communication and information technologies, become singular nodes, isolated but connected through screens and the virtual world. For those connected to the network, the concept of time and place changes entirely. The connected urban population is not just bound together by the physical infrastructure of a city anymore, but starts to merge with it, annihilating time, and killing distance. In order to protect oneself, from the increase in physical and informational speed, man will increasingly has the need to withdrawal in capsules. Blind to the outside world, the capsular civilisation is one of dualization of segregation of exploitation and exclusion resulting in an implosion of the polis of the common (Barney, 2013; ManuelCastells, 2000; Cauter, 2004, 2012; Graham &amp; Marvin, 2002). Secondly, we have tried to reveal what spatial (in the urban and architectural realm) consequences this capsular society brings forth. We have distinguished five mechanism of capsularity: decentralisation, fragmentation, isolation, privatisation and simulation. Together these characteristics will increasingly lead to the encapsulation of the urban and architectural realm. The future city will not just be a collectives, but rather a multiplicity of entities with their own sociality, character, and own rights (Manuel Castells, 2000; Cauter, 2004; Neil. A, 2018). The coming age can be defined as an age of disintegration, gated communities are the urban and architectural models that give shape to this order: an inside world of privatised publicness versus a chaotic, unsafe and uncontrollable outside world. We become voluntarily prisoners (Cauter, 2012; Davis, n.d.; Eckardt, 2017).","Future city; Capsularisation; Technological revolution; network society","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Explorelab","",""

It is very challenging in real indoor environments to perform concurrent localization and reliable vital signs monitoring of multiple subjects within practical distance ranges. In fact, the multipath propagation results in the reflected signal dispersed in time, which not only causes false ToF (Time of Flight) estimation but also leads to inter-subject interference, jeopardizing the vital signs extraction and the localiza- tion. Here we show a methodology based on radar techniques to auto- matically locate multiple subjects in indoor environments while keep monitoring their vital signs.

A lower, second dike is constructed behind the original existing dike. The original dike is only being strengthened to a minimal extent. The general idea behind this project is to more efficiently use the area near the dike without losing valuable nature or buildings during dike reinforcements. At the same time, this concept is expected to be cheaper, provides the required flood safety and the area between the dikes is used for experimental purposes. Currently, there are no pre-defined methods which can be used to easily assess the safety requirements of multiple lines of dikes. This research investigates if multiple lines can be an attractive alternative for traditional dike reinforcements regarding flood safety and costs, to provide the required protection against floods. <br/><br/>In order to answer the research question, it is analysed how flood defences are currently assessed in the Netherlands. Governing loads and failure mechanisms for the Twin Dike are determined. Using current and experimental methods the loads acting on both dikes are determined. Next, a sensitivity analysis is performed to analyse the sensitivity of various aspects on the results. Finally, a cost-benefit analysis is performed. <br/><br/>This research concludes that erosion of the outer slope and overtopping are governing failure mechanisms for the outer dike of the Twin Dike project. Overtopping volumes are, however, not large enough to cause considerable damage to both the outer and inner dike. Existing assessment methods are not good enough to determine the safety of the Twin Dike project with respect to erosion of the outer slope. A prototype model is used to better analyse the effects of erosion of the outer dike and the consequent loads on the inner dike. The model showed that breaches are formed in the outer dike at conditions which have a higher probability of occurrence than allowed by the safety norms. When a breach occurs the inner dike is not able to withstand the consequential loads. A total system failure immediately occurs. <br/><br/>A sensitivity analysis was performed on the overtopping volumes and erosion model results. Sea level rise was the dominant uncertainty for the overtopping volumes. If sea levels will rise extremely within the design lifetime, overtopping volumes can be three times as large compared to the case with mean sea level rise. However, the overtopping volumes are still low enough such that Twin Dike satisfies the required safety norms. For the erosion model, the average return period for which a breach occurs varies greatly with the uncertainty of various parameters. However, using a case with mean values for all variables, the probability of a breach is still larger than allowed by the safety norms.<br/><br/>Also, a cost-benefit analysis was performed to assess if the Twin Dike project is an attractive solution with regards to costs. In this case, from a cost perspective, multiple lines of dikes are not an optimal solution.","Flood protection; Twin Dike; Safety assessment; Cost-benefit analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering | Hydraulic Structures and Flood Risk","","53.395787, 6.885466"

By identifying the historical position of the North Sea, it is confirmed that the sea has been perceived as “the edge of the world” in its past. The sea and its cold northern waters was seen as an evil in itself, as a physical and a mental border, difficult to pass and coexist with. Looking at the present conditions, we (man) are being confronted with powerful nature again. In the past, the North Sea was difficult to navigate. Today, we are facing the issue of forecasting sea level rise and unpredictable weather. This shows the phenomenon of nature’s power is once again taking control over human. The subject of the project is focused on the strategy of overcoming this fear but once again harnessing it power as an opportunity for humans. <br/><br/>In the past, people faced the challenge of passing the fearful water by improving sailing boats, discovering navigation techniques and studying its natural movements, currents and tides. This process helped us to familiarise ourselves with the initially unknown and to learn how to coexist with nature. Today, we are confronted with the increasing power of water, which we have fortified ourselves against from it by building high advanced dams, walls and floodgates. We are using physical, monstrous engineering interventions to protect ourselves from the water rather than embracing its power – like we did in the past.<br/><br/>The design in itself aims to tackle the current issue of water level rise in a more traditional way, to open up to nature, to understand its behaviour and draw on our experience and knowledge. <br/><br/>The project has been set on the Shetland Islands, to metaphorically connect the story of the project with the first settlers of the Isles first settlements of the Vikings. Historically they embraced the fear of the waters mystical power and sailed through the unknown sea. As a link to the present, the geographical location of the Shetlands’ dictates that their coastal line will be one of the first to be impacted by the rising sea. Moreover, the island is by definition a transitional territory, the link between the Norwegian Sea and the North Sea. <br/><br/>The relationship between the power of water and the site was further explored in the architectural proposal. It was important to develop a cohesive narrative in the design, to bridge the past and present perception of water’s power with the site. This specifically related to the introduction of using renewable water energy as the main component of the project. By analysing local issues of the Isles’ residents and researching current knowledge of using water’s power, the site issues with the advanced technologies were combined into one coherent solution. By following this, I had to consider how far I can use the aforementioned natural power to not to damage the rough beauty of the site as well as the rough beauty of the natural power of water. This led to the introduction of the three architectural elements of my design– the harbour, the tidal power plant and the experiential path which links these two - the traditional way of using water (the harbour) with the advanced one (tidal power plant). Given the poetical nature of my project, the three interventions act as one line of experience, the deconstruction and analysis of building the tension and reflection of the story around the natural power of water, was an important procedure of translating the narrative into an invented design.","North Sea; Water level; Power; transitional territories; Landscape; Tidal Power Plant; Renewable Energy; Shetland Islands; Vikings; Water Lever Rise; Coastal Engineering; nature; Human power; history","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Transitional Territories","","60.346958, 1.235660"

Teusaquillo, the central area of intervention, has been shaped by educational and cultural institutions. It consists of quiet neighbourhood streets, hectic connecting roads and the green spine, the parkway. The dominance of traffic and movement within the city leaves little space to interact in the public sphere which led to the following question: How can collective space in Teusaquillo be altered from a space of movement to a space of inhabitation? Developing an architectural response to this question, inspirations from the comma in literature and the pause in music have grown from conceptual inspirations to design tools. Apart from this, investigations on intimacy in architecture and the boundaries between architecture, urban planning and landscape played a major role. The street itself became the location of this project and has been analysed in depth. The resulting intervention is envisioned through a new layout of the street based on ground interventions with landscaping elements as well as a modular façade structure that extends buildings and creates spaces of transition. This was developed through a systematic approach that has been tested and validated on other streets. Spaces of Permanence is carried out beyond the boundaries of architecture and questions modernist urban planning ideals. Through acts of slowing, blurring boundaries, introducing means of appropriation and material culture collective space is made accessible and spaces for meaningful interaction are created.","Comma; Pause; Bogotá; Teusaquillo; Movement; Public Space; Street; Permanence","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","",""

These powerful forces have imposed further spatial disjuncture on an unplanned city. More specifically, forces of contemporary urbanisation plague the developing fabric of Mumbai’s urban periphery. Nala Sopara lacks an adaptive, secure and inclusive physical identity, which is situated in, and modeled off the existing needs and practices of its locality. The colonisation of the area by newly established ‘handshake chawls’ has become a dominant condition which disrupts and destroys existing domestic practices and patterns of habitation. The transformative typological variation and morphological potential of typology present in Mumbai, from the city’s first settlement to present day developments, makes the impact of typology on domestic life clear. This process of typological renewal, termed typology genealogy by Atelier Bow Wow, questions what the various typological shifts or variations afford or disallow their inhabitants. This project aligns with their thinking, which poses the role of the architect as one who observes and applies the efficiencies of user appropriation in the creation of new typologies.<br/>The prevailing response to rising density requirements in this area lacks severely in social sustainability. In combining ethnographic research with a typological approach, the project seeks to primarily address three core themes: [1] flexibility and growth; [2] the urban public/private space spectrum; [3] open space hierarchies. These three inter-related motives work towards creating an urban domestic fabric which is informed by and empowers endemic habitation practices.","Affordable; Housing; Mumbai; India; Locality; Ethnography; Endemic; Domesticity; Flexibility","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","","19.4199, 72.8117"

The information that passes over these IT-infrastructures is highly confidential and privacy-sensitive, therefore it is essential that these infrastructures are secure. To improve the security of their infrastructure, Intermax is developing a Security Operations Center (SOC) which is fed by information from an optical tap which is placed on one of Intermax's core routers. The goal of this project was to extend the SOC with a REST API that analyses and classifies SSL certificates to filter malicious network data. This REST API makes use of models, so in addition to the REST API itself, a Neural Network Framework has been built to create these models. The framework can be used for different sorts of network data, but for this project, a proof of concept using SSL certificates was worked out to provide Intermax with a working product. The SOC is being built upon the security analytics framework Apache Metron and the REST API will be incorporated using Metron's Model as a Service functionality. Apache Metron sends individual data packets to the REST API, which analyses the data packet and returns whether the packet is malicious or not with a certain accuracy. This analysis takes roughly 1 millisecond and is independent from other data packets. This allows Apache Metron to spawn multiple instances of the REST API, making the solution fast and scalable. The Neural Network Framework runs completely separate from Apache Metron and the REST API. A user can configure, train and test a neural network using the framework and their own dataset. The neural network can be stored on a storage medium. Consequently, the REST API can import and apply the neural network on incoming data.","SSL; Neural Network; Network Security; Command and Control","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science and Engineering","",""

A key concern surrounding the application of CLT in buildings is its combustible nature and subsequent contribution to a compartment fire. Previous research has shown that exposed CLT, under certain circumstances, can achieve self-extinguishment. This research aims to further experimentally investigate the fire performance of small-scale compartments containing exposed CLT. The focus of this study is threefold, namely to investigate: i) the influence of (commercially available) adhesives used in CLT panels on fire behaviour; ii) the influence of CLT panel configuration on fire behaviour and iii) the ability of design guidelines to predict experimentally obtained fire behaviour. By investigating these aspects, a detailed investigation into fire behaviour of compartments with exposed CLT is presented to characterise the influence of CLT on enclosure fire behaviour and assess the ability of CLT to reliably self-extinguish. In general, it was found that reliable self-extinguishment is promoted when small-scale compartment fire tests reveal the avoidance of burn-through behaviour (and a second flashover), due to the combined effect of CLT adhesive type and CLT panel configuration. The particular observations recorded in this research project (relating to adhesive type and CLT panel configuration) serve as a base on which to conduct further research (especially by conducting experiments at real compartment scales). In addition, the investigation into the ability of a design guideline to predict fire behaviour, namely a Parametric Fire Curve (PFC) calculation method that includes the contribution of exposed CLT to the fuel load, provided mixed results. Further refinement is required to improve the model’s ability to predict compartment behaviour.","CLT; Self-extinguishment; Adhesives; CLT Panel Configuration; Parametric Fire Curves","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Depending on the sensor platform where the laser scanners are mounted, there are MLS, ALS and TLS techniques for both indoor and outdoor environments. The high-quality 3D point clouds produced from laser scanners is an important source of 3D spatial information and it is increasingly used in a wide field of applications from engineering to medical modeling, gaming and agriculture. Although laser scanners provide dense and accurate point clouds, a scene coverage and the creation of a complete 3D representation requires multiple scans of the same area. The procedure integrating multiple scans does not always result to a perfect match. Errors that exist in the datasets or errors in the transformation of datasets create difficulties during the matching procedure. Matching data-sets with the best alignment is a topic that has been researched in many fields and a variety of methods have been analyzed for registering point clouds. A co-registration can be compared to a mathematical model and hence it is important to present not only the functional model and the set of functional relationships between the variables but also the stochastic model that describes the variability among the values and gives insights about the level of satisfying predefined demands. As a result, it becomes necessary to establish an evaluation of the output of a procedure and each result to be accompanied by its quality description. The aim of this graduation thesis is about presenting the stochastic model of a co-registration with a quality description of the result of co-registration between point clouds. The approach will be applicable to results acquired from an image-based registration and the goal is to implement a method in order to quantify the quality of the co-registered result of two different point clouds. A probabilistic analysis of the results of an image-based method results to a quantification of the quality of the output. Response images acquired from an image-based co-registration are tested and the quality indicators of precision and reliability are determined. Moreover, the shift parameter is also defined, fact that enhances the applicability of this research to co-registrations referring to big areas where multiple local registrations have to be combined in a globally consistent manner and each local result contributes to the global registration according to its quality indicators. Particularly, response images that have clearly defined peak areas and pass the tested criteria, are considered more reliable and contribute to the global registration with a greater weight. On the contrary, blurry response images, fail to satisfy the tests, are considered less reliable results and contribute with a smaller weight. The analysis of the images performed by testing the distribution of pixel values in both directions of the images. The implemented approach provides information about the precision and reliability of the images that have normally distributed values. Furthermore, by fitting a Gaussian line to the discrete pixel values, a sub-pixel accuracy of the result is achieved as values are generated in between the discrete pixels. The developed method quantifies the quality of an image-based registration but further improvements and investigation of the recommendations can also attach additional value.","Co-registration; Probabilistic analysis; Quality; Point clouds; Stochastic Analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geomatics","",""

We hypothesize that epidermal growth factor receptor-targeted (EGFR) intraoperative molecular imaging can help improve localization of lung nodules. In a clinical study, we evaluated the use of panitumumab-IRDye800 to determine if fluorescently labeled antibodies can be safely used to identify non-small cell lung cancer. Three subjects with lung lesions suspicious for lung cancer were enrolled in a phase I clinical trial to evaluate the safety and feasibility of panitumumab-IRDye800. These subjects were systemically infused with different doses of panitumumab-IRDye800 one or two days prior to surgery. Near-infrared fluorescence imaging was used in situ and ex vivo and the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) and tumor-to-background ratios (TBRs) were calculated based on histologically healthy and tumor tissue. In all three patients, no adverse events were observed during and after systemic infusion of the antibody. Two out of three patients were diagnosed with adenocarcinoma and one patient was diagnosed with follicular lymphoma. The MFI of both patients with adenocarcinoma was significantly higher in histologically tumor tissue compared to histologically healthy tissue and a TBR higher than 1 was found in both patients. The EGFR expression level was very high in tumor tissue compared to healthy lung tissue and a microscopic correlation was found between the presence of EGFR and panitumumab-IRDye800. This first-in-human use of panitumumab-IRDye800 in lung cancer patients, provides evidence suggesting that the use of this fluorescently-labeled antibody is safe. The data also shows that EGFR may be used as a target to identify lung nodules in patients with lung cancer and that panitumumab-IRDye800 may improve identification of malignancies.","Fluorescence; Adenocarcinoma; Lung; EGFR; Antibody; Surgery","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-07-08","","","","Biomedical Engineering | Medical Instruments and Medical Safety (MIMS)","",""

Inclusion of depth assimilation and ensemble averaging in radar calculations led to smaller differences between ADCP and radar. The observed differences were clustered and related to water level elevations, wind velocities, wave periods, wave heights, spatial coherence in radar output and error metrics of the radar fitting procedure. Larger waves and higher wind velocities were observed to benefit radar agreement with ADCP results. Rising water levels benefitted agreement in east west direction. Falling water levels benefitted agreement in north south direction. Confidence intervals of the fitting procedure were observed to coincide with differences between ADCP and radar and potential for filtering based on them was shown. Nevertheless, an unclarified tendency towards northwestern bias, which may be specific to the comparison locations, remains. The radar at Ameland monitors the whole inlet system and provides current velocities everywhere in its range. This study shows that its currents are in good agreement with ADCP depth averaged currents throughout most of the tidal cycle. Furthermore, it stresses radar’s potential for better monitoring of the coast and for cost effective coastal field measurements to obtain large datasets, even in hydrodynamically very complex regions.","Remote Sensing; Coastal Field Measurements; Current Monitoring; Depth Inversion; X-Band Radar; XMFit","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-07-10","","","","Coastal and Marine Engineering and Management (CoMEM)","SEAWAD: research into a sand engine for the Wadden Islands","53.440564, 5.6587659"

Nations meeting at the United Nations International Maritime Organization (IMO) in London have proposed an initial strategy for the reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from ships, setting out to reduce GHG emissions from international shipping by phasing them out as soon as possible with the aim to achieve zero emission by the end of this century. Heerema Marine Contractors (HMC) is a world leading marine contractor in the international offshore energy industry and aims to be a role model in environmental responsibility through carbon emission reductions.<br/> <br/>As a result of HMC’s global activities, their fleet covers a considerable distance through transit across the globe. Their large semi-submersible crane vessels are conventionally transported through towing by a tug. The great amounts of fuel required for these transits provides a significant opportunity for the reduction of HMC’s carbon footprint. One such initiative proposed within HMC is the application of wind-assisted ship propulsion on the tow configuration.<br/> <br/>This report presents an initial investigation of the feasibility of wind-assisted towing of the HMC’s Thialf, a semi-submersible crane vessel. Previous internal research at HMC showed the feasibility of using a discarded Panamax vessel as a floating breakwater. While operationally the discarded Panamax was found to be feasible, economically this was not the case. In this research, using the Panamax as a wind-assisted tug for towing the Thialf is investigated. As such the Panamax vessel can be employed for multiple purposes; for wind-assisted towing and as a floating breakwater, improving the financial feasibility. <br/><br/>To test the performance of a wind-assisted tow operation, a comprehensive 2D model is developed in this research to be able to check configuration variations in a wind-assisted tow setup. A conceptual design of a Panamax vessel converted into a sailing tug is implemented in a 2D model simulation. The performance in combination with the Thialf is assessed under the common environmental conditions experienced by the Thialf for various transit routes. <br/><br/>Results showed that the use of a wind-assisted tow configuration based on a Panamax, without using the Thialf propulsion is not feasible. The main point of failure is the required force balance transverse to the sailing direction. The Panamax basis used for the preliminary wind- assisted tug design proved to be not the optimal base case due to the limited leeward force generation under a drift angle and the large sensitivity to environmental loading. Although implemented measures improved the systems performance, it is debatable whether a wind- assisted tow configuration with the associated uncertainties is the most promising area to accomplish significant CO2 reductions. <br/><br/><br","WASP; VPP; Towing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

The primal goal of this BSc thesis is to improve existing Mixed Integer Optimization models to classify azole resistance of <i>C. glabrata</i> more accurately by preventing overfitting. Moreover, these classification methods can generally also be used for the classification of any kind of numerical of categorical data. The classification method that we used is based on an MIO formulation that was first introduced by Bertsimas and Dunn, and later adapted by Van Dijk. We first made the output of the model much easier to interpret, both from a mathematical and biological point of view. We also applied feature sampling to reduce the run time of the program, making it possible to create deeper trees, and to prevent overfitting. To further prevent overfitting in these deeper trees, we added the option of forcing at least a certain number of training data points in the leaves to the MIO formulation. We verified our MIO model on a data set constructed by combining two data sets from the Westerdijk Fungal Biodiversity institute and a data set from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention Atlanta, all containing the FKS1 and FKS2 gene sequences from <i>C. Glabrata</i>. We automated the preprocessing steps and merging process of these data sets with a Python program, and wrote a user manual on how to use this program. By processing a bigger data set we were able to classify more data correctly than Van Dijk, and we outperformed the CART algorithm. Similar accuracy results were obtained when applying feature sampling as when not, and the run time was drastically reduced. Deeper trees did not change out-of-sample accuracy much, though this may be because our data sets did not require deeper trees. When also forcing at least a certain number of training data points in each leaf of these deeper trees, we were able to slightly increase the out-of-sample accuracy, which means overfitting was indeed prevented slightly. Lastly we interpreted the results in biological context, and found some resistance-related mutations that were already identified previously in other research, as well as some additional ones for which the biological relevance is yet unknown.","Mixed Integer Optimization; Classification trees; overfitting; Candida; glabrata; DNA","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics","",""

Many municipalities are now working on a specified portfolio identification while maintaining this portfolio. Some municipalities are ready to think about how to change their portfolio into one that is almost CO2 neutral. However, there are also municipalities that are struggling due to the lack of (energy) information of their portfolio and choosing the appropriate tools to help them achieve their goals. Some municipalities do work on the sustainability goal as seen at the benchmark of 2017, but here is also evident that around 25% of the public building stock is still categorized at label G, the worst label. Therefore the aim of the research is to provide insight into the facts, processes, possibilities, and challenges of sustainable strategies for municipalities to create an energy neutral real estate portfolio and given this national goal, provide a road map for municipalities. We can conclude from literature and case studies that there are special contracts, approaches, and guidelines municipalities can use to make their building portfolio energy neutral. However, there is not one uniform tool that can entirely transform the total building portfolio. So, the strategy tools need to be used for the right buildings at the right time with the right expertise and information. This approach needs to be in balance with the three added values of MREM, namely: political goals, financial policies, and user satisfaction. The considerations to set the pace of the energy transition is predominately based upon the financial possibilities, the amount of support of the council, the physical context, and the professionalization of the real estate department.

Road surface anomalies, like potholes, cracks and ravelling, affect driving conditions, such as driving comfort and safety, noise emission, load loss of trucks, increase of fuel consumption and traffic circulation. Locali- sation of these anomalies allows for targeted road maintenance, which contributes to the improvement of driver safety, comfort and the optimisation of road maintenance.<br/>The current technique to detect road damage is that road inspectors determine road damage in road images. However, the results are susceptible to human subjectivity. An improvement on image based road damage detection is using LiDAR data, because the geometry of road damage is measured too. To mitigate the issue of human subjectivity, an automated method for road damage detection was developed for the profile laser scanner on the IV-Infra car. This laser scanner is mounted at the back of the vehicle so that its profile lines are perpendicular to the driving direction. The proposed method consists of: (I) feature extraction with a sliding window algorithm; (II) K-means clustering to create training data; (III) Random Forest classification and (IV) morphological operations to remove noise and identify larger damage patches. This method was tested on an 800-meter long provincial road with different road defects and road types. Most occurring road damages are cracks, craquel and raveling. The results of this method were validated in two ways: using a road inspectors damage classification and a custom-made validation set based on orthophotos. An overall accuracy of 73% is achieved for the fully automated process. When training of the Random Forest was based on an improved, semi-automated training data, the overall accuracy was 58%, this gives visual clear results. This is explained by more noise are presented in the results based on the fully automatic method, which is overlapped with the coarse road inspector’s data. Optical inspection shows that the semi-automated method identified almost all damages of the custom-made validation set, although a shift between the point cloud and the validation is found. Still, the method has some difficulties with detecting the transverse cracks. This problem can be solved by integrating the two other mounted laser scanners of the Iv-Car, but pre-processing is needed to organise the point cloud. Also, an improvement in georeferencing the validation data would help to optimise the method and training data. Nevertheless, promising results are achieved by this method.","Infrastructure Monitoring; Damage detection; Mobile Laser Scanning; road pavement","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geoscience and Remote Sensing","",""

Firstly, merging maneuver is looked upon, considering heterogeneity in the vehicles i.e. considering different dynamics for the vehicles involved. Then heterogeneity in platoon, arising from the difference in potential limits of the vehicles is taken into account, which the current literature fails to address. The uncertain/heterogeneous dynamics are addressed through the difference in the engine driveline constant, which differs for different vehicles and keeps on changing during operation. The heterogeneity is tackled by using Adaptive control, which adapts to the changing dynamics and estimates the uncertainty to act accordingly. Adaptive strategies for formation keeping in platoons of automated vehicles have been recently proposed; while these strategies are able to cope with uncertain vehicle parameters, they have the drawback of handling only acyclic graphs (e.g. look-ahead topology). This prevents from enhancing formation keeping protocols with more complex platooning maneuvers such as synchronized merging/splitting. This work proposes an adaptive strategy for performing synchronized merging maneuvers in the presence of uncertain vehicle parameters: during these maneuvers, a cyclic communication graph is instantiated, which must be handled in a suitable way. The strategy is framed as a synchronization protocol with a set of adaptive control laws, designed via Lyapunov stability theory. A benchmark scenario in which two platoons formed in different lanes are required to merge, (e.g. due to a lane closure because of roadworks) is presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed strategy. The approach is proven to be scalable to platoons with arbitrary number of vehicles. In later part of the work, a method is proposed which takes the limits of the vehicles into consideration, to make the platooning realistic. An adaptive platooning strategy is used so as the vehicles can adaptively synchronize to desired reference dynamics. In order to handle engine limits, a mechanism is proposed based on making the reference dynamics `not too demanding', by properly saturating their control action. Such saturation action will allow all vehicles in the platoon to remain in their engine potential limits throughout. Another problem that affects the stability of the platoon is that, any perturbations or disturbance in the platoon leaves the vehicle scattered if the vehicles are already running at their potential limits. This work proposes an adaptive platooning method with bi-directional interaction and a mechanism coping with engine constraints. The bi-directional interaction allows the vehicle to not only look at the error in spacing from the preceding vehicle (vehicle in front) but also the succeeding vehicle, this makes the vehicle's control action (acceleration) depend on both front and back errors, the vehicle can thus slow down for the following vehicle if it lags behind. The bi-directional strategy developed is then proved string stable, which the literature struggles to establish with the already developed bi-directional strategies. Simulations are then conducted to validate the theoretical analysis and show the effectiveness of the method in retaining cohesiveness of the platoon. The simulations include a merging maneuver to check the effectiveness of merging with synchronized cyclic communication. For the engine potential limits, the firstly state of the art algorithm's simulation is run which is then compared to the performance of the proposed algorithm. Finally, to check the effectiveness of bi-directional CACC strategy simulations for a specific case is run for both uni-directional and bi-directional strategies proposed in the thesis and are then compared, showing the advantage of using bi-directional CACC strategy over uni-directional.","Vehicle Platoon; Model Reference Adaptive Control; CACC; Bi-directional CACC","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-07-09","","","","","",""

The city is built in a natural river delta, which has been altered extensively in the last millennia to facilitate a desirable and safe living environment for its inhabitants, initiating in the 14th century by damming the river Rotte. From then on, the settlement around the lock mechanism has evolved into one of the biggest urban areas in the Netherlands. It is here, where floods would cause economic loss through property damage and therefore social disruption to the population. <br/><br/>My aim was to investigate into the most vulnerable residential districts of the city: Noordereiland, the sole urban river island of Rotterdam, proved itself as the first neighbourhood to flood in a case of high water levels. Not protected by dikes and lying the lowest above current mean water level, it presents itself as the most urgent district to investigate, seeing it as an ideal urban test laboratory to asses solutions to flooding in an urban environment.<br/><br/>Firstly, limiting myself to the extents of the urban block, my project aim was to develop a systematic of how to convert the morphology of it under the extreme scenario of flooding. The system is composed of repetitive added portal structures, which span over the existing buildings. These build the framework for a new vertical circulation system, originating in corner gaps of the blocks. The circulatory system is built up by arcades on the inside and outside facades of the block, affixed to the sides of the portals. The new system converts the individual access routes of the units into a collective one for the whole block. Furthermore, extending over the whole island, these arcades, connecting the individual blocks by bridges, provide a new three-dimensional route across the whole district, providing it with an alternative plane to the flooded ground floor. Additionally, the portal structure provides a new foundation for added structures on top of the existing buildings, which compensate for the lost ground floor level.<br/><br/>The project is experimenting in how the urban block could re-structure its morphology to cope with flooding. The purpose of the added structure is not to act as an autonomous piece of architecture, superimposed onto the existing fabric.

The studio focused on the opportunities and challenges our cities (currently) face in order to prepare for the near future of 2040. This research deals with the currently critical notion of ‘circularity’ (originated from the Circular Economy). Circularity correlates highly with sustainability and therefore with the welfare of our planet. The Paris Agreement and the Commodity Agreement induced the Circular Economy to catch momentum. Many municipalities, especially in the Netherlands, placed circular developments higher on their agenda. Rotterdam was one of the first to state a bold ambition to become a fully circular city by 2050. However, recent studies have shown that, even after the international agreements, our current commitments have not proved sufficient.<br/><br/>Within architecture circularity is mainly measured through performance related aspects, such as recyclability, reusability, and demountability. However, in this thesis circularity has been placed in a different context. The year 2050 is relatively short to transform an existing city and economy to a circular one, but considerably long enough to influence and educate the next generations to embrace and adopt circularity as their standard.<br/><br/>On the one hand there are many people who are still unfamiliar with circularity, or do not know in what ways they can contribute to the economy. On the other hand, there are people (and also students) who have brilliant circular ideas but cannot afford the resources to execute them.<br/><br/>Instead of approaching circularity in a conventional way, this thesis made a distinction between hard and soft characteristics of circularity and classified them as short-term and long-term achievements respectively. The soft characteristics are circular interventions that have education, interaction, and spreading awareness as their main focus. Promoting the works of circular initiatives, facilitating interaction between users and actors, and providing space for people who want to engage with circularity is a critical and necessary venture for the future of our planet.<br/><br/>The project investigated how architecture can contribute to boost circular awareness in order to influence behavior and activate interaction. It is called ‘House of Circularity’ and resulted in a hybrid building that accommodates educational programs, dedicated workspaces for circular initiatives, commercial facilities, flexible office spaces, (short-stay) hotel, and apartments. The project consists of two plinths and towers on either side of the railway, and a public plateau that connects both structures and the two districts. The complex is a modest tribute to the place’s history and the former Hofpoort (city gate). The two towers mark the transition in the skyline between the Central District and Rotterdam North.<br/><br/>This project is a critical statement towards traditional and conventional approaches to circularity.

However, the increase in computation power in the recent years allows for more advanced scientific models. The well-known susceptible-infected-susceptible model is used to describe the spreading of a disease among a group of people. This is modelled as a network, where persons are represented by nodes and their connections are links in the network. In this thesis, instead of a typical static network, the network itself changes structure based on the disease states of the nodes. In other words, there are two independent processes; the spreading of the disease over the network (state of the nodes) and the adaption of the network to the disease (state of the links). As a spreading model, the Markovian adaptive susceptible-infected-susceptible model (ASIS model for short) is introduced. It is shown that the model has one steady state, named the trivial steady state, in which all individuals are healthy. When the infection rate is sufficiently high, the system undergoes a phase transition from the disease-free state to an endemic state, where most nodes are infected. The state where most nodes are infected is named the metastable state. After being in the metastable state for a long time, the system collapses to the trivial steady state. The spreading of contagious processes is not just limited to disease spreading. Other relevant examples, such as opinion, gossip, fake news, neuron transmittance in the brain, etc. can be modelled using adaptive models as well. In this thesis, the ASIS model is extended by allowing different rules for the link-breaking and link-creation processes in what we call the Generalised ASIS framework. In total 36 models have been analysed simultaneously. Out of the 36 models, 9 showed a partially unstable metastable state. This resulted in rapid oscillations of the number of infected nodes just above the epidemic threshold. The relation between the epidemic threshold and the effective link-breaking rate was also determined. For 5 cases, the epidemic threshold is independent of the effective link-breaking rate. In 18 cases, the epidemic threshold scales linearly in the link-breaking rate. The remaining 13 cases are bounded between a constant and a linear link-breaking rate, however, its exact dependence remains unclear.<br/> In the G-ASIS framework, it was conjectured that the metastable state of the Markov process can be accurately approximated by the steady state of the mean-field approximation. It was shown this is not true for every model. However in the ASIS model, the mean-field approximation showed close resemblance to the averaged stochastic results. This may be caused by a positive correlation between the nodes. For the other models, the deviation from the mean field approximation can probably be contributed to the fact that nodes are not positively correlated. Other higher order mean field approximations should be examined to approximate the averaged behaviour of the Markov process.","Adaptive; Network science; Information diffusion; Epidemiology","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics","",""

As climate change looms over and threatens our physical environment, the EU and consequently the Dutch government has proposed multiple stringent regulations to curb our unsustainable resource consumption habits and create a circular economy for the future. The realization of such an economy is currently hindered by the lack of availability of standardized design strategies and assessment methods. In comparison, a high energy performing building can be designed, assessed and operated by following the closely monitored Energy performance building directive initiated by the EU. The directive lays down stringent goals to be achieved in the built environment every few years. This imbalance leads to the development of a fast-paced energy efficient building stock with circular economy ambitions lagging behind. Addressing this gap, this research focuses on creating and testing an assessment method that measures the energy performance and circularity of a building in an integrated manner, to ensure the equal development of both aspects. In this process, data on new buildings are gathered using which the circular intentions and consequent measures incorporated in these buildings to meet the current building regulations are tracked, resulting in a set of design guidelines for improving the combined energetic and circular performance of a building.","circularity; energy performance; circular building; integrated assessment; energy assessment; circularity assessment","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","",""

Circular Material Use rate shows how much material demand was catered by reused or recycled content. The Netherlands was estimated at 29% in 2016 is the highest among all other member states and more than twice of Europe’s average. The Netherlands has now set up the goal to become 100% circular by 2050. Principles of circularity aim at lowering the environmental impacts and halve the emissions by 2030 and carbon neutral by 2050, according to the Paris Agreement. However, even though high circularity rates in the Netherlands, 12.2 tonnes per capita of greenhouse gases were released in 2016, which is 3.5 tonnes higher than the EU average. In transitioning to a circular built environment, the most crucial challenge is to keep all materials in a closed loop in a way that proves lower environmental impact compared to extracting a virgin equivalent. In current practice, building materials are procured at the end of a design phase, which results in minimum use of secondary stock and maximum extraction of virgin material to fit “circular” designs. Since buildings are designed for longer lifespans, this virgin material returns as secondary much later and do not reflect in the indicator defined by the EU. The main question is what information is needed by a designer or engineer in procuring secondary materials and when &amp; how it can be best provided to them. This research gives an Assessment Framework to assess parameters such as the circular flow of materials,embodied CO2, cost and technical performance while designing.It is composed of five significant interfaces - material database, material explorer, assessment dashboard, digital design and a visual script toassess various parameters such as MCI, embodied CO2, distance from the project site, cost, U-value, Thermal conductivity, Density and other labels in 3D.The framework provides a Preliminary and Advanced assessment of different parameters. The only difference is that Advanced assessment takes into account is the disassembly potential of various components at a system level and determines whether they can be reused or have to be demolished at EOL. Demolition would mean a product reach EOL sooner, which result in higher embodied CO2. Hence, allowing design/engineering optimization. Other instance, where a component reaches EOL before its surrounding product, replacement of that component should not result in the demolition of others.","Circular economy; LCA; Environmental impacts; Adaptive reuse; Sustainability; circularity assessment","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Building Technology","",""

Based on the microscope pictures and FISH analysis, at least two different PHA producing bacteria were identified: small (&lt; 2.5 μm) and big PHA producing bacteria (&lt; 5 μm). Big PHA bacteria appeared from FAN concentrations higher than 50 mg/L, but concentrations higher than 150 mg/L were highly toxic for the whole PHA microbial enrichment.

This creates a problem for the also increasing number of high-rise buildings many of which are of unconventional shape. However, current methods for calculating wind response either do not account for these geometries, such as the Eurocode or are prohibitively expensive and time-consuming, such as physical wind tunnel tests. This thesis aims to address this issue by developing a computational method by which one can analyse the structural effects of wind on a building and optimise the external geometry to reduce those effects in the early design phase. The method involves the combination of three main algorithms: Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) to simulate the wind and the pressure it exerts on a building, Finite Element Analysis (FEA) which calculates the structural effects such as deflection and stresses due to these forces, and an optimisation algorithm which can iteratively manipulate an input geometry to obtain better performance. For this thesis, a tool based on the method was developed in Grasshopper, the visual scripting plugin for Rhinoceros3D. Existing plugins were used for the main algorithms while custom scripting was used to combine them into a single tool that was made relatively easy to use and returned quick results.<br/>The methodology involved extensive research into the various aspects of the method. This was followed by the development of the method throughout which testing and validation were performed to determine its accuracy and timeliness. Case study buildings were tested with the goal of reducing structural material use. In all tests, the mass of structural material needed was reduced by allowing the optimisation algorithm to manipulate only the external geometry of the building. This produced a tool within Grasshopper and a set of guidelines for developing such a method.","Computational Fluid dynamics; Optimisation; Finite Element Analysis; Wind Engineering; Parametric Design; Computational Design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","",""

This research focuses on the development of a climate adaptation concept for the new Feyenoord Stadium, with the goal to make it adaptable to the future climate scenario, characterized by global warming, which will lead to an increase in temperatures and heat waves. The focus of the design is mainly on the integration of passive strategies to cool down the stadium and control the indoor temperature to guarantee proper livability to users, thus reducing the need for active cooling. The research explores mainly possibilities for the design of the envelope, which represents the connection between the stadium and its surroundings. A proper design of the envelope would bring benefits both to the stadium itself and the outdoor environment, by mitigating the urban heat island effect. Indeed, the main question of this research is “how can the envelope of a large-scale stadium be designed to integrate passive strategies to provide cooling in a future warmer scenario and guarantee a comfortable micro-climate to users, while reducing the UHI in the surroundings?” Based on the literature review, different strategies were explored, and those more likely to make the Stadium adaptable to the climate of Rotterdam have been selected and analyzed in detail to be integrated into the new design. Through means of calculations and simulations, outcomes were obtained, which show that with a proper design of the envelope and some areas of the stadium, it is possible to control the indoor temperature to avoid overheating, guarantee comfort to users, and reduce the cooling demand of the building. The ultimate goal of this research is to give guidelines for a replicable design approach to be applied to stadiums around the world to deal with local climate potentials and hazards, and rely on the resources offered by the surroundings.","Stadium; Climate change; Sustainability; Climate design; Passive design; Natural ventilation; Daylight; Shading; Evaporative cooling; Energy production; Urban heat island effect","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-07-09","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","","51.8939035, 4.5231354"

In practice, many watersheds are ungauged due to high costs, inaccessibility and even due to political instability (Pan, Wang, and Xi 2016). For this reason, measuring remotely without the need of being physically present, for instance by remote sensing satellites, can be interesting for many applications. The large amount of satellite data can result in the ability to extend short observation series into larger series with satellite missions.<br/>Discharge is one of the conditions in a river, which is relevant to have data on during regular periods but in particular during or after extreme events. This thesis focussed on an approach, by using remote sensing, to obtain data that can be used for further research to determine discharge. River-width is one of the current variables researched to be used as a substitute for river stage data. River stage is currently used to obtain estimations for river discharge via earlier obtained river stage-discharge relations, which can be transformed into river width-discharge relations.<br/>The objective of this thesis was to develop a method to obtain sub-pixel accurate river-width estimations by remote sensing. The objective to estimate river-widths on sub-pixel base originates from the need of river-width estimations with higher accuracy than the freely available optical satellite resolutions of 10 to 20 metres. The study contains the improvement of the current water classification methods by including analyses for discriminating band combinations, to construct site-specific indices. This was noticed to be needed, due to the conventional indices, like the NDWI, performing differently with the presence of certain land types.<br/>By having multiple indices based on uncorrelated satellite bands transformed into probability bands, it is possible to combine indices, via Bayes theorem. Based on the site-specific indices and index combinations, the aim is to develop relations between spectral information and water fractions of pixels that could lead to a more detailed river-width estimation by including sub-pixel information.<br/>The resulting method was able to show discriminating abilities in satellite bands and band combinations, specifically for an area of interest, other than the conventional NDWI and MNDWI. With the use of river edge information, the spectral bands could be transformed into spatial water probability bands, indicating a probability for the present pixels to be water. The probability indices and index combinations showed to reduce a large part of the occurring misclassifications. With the use of ROC curves, to assess the classification performance of the indices and combination of indices, variation in misclassification of certain land types between days were observed for certain indices.<br/>The probability bands, which are based on the river’s edge value distribution, also seemed to be useful, especially for the pan-sharpened MNDWI and the Bayes 0-3 indices, to obtain the needed water fraction relations for sub-pixel base estimations. A comparison in river-width estimation of a conventional automated water classification method; Otsu’s thresholding method and a Supervised training map classification method were made against the use of probability indices with sub-pixel water fraction relationships. It was found that the use of sub-pixel information resulted in a significant improvement of the accuracy for river-width estimations. For the first and second fieldwork day, the average river-width deviations of the pan-sharpened MNDWI and Bayes0-3 decreased, respectively, from 16 and 9 metres, to under 5 and 7 metre deviation by including the found water fraction relationships.","Remote Sensing; river-width; Fieldwork; Google Earth Engine","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

Methodology: The factors are explored by conducting a single case study research. The starting point was a literature study towards team effectiveness. The outcome of this study was used as input for the case study research. The case study was used to collect data, the data was generated by conducting semistructured interviews. After these interviews were conducted, observations, off the record conversations and inspection of restricted documents were used to discuss and validate conclusions.

However, the factors resulting from this study need to be kept in mind, due to the fact that it will always be factors that influence the team collaboration, not said that they have to be the most influential for every comparable project-based integrated design team. Practical implications: The research addresses factors that affect the team collaboration of a project-based integrated design team. These factors should be taken into account when starting a comparable project team. Even though the case study of this research concluded with these factors, it is not excluded that there are more factors that influence the team collaboration of a project-based integrated design team. Therefore, more studies should be conducted in this area of research. Scientific relevance: There are a lot of studies conducted towards the team effectiveness of composed teams, however, more research is needed to define the factors that influence the team collaboration of a projectbased team. This research could be used as a starting point for further research, while it is one of the first studies conducted on a project-based team of this size and complexity, subjected to designing a big complex building project.

In case of a disaster, the water impounded in the reservoir escapes and destroys everything in its path. Reasons for failure range from geology, hydrology and seismicity, to design problems, lack of maintenance and poor field investigation. Prior cases show that various dams gave away mainly due to geological causes, so there is a particular interest to see how the local terrain features could influence the longevity of the structure. Three historical case studies are discussed in order to emphasize the impact of geology regarding dam failure. The Saint Francis Dam is a prime example of poor site investigation, where the lack of knowledge on the foundation rock led to the rupture of the gravity dam. The Malpasset Dam gave away predominantly due to underestimated effects of the uplift, nevertheless, the geologists were unaware of an active fault system and the mechanical properties of the rock mass. The Baldwin Hills Reservoir comes with a more thorough site investigation, yet still, due to earth movements, the water from the reservoir infiltrated through the embankment. Therefore, geological features at the site need to be included in the design options of the dam in order to ensure a safe, feasible and economical project. With respect to the way we build nowadays, engineers have learnt important lessons from past experiences, however, issues such as ageing of the structures and the unpredictability of geology and weather, could still influence the safety of modern dams.","","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Earth Sciences","",""

This feasible area is defined by both a surge and choke line as well as the minimum and maximum rotation speed.<br/>The gas network considered consists of a compressor plus a pipeline in front and after the compressor. To model a pipeline the Weymouth pressure-drop equation is used. The pipe- compressor system can be described as a system of seven equations. There are seven unknown variables and two given variables. The given variables are the pressure at the beginning of the first pipeline and the pressure at the end of the second pipeline.

The Kuramoto model is a prominent model that describes synchronization in systems (networks). It models each element of the network as an oscillator with an individual phase. Due to global coupling, a phase transition is realized, such that some oscillators of the network synchronize. An example of this model is the synchronization of chemical oscillators. However, this model is sometimes insufficient. It is found that in some parts of the brain, synchronization is required, but that excessive synchronization may lead to epilepsy. This reveals that negative feedback is required in order to avoid excessive synchronization. In this study, the Kuramoto model is extended to an adaptive network by introducing two opposing adaptation rules, such that the strength of coupling can differ per pair of oscillators. The anti-Hebbian rule promotes links between oscillators that are in anti-phase. It is found that networks with this adaptation rule organize themselves in a way that links occur between oscillators whose frequencies are most distant, and that other links are weakened or pruned completely. This suggests that networks with this adaptation rule are able to avoid excessive synchronization. However, the network is still able to sustain explosive synchronization. The second rule, the Hebbian rule, promotes links between oscillators that are in phase. Networks with this rule do not prune links. Again explosive synchronization is revealed in this network. A stability analysis is performed to obtain more fundamental insights in the dynamics of the network. The results of this thesis can help obtaining deeper understanding the dynamics and principles of link pruning and explosive synchronization in complex networks: phenomena that are observed in, among others, the field of neuroscience.","","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering","",""

Solar cooling technologies promise more sustainable approaches with reliance on solar energy as a renewable energy source. Thermoelectric technology is a promising solar cooling technology that is powered by electricity from PV panels and has been researched in recent years for investigation of potentials for building and façade integration. These small devices create a temperature difference between the two sides when applied to electricity and therefore, can be used in generating both cold and heat for conditioning of spaces. As an example of arid to semi-arid climates, Tehran has been selected as the context of this project. This graduation project focuses on designing an integrated façade product that uses thermoelectric technology for providing cooling and heating demands of an office building in Tehran. One of the main challenges of this design was the low performance of the TE system that could be increased in a few ways among which decreasing the temperature difference created at the two sides is the most crucial. An office building was initially selected to represent typical offices in Tehran and a few passive strategies including reductions in WWR, changing glazing type, applying insulation and reducing infiltration rate as well as using natural ventilation were implemented on this office model. The implementation of these passive measures leads to a decrease of 55 percent in the annual heating and cooling loads and 39 and 49 percent in the heating and cooling design capacity, respectively. Having this passive model, a ventilation integrated active cooling and heating system was developed that functions like a heat recovery system and uses extracted ventilation air to cool down the temperature of the hot side in summer. Fresh conditioned air is provided in this system through the cold side of the façade via an underfloor air distribution system. A unitized façade product was then developed to accommodate this integrated concept and it this TE system was proved to be flexible in terms of design and integration. To evaluate the performance of this façade, a comprehensive model was developed, and a code was written in EES to solve the equations simultaneously. A baseline model was set to simulate a summer peak situation and as a result, COP, electricity consumption, and temperature difference values were obtained. Next, all the variables in the model were studied and optimized to obtain the best results for every time step of the year. The annual simulations showed that average COP of 1 to 1.3 and 2.1 to 3.0 could be obtained for summer and winter conditions. Feasibility aspects of this façade unitized system were then studied and compared to other solar cooling technologies to obtain a better understanding of limitations and promises of this façade. It was found out that although in terms of performance and cost the TE façade can compete with other solar cooling technologies, issues such as weight, size requirements, and noise might affect its application in some cases.","Facade Design; Climate Design; Solar Cooling; Thermoelectric; Passive Design; HVAC; Integrated Facade; Semi-arid Climate","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Building Technology | Sustainable Design","Façade and Climate Design","35.757323, 51.409935"

(mentor); Brinkgreve, R.B.J. (graduation committee); Hicks, M.A. (graduation committee); Kasbergen, C. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","The earthquake-induced liquefaction is a high-risk phenomenon for dredging industries, which need to set strict requirements in order to avoid potential disastrous effects for the project. Different types of liquefaction exist which can be triggered over a wide range of soil types and for different loading conditions. The liquefaction triggering due to an earthquake event is dependent on the soil behaviour under undrained cyclic loading. The assessment of the liquefaction hazard during an earthquake is mainly based so far on empirical procedures. The most common used in practise is the NCEER method (Youd &amp; Idriss, 2001) which is established according to empirical evaluation of field observations and in-situ testing. However, the NCEER method can be inaccurate for the design primarily due to its empirical nature as it is capturing different soil types and loading conditions. For that purpose, advanced constitutive models can provide more precise assessments as they can be calibrated for specific site conditions. Such a model is the PM4Sand, which is very attractive for practical applications because there are only a few model parameters to be determined in the calibration process.The first part of the current thesis project includes the validation of the PM4Sand model for both earthquake-induced and static liquefaction according to undrained Cyclic Direct Simple Shear (CDSS) tests and undrained Direct Simple Shear (DSS) respectively, performed on Ottawa F-65 Sand. The influence of the model parameters is examined throughout a parametric assessment analysis. It was observed, that the model approximates well the general features of both cyclic and static loading. Regarding cyclic loading, it produced similar responses in terms of excess pore pressures generation and stress paths even though it slightly overpredicts the cyclic resistance for small number of loading cycles and underpredicts the cyclic resistance for large number of loading cycles. Regarding static liquefaction, even if the model had initially overestimated the response, it was able to simulate successfully the static liquefaction behaviour after a recalibration process was established.The next part of the project includes the performance of the PM4Sand model for the prediction of earthquake-induced liquefaction in hydraulic fills, which are analysed for several different seismic motions. The fill is placed over a different range of relative densities and it is modelled in Plaxis software as a 1-D soil column. The fill layers that are prone to liquefy, are modelled with the PM4Sand model while the layers that are not susceptible to liquefaction are modelled with Hardening Soil Small (HSS) model. The PM4Sand layer is calibrated according to factors that are accounting for the in-situ state of the fill and the magnitude of the earthquake motions. The dynamic analyses are performed with and without consolidation and the lateral boundaries used are tied degrees of freedom. The results in terms of excess pore pressures generation are examined throughout the whole earthquake motion. Moreover, the onset of liquefaction in the hydraulic fill is captured when the excess pore pressure ratio has reached a value of around 1.0 (ru≈1). It is shown, that the PM4Sand model is indeed applicable for the prediction of earthquake-induced and static liquefaction in hydraulic fills. The effect of the in-situ state of the fill, in particular the relative density, has a critical role on the liquefaction susceptibility, which is a lot representative to what has been observed in reality. According to PM4Sand model, the loosely-packed fills DR=30% and DR=40%) are indeed more susceptible to liquefaction compared to the densely-packed fills (DR=50% and DR=60%) which showed less or even no liquefaction potential due to the earthquake events. On the other hand, the largest drawback of the NCEER method it its empirical nature, as for the current project it is proved to be conservative for the design. More specifically, it predicted liquefaction for almost all the hydraulic fills (DR=30% to DR=60%) analyzed for all different earthquake motions. Regarding the dynamic analyses with consolidation, the results related to the earthquake-induced liquefaction of the fills are more representative to realistic conditions as there is a better distribution of excess pore pressures along the soil column with respect to the dynamic analyses without consolidation. For the latter type of analysis, in the loosely-packed fills (DR=30% and DR=40%) there is a better diffusion of excess pore pressures more for the signals of low dominant frequencies regardless the peak ground acceleration values of the input signal. In the densely-packed fills (DR=50% and DR=60%) the same phenomenon takes pace more for the signals of high dominant frequencies. However, a localization of liquefied zones is observed in distinct parts along the fill layer for the rest of the signals.","PM4Sand; hydraulic fill; dynamic analysis; earthquake-induced liquefaction; static liquefaction; cyclic loading; NCEER method","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geo-Engineering","",""

(mentor); de Winter, J.C.F. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","A large number of pedestrian fatalities and the emergence of autonomous vehicles (AVs) creates a need for research in vehicle to pedestrian (V2P) interaction. Gestures (e.g., hand movement, eye contact) used for communication between pedestrians and manually driven vehicle plays a significant role to reduce ambiguities and make safe road crossing decisions. With autonomous vehicles on the roads in the near future, it may be possible that pedestrians are not able to understand the vehicle behaviour or vice a versa. Virtual reality (VR) simulations are used to test a new method of communications such as external human-machine interface (eHMI) between AVs and pedestrians. Virtual reality has emerged as an effective and cost-efficient tool in various fields such as surgical training, technician training and driver simulators. Among many benefits of virtual reality, is it’s ability to expose its users to critical situations where the real environment would be dangerous and therefore, could be a viable tool for conducting V2P research. However, it is essential to understand how pedestrians’ behaviour and perception match in VR or 360◦ video with real life to rely on them<br/>as an experimental method. The main goal of this study was to examine the <br/> effectiveness of VR and 360-degree video environments in terms of pedestrian perception and behaviour to draw actionable conclusions on the reliability of VR.<br/>An experiment was conducted to test the interaction between pedestrians and autonomous vehicles using three different environments: a field test on a a public road, a replication of the test in an animated virtual reality (VR) simulation and a third repetition using a 360-degree video recording of the same location. The animated virtual environment was designed using Unity and C#, and the 360-degree videos were recorded at the field test location from participants’ position at a height of 180 cm. The participant was standing on the sidewalk on a two-lane road in Delft in each environment. To compare human perception of distance and speed and behaviour in terms of gap accepted during road crossing scenarios in 360-degree video and animated VR, three tasks being: 1) Distance estimation, 2) Speed estimation and 3) Gap acceptance was conducted in each environment with a within-subject design (N = 30). <br/><br/>Results showed that there were no significant differences between the three environments for distance estimation, gap acceptance tasks and measures of presence. However, significant differences were found between animated VR and 360-degree video environment for perceived speed of 30 km/h. According to the median values, the perceived distance in real life and animated virtual environment deviated below 5% from the ground truth values. However, the median values for perceived distance in 360-degree video environment for<br/>distances of 40 m and 63 m were overestimated. The deviation in perceived distance increased as the ground truth value increased, wherein the animated virtual environment showed the highest amount of variance amongst the three environments. Underestimation of the speed of about 5 - 10 km/h was observed in both field tests and animated virtual environment for speeds below 50 km/h. The median values show that the perceived speed was most accurate in a 360-degree video environment. However, the animated virtual environment was more consistent with real life perceived speed. A significant positive correlation between distance and speed estimates showed consistency in human perception across the three environments. A negative correlation was found between perceived distance and gap acceptance ratio, whereas a positive correlation was found between perceived speed and gap acceptance ratio. The presence scores were relatively higher for field tests and 360-degree video environments compared to the animated virtual environment. However, the scores were high enough to validate the three environments subjectively. Only one participant experience motion<br/>sickness in virtual reality tasks with a score of above 2 out of 3, experiencing a moderate sickness but was successfully able to complete the whole experimental task. Overall results show that pedestrian perception and behaviour in 360-degree video and animated VR environment doesn’t differ significantly from real life. These results have a strong implication on the usage of virtual environments for studying pedestrians’ perception and behaviour when interacting with vehicles.","vehicle to pedestrian communication; Virtual Reality; Automated driving; Validation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Vehicle Engineering","",""

Several ventilation strategies are formed in order to ensure that the suggested system functions effectively in an annual basis. To evaluate the developed concept and to make estimations regarding its acoustic and thermal performance calculations are conducted indicating the facade’s cavity temperature, the levels of sound insulation and the amount of the provided airflow. After taking into account the calculations’ results, several facade typologies are developed and evaluated according to their feasibility, cost and aesthetic value.

These days, more than a half of the population of Mumbai dwell in the informal settlements, dealing with poor living conditions and low standard of living. Since the nation’s Independence in 1947, India experienced different approaches and policies towards slums: Slum Clearance Act (1956), Slum Improvement Program (1971), Slum Upgrading Program (1985). All of them in some sense are products of evolution of many schemes before11. Eventually, it became obvious that these strategies failed to achieve the required demand due to different reasons. Being unable and unwilling to provide the Economical Weaker Section (EWS) with the adequate housing and with the aim to resolve the problem of informal settlements the state government passed the reins of control of the housing issue to the market. After the Slum Rehabilitation Scheme was introduced in 1995, it quickly became popular among the private sector due to the abolition of restrictions on profits. However, while chasing the profit developer ignored the necessities of the urban poor. Proceeding from the ideas of extreme densification, the redevelopment consumed the whole complexity of existing social and economic networks, which is crucial for the inhabitants of the informal settlements due to the social engagement and income generation. The developer-centric approach neglected the fact that most of the working population of Mumbai is involved in the informal sector, which apart from dwelling is also consists of working areas for the urban poor. Their plans lack of spaces containing different forms of small-scale labor, which play an important role in the informal economy. Therefore, it requires an innovative approach towards dwellings’ design. In chase of higher FSI, the stakeholders did not take into account patterns of social activities. Therefore, it lacks both outdoor spaces and places for gathering that could reinforce the sense of community. Sticking to the same strategy of redevelopment, which provide people with shelters instead of adequate housing is a contradiction to the goals of the Sustainable Development 2030 of the United Nations Habitat commission, which addresses the topic of the housing problem in the Urban Global South. If we do not want to repeat the fate of the Kowloon Walled City, which was demolished due to its unlivable conditions, it is time to reconsider the approach towards housing design for the urban poor.","Mumbai; Housing; housing affordability; Affordability","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Global Housing","",""

Autonomous trucks cannot become widespread without eliminating this danger by guaranteeing rollover-free vehicle motion. Currently existing Roll Stability Control implementations rely on the assumption of having a responsible driver behind the steering wheel -- therefore, unsupervised driving will need a higher level of roll safety than what the currently used methods can provide. Fortunately, there are two main attributes of self-driving vehicles that can be utilized to achieve this goal: Information about the reference path ahead of the truck will be available and the used algorithms may have a full control authority over the available actuators.<br/> <br/>This thesis project developed two, redundant rollover mitigation techniques to be run in parallel, for a tractor-trailer combination: The proactive and reactive Roll Stability Control methods. These vehicle motion controllers are separate, independent functional entities.<br/> <br/>While the proactive approach attempts to prevent upcoming events, the reactive Roll Stability Control is designed to mitigate imminent rollovers that could not be anticipated based on motion reference information. This controller is placed within the motion control paradigm of Control Allocation. The objective of Control Allocation is to coordinate different actuators to achieve both longitudinal and yaw accelerations as desired by the higher-level tracking controller. Roll stability is achieved by extending the set of functionalities of this framework, using both brakes and steering to realize the needed interventions. Emphasis is put on accurate wheel lift-off detection, using lateral acceleration, steering angle and accurately estimated roll angle signals.<br/> <br/>Design choices during syntheses of both controllers were made based on the conclusions of a thorough analysis of roll dynamics, carried out using a high-fidelity vehicle model, provided and validated by Volvo Group Truck Technologies. Subsequently, both controllers were implemented within Volvo's real-time framework. While the proactive method's performance was only assessed using simulations, the reactive controller was tested on Volvo's proving grounds.<br/> <br/>The thesis concludes that achieving a higher level of roll stability of (autonomous) heavy vehicles is possible, whilst having a less conservative overall behaviour compared to traditional approaches.

At the core of the strategy was my perception of what I think is the role of the architect: There are always areas which are being neglected because they are of lower quality, their redevelopment won’t make anybody any money or they don’t fit in the image of the city of the future. I think an architect you should always have a wider scoop and look for opportunities and creative designs to connect the interest of different stakeholders and create architecture that is holistic in addressing societal issues. Based on this statement, a theoretical framework based on the theory of affordances, spatial analysis and resident interviews a strategy was developed which had three parts: 1) Lift the new station development to a higher level, to make a place for a program that creates benefit for the existing neighbourhood. 2) Create a transition from highly urbanised to local community scale to protect the current good qualities of the neighbourhood (dense but green and quiet). 3) Connect the new development to the surrounding area to prevent segregation. Each part of the strategy had specific design tools which were elaborated on by a design proposal.","Architecture; Station development; Urban renewal; Post-war neighbourhood; Mobility; Infrastructure; disadvantaged neighbourhoods; inequality; Urbanism; Strategy development; Peri-urban station","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","","51.990994, 4.364544"

This time the city successfully managed to avoid the critical date; however, the underlying problems are not solved permanently, the future is not secured. The city is pushed forward to take action and „be a beacon in Africa through the progressive realization of Cape Town as a water sensitive city (CoCT, 2018A)”. However, water scarcity is further complicated by high levels of inequity and poor water quality in the city’s townships, where the legacy of apartheid is still present in forms of social and spatial segregation. The thesis seeks to explore and develop spatial strategies that can foster the transition towards a water sensitive Cape Town, while also providing inhabitants with equal access to water services and amenities. The Cape Town urban water cycle and resource flows are evaluated using the Water Mass Balance equation. The metabolic analysis is completed with spatial mapping of regional water flows, which reveals vulnerable territories and potential intervention zones. Three peri-urban cluster areas along different watercourses have been selected to showcase water sensitive design interventions focusing on the water-food-energy nexus. A micro scale design for Imizamo Yethu township exemplifies the details and technical aspects of implementing Water Sensitive Urban Design and Sustainable Drainage Systems. Spatial measures are translated into typologies to enhance their transferability as design principles to various locations. Besides the spatial strategies, the thesis provides recommendations on improving public participation in water governance by bridging the communication gap between local communities and decision-makers through catchment forums. The thesis concludes that the urban water cycle is an epitome of why we cannot ‘divide’ a city without serious consequences. As water flows through the city and interlaces neighbourhoods regardless of any border, Cape Town can only achieve its goal and become a water sensitive city if strategies address the whole urban ecosystem including still often neglected areas and marginalized communities.","urban water metabolism; catchment forum; participatory water governance; water sensitive urban design (WSUD); sustainable drainage systems (SuDS); Cape Town","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution); University Medical Center Utrecht (degree granting institution)","2019","Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is a three-dimensional deformity of the spine that can be treated by wearing a correctional rigid brace. The goal of brace treatment is prevention of curve progression, and in some cases the curve even decreases. The current problem concerning treatment of AIS lays in the design decisions made during manufacturing of the brace. Correctional forces are applied through static pressure pads added to the inside of the brace. Evaluation of the correct positioning and size of these forces is done through radiographic imaging which allows limited feedback intervals as cumulative exposure to ionizing radiation increases the risk of cancer development. The design of scoliotic braces is currently suboptimal as the manufacturing remains an inefficient process. Moreover, it was hypothesized that the corrective forces show decreasing time dependant behaviour due to viscoelastic properties of the human body adapting to the load. <br/>The objectives of this study were therefore to increase the effectiveness of brace treatment, by determination of the time dependant behaviour and accurate positioning and sizing of correctional forces.<br/>A dynamic brace was developed containing pressure regulated cuffs creating a three-point-bending system on the spine. A healthy (non-scoliotic) test subject wore the brace with the goal of creating a spinal curvature. The cuffs were tested on stress relaxation behaviour, which was needed to determine if possible changes in pressure were due to viscoelasticity of the cuffs or the body. The tests showed that pressure stayed constant over time, which excludes viscoelasticity of the cuffs. Moreover, compression tests were executed on a cuff to determine the relationship between external loads and internal pressures. <br/>Ultrasound (US) imaging was used to evaluate the effect of the three-point-bending system on the spine. The images showed a curvature, but the results varied too much to draw conclusions from, as this imaging technique works best for large scoliotic curves. BoneMRI has higher imaging accuracy and adds an extra dimension, however supine positioning decreases the spinal curvature. The boneMRI results show a subtle curvature after applying pressure. The cuffs lengthened the spine and caused mechanical torsion. After one hour the lengthening remained equal but the mechanical torsion decreased to its starting value. Lengthening of the spine could be useful in brace treatment to create more space between vertebrae and facilitate vertebral realignment. <br/>This research served as a proof of concept which can be further developed by testing on a scoliotic patient with a moderate spinal curvature. This could result in a dynamic brace used as a method to enhance the positioning and sizing of pressure pads for a static brace, or the dynamic brace design needs adjustment to use it as a daily worn brace which keeps correctional forces constant by adjusting pressures automatically. <br","Brace; Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis; Manufacturing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Fractures can massively influence the permeability and porosity in a rock formation, reducing resistance to flow. However, to improve permeability, multiple fractures must connect to each other. Therefore, it is important to understand the effects of a stress field under varying orientations and how it influences new and existing fractures. Brazilian disc tests were filmed and performed on 18 Indiana limestone samples, after which 13 samples were fractured a second time under orientations varying from 20° to 90°. Afterwards, video footage of the tests was used to study fracture propagation and fracture roughness. Analysis of the results showed that four distinct types of fracture behaviour occurred. Each type was generally displayed between certain angles. Case 1, under 30° shows reactivation of the original fracture. Case 2, between 30 and 45°, shows largely reactivation of the primary fracture but new secondary fractures towards the ends of the sample. Case 3, between 45 and 60°, shows the primary fracture closing and formation of secondary fractures near the centre of the disk. Case 4, from 60° onwards, shows the primary fracture close completely while a new fracture forms perpendicular and independent of the first. The results imply that initiating a stress field in a certain orientation has differing consequences. A stress field more parallel towards the original fracture causes reactivation of the fracture, without much impact on the permeability. However, a stress field initiated perpendicular to the primary fracture causes a new fracture to form, independent of and straight through the primary fracture. This is likely to increase permeability and therefore reduce resistance to flow.","Brazilian Disc Test; indiana limestone; tensile fractures; fracture interaction","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Earth Sciences","",""

These events are similar to an escape room in which teams work together to solve puzzles, only on larger scale. Different kinds of challenges, arise when hosting these events, such as monitoring the progress of the teams and managing collection of physical puzzles. For an escape event, different kinds of staff help the teams to have the best experience possible. The teams need to be able to submit their answers to puzzles, while the staff should provide them with the right materials and monitor their progress. To facilitate these needs, Raccoon Serious Games created the Massive Online Reactive Serious Escape (M.O.R.S.E) system. However, the old system lacked in the parts of modularity and flexibility, while having the event hardcoded. To solve this problem, we created a new system to improve the lesser points of the old system while also improving the usability and maintainability. Over the course of ten weeks, we researched and created the Massive Online Reactive Serious Escape 2.0 (M.O.R.S.E 2.0) system. The first part of the project consisted of researching the previous system to find the requirements for a new system. After that, a new system was designed and implemented from the ground up. M.O.R.S.E 2.0 contains all the functionality of the old system, while also improving the structure of the administrator panel. Furthermore, the final product comes with several editors, allowing for designing the puzzles, schedule and logic in the form of rulesets for an escape event and allowing multiple events to be created managed. Furthermore the configuration editor allows the employees of Raccoon Serious Games to adjust different types of settings and cosmetics. The product was successfully tested during an escape event and will be used by Raccoon Serious Games for future events.","escape room; web application; modularity; Meteor; Typescript","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science and Engineering","",""

I believe the design project must anticipate the global social and economic shifts that are present within the territory of the North Sea and must be shaped in relation to the effects of these changes on local societal level. Mapping is used as a tool of associating, ordering and projecting the changes in the qualities (territorialities) of the space rather then a mere visualisation tool (Corner,1999). Equally important, The scripting of scenarios based on literature and statistical data allows for the depiction of the alternate realities that the societal shifts could produce. Taking Port Landscapes, Automation and the energy transition as drivers of change, the project aims at redesigning an automated infrastructure for windblade production, storage and maintanance, and with that reshaping the coastal form based on this process. The aim is in determining the relationship between automation, form and the port landscape. Taking both automated and natural processes into account when designing, the project is inspired by the writings of Martin Pawley, in his work Terminal Architecture (Pawley, 1998) he writes: “ The real barometer of the value of buildings today is not their aesthetic pedigree, but rather their usefullness as terminals in the maze of networks that sustain modern life.Authentic Architecture has been disurbanised. It survives only in the shape of building like distribution centers, factories, petrol stations, that are designed as instruments not monuments.” The design depicts the process and actions of the machine.

(mentor); Bilow, Marcel (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","Glass is a material with high potentiality in a structural application. Brittleness has always been challenging for glass structure. Recyclability is also challenging for the current glass application since the chemical bonding is contaminating the recipe. Interlocking cast glass construction offers an interesting bypass to solve these two problems. To not rely on chemical bonding, the interlocking mechanism is used. Interlocking requires self-stabilising bulky units which are the perfect fit for the casting process, which is not conventional for the structural glass. Interlocking construction with glass blocks relies on soft interlayer to avoid peak stress and protect the glass. Also, this makes the interlocking cast glass construction rather challenging to analyse.<br/><br/>The thesis investigates the key aspects of the topological interlocking cast glass (referred as TICG) system with elastomer interlayers. Glass is a sensitive material; its structural behaviour needs to be investigated considering its geometry and boundary condition of the application. The complexity of the structural behaviour lies in three levels, namely, single block level, block-interlayer-block interaction level and interlocking assembly level.<br/><br/>The literature research was done as the first step to understanding the relevant aspect for the TICG system could be. It then concluded that the interlayer mechanical attributes, glass geometry, interlocking amplitude and lateral pre-compression could be the key aspects. A case of the Optical House in Hiroshima, Japan is chosen to apply this technology, for which the possible failure and risk is analysed according to the possible failure mode in the literature research. A strategy of using active façade with compression-release is determined for the key feature of the façade.<br/><br/>Given the complexity in the TICG composition, it is decided to do physical testing on the interlocking cast glass system and blocks, instead of doing numerical simulation. This part generates the requirement for façade engineering to be considered for the next section. The TICG structural behaviour complexity is investigated in three tests, namely, uniaxial test, three-block shear test and assembly test. The uniaxial test yielded the relevance of interlayer strengths and block geometry. The three-block shear test showed the relation between shear key geometry and shear load transfer. The final assembly test proved that the pre-compression is still relevant to the stiffness of the TICG façade and actively controlled releasing mechanism should be integrated.<br/><br/>In the last part, the façade is engineered and detailed considering the requirement previously investigated. Feasibility, detailing and assembly sequence is given. Comparison has been made between existing threaded cast glass solution and the TICG solution.<br/><br/>The thesis plays a part in the glass research group in the Building Engineering department of TU Delft and it is aimed to provide a step forward towards a more reliable and more recyclable glass structural solution.","Glass; Cast glass; Structural glass; Safety design; Risk analysis; Structural Behavior; Facade design; facade control; Smart facade","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","",""

The amount of entirely closed off, fortress–like private properties is growing, creating extremely inefficient public spaces. Those ‘in-between’ areas paradoxically create less safe environment putting the inhabitants in dangerous, ghetto-like environment the moment they leave their ‘safety bubble’.

This implies the high demand for urban housing, infrastructure developments and services. In many cases, because the government is unable to provide solutions, it shifts the approach from “providing to enabling”, encouraging the private sector to invest in the built environment. This results in developing New Towns which tend to envision of “Africa Rising” Narrative - driven by rapid economic growth. Ideologically, New Towns should be the solution for economic and population growth, however, influenced strongly by private sector’s ambitions, governments’ visions and emerging middle-class’s desires, they tend to become an exclusive and luxurious development, excluding the majority of the population who simply cannot afford living there. This approach may lead to socio-spatial exclusion, resulting in socio-spatial segregation. This research discusses this phenomenon in the case study of Tatu City – a private New Town in Kenya that is partly built, partly under construction and partly in the design process. This research discusses the socio-spatial and governance challenges of Tatu City that have a direct and indirect impact on socio-spatial exclusion.

This was investigated because currently, the vessels designed by IHC, have to sail back to port to restock on pipes. During this time the expensive pipelayer is not laying pipes and thus not making money for its operator. Some operators have already moved to designs which use cranes to load pipes at sea. However, lifting heavy objects results in limited operability and wide vessels. The problem owner (IHC) wants to avoid this. The goal was to find a way to transship pipes offshore, which improves on the current performance of the reference vessel without resorting to cranes to transfer the pipes. <br/><br/>The research was mainly focused on the modelling of the logistical process of getting pipes from the port to the location. The results of this were used for the conceptual design of a flexlay vessel capable of being supplied at sea. The reference vessel built by the problem owner turned out to be a suitable candidate for adaptation for this purpose. To reach this conclusion, a logistical model was made, which was used as a basis for parametric studies. As input to that studies, a seastate timeseries is generated together with different transshipment methods. Two sets of simulations were used to evaluate the effect of the transshipment method in relation to a range of operational limits, and the effect of the distance on the operation.<br/><br/>The resulting pipelayer is fitted with two mailbox type docks in the side, this elongates the vessel and decreases its initial draught. These docks are closed and drained afterwards in order to secure the barge. The main conclusion is that it is possible to redesign the original pipelayer to accommodate the transshipment of pipes offshore.","Dockship; Pipelaying; Transshipment; Transfer at sea; Ship Design; Logistical model; Seastate persistence model; Pipelaying vessel; Loading and offloading at sea; Offshore field development","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Marine Technology | Ship Design, Production and Operations","",""

A new spatial order will arise: one of energy landscapes. This thesis has investigated this infrastructural and morphological transition through a transcalar ‘research by design’ approach. It has endeavoured to re-establish the role of architecture as an infrastructural enabler in a projected (extreme flooding and drought) scenario, developing a transcalar spatial order in the Scottish Highlands region of Brora. The project’s agency culminates in striving to achieve symbiosis between the infrastructural design of a proposed hydro-electric energy network, the receiving landscape and the habitable space needed for existing local life. The design focuses on water and electricity delivery to an existing distillery in the area, while also reinterpreting the typological arrangement of the distillery to be as energy efficient as possible.

More and more companies and government institutions see the value of circularity of raw materials. The municipal- ity of Amsterdam published several reports to clarify the directions towards circu- larity. A report on waste-chains highlights the importance of organic residual flows for circular economy transition. This thesis focuses on organic residual streams, the lack of understanding of these streams has been mentioned as an obstacle to plan- ning by many of regional stakeholders. The topic of this thesis is formulated within the context of the REPAiR project by the AMS Institute. The starting point of this thesis is the waste collection location in public space and follows the waste back to the retailers of food. The households are identified, after which the used trashcan and the retailers of food are identified.<br/>To create the geographical connection between the three nodes in this thesis, a related works research is conducted. The main source of food waste is food retail and the main disposal is collection of residual waste. Since the municipality of Amsterdam is not collection organic waste separately, residual waste is considered. Multiple researches added spatial dimensions to their material flows, trying to cre- ate a better insight in sinks and flows of the chains. Household level is not reached. This leads to the research question: How can household waste flows be mapped in reverse based on their environment?<br/>To create the mentioned connections, two main methods are developed. First, the method household-to-trashcan and second, the method household-to-retail. The first method is simulating the pedestrian path from a household towards their used trashcan. A least cost raster is created from the BGT, the direct environment is translated into walkability values representing the willingness to walk on a certain object. By comparing the paths to different trashcans, the trashcan reachable with the smallest least cost value is picked. Another factor is inserted, considering that walking to the trashcan is mandatory trip, executed in as less time as possible, city hotspots are inserted. The hypothesis suggests that people are willing to walk further, if the residents can combine their trip to the trashcan with their trip to, for example, the supermarket. By changing the values in the least cost raster, this direction is made preferable. After the validation of this method is concluded, that a stronger influence of the city hotspot (among the tested values), results in a higher positive correlation of the number of households per trashcan and the mass of waste in the trashcan in kg.<br/>The second method household-to-retail, is a demonstration, due to the uncer- tainly and the many involved personal factors. Food retailers in different isochrone areas are given importance values based on their distance towards the considered household and the floor size of the retailer.<br/>After establishing the connections from trashcan to household and from house- hold to food retail, reverse distribution of the waste measure in the trashcan can be executed. In this way is known which household contributed how many kg per year to the trash composition of the used trashcan. When adding the other step, the contribution by the food retailers can be given.<br/>This thesis generates the first step in mapping residual waste flows touching household level. Promising positive correlations between the number of households using a trashcan and the kg measured inside this trashcan are shown. The method household-to-retail cannot be validated and is therefore only a demonstration. The outcome of this thesis is a step in the right direction to be able to follow waste through the waste chain, by analyzing results in trash composition and knowing which households and retailer contribute to this composition.","Waste; Flow; Mapping; Amsterdam; reverse chain; household waste; household detail","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geomatics","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","Negative emission technologies aim to remove historic CO<sub>2</sub> from the atmosphere. Bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) is regarded as a possible negative emission technology. This thesis aims to study the technological and economic feasibility of implementing BECCS in the cement industry. Four different types of biomass - rice husk pellets, wood pellets, sewage sludge, and municipal solid waste were chosen to substitute 30% of the coal in a model of a European cement plant. With an emphasis on retrofitting, three CO<sub>2</sub> capture technologies, absorption using monoethanol amine (MEA), calcium looping (CaL) based capture, and oxyfuel combustion capture were chosen. This thesis compares the techno-economic performance of the BECCS technologies in a cement plant using the key performance indicators (KPIs) of specific primary energy consumption per CO<sub>2</sub> avoided (SPECCA), cement production costs and costs of CO<sub>2</sub> avoided. Mass balance results and estimates of capital and operating expenses were used to calculate the KPIs. The parameters for each biomass-CO<sub>2</sub> capture combination are compared to each other and compared to the reference value of a cement plant which uses 100% coal without CCS. The results were subjected to sensitivity analysis. CO<sub>2</sub> accounting was performed for a defined boundary to estimate the carbon footprint of the BECCS technologies. The BECCS technologies studied have a lower rate of cement production as a result of co-firing biomass in existing boilers. This can be attributed to the low calorific value of biomass. Of the three CO<sub>2</sub> capture technologies, oxyfuel combustion capture is the least energy consuming option (1.8 MJ/t<sub>CO2</sub>, with wood pellets) and the highest range of SPECCA is visible in the case of MEA (8.6 MJ/t<sub>CO2</sub>, with municipal solid waste). The cement production costs increase by 42 to 89% compared to the costs without CO<sub>2</sub> capture. The cost of CO<sub>2</sub> avoided is between 45 €/t<sub>CO2</sub> (wood pellets with oxyfuel) to a higher range of 96 €/t<sub>CO2</sub> (sewage sludge with MEA). The variation in costs is significantly affected by the type of biomass used. CaL technology has a moderate performance in energy consumption and costs. SPECCA obtained for CaL process is in the range of 4.1 to 4.4 MJ/t<sub>CO2</sub> and the cost of CO<sub>2</sub> avoided is in the range of 57 to 74 €/t<sub>CO2</sub>. CaL also entails the highest CO<sub>2</sub> capture rates, in comparison with MEA and oxyfuel technologies. In terms of total CO<sub>2</sub> emissions avoided, CaL based CO<sub>2</sub> capture gives the highest CO<sub>2</sub> avoided for the system boundary defined. Therefore, when the CO<sub>2</sub> removed from the atmosphere through the growth of biomass is included, the net CO<sub>2</sub> emissions are the least for CaL capture technology. The reason is the additional thermal energy requirements for the retrofitted CaL process units, which are met with 100% biomass. Although theoretically, a net negative value of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions was visible in the case of CaL, it must be noted that upstream process emissions are not included. But in practice, it is still unclear as to whether negative emissions are attainable with the information at hand.","BECCS; Technoeconomic assessment; Cement industry; Decarbonization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

The focus of the research is the Bandung Region in Indonesia, a densely populated metropolitan area, highly exposed to flood risk due to its vulnerable socio-spatial context. The future predictions indicate that by 2035 the population in this area will increase double to the current situation (Djalante, Garschagen, Thomalla, &amp; Shaw, 2017), leading to rise of the social inequalities and escalating vulnerabilities. By further exploring the existing practices for reduction of those risks, the research finds measures improving the safety conditions, but failing to address the issues of well-being and quality of life of the society. This leads to the understanding that overcoming the issues of vulnerability, within the framework of the uncertain future, requires more than just aiming at flood protection.

This research demonstrates that an IDS that is trained with unrealistic data performs nowhere near as well as is claimed by the author when trained using real network traffic. Finally, we propose CAML-IDS, a framework for the correct assessment of machine learning-based intrusion detection systems.

A promising new technique that hasn't found much adoption in offshore industry is SPH. This thesis aims to improve the reach and use of SPH within the offshore industry. With an abundance of world's unexplored hydrocarbons located in the Arctic Region, 18\%, ice-structure interactions (ISI) are set to increase. Modeling these ISI requires complex dynamics, SPH can model these ISI dynamics without extra treatment. SPH works by interpolation of a set of neighbouring particles using a weighing function. This modeling technique offers many advantages over conventional rules-of-thumb, Finite Element Modeling (FEM), and Finite Volume (FV) methods. SPH is a particle based method, thus, uniquely suited for problems with large displacements, or discontinuities. However, in the standard, weakly-compressible (WCSPH) method spurious pressure fluctuations and particle clustering can occur. By implementing the plethora of correction methods and equations present in literature, such as kernel corrections, incompressible variants, or density corrections, these drawbacks can be circumvented and a robust framework can be formed. An implementation of WCSPH that focuses on adaptability and flexibility is presented in this work. The flexibility of the implementation allows future researchers to focus on the core of their research, only changing the equations they are interested in, instead of implementing all the required equations for a full SPH simulation. A validation study of the implementation assures that it matches closely with existing implementations and real-world results. The mathematical model developed in Keijdener (2018) is implemented in the proposed WCSPH implementation. Comparing the results shows close agreement for the breaking length. However, significant differences are present in the failure time results. Despite this it shows the possibility of combining solid mechanics with SPH, and validates the integration method, solver, and SPH model.","SPH; ISI; Simulation; Smooth particle hydrodynamics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

These turbines are operating in a harsh environment. Adopting a preventive maintenance strategy is important to achieve an as high as possible availability of the farm and reduce the cost of maintenance. A well performing condition monitoring system that utilizes SCADA data from the wind farm can enable this strategy without the need in additional cost in hardware. This master thesis focusses on the development of a framework that can be utilized for this task. This framework can process raw operational SCADA data collected at the Egmond aan Zee offshore wind farm to create a clean dataset to train supervised machine learning models on. This work provides an insight in the correlation between different SCADA signals using a mathematical approach and from a understanding of the system integration of drivetrain components. Bearing temperatures are modelled using a data driven approach to describe the temperatures under healthy conditions. Several models are evaluated for this task and it was concluded that a decision tree supervised machine learning regression model resulted in the lowest error between predicted and measured values. Anomalies are detected and tracked with a normal behaviour model and a Sherward and CUSUM control chart that are applied on the residual error between modelled and measured temperature signals. 4 anomalies could be identified in the gearbox bearings using the developed framework. Abnormal behaviour of the drivetrain could be identified as early as 1 month before the turbine was taken out of productions. This highlights that temperature based condition monitoring that utilizes SCADA data can be used for early detection of faults by combining the accuracy of supervised machine learning methods with different fault detection methods like the CUSUM control chart. This work also investigates the relation between experienced wake of a wind turbine and the influence on the drivetrain component temperatures. The wake conditions at Egmond aan Zee, modelled with an Ishahara wake model, and the component temperature measurements from the SCADA data are used for this analysis. The bearing temperature distributions under different operational and wake conditions can be compared by clustering over the wind speed and the velocity deficit or turbulence intensity at turbine level. It is concluded from this work that wake effects do not result in a change in drivetrain component temperatures. The effects of asymmetric wake conditions opposed to wake experienced over the entire rotor is analysed by comparing the temperature distributions under these conditions in a cluster where the turbine is partially waked. A small shift towards higher component temperatures can observed on a limited amount of data for turbines under asymmetric loading conditions.","SCADA; Offshore Wind; Condition Monitoring; Supervised machine learning; decision trees; Asymmetric wake loading; Temperature based","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-07-08","","","","European Wind Energy Masters (EWEM)","",""

For the EU, bioenergy was considered mostly for its contribution to greening and diversifying its energy mix. While its impact on CO2 emissions is hotly debated, there is a dearth of studies regarding the energy security implications of bioenergy in the EU. This opens up a window of opportunities and challenges to perform such a study. The main research question of this thesis is:What has been the impact of bioenergy on the energy security for the EU from 2000 to 2018?The main research question and the sub-research questions are addressed in the context of the EU economy and its vision for climate mitigation. The thesis starts with the literature review of energy security leading up to framing a new theoretical framework. Past implications of bioenergy that includes biofuels in the last decade and a half since 2000 have been analyzed. The thesis has assessed what bioenergy has delivered in that time. Positive and negative developments are taken into account and analyzed with respect to the selected energy security indicators and metrics.Both ES literature and PEST tool have been employed to narrow down the data gathering and relevance of energy security indicators for bioenergy. The use of the PEST analysis tool also offers a unique combination of elements in the framework and a boarder categorization, which in traditional energy security is often not employed.To get a better overview of EU bioenergy, a review of the current policy of the EU for bioenergy has been done. It presents all relevant data related to bioenergy like various bioenergy potential, total energy consumption, and demand, etc. Then, different characteristics and features of bioenergy are described along with the various conversion routes to obtain different forms of energy (namely biofuels, bio-electricity, and bio-heat) are explained. Some of the projections for 2020 for bioenergy in the EU have also been provided to better gauge the state of availability of resources and likely policy direction taken in the future. The effects on the energy security indicators of bioenergy in the EU have been derived from the data on EU bioenergy and is assessed with respect to the 22 selected energy security indicators and metrics from the analytical framework. A rating of 3.0 here implies no or a little effect for energy security indicator or metric on account of bioenergy, anything above 3.0 is positive, and below 3.0 implies a negative impact. It is found that the overall effects have been slightly positive with an average rating of 3.09 for all the 22 selected ES indicators. With 3.5, for the dimension of ‘technology development and efficiency’, it has a positive effect implying an increase in employment in the bio-sector and high research budget for bioenergy from 2000-2018. However, with a score of 2.9 for the dimension of ‘Environmental &amp; social sustainability’, the effects have been overall negative, implying a negative impact on the environment in the last 18 years.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

Image segmentation is the task of dividing an image into ""segments"" that are uniform as well as homogeneous with respect to some characteristics, for example grey tone or texture as in Haralick et al. This thesis seeks to perform image segmentation using a Deep Learning (DL) approach in the area of warehouse automation, specifically focusing on an order picking use case of Vanderlande Industries (VI). Generally in literature, DL algorithms for image segmentation are split into two main classes: algorithms for RGB images and algorithms for RGB-D images. RGB stands for the Red, Green, and Blue values of a pixel. RGB-D stands for the Red, Green, Blue, and Depth values of a pixel. The depth value in this case differs from the RGB values in that it does not give a value for a colour intensity, but rather it gives a value for physical distance between the camera and the object it is capturing. The challenge addressed by this thesis focuses on whether the introduction of depth data results in a substantially better performance than using RGB-only images, based on a data-set provided by VI. Also, this thesis looks into the maximum allowed deviation along the X-axis in the registration of the depth data to the RGB images. Two networks from literature were investigated and implemented in MATLAB for this purpose: the SegNet architecture proposed by Badrinarayanan et al. and the FuseNet architecture proposed by Hazirbas et al. Through experiments we have found that, for this use case, the introduction of complementary depth data leads to an improvement over the use of RGB-only images. We also find that, for this use case, the maximum allowed deviation along the X-axis in the registration of the depth data to the RGB images is approximately equal to 1.67 millimetres. The results in this thesis seem to indicate that investing in acquiring an additional depth band does have a positive effect on the accuracy of image segmentation for order picking in warehouse automation.","Deep Learning; RGB-D; Warehouse automation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

Barely a place or species sharing this earth remains unaffected by our activity. Humans treat other animals as commodities, objects available to be exploited. They are used for our gain and pleasure, at great cost to those individuals involved and indeed to entire species. The North Sea, surrounded by many of the world’s most powerful nations is suffering from catastrophic overfishing. Trillions of fish are killed each year, a scale of extraction so huge it is leaving ecosystems on the brink of collapse. A disconnect in our empathy for other species is further widened by the border between land and sea, the familiar and the unknown, between us and them. Scalloway is a small town in the Shetland Isles, 260 miles North East of Scotland. It sits in a wild, beautiful and romanticised landscape, surely the epitome of nature. Yet the islands are dominated by intense and ever growing salmon farms, highly destructive both to the fish who are farmed and the environment the industry dominates. As demand continues to grow, consumers typically have very little connection to the producers or the impacts felt by production. Scalloway is left in a state of constant adaptation, intensification and increasing dependency. Alternatives to animal-based foods exist and the arguments for their adoption, from nutrient profile to sustainability to animal welfare is compelling, so why haven’t we changed our approach to production? Food, despite playing an essential, daily part of each and every of our lives, appears to be the last aspect we are willing to adapt or change. It is embedded within our social, cultural and emotional connections: a change to our eating can bring so much more. Taking Scalloway as a precedent, a new approach to food production is envisaged, using spatial design as a tool to challenge, inspire and shift patterns in our daily lives. It harnesses the technical capability of architecture, providing the physical infrastructure for a new system of production, yet combines this with the aesthetic qualities it imbues to inspire, attract and reinforce the positivity of new possibilities. Finally, it breaks down barriers and thresholds to provide spatial connections, bringing together producer and consumer and creating habitats not only for humans but for all species to thrive. Understanding the process of change as a series of provocations, reminders and inspirations, cultural (ex)change invites the visitor on a journey. A series of moments mark the gradual transition from the comfort and familiarity of the land, to the sublime, unknown of the sea; defamiliarising, reorienting, sharing and expanding. Food production anchors habitat and livelihoods for other species in a mutually beneficial, productive relationship, bringing together human and non-human needs in places of co-existence. Consumption is reunited with production to create a place of experiential education, of discovery and exploration. A place that reconsiders, how we live and who we live alongside, bringing awareness and responsibility back into the public realm, back to the scale of the individual.","commodification; species; intersection; empowerment","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","",""

(mentor); Vijver, MG (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution); Universiteit Leiden (degree granting institution)","2019","Copper-based fungicides (CuFs) are used in vineyards and fruit-farms as a preventive form of pathogen control. These have a fungicidal impact against mildew infections (Plasmopara viticola) and other fungi that attack grapevines causing poor plant development, fruit rot, and ultimately, poor wine production. If applied annually in large quantities, copper pollutes both the vineyard soil and the surrounding freshwaters. This research combines a copper soil transport model within vineyard systems, a downy mildew germination model, and a copper dosage model with the ultimate aim of diminishing copper usage to concentrations as low as reasonably achievable while determining its environmental fate. The copper soil transport model is based on a solid-solution partitioning model, water balance model, and biotic ligand model. The downy mildew model is built according to a mechanistic model which separates the morphological development of mildew into discrete variables. The copper dosage model is built by combining a grapevine development model, a spray efficiency model, and a deposition efficiency model. Running the simulation from 2009 to 2018 for a vineyard in the Bordeaux Graves region, the model predicts that copper usage could have been reduced to 4.7 kgCu*ha-1 annually by only applying during mildew infection events and accounting for leaf area dependent spray deposition rates. Improving spray efficiency by 10% could further reduce copper demand to 3.9 kgCu*ha-1, below the new European limit of 4 kgCu*ha-1. Soil pH and organic matter adjustments most affected copper speciation, controlling biological uptake rates, soil matrix storage, and leaching rates; while varying the clay content did not present significant impacts.","copper; emission; modeling; mildew; application efficiency; systems approach; soil transport","en","master thesis","","","","","","Master of Science in Industrial Ecology at TU Delft and Leiden University Completed at Leiden University in accordance with Climate KIC Mobility requirements","","2020-09-01","","","","Industrial Ecology","",""

(mentor); Gradmann, Sofie (mentor); Brönner, Marco (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","Northern Norway has an extensive geological variation compared to other parts of Norway. It is home to major ore deposits containing base and precious metals. It is located within Fennoscandia, which has been identified as a significant metal-producing region in Europe. Recently, Northern Norway has extensively been surveyed using several geophysical techniques, which led to coverage improvement of basic geological information relevant to the assessment of its mineral potential.<br/>The study area, in the vicinity of Karasjok, is located on the Karasjok Greenstone Belt and comprises mainly Palaeoproterozoic rocks. This terrane is located on the same Palaeoproterozoic greenstone terrane of northern Finland, in which the detected gold deposits showed, with a few exceptions, similar characteristics to gold occurrences in Palaeoproterozoic greenstone belts in other parts of the world. Also, economic mineral deposits, e.g. Ni-Cu-PGE-Au mineralization, are largely restricted to events that occurred during the Palaeoproterozoic era. However, the study area for this study still remains largely under-explored and previous research and field work of the Karasjok Greenstone Belt have proven unsuccessful to locate significant mineral deposits. This area contains very few outcrops and traditional methods to map such areas are challenging.<br/>A large number of different geophysical data sets exist for Norway. While individual data sets cannot provide direct information about the lithology of the mapped area, a combination of multiple data sets makes it possible to delineate and interpret characteristic regions of potentially similar lithology. This is of particular interest where the geological map may be unreliable or that geological mapping itself is difficult, for example, due to difficult accessibility or large vegetation coverage.<br/>In this study, three fuzzy clustering algorithms, i.e. the fuzzy c-means algorithm, the Gustafson-Kessel algorithm, and the possibilistic fuzzy c-means algorithm, have been applied to compile pseudo-lithology maps and to characterize zones of mineralization by integrating recently acquired high-resolution airborne geophysical data sets of Karasjok. These algorithms have been applied for the integration of long-wavelength data sets, i.e. gravity and magnetic data reflecting deep geological features, the integration of short-wavelength data sets, i.e. gravity and magnetic data reflecting shallow geological features, and the integration of three near-surface data sets, i.e. the two short-wavelength data sets and a potassium data set. Analyzing the interrelationship of the data sets and pre-processing the data sets, have shown to be necessary steps in order to determine what kind of geological differentiation of the study area will be obtained when applying the clustering algorithms.<br/>The application of the fuzzy clustering algorithms for the compilation of pseudo-lithology maps have shown promising results. While the long-wavelength data sets indicated different, likely deeper, geological features than has been mapped on the current bedrock map and did not show similar structures on a lo- cal scale, the clustering with short-wavelength data sets indicated similarities on a local scale. Adding the potassium data set as a third dimension, results in patterns that clearly reflect the presence of the Archaean tonalities gneisses and granites of the Jergul Gneiss Complex within the study area. This showed how the use of clustering with three data sets can obtain a larger geological differentiation of the study area. It is concluded that the local structures have a more detailed composition than currently mapped.<br/>The application of clustering algorithms for the identification of zones of mineralization for this study has proven to be a powerful tool as it allows for the extraction of clusters of interests. One can simply use the clusters of interest to outline the areas of interest. In this case, the focus was to find areas that contain possible Ni-Cu-PGE mineralization, which are commonly reflected by high Bouguer and high magnetic anomalies. During this study, the clustering algorithm not only identified zones that were mentioned by previous re- search to contain possible mineralization, but also three additional zones that have not been explored or identified before.","Clustering; Geophysics; pseudo-lithology; mineralization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

The aim of the current investigation is to gain insights into the characteristic damage pattern and mechanisms that take place during CPV pressurization by analyzing the acoustic emissions and comparing the results to analytical and numerical solutions. Hence, a predefined number of vessels is manufactured and hydraulically pressurized in a specially designed test chamber up to burst. An array of 120 sound pressure sensors installed within the test chamber is responsible for recording the occurring acoustic events. By using a delay-and-sum beamforming algorithm, the events are localized. Their position and corresponding pressure level are analyzed and compared to analytical solutions calculated using classical lamination theory and 3D elasticity theory. Furthermore, a comparison to a finite element analysis is established. Therefore, insights are given into the application and correlation of these calculations to the experiments. Finally, the solutions are validated through damage observations using microsections and computer tomography. The findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the occurring damage mechanisms, the accuracy of the experimental method used and the damage progression due to different loading conditions of the CPVs under investigation.","Interfiber Fracture; Composite Pressure Vessel; Acoustic Emission","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-07-08","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

To this end we introduce a multiple time scale expansion. This provides a mathematically sound argument for treating the fast ebb-flood cycle and the slow spring-neap variations as independent time scales. With this expansion, semi-analytical approximations of the water motion and suspended sediment concentrations can be found as functions of the spring-neap time scale. The advantage of this is that the transport of sediment is then investigated in a tidally-averaged sense using analytically obtained temporal dependencies and model simulations based on the conditions in 2005 of the Ems-Dollard estuary. We found that sediment import is strongly enhanced during spring tide and that a combination of vanishing import processes and sediment export due to river discharge resulted in a net export of sediment during neap tide. Furthermore the spring-neap varying deposition of fine sediment in a bottom pool on the river bed is investigated. We found that the time needed for the system to adjust to new equilibrium conditions can not be neglected within a spring-neap cycle as temporal lag effects are clearly visible in the dynamic behaviour of the bottom pool and suspended sediment concentrations. These temporal lag effects are sensitive to the choice of the parameter governing erosion. Assuming different values of the erosion parameter we have shown that the long-term characteristics of the bottom pool are sensitive to these temporal lag effects. Choosing a low value of the erosion parameter results in the presence of a bottom pool throughout the spring-neap cycle. With a high value of the erosion no bottom pool is formed at any time in the spring-neap cycle.","Estuaries; Sediment transport; Idealized modelling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics | Computational Science and Engineering","",""

The primary energy usage has risen with approximately 49% and the CO2 emissions with 43% during only the last two decades. The building sector in the Netherlands contributes for approximately 36% to this energy consumption and office buildings are one of the larger consumers (Rijksdienst voor Ondernemend Nederland, 2018). Even<br/>though sustainability measures have been established, a contradicting trend occurs where building envelopes become more transparent and lightweight. This results in a lack of thermal mass and so increases the sensitivity to external influences. Solar shading applications are often applied to control the influences of the sun. This research project explores how the implementation of phase<br/>change materials (PCM’s) could reduce this sensitivity. PCM’s present a suitable replacement for thermal mass, since PCM’s are known for their high storage densities in small volumes. How the combination of solar shading and PCM will affect the energy consumption of an office, is researched through its influence on the thermal and visual comfort of occupants. If both comforts are improved and stabilized by this application, less energy is needed to maintain this comfortable environment. This is defined in the main research question: “What is the most optimal PCM solar shading system which contributes to a stabilized indoor climate and a reduction of energy consumption in an office setting for both winter- and summertime in the Netherlands?”. <br/>The key element within this question is the PCM solar shading system which exists out of two aspects; the PCM and the solar shading system. Both aspects include different parameters which determine whether a certain typology is suitable for this particular combination within an office setting. The influence of a sun shading system on the indoor climate is mainly determine by its thermal and visual performance. Whereas the thermal performance is determined by the<br/>difference between external and internal applications, the visual performance depends on the flexibility of the system. In general, an external blind system would achieve the highest performance on both levels. However, if a PCM is combined with a shading system, an internal application would be more beneficial (Fiorito, 2012). Which PCM is most suitable has been established based on safety factors and appurtenant performances. A salt-hydrate is selected in this case, based on its nonflammable and non-toxic character, high latent heat storage and high thermal conductivity. The first two characteristics ensure a safe application and the latter two increase both the storage density<br/>and heat transfer, and thus the performance.<br/>Both PCM and shading related parameters are simulated to establish their individual and combined impact on the thermal and visual environment. The PCM related parameters concern the melting temperature and the layer thickness. These parameters are only simulated based on their thermal influence in Comsol Mutliphysics. Comsol is a simulation platform which is used to optimize physic-based designs through numerical simulations. The melting temperature showed to have one of the most influential effects. Since a too low temperature causes for overheating of the material and a too high temperature for a lack of activation, a specific value is required to provide any (positive) effect on the indoor environment. The tightly integrated relation to the surrounding conditions results in two different temperatures for summer and winter with 27 and 23 oC, respectively. The layer thickness on the other hand mainly influences the heat transfer. A thickness of 2 cm resulted in a relatively stable temperature flow throughout multiple days, whilst still being able to release heat in<br/>both summer and winter conditions. <br/>Shading related parameters are the position, depth, shape and encapsulation material of the blind. These parameters represent various aspects of a common blind system which can be altered to increase mainly the visual performance. However, these parameters might influence the amount, distribution and heat transfer of the PCM, which leads to a different thermal performance as well.<br/>Visual performance related simulations are executed in Grasshopper, a graphical algorithm editor which uses plug-ins to apply performance simulations. The first parameter which is simulated in Grasshopper determines the influence of horizontally and vertically positioned blinds on the visual comfort. These simulations showed that vertical blinds perform well with low angled sun (winter<br/>conditions) and horizontal blinds with high angled sun (summer conditions). However, horizontal blinds present the highest overall performance when different angles of the blinds towards the sun are considered. The visual results are used as a guideline due to limitations in the thermal models and assumed small influences. <br/>The blind depth has a significant impact on the thermal performance. An increase in depth namely results in an increased PCM volume, unless the thickness is adjusted to maintain a constant volume. Additionally, it should be considered that an increased depth is linear proportional to an increased opening between the blinds. When these considerations are taken into account, a blind of 7x2 cm performs best. The thermal effects of different blind shapes, have a less <br/> significant impact. A rule of thumb describes that smooth surfaces increase heat transfer and rough surfaces create obstructing air pockets. Visual simulations support the preference for smooth surfaces as a crescent shaped blind allows for the highest amount of comfortable daylight. All visual results are based on<br/>a transparent encapsulation material to visually show the PCM. Polycarbonate has been selected in this case based on its transparent, tough and non-flammable character. <br/>All parameter results are suitable for both winter and summer conditions, except for the melting temperature. When separate melting temperatures are applied, both thermal and visual enhancements can be achieved under different conditions. During summer an average temperature reduction of 1,5 oC, stabilized temperature fluctuations and 10% increase on visual comfort are<br/>achieved. Smaller improvements are achieved during winter with a 1 oC increase and 5% visual comfort enhancement. Ultimately, when these influences are <br/> converted, the general energy consumption of an office can be reduced by approximately 6,9%.<br/>The results regarding the energy reduction are only achieved when the PCM is able to completely regenerate during the night. Hence, the effect of positioning, rotation and additional ventilation are studied to estimate how it could stimulate the regeneration process. In general, a horizontally positioned PCM blind will experience difficulties to initiate the solidification process compared to a vertical positioned element. However, once the blind is rotated, the horizontal blind will<br/>provide an evenly distributed solid PCM layer. Rotation cause for the solidified particles to find more points of attachment, and thus the possibility to advance over the entire surface area. Additional ventilation will contribute during the initial phases, since it accelerates the solidification. To what extend these actions are necessary strongly depends on the surrounding conditions.<br/>Both the evaluated parameters and regeneration process come together into one concept proposal with an appurtenant behavioural strategy. To determine how one system could function for both summer and winter conditions, three different system set-ups have been analyzed. Conclusively, a compromise regarding the melting temperature was required in order to obtain a practical application. Since an opportune melting temperature is a key component of the PCM blind system, a thermochromic layer is added to the blind surface. Similar to the PCM, the thermochromic layer will change its properties around a specific temperature. The material will change in tint and gain the ability to block solar radiation. Hence, excessive radiation is prevented from affecting the PCM. Through this combination one system would be able to contribute to a stabilized indoor climate whilst reducing the energy consumption.","Phase change materials; Solar shading; Thermal comfort; Visual comfort; Energy reduction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","",""

On each subsystem, a separate thesis was written and this paper serves as a general yet complete overview of the design process, simulations and test results of a fully functioning solar drone with the theses attached as appendices for reference. The original (optimistic) aim of an extension of at least 25% of the battery lifetime was set by our supervisors. For the PV part SunPower C60 IBC cells were used (no specific selection was done) together with a (borrowed) custom-built drone (not built by this team, it was borrowed from another research group) as a starting point. After analysing the limitations of the drone and the cells, multiple configurations were designed and a mathematical model that determines power usage, energy costs per solar cell and the optimum amount of cells was developed. %The optimum amount of cells for this specific drone was found to be a total of 28 cells. A SEPIC converter will extract solar energy from a PV-module in order to charge the battery of the drone. The converter will be controlled by the micro-controller subgroup using MPPT (Maximum Power Point Tracker) algorithm and this will be done by supplying a PWM signal to the converter. Since the drone was not specifically designed for the project (thus not optimised when it comes to lift capacity and room for cell placement), the efficiency of the solar cells was not sufficient to extend the fight time by 25% (15.1% in summer, 5.6 in winter). Since these bottlenecks can easily be eliminated by replacing the drone and the cells, these results serve as a proof of concept and are an excellent starting point for future research.","Drone; Solar Drone; Solar Cells; SEPIC; Microcontroller","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering","BAP",""

This is done in a table with columns for inputs and outputs and rows for a combination of inputs together with its corresponding output. A row is also called a rule. A simple program to decide such a decision table can easily be made, like Camunda. However, when the output of one table is also the input of another table and so on and the amount of rules get enormously big, the problem gets more complicated and Camunda takes a very long time to solve such structures.<br/>We created a decision engine in Scala that can decide the output when there are thousands of tables linked together in less than a minute with the help of Akka. Akka is an actor model, which means that it can create multiple actors, which each can perform a certain task. Actors can run in parallel, which speeds up the decision engine. Actors send messages to each other and an actor will only start working when they receive a message. The decision engine reads DMN files and parses it to tables. For better performance the decision tables get parsed into a tree structure with for every table the input tables are its children. In this way the decision engine is very quick in solving tables, however the parsing into trees still takes some time. This is not a big problem, since the parsing is only done once and the tree can be saved and the solving can be done very often. Also the deciding of a single table is improved, because we created our own FEEL-expressions that can decide the rules very fast. The result is that after a very large table with 50,000 rules is parsed, the solving that took Camunda 400 milliseconds only takes 9 milliseconds for the new decision engine and when the parsing is left out, the new engine is faster in computing 500,000 rules than Camunda with 1 rule. Also when the parsing is included in the time, the difference gets only bigger. For 50,000 rules, Camunda takes 20 seconds to parse the file and solve the table, while the new decision engine takes only a little more than 1 second to do this all. When the files get larger, so does the difference.","Decision Engine; Akka; Camunda","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The design proposal involves 3 levels of intervention : <br/>- the urban/ecological scale for the re-naturalisation of the currently polluted river Arzobispo; <br/>- landscape design for the articulation of the river bed and the zoning of the garden; <br/>- architectural design for the creation of the pavilions and the infrastructure which allow the interaction with the re-naturalised landscape. <br/>The architecture of the river garden allows to reconstruct, along with the physical archaeology of the place, through the exposure of raw and unapparent elements, also a human archaeology in the enclosed gardens of people's memory. The notion of ""Sólido.Líquido.Lítico"" derives exactly from the temporal dimension through which solid and liquid elements come into contact. The extended stratification of solid ground and the repeated shaping action of water produce the physical state of 'lithos', stone. Metaphorically, the lithic state can be considered as one of the physical states of this architecture, where the mass of the built encounters the ephemerality of time and use, giving birth to a state of reduction to its elemental state, a dissolvement to the essence and a permanence in the memory of the people who lived within it. Connection and memory triggers an effect of belonging. Through belonging, individual care enters into action and stimulates a collective behaviour of responsibility, which is likely to produce a change of attitude towards taking care of the river.<br/>This process of addressing at once the natural environment as well as the human environment can produce durable positive effects. First, the re-naturalisation of the river Arzobispo can be a model to be applied to many other watercourses in the wider area of Bogotá. Secondly, it allows to envision a public space which resonates with the history and culture of the Bogotan society and that is likely to be embraced as a positive platform for public life, outside of the dynamics of power, fear and violence.","Bathing; Garden; Unearthing; Re-naturalisation; Bogotá; Colombia; River; community; methods and analysis; raw architecture; rammed earth; landscape; Urbanism; architecture of water; Design for connectedness; performativity; origin; rituals; mysticism","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","","4.71100, -74.07210"

SAG is known to have many benefits, such as mitigating corrosion effects and increasing gas injectivity. Despite this, liquid injectivity is typically very poor during the SAG process. Currently, there is not a consistent model for liquid injectivity during SAG. However, Gong et al. recently conducted core-flood experiments to gain clarity on how gas and liquid injectivity are affected during SAG in near-wellbore conditions. Gong et al. determined that gas and liquid injectivity are represented by the propagation of multiple banks. For gas injectivity, there are two banks: the collapsed-foam bank and the foam bank. For liquid injectivity, there are three banks: the collapsed-foam bank, the gas dissolution bank and the liquid-fingering bank.<br/>Conventional foam simulators, such as CMG’s STARS, use the Peaceman equation to obtain an estimate for well pressure as well as liquid and gas injectivity. Gong et al. came to the conclusion that conventional foam simulators do not take the propagation of the collapsed-foam bank into account. Thus, Gong et al.’s results indicate that the Peaceman equation greatly underestimates gas and liquid injectivity during SAG in a 100 by 100 meter grid block. Subsequently, this paper aims to determine how refining the 100 by 100 meter grid block will alter well pressure and liquid and gas injectivity, especially in the near-wellbore region.<br/>We used CMG’s STARS, a conventional foam simulator, to test the impact of grid refinement on injectivity and well block pressure. Our grid set-ups include a base grid of 5x5 equal blocks and two refined grid cases, in which the center grid blocks are partitioned into 9 and 25 equal block pieces. Our results indicate that as we refine the grid, the dimensionless pressure drops occur quicker and the magnitude of pressure decreases. When compared to the base grid, the pressure drops of the refined grids were discovered to be approximately 9 and 25 times faster for the 3x3 center grid case and the 5x5 center grid case respectively. Additionally, we observed additional dimensionless pressure peaks in the refined cases, which can be explained by a drop in relative mobility when the foam reaches a new grid block.<br/>Although our foam parameters were based on Gong et al.’s foam scan, our foam parameters are not exactly the same as the parameters listed in Gong et al.’s paper because we did not include foam shear-thinning properties. In order to build on this paper’s research, future research should look into comparing our STAR’s results to the fractional-flow theory. Additionally, future models and research should look into reducing the simulation’s time step in order to increase the number of iterations calculated by the simulator, especially around the region in which the pressure drop occurs. Lastly, it would also be important to look into finding the best method to represent the well block pressure for a refined grid case.","","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This dichotomy causes several groups of people in our society to move out of the cities. One of these migrating groups are families. Recent research has shown that many young families in Amsterdam are dissatisfied with their homes and with their living environment and as a result many of them move away from the city. As a consequence, the diversity within cities decreases, resulting in the segregation of the population. However, families have a preference towards living in the city, but the problem is that the housing supply is not sufficiently tuned to their needs. In other words, the right houses are missing. Families with a modest income are usually dependent on the outdated housing stock. As a result, they either stay dissatisfied in their current dwelling or move outside the city. A straightforward solution is building enough suitable dwellings for families. However, building dwellings with gardens for everyone is not feasible because of the lack of space and the high prices of the land. These issues that cities are facing, have brought me to my graduation topic. I have researched how we can design affordable and good quality family apartments in dense areas such as in a city.

Since 2000, the arable land per farmer increased with 66%. To help farmers managing their increasing amount of arable land, it is important to develop new techniques in example based on remote sensing data. One of the key parameters for agricultural management is the water availability in the area. The water availability can be clarified with help of two different soil water properties, soil water holding capacity and soil moisture content. The aim of this study is to estimate soil water properties at a scale of 30 meters based on bare soil surface reflectance and thermal infrared image analysis. In this study, two newly developed models are proposed to determine the spatial patterns of soil wetness. The first model is based on bare soil surface reflectance, named as SoilGrids30m, a spatial estimation model for clay content and organic matter content in the study area. These estimates are then used as input of pedotransfer functions to obtain spatial estimates of soil water holding capacity in the study area. The second model is based on the relation between the normalized difference vegetation index and the crop temperature, named as the soil wetness indicator. The soil wetness indicator is a representative of soil moisture content in the root zone of crops. Both models are evaluated against the soil moisture content estimates obtained from SEBAL. Soil water holding capacity is not directly related to soil moisture content. The hypothesis is therefore, soils with a high soil water holding capacity will tend to have higher soil moisture content estimates and vice versa during a long period of drought. The year 2018 has been used as reference year because of the extreme drought conditions in the months May until July.<br/><br/>Conclusions <br/>The SoilGrids30m model improved the estimation of clay content and organic matter content in the study area compared to the existing coarser SoilGrids250m and SoilGrids1000m models. Especially, the organic matter content estimates significantly improves with help of the SoilGrids30m model. However, the influence of adding bare soil surface reflectance to the model was relatively low for both clay content (37%) and organic matter content (13%). The influence of bare soil surface reflectance only improved the clay content estimates compared to the SoilGrids1000m model. In all other cases, the target variable estimates did not improve by adding bare soil surface reflectance data. It can therefore be concluded that the improvement of the SoilGrids30m model is due to the use of a larger set of observation data from the study area and not because of the input of bare soil surface reflectance data.<br/>The obtained soil water holding capacity estimates with help of pedotransfer functions did not show reliable results compared to the soil moisture estimates of SEBAL. The highly empirical pedotransfer functions are the main cause of the unreliable results but also seepage and irrigation are important factors that could have played a role. In future work it would therefore be recommended to avoid using pedotransfer functions calibrated in other regions than the study area.<br/>The results of the soil wetness indicator showed a clear correlation with the soil moisture content estimates from SEBAL. The soil wetness indicator is therefore a simple and reliable tool to recognize spatial patterns of wetness. In example for precision agriculture, the soil wetness indicator could be used for irrigation management. The relative representation of the soil wetness indicator could determine the distribution of irrigation within a field.","Soil Moisture; Remote Sensing; Soil water holding capacity; Thermal infrared; Visible and near infrared","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","52.718659, 5.776130"

The tensor-train decomposition is chosen due to its computational advantages for systems with low tensor-train rank. Within this thesis two main limitations of the existing tensor Kalman filter are solved. First, a method is developed based on tensor-train rank truncation of the covariances to increase the computational speed for more general systems. Second, a MIMO tensor Kalman filter is developed for a specific class of systems. The power of the developed methods is shown on the example of adaptive optics which fits into the framework. A comparison with state-of-the-art large-scale estimation algorithms shows the computational advantage of the tensor Kalman filter at the cost of approximation errors.","Kalman Filter; tensors; Large Scale; tensor decomposition; curse of dimensionality; Adaptive Optics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-02-21","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

The polynya forms due to deep convection, which is caused by static instability of the water column. Observations and model studies show periodic heat accumulation in the subsurface layer prior to a polynya. This heat accumulation could be caused by internal ocean dynamics: the Southern Ocean Mode. Periodic subsurface heat and salt accumulation could be the major driver in causing periodic deep convection, which is in contrast with earlier studies. These studies focus on surface processes, and see the polynya as an irregular event. In this study a simple convective model is used to look into this contrast. Model simulations excluding and including periodic subsurface heat and salt fluxes have been performed. Multiple polynya events were only simulated in the model set up including subsurface fluxes. The dominant frequency for polynya events in these simulations equals the frequency of the subsurface heat and salt accumulation. This frequency is still visible in runs with white noise added to the freshwater flux, showing the importance and dominance of the subsurface forcing. In combination with earlier studies, this study suggests that periodic subsurface processes are most dominant and govern the initial formation and periodicity of the Weddell Polynya.","Weddell Polynya; Open-ocean convection; Southern Ocean; Southern Ocean Mode","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The combination of these factors is driving the development and implementation of an updated power system with integration of Renewable Energy Sources (RES). This calls for an update of the existing infrastructure, with an additional layer of advanced monitoring, control and Information and Communication Technology (ICT) that is presently only beginning to be applied. With this introduction of ICT into the power system, a Cyber-Physical Energy System (CPES) is formed, that is multi-domain in nature. It encompasses interactions between the power system, communication as well as control and supervisory applications. Thus, the CPES is greater in scale and complexity, in comparison to the traditional electrical power grid. As a result, the study and analysis of this complex and large scale CPES is not feasible in one dedicated facility/Research Infrastructure (RI). Therefore, remotely interconnecting Smart Grid laboratories unlocks the potential to test large scale scenarios through Joint Research Activity (JRA). By conducting joint experiments between different RIs within Europe, resource sharing can be achieved. This enables usage of and interaction between assets located in each RI in a coordinated way. Hence, the application of control algorithms running in one RI for the remote control of devices which are physically distributed in other facilities becomes possible. Thus, this thesis studies the implementation and application of geographically distributed laboratory interconnections for smart grid testing.","Smart grid; Co-simulation; Power System Modelling; distributed simulation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-01-14","","","","","ERIGrid",""

Two methods are studied while assuming that the tip-sample interaction is sparse, namely a model-based approach and a data-driven approach. Real-life experiments have shown that the model-based approach improves the image resolution with a factor of 7.5 to 0.555 nm compared to the conventional imaging method, according to a metric using Fourier Ring Correlation in which a reference image is unnecessary. The data-driven approach can be used in the model-based approach to further improve the resolution. In addition to improved resolutions, a Linear Time-Invariant model of the mechanically driven AFM-cantilever immersed in liquid – from piezo input to cantilever deflection – has been obtained through subspace identification with a Variance Accounted For of 79.2%. Recommendations for future research include applying the latter model in detecting the tip-sample interaction, improving the data-driven approach, reducing the computational effort of the model-based approach and implementing algorithms for detecting the tip-sample interaction online.","Atomic Force Microscopy; System Identification; LASSO; Fourier Ring Correlation; Difference of Convex Programming; Bilinear; State Estimation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

While consumers used to experience the products mainly in store, now they must base their purchases whatever they see on the screen. Thus, the visual product design directly influences the digital buyers in their product purchases, but how? The earlier studies show that a product’s appearance can have aesthetic and symbolic value for consumers, can communicate functional characteristics and give a quality impression (practical value), and can communicate the ease of use (ergonomic value) (Creusen &amp; Schoormans, 2005). Although these studies explore the role of product appearance or visual product design in consumer purchases, none of them particularly targets online purchases. This study aims to fill this knowledge gap in the literature through qualitative research. The qualitative research, conducted as a part of master graduation assignment (see Appendix A to read the whole assignment), explored whether the different roles of product appearance exist in consumers’ process of product evaluation in online environments and to what extent these roles influence the consumers. Also, product related or contextual factors which may potentially have an impact on consumer responses to the product form in the digital environment were researched in the scope of this project. The complete online shopping experience was designed for the participants, and they were asked to perform two simple tasks, purchasing a pair of headphones and a laptop stand through the test website. Later, they were interviewed on their choice reasons for the products. The interviews done with the participation of forty-three subjects was transcribed and coded first, then content analysis was done to learn the frequencies of each concept existing in online shopping practice. The research findings showed that different roles of product appearance exist in the consumer product evaluation process in digital environments, although the consumer responses to these roles vary for different product categories. For instance, in the experiment, some participants based their purchase on attention drawing value of the product form for a socially significant product category, headphones, whereas this value was not mentioned at all by any of the participants for the other category. Additionally, the influence of some contextual and product factors on the consumer responses to the product form was detected based on the research results. For example, an impact created by in-context images on consumer perception of symbolic value was noticed in the experiment. As a result, this study filled the knowledge gap in the topic “the role of product form in online purchase” as much as the study limitations allow.","product appearance; online shopping; Consumer behaviour","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

The Nurse Rostering Problem is the problem of finding an optimal assignment of nurses to shifts given some constraints. We extend the problem by considering that the nurses different sets of skills by which they can only perform certain tasks. We want the working hours of the nurses to be as close as possible to their contract hours, and moreover, we want the amount of work done on a specific task to be as close as possible to the demand for that task. It is important that the user of the model has control over the execution time. We model this problem with an Integer Linear Program (ILP). The data we use to test the model is provided by ORTEC. ORTEC provided a random data generator which generates data such as contract hours and demands for certain skills, for a fictional company. The number of employees, skills and weeks can be determined by the user. We use small, medium and large data sets where large data sets consist of 100 employees, 52 weeks and 5 different skills. Our model is a linear approximation of a quadratic problem. It is based on minimizing the largest deviation in contract hours and demand. To get control over the computation time of the model, a timer is implemented. The desired maximum computation time can be set by the user and the model provides the best solution found within that time boundary. The initial model is tested with three different solvers: COIN-OR, CPLEX and Gurobi. The computation times and consistency of the solvers are compared. We found that CPLEX was in our case the best solver with an average computation time of 7.2 seconds for data sets of 100 employees, 5 skills, and 52 weeks. Next, we use an iterative procedure, which runs the model several times in order to obtain a more accurate solution. In this procedure, certain deviations, and their contributing variables, are fixed in every iteration while the model runs on the remaining non-fixed variables. An extension to this iterative procedure is also presented. In this extension, multiple deviations are fixed in every iteration to decrease the execution time. The fixed percentage of maximum deviations per iteration is tested on accuracy and computation time. We found that for small data sets it is best to use 1%, which results in one fixed deviation per iteration. For medium data sets, the best range is from 1% to 10%. Lastly for large data sets we recommend to use a range of 10% to 20%.","","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics","",""

This development has led to a transition in the current national spatial planning system by means of the new Environment and Planning Act, which aims to work in a multi-level governance manner. One of the law’s instruments is the National Strategy on Spatial Planning and the Environment (NOVI), which identifies frameworks for a national spatial long-term vision. Design research is suitable for addressing these wicked integral challenges, and has two types; the inspiring design-type and the clarifying research-type. Both have distinct design processes, outcomes and contributions to policy. The first type, the design-type, is characterized by an incremental, experimental, solution-oriented and multidisciplinary process that focuses on reducing complexity. This form delivers a detailed master plan in order to inspire and give high abstract issues an realistic and tangible content. The second type, the research-type, is characterized by an iterative, problem-oriented, and interdisciplinary design process, which delivers an adaptive framework for decision-making processes by clarifying the issues and challenges.

The research-type contributes to achieving a higher degree of integrality, assessed on the topics of function, time, scale, and interest integration. The research-type is also effective when applied within an abstract question within spatial planning to clarify challenges, such as within the NOVI. The design-type, on the other hand, can be effective within context-specific questions, such as within Regional Agendas, for providing an inspiring and innovative image using multiple directional solutions. Nonetheless, design research is most effective when both types are used, with the focus on one or the other.","Design research; design-type; research-type; national strategy on spatial planning and the environment; NOVI; Interdisciplinarity; Interdisciplinary; Multidisciplinary; interdisciplinary approach; Design process; integral design; integrated design; integral challenge","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

Theories like RDD take a systematic approach towards bringing sustainable and adaptable solutions to the built environment. Theories like this are highly relevant because they embrace cities as the complex systems that they are. The thesis used the case study of the Metropolitan Area to answer to the question of how to integrate then, RD, and planning practices. It used the working hypothesis that by integrating the geodesign framework as a methodological basis and the Social-Ecological Systems Framework (SESF) as a theoretical/analytical basis, the previous could be achieved. The SESF was used to address the use of social-ecological systems, governance, and multiscalarity, while the geodesign framework was mostly used to achieve transdisciplinarity. The report then presents the methodology that was used to explore such issue. As the hypothesis indicated, the research integrated the SESF as a structured language into the geodesign framework. The SESF language helped to answer the questions that the original geodesign model asked. Throughout the process of developing the methodology, the geodesign framework was adapted to enhance its use of multiscalarity, which it actually did not possess, and its use of transdisciplinarity. <br/>The first modification improved the use of multiscalarity in the adapted framework by dividing the Resource System in two different types of scales: into system and subsystems, and into an assessment and designing area.

To ensure a safe and reliable infrastructure, preventive maintenance is of utmost importance. ProRail, the sole maintainer of the railway infrastructure in the Netherlands, spends hundreds of millions of dollars on maintenance each year. Due to the complexity and busyness of the network, maintenance can cause major disruptions leading to longer travel times. Despite these factors, maintenance is currently scheduled mostly manually, leading to suboptimal schedules being created. A pilot study by Macomi, the company which enabled this study through an internship, showed great potential for improvement in scheduling this maintenance. In this thesis, the aim is to further improve the maintenance schedule of ProRail, as well as to find out what kind of solution method is most suitable to improve that schedule. To achieve this goal, various types of algorithms have been implemented and tested on the problem. An evolution strategy algorithm developed by Macomi was successfully improved. Through the use of multi-objective algorithms, the trade-off between maintenance costs and availability of the infrastructure was analyzed. These multi-objective algorithms were found to provide unsatisfactory solutions. Greedy algorithms were also developed to provide a quicker solution method, and the resulting solutions were of surprisingly high quality. Finally, a hybrid algorithm using the evolution strategy and a greedy algorithm was created. It was shown that this hybrid algorithm outperforms all other algorithms, and provides solutions that are better in terms of costs and constraints compared to the manual schedule of ProRail, and the baseline established by the pilot study of Macomi.","Scheduling; Railway Maintenance; Evolutionary Algorithms","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science | Data Science and Technology","",""

Within this framework architecture is no more concerned with the building as a final product but with the social and collective processes that the production of space is based upon. Following the principles of participatory architecture, the project proposes an alternative model of architecture in which levels of participation vary; a model which is referred as ‘compromised participation’.

Within this process people would be able to shape the environments they want to live in resulting the possibility for an architectural creation with the capacity to regenerate social relationships within a contemporary urban environment. Participatory architecture introduces the possibilities of new ways of working and behaving within the built environment and enables us to move away from the limits of the term architecture, ‘with its implications that is the sole domain of the architect, and to move to the wider possibilities of space.","participation; Live-work design; Social design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","",""

Decarbonization of the end-use sectors and the integration of the variable renewable energy (VRE) sources are the main challenges of the transition. In the Netherlands, the heat sector depends on natural gas and much more effort is needed for reducing CO2 emissions. This research proposal presents ""sector coupling"" of power and heat markets in the Netherlands as a promising solution to the above-mentioned challenges. The addressed research question is: “What are the flexibility implications of the increasing sector coupling between heat and power?”. A flexible heat demand and hybrid technologies for heating will have a significant grid and market implications. In addition, to unlock this potential, incentives and amendments on regulations are necessary. A model-based study by using the power systems model COMPETES reveals the flexibility potential, power sector implications and the effects on end-users: households and industry. Effects of natural gas and electricity price structures are also investigated as one of the important barriers against power-to-heat technologies. Results reveal that flexibility of the heat demand provides a more cost-efficient coupling. The policy instruments such as a tax shift from electricity to natural gas have the potential to make power-to-heat technologies more attractive.","Sector coupling; flexibility; power sector; heat sector; electrification; renewable integration; policy analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Nowadays, double-glazing is a common product for moderate maritime climate. In the Netherlands two permit requirements are calculations regarding nearly zero energy and environmental performance of a building. In order to reach nearly zero energy buildings, triple glazing and even quadruple glazing is considered as possibility. This has negative affects on the environmental performance of a building, because glass does need a lot of resources for production. A solution to that challenge could be the application of thin glass sandwiches, a structural sandwich with two ultra-thin faces (0.5mm) of glass. The structural sandwich is common in the aviation industry to stiffen and strengthen an element without adding significant weight. Downside is the increased conduction through the core material. Question is: to what extent can a thin glass sandwich panel, compared to regular insulated glass units, counterbalance its decreased thermal performance by reducing embodied energy during production? This research focusses on the material choice, quantity and distribution in the core of a sandwich panel in order to maximize thermal performance for a moderate maritime climate. In order to do so, materials from the CES library are evaluated. Detailed analytical calculations are used to determine the thermal performance regarding different patterns. FEA simulation software is used to determine the thermal performance regarding the cross-section of the actual thermal bridge between the two faces. From this research, the best solution is picked and evaluated on energy consumption, order to identify the effects on a building scale. General trends are identified and transformed into a design for a thin glass sandwich. Next to that, design guidelines are extracted for designers in order to design a thin glass sandwich without the need of calculating.","Thin Glass; Structural Sandwich; Thermal Performance","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","",""

Relevant knowledge from academic and industry was learned, together with the technology learning on 3D virtual fitting.The research findings revealed several problems on customers’ side: the lack of sensory inputs (visual and tactile) for evaluating apparel fit in online environment; the perceived complexity and uncertainty of making choices on personalized garments; the gap between one's fit requirements (depending on body sizes and personal fit preference) and actual garment sizes. The research findings also confirmed the perceived usefulness of 3D virtual fitting as a promising solution for online shopping. By using the software CLO3D, the visualization of knitwear is achievable, as well as the simulation of how the knitwear fits to different human body models. After the analysis stage, the focus of the project was transferred to how to connect the research findings to the design. An explicit and specific design statement was established, “To design a website that enables customers to customize and order knitwear made to their measurements, in all possible looks, sizes and fits. Include the use of 3D virtual fitting in the website to boost customer confidence in evaluating clothing fit online and shopping enjoyment. In the end deliver the real garment that achieves customer satisfaction”. The design goal, along with a website framework and a list of design requirements, gave a clear guide where the design should go. During the design stage, several iteration cycles were conducted to evaluate the design effectiveness of each part of the website, so as to quickly make design decisions and refine the concept in an early design phase. The final concept was built based on both the design requirements and new inputs from design process. In the last stage an evaluation study was carried out. A user test was done with thirteen participants using the website prototype to finish an order, and a comparison between physical try-on and virtual fitting was done with two of them. From the study results it could be evidenced that the website is able to support people to finish the online process of customizing made-to-measure knitwear, and for the majority the function of virtual fitting achieves its intended effects of enhancing customer confidence and shopping enjoyment. In the end, a review of the concept showed the validity and limitations of this project, some recommendations were discussed as well.","virtual fitting; fashion industry; interaction design; personalization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

The lack of technological research using this material in its natural state has caused a drawback in its usage. Also, the dependence on engineered wood for modern construction has only increased the transportation of such materials from the developed regions or ‘technologically advanced’ regions of the world to the developing areas, increasing the carbon footprint. <br/>The grassroot idea of this research was to develop a construction technology for a multi-storey building using the locally available natural timber that satisfies the contemporary needs of the housing shortage in the urban context and encode the design logic of this research in a digital tool for ease of use by the local designers. The urban city of Shillong, located in the north-east state of Meghalaya in India, was selected as the context for this research. The region has a history of construction with natural timber, however in contemporary scenario the construction is common with concrete and steel, which poses a question on sustainability. The region also provides a challenge with respect to the seismic hazard as it is located in the Himalayan seismic belt. Given these constraints, along with the availability of local resources like– money, labor, space and technical data, the boundary conditions for this research were formulated. Inferences were drawn from the literature research for understanding timber as a building material, architectural principles of seismic design and case studies of Traditional Japanese timber construction and contemporary innovations in tall timber structures which played a vital role in development of the design. <br/>This research focuses on the structural possibilities of constructing a six-storey building using naturally available timber. Given the academic time-frame, the column-primary beam joinery was developed, while others were conceptualized based on the inferences drawn from its design process. The global structural system was validated using the finite element analysis under the provisions of the National Building Codes of India. Being first of its kind in the context, this research successfully proves the structural possibilities of the proposed multi-storey natural timber structure. Also, a digital tool was created, which encodes the logic of the whole design process, which could be used by the local designers of the region to visualize the structural system at an early design phase. This would ease the usage of this technology in the region. <br/>This research transcends beyond the current innovations in the field of timber construction. On using natural timber for construction, a complete manufacturing line of the engineered wood is eliminated, thus, reducing the environmental impact. It should be mentioned that the structural strengths of the natural timber cannot be matched to that of engineered timber or steel. However, the global concerns of environmental impact have forced us to rethink the way we are building today; ideate and share innovation in order to take a step forward to a sustainable future.<br","natural timber; timber building; Timber; seismic arhitecture design; seismic building structural type; compression test; Digital Architecture; digital tool; design logic; Shillong; Meghalaya; India; Tall timber; Sustainable Design; Sustainabilty; Finite Element Analysis; ANSYS; Grasshopper; design informatics; Structural Design; sustainable architecture","en","master thesis","","","","","","Certain internal data sourced from the Government of Meghalaya has been provided with permission in this report only for academic purpose, permission for further sourcing of this data can only be granted by the Governing authorities.","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","","25.57880, 91.89330"

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","New York is currently going through a construction boom as developers try to take advantage of rising land values and rents caused by economic growth, resulting in a lack of affordable housing available to middle-income families. The current Mayor of New York, Bill de Blasio, has made it a priority to meet the demands and challenges of the housing crisis by incentivizing private development through various methods, such as changing zoning laws and cutting red tape for access to abandoned lands, as a way to inject steroids into the housing market (Kaysen, 2018). This has unfortunately caused issues such as gentrification and speculative development, which has led to the disenfranchisement of low-income inhabitants in the city (Kaysen, 2018). These policies have marginalized people by either forcing the poor to either live in the periphery of the city, or be crammed into social housing projects that were built more than half a century ago. This is worrisome due to the fact that these aged dwellings display a variety of health and safety issues that the New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA) is having a hard time managing. The low-income families which rely on these projects have a hard time paying the minimum rent to begin with, and when you couple this with unacceptable living conditions, you end up with the spatial manifestation of an increasing divide between the rich and poor which now defines New York City. What is more shocking is that when you look back in history, the social housing projects were originally seen as a solution to poverty and slumification, but they ended up just being vertical versions of the slums which they took place of (Ferré-Sadurní, 2018). In order to help these disenfranchised people living in the projects, there must be an effort in place to help increase their quality of life. In order to achieve this, the monofunctionality of their public space needs to be made more functionally diverse. This is because the lack of diversity in both social and programmatic elements results in low public activity, which in turn leads to crime and vandalism due to a lack of self-awareness which tends to not exist in places of high public activity (Jacobs, 1961). In addition to this, the problem of public space is exasperated by the design philosophy that was used to create the projects. Planners used the International Style, which was a popular urbanist theory during the time that the dwellings were created. By clearing the tenement slums that were defined by a spatial hierarchy created by the street grid of New York City, he accused the planners of intentionally destroying the rich hierarchy and variety that existed in the contextual public realm (Kunstler, 2004). He also argues that the high-rises of the projects themselves destroyed any sense of human scale, which in combination of his other concerns, eradicated the inhabitants connection to the public realm (Kunstler, 2004). By looking at these failures of the social housing projects, a transformational framework needs to be produced that acknowledges these issues of monofunctionality, scale, and safety. This framework should also act as a blueprint of rehabilitation for all NYCHA projects, including what needs and characteristics need to be created in order to activate a public space that increases the inhabitants quality of life. By providing a framework that brings the “soul” of public space in these projects back to life, the original intent of the projects - or the promise it made to the people who would live in them - can be met and achieved.","New York; East Harlem; Progressivism; Social Housing; Public Space; Redevelopment; Regeneration; Modularity; Palimpsest; Social Equality; Transformation; Fractalization; Zoning; Urban Planning; Sustainabilty; Productive Landscape; Heritage & Architecture; Historical Analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","History and Heritage","40.7921034982, -73.9373579172"

The main goal I strive to incorporate within the design project is circularity by integrating the ecology within the existing build environment and society. Therefore, I choose the Harvest studio of Architectural Engineering chair, because this studio is focused on the synergy between technology and design to solve societal issues. Within this studio we work through all scales, from region to object, in which I tried to close waste streams to incorporate circularity within my graduation project. Which gave me the feeling to contribute to a better and sustainable future. <br/> The objective is to research and design with the possibilities of applying fungi though different scales within the built environment of the region Parkstad in Limburg, using different organic waste streams of local industries. The “roots” of this living organism called mycelium, can transform this waste into valuable new building materials. This way a symbiotic entanglement with the ecosystem can be arranged by literally implementing living organisms within the architectural design. This can be accomplished by investigating the qualities of mycelium-based materials, the production process and growing modular building objects that eventually disappears within the ecosystem after its use instead of harming the planet. <br/>The design project is located in two vacant steel construction halls in Schinveld. The goal of this project is to revitalize this abandoned industrial terrain into a “Fungi Factory”: a factory for the production of mycelium-based materials. I tried to add a positive value to these halls by designing a factory and a place where people work, meet and learn about new innovations. The factory is leaving a positive footprint on the environment because it is not depending on fossil fuels and it is closing organic waste streams within the region. In this way I tried to create a balance between ecology and economy. Within the hall I designed a dynamic landscape of flexible units that can easily adapt to the growing scale of the production process and the demand of the users. Within the materialization of the design project will form a showcase of the variety of the applications of mycelium-based materials.

In arctic and sub-arctic regions, the ice action on infrastructures such as platforms, lighthouses, sub-sea pipelines, or wind turbines may exceed the total forces of wind, waves and currents and may, therefore, determine the design. For example, in regions such as Beitstad in Norway, ice loads can be the predominant lateral force in the design of bridge sub-structures. Therefore, accurate estimation of ice forces that can act on bridge piers in northern climates is critical in both cases – the design of new bridges and the structural evaluation of existing bridges. Different design codes provide empirical formulae to calculate the design ice forces, based on the effective ice strength, thickness and other important empirical environmental or climatic coefficients. Ice forces must be considered in the design of the coastal and hydraulic structures. Both the ice conditions and the environmental factors are combined in a formula to calculate the magnitude of ice forces that a structure is expected to withstand in the future and over its lifetime. The existing standards for estimation of the ice loads on vertical and sloping structures adopt different analysis methods, and to determine the global ice loads on these structures, the ice-structure interaction scenarios must be identified. In this study, most of the focus will be on fjord and lake ice conditions and their loading on a bridge pier will be assessed and compared by using different shapes of structure and standards of different countries, followed by the deterministic extreme value analysis , probabilistic assessment and uncertainty analysis of the ice loading during the design lifetime of the bridge sub-structure.","Ice actions","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Coastal and Marine Engineering and Management (CoMEM)","CoMEM","63.430500, 10.395100"

The main span is 64 meters, which is large for an FRP bridge.Combined with its lightweight, low stiffness and structural damping, the structural response to wind excitation might be an issue. Next to designing an FRP cable-stayed bridge, this thesis therefore focuses in a second part on the dynamic behaviour to wind excitation of the bridge. To have a point of comparison with a more ’traditional’ cable-stayed bridge, in parallelto the FRP bridge, a steel-concrete alternative has been designed and analyzed. To push the comparison further, long span alternatives of the two bridges have been designed and analyzed to see their response to dynamic wind excitation. The dynamic analyses in this thesis only take buffeting (turbulence-induced vibrations) into account. Flutter (motion-induced vibrations) are considered through simple approximations from Eurocode.","FRP composites; Cable-stayed bridge; Dynamic wind analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering","",""

The problem is modelled as an extension of the Transportation Problem, adding product, time and size dimensions.

For all those reasons, during the last decades, there is intense research on finding ways to produce the needed energy in a sustainable fashion. Renewable Energy Sources have a minimal impact on the environment compared to traditional energy sources. Those resources can effectively tackle the problems which arise with fossil fuel usage.

(mentor); Liu, Y. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","Low-thrust trajectories can benefit the search for propellant-optimal trajectories, but increases in modeling complexity and computational load remain a challenge for efficient mission design and optimization. An approach for developing models utilizing Gaussian Process (GP) regression and classification is proposed to perform computationally efficient optimization while obtaining acceptable accuracies for trajectories based on exponential sinusoid shaping. The goal of this work is to predict a combination of values of input variables which corresponds to a shape-based trajectory with the smallest total velocity increment (∆V) or propellant mass fraction (Jm). A GP classification model is constructed to assess whether a given combination of values of input variables corresponds to a feasible trajectory. GP regression models are developed to predict the total ∆V and Jm corresponding to a combination of shape parameters, which can replace the required integration along the shape. In addition, advanced regression models are developed to predict the target values while requiring only three input parameters, thereby replacing the entire shape computation. In order to develop a GP model that fits the problem at hand, the underlying functions and parameters should be selected rationally. A novel model development approach is proposed to ensure that the mean function, covariance function, likelihood function, inference method, and hyperparameters, which dominate the performance of the models, are chosen rationally in terms of mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and prediction time. Using this approach, GP models are developed and tested on transfer trajectories from Earth to Mars and Ceres, and from Mars to Earth, and their performance, in terms of MAPE and prediction time, is compared to that of more common optimization techniques in combination with the exponential sinusoid and other shape-based methods. The results demonstrate that the computation time can significantly be reduced while achieving promising MAPE's, especially when the goal is to locate regions of feasible or near-optimal trajectories. The proposed model development procedure is tested for robustness, which provides confidence in the proposed approach. Furthermore, it is found that the models which map three input variables directly to a ∆V or Jm value perform better than the ones trained with shape information, which demonstrates the strength of GP models as applied to low-thrust trajectory optimization.","Gaussian process; Gaussian process regression; Gaussian Process classification; Low-thrust trajectories; Trajectory optimization; Shape-based methods; exponential sinusoid; Preliminary design; Machine Learning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-07-05","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

These systems use conventional PV modules which have a poor performance under non-uniform illumination conditions. When the module is partially shaded, either at least one subgroup is bypassed or the module current is limited by the current of the worst performing cell. This leads to significant and disproportionate power losses. One way to address this issue is to implement a dynamic module architecture which changes its electrical configuration depending on the shading profile. This report evaluates the potential and performance of reconfigurable modules in urban landscapes and describes the optimal module configuration. An electrical simulation framework was developed in MATLAB to trace the current-voltage (I-V) characteristics of several static and dynamic module architectures. For a PV module with 72 solar cells, it was found that a series-parallel connected reconfigurable architecture with six subgroups is the optimal trade-off between a high shading tolerability and a simple module design. The potential of these PV modules increases for locations further away from the equator since shadows are larger and occur more frequently. The annual energy yield of a shaded module of a typical PV system in an urban landscape located in Rotterdam (the Netherlands) can increase up to 9% when replacing a conventional with a reconfigurable module. Reconfigurable modules require additional components, but the negative effect on the power output under uniform illumination conditions is marginal. Consequently, reconfigurable PV modules make complex shading analysis for PV systems superfluous. Compared to a static parallel topology, the module current is generally much lower which in turn leads to lower power losses on system level. Other advantages of the reconfigurable PV module are the smaller seasonal fluctuations in energy yield and the absence of local maxima in P-V curves. Finally, a proof of concept was made to validate the simulation framework. Only minor deviations between the simulation results and the measurements were found. Experiments also showed that solar cells with a soft breakdown must be used to prevent the formation of hot-spots under all circumstances.","Shade-Tolerant; PV Modules; Urban Landscapes; Reconfigurable; Dynamic Topology","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-09-01","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","Recently, the application of machine learning and data fusion techniques on hyperspectral imagery have demonstrated potential for ground cover classification at material level. Hereby, specific locations of resources enclosed in cities (e.g. roof materials) can be identified, which is critically relevant within the field of urban mining. A limitation of this approach is the so-called 'pepper and salt effect', the oversensitivity of the classifiers to spectral variations within a pixel (e.g. chimneys, roof windows). Identifying and correcting affected pixels can be done statistically (e.g. using a majority filter), but not in cases where spectral variations affect a majority of pixels characterizing a surface. A solution to this limitation would be the usage of 3D city models containing the objects inducing the spectral variations. However, such highly detailed 3D city models are often unavailable as they cannot be produced automatically yet. An alternative covered by this research is to use a less detailed 3D city model and semantically enrich it with the required data. As 3D city models are usually produced using a point cloud, such a point cloud is used to perform the enrichment. The main research question addressed is therefore: How can a CityGML LOD2 model be semantically enriched in order to improve material classification performed on roof surfaces?.      To address this, an existing LOD2 model was compared to a point cloud acquired by Ligth Detecation and Ranging and 'deviation' points were identified. This identification uses a distance check for seed selection and performs a region growing with an orientation check. In a subsequent step, 'deviation' point regions were translated into a geometric shape by usage of their Voronoi diagram and fused with the pixels of hyperspectral imagery. Part of this research is also a nominal validation analyzing a total of 41 buildings and 831 pixels located in the south of Rotterdam (Netherlands). Overall kappa values of up to 0.7 and commission errors as low as 10% (for the class 'clean' pixels) were obtained, showing potential of the chosen method. Additionally, a rational validation was performed to assess the impact of potential tolerance of classifiers for 'spectral deviations'. This one only included 10 buildings, but took into account 328 pixels located up to 30% outside the roof surface A main outcome is the recommendation on settings to use depending on the specific user needs. To accurately quantify materials, relatively 'loose' settings are recommended. In contrast, to identify presence of materials, stricter settings are recommended. Beyond this, recommendations to data suppliers and potential applications of the method to other fields are formulated.","enrichment; CityGML; hyperspectral imagery; urban mining; Rotterdam; APEX; spectral variation filtering; semantics; LOD; level of detail; point cloud; AHN","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geomatics","","51.8870079, 4.463591"

In striving to clean and sustainable combustion, adding hydrogen to the Dutch natural gas (DNG) fuel and CO2 in the coflow is promising. Objective of this investigation is to study the effect of hydrogen fuel-addition and CO2 coflow-dilution on the stability of a turbulent lifted DNG jet diffusion flame in cold co-flowing air. OH* chemiluminescence and particle image velocimetry (PIV) are applied simultaneously at a low sampling frequency of 50 Hz to determine time-averaged statistics of the lift-off height and stabilization point location of the flame. PIV measurements at a sampling frequency of 2.5 kHz are performed to determine the transient behaviour of the stabilization point, the flow conditions at the stabilization point and the burning velocity. Hydrogen fuel-addition leads to increased flame stability. With more hydrogen in the fuel, the lift-off height reduces and the stabilization point location shifts upstream and radially inward. The burning velocity at the stabilization point increases with increasing hydrogen fuel-concentration. A significant difference is observed in the burning velocity conditioned on upstream or downstream stabilization point motion. Hydrogen enables the flame to stabilize in a region of the flow that is characterized by high gas velocity and high vorticity. CO2 dilution of the coflow leads to decreased flame stability. With increasing CO2 coflow-dilution, the lift-off height increases and the stabilization point position shifts downstream and radially outward. The burning velocity at the stabilization point increases with increasing CO2 coflow-dilution and the flame stabilizes in a flow region with significant lower vorticity.<br/>Additionally, this report provides useful statistics of the investigated quantities and presents a description for the transient behaviour of the stabilization point.","Gas Turbines; Lifted Diffusion Jet Flame; Flame Stabilization; Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV); OH Chemiluminescence; Combustion; Hydrogen; Exhaust Gas Recirculation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

Within this graduation the- sis, a stakeholder is involved named the ‘Nederlandse Spoorwegen’, in short NS. The stakeholder has the ambition to make their station’s en- ergy neutral. To achieve this, electricity generating assets needs to be implemented on every asset they own. One of these assets is the P+R parking plots near stations. An easy way of implementing solar into the parking plots is by integrating the solar panels into a carport structure. Current solar carport designs which have been constructed so far, are purely focusing on the aspect of generating the maximum amount of electricity and neglecting the aspect of design. The NS has the ambition to make the carport design sustainable in appearance and material use. Besides the sustainable appearance of the design, the design should be applicable in every P+R parking plots. This results in a modular sustain- able carport design that is orientation independent. For the design, a solar cell technology was needed. Three generations of solar cells were found in literature, but the third generation was not further researched since this generation isn’t commercially available yet. The remaining two generations of solar cell technologies (1st and 2nd generation) were researched on the following topics; performance, de- sign, and sustainability. The information found in this literature research directly fed the multi-criteria analysis (MCA) method called the analyt- ical hierarchy process. With this MCA method, polycrystalline silicon solar cell technology was selected to be the best suitable for the design. Another downside to the current solar carport designs is that these de- signs don’t fully exploit the structural capabilities of the solar panels. In the ﬁnal design, a connection is designed and analyzed to exploit the structural capabilities of the solar panels, whilst still keeping the trans- parent nature of the solar panels intact. The ﬁnal design features recycled rail tracks in the structure of the car- port. Besides being made from high-grade steel and the shape of the rail tracks suits their integrating into the structure, the direct link to the stakeholder was also recognized as a beneﬁt for the ﬁnal selection of this material. To further enhance the sustainable appearance/function of the carport, a green wall is implemented to absorb the rainwater. Thus, im- proving the water absorption in the asphalt dominated landscape of the P+R parking plots. In particular, the design of the sustainable solar carport for the NS is analyzed on solar radiation performance and structural performance (on carport scale and on connection scale). To gain an understanding if the new connection is beneﬁcial on a carbon footprint scale, the newly designed connection is compared to a standard aluminum transom and mullion system.","solar; design; carport; structural solar; sustainable carport; Nederlandse Spoorwegen; Solar carport","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","",""

Conventionally, Glass, in architectural industry, has been used in form of sheets (Float glass) due to ease of fabrication of planar sheets, but in last few years, cast glass bricks have been used for creating structural wall/ envelope of few architectural projects namely, Atocha memorial (Spain), Optical house (Japan) and crystal house (Amsterdam) due to its high compressive strength. Cast glass offers many advantages over float glass, but, the reason for limited use of it, in the industry is due to annealing time. Thicker the section of glass, more time is required to anneal the element. To reduce this annealing time, one of the most promising solutions is to use an optimised geometry composed of thinner sections. These optimised geometries usually are based on stress and buckling load of the element; hence they have very dynamic geometry. In order to fabricate these optimised geometries, one has to take help from digital manufacturing tools involving additive manufacturing (3D printing). 3D printing of glass is still in very primitive stage and is currently used for creating artefacts rather than structural elements. Another alternative to fabricate these complex geometries is to print the moulds and then cast glass. 3D printed Sand moulds are being used in the industry to cast optimised concrete slabs and steel nodes. Hence this research explores the feasibility of 3D printed sand moulds for casting optimised structural glass geometries. A column design as a case has been taken, for the experiment as glass having high compressive strength, comparable to steel, portrays as a perfect material for a compression only structure. The column is structurally optimised using topological optimisation and sections of the complex challenging optimised geometry are fabricated using 3D printed sand moulds as different scale and results are drawn.","cast glass; transparent; Casting; Transparency; Sand mould; additive manufacturing; 3D Printing; 3d printed mould; Binders; Binder jetting; Glass column; glass; Column Optimisation; Topology Optimisation; Structural glass","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Building Technology | Sustainable Design","",""

Impressively, this enabled us to find the optimal architecture in both proxy and proxyless tasks on CIFAR-10 within only 0.2 GPU days using a single GPU. As a byproduct, our approach can be transferred directly to convolutional neural networks compression by enforcing structural sparsity that is able to achieve extremely sparse networks without accuracy deterioration.","NAS; Deep Learning; ICML; Artificial Intelligence","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Vehicle Engineering","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","The issue of suburban sprawl in the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area (GTA) has been increasing the pressures of land consumption, infrastructure development, resource consumption, and population growth over the past 50 years. The same can be said for many peripheral regions of Canada’s urban areas. In 2011, two thirds of the population of Canada lived in some form of suburban neighbourhood, and for the GTA a larger percentage of 86%. Though this growth continues, the vast expansions of automobile-dependent neighbourhoods have shown to have prolonged effects on resource consumption, carbon emissions, ecosystem devastation, declining health rates, social segregation, and the destruction of available agricultural land in Ontario. Yet these problems are not new. Neither are the solutions. Suburbs have been the centre of angst for many contemporary urban planners in North America for over thirty years. This has been the motivation for theories such as New Urbanism, Smart Growth, and Sustainable Development, three ideologies which have already been integrated into Provincial and Municipal Policies in Ontario. Most of which are focused on general themes of traditional aesthetics and densities of suburban development and most of which have failed to change the form of suburban development in Ontario. In order to explore these issues, this project looked at the current consumption data through ecological footprint analysis. The largest contributors to consumption included housing (energy), mobility, food, and threats to ecosystem services. In order to explore sustainability in the region, these themes were broken down into indicators which would analyse the growth patterns of the city. In order to compare these findings to current and future growth, growth typologies were created and ranked on performance through the process. Based on the performance conclusions, strategies, scenarios, and future recommendations were developed for future growth planning in the region.","Urbanism; Suburban; Spawl; Urban Metabolism; Sustainability; Urban Growth; Urban Expansion; Toronto; Canada; North America","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","",""

(graduation committee); van Cann, Koen (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","The use of the Classical Laminate Theory (CLT) is limited to laminates where all the fibres in a ply are oriented in the plane of the laminate. In some applications, it is possible that the plies will start at the bottom of a laminate and end at the top of the laminate. This means an inclination is added to the plies, which creates an extra rotation in the fibre direction with respect to the plane of the laminate. Such a laminate with inclined plies is found for example in the skin of InfraCore panels. In the regular CLT, this extra rotation cannot be taken into account, thus the elastic behaviour of a laminate with inclined plies cannot be described properly. The extra rotation that occurs in a laminate with inclined plies has analytically been implemented in the regular CLT to obtain a modified CLT, which has been verified using Finite Element analyses. Using the modified CLT, a reduction in equivalent stiffness can be observed for a single unidirectional ply with an inclination in the fibre direction. The exact value of stiffness reduction strongly depends on the material properties and the lay-up of the laminate. For InfraCore skins, the stiffness reduction is very small (0.15%). Due to the inclination in the plies, the lay-up of the laminate differs along the length of the plate. As a result, the output of the modified CLT is only applicable to one location along the plate. Due to the lay-up differences, the equivalent stiffness will also differ along the inclination direction. The in-plane equivalent stiffnesses will be the highest for symmetric laminates, where the flexural equivalent stiffness will be the highest when the plies with the stiffest fibre direction are located on the outside of a laminate.","FRP; CLT; Laminated composites; Classical Laminate Theory; InfraCore","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering | Structural Mechanics","",""

Next, an analysis of the competitors, customers, company and future trends was conducted. The research insights were the basis for the conceptualization. The presented solution, offering a sense of belonging to the guests by a next level of engagement, is called the citizen board.

This has been demonstrated, where dynamically acting molecules such as Myosin V walking on an Actin filament and Bacteriorhodopsin in response to light were successfully visualized.

First, Amsterdam brands itself as a creative city. It is true that Amsterdam has one of the biggest creative industries in Europe. Yet, makers are only a marginal group of them and economically disadvantaged although their mentality fits the image that the city wants to create. Also, since the industrial revolution, working and living has been separated and especially making was pushed out of the city centre. The structure of the city of today still uses the zoning system and making remains out of sight. In craftsmanship this is crucial because the process of making is an important factor for selling the products. This is one of the reasons why craftsmanship is not valued anymore and products are bought much cheaper from mass production outside of the country. As a consequence, starting a making business is economically difficult. With the high prices of housing in cities like Amsterdam it is impossible for a single craftsman to open a business close to the city centre without any support. Another aspect is the mentality of the younger generation that is changing towards a more flexible lifestyle where work and private life are more intertwined. The zoning concept of the city today is not adapted to the needs of the craft field, with their more complex work spaces.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Dwelling","",""

Natural coastlines supporting mangrove and wetland have been transformed into seawalls with buildings. It is estimated that in the last 100 years, 40 percent of the mangrove coast and significant parts of wetland, pine forest and sea grass have disappeared. (“Florida’s Mangroves | Florida Department of Environmental Protection”, 2019). Mangrove forests stand out to be a future- oriented way of natural coastal defense for South Florida. Although they mainly appear in calm tropical waters, they can withstand and recover from tropical storms. Their unique growth habit with a characteristic root system and branching forms a robust forest, that functions as a natural coastal defense. Also, marine life is dependent on the nursery grounds provided by the root system of the trees and maintaining a healthy fish stock (Sheppard, 2018). We can learn from the past that this forest provides the land with a natural levee and protect against flooding. Also, this natural system has potential to adapt to the consequences of climate change that highly urbanized areas like Miami are already facing and which will increase rapidly in the future. This research identifies and explores design strategies and principles for the mangrove landscape of Biscayne Bay in order to reduce the flood risk of Miami Metropolitan Area, as well as provides aesthetic, ecological and functional qualities that contributes to the identity and resilience of this coastal region. This is done through design-related-research, that divides this research in two domains.

A form of facilitating change is to organise a creative session, which is a group process of applied creativity with the ultimate goal to create a product. The product is the desired future state of a creative session and does not have to be tangible. Most importantly, the product has to be further developed or implemented after the creative session in order to achieve a successful process of change.<br/>LEF Future Center facilitates breakthroughs by organising creative sessions for the Dutch Public Works and Water Management (Rijkswaterstaat). LEF is the context of the research and the aim of this thesis is to enhance change in their creative sessions. The scope of this research is set on creative sessions of which the problem owner desires an outcome that requires implementation into the associated organisation.<br/>First, complete understanding is created on how a creative session facilitates change. Organisational change management and integrated Creative Problem Solving (iCPS) were compared in a literature review. Revealing that iCPS follows similar steps to organisational change management. Afterwards participant observations complemented the research to understand how LEF facilitates change in sessions. The most promising opportunities that resulted from the research are; (1) Ensure a thorough understanding of the problem as given by the problem owner. (2) Define and phrase the goal of the session. (3) Compose a diverse and balanced resource group. (4) Document creative sessions. (5) Inform the problem owner on its role as a change leader.<br/>To ultimately influence the implementation of change over the full process, the design focuses on the beginning of the LEF-process. The intake meeting is chosen as the specific context for the design.Considering this meeting could educate all partakers on their respective roles regarding the goal of the creative session, whilst engaging in all elements of an intake meeting. The partakers of an intake meeting are the facilitator, problem owner and account manager.<br/>The final design resulted from three evaluation sessions, performed during actual intake sessions at LEF. The Intake Session is the new form of starting the preparations of a LEF-session.<br/>The Intake Session is a combination of context specific table and clear instructions, which supports all partakers to fulfil the meeting in three phases. The first phase is introductory. The second phase critically identifies the purpose and reason for the LEF-session. Hereby the partakers give shape to the LEF-session together. The tangible aspects of the table, remind the partakers of all intake elements. During the third phase of the Intake Session, all partakers will evaluate what is in their power to reach the goal of the session and wrap-up with a picture of all that has been written on the tabletop.<br/> <br/>The physical aspects of the Intake Session fit with LEF’s identity and support all partakers. LEF is aware of their prominent opportunities to enhance change. However, LEF lacks a sufficient intake where these opportunities are used. The ‘Intake Session’ provides an essential physical and visual reminder of how to make a good start in the LEF-process, so LEF can flourish during the creative session and facilitate a breakthrough.","Creative session; Organizational change management; Design; Change; Intake","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

By doing this the research seeks to answer the question:<br/><br/>How can we re-interpret the old ‘Healthy City’ identity of the 1920’s, in order to improve the public health, and therefore the livability, whilst meeting the densi cation requirements of kampung Tamansari in Bandung?<br/><br/>This report will gradually work towards a new design proposal for a improved healthy, livable, green, sustainable, affordable and feasible development model for the slum-neighborhoods of Indonesia. The design itself has been conducted on the location of kampung Tamansari.<br/><br/>This report will inform urban planners and other practitioners on the growing challenges and threats of the Kampung-neighborhoods, and give an alternative development model for Indonesia’s slum neighborhoods.","Kampung Improvement; public health; Livability; Incremental development","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","-6.901499, 107.607444"

This power burst can be divided into two mechanisms; pre-emptive push off and a push off to accelerate the leg into swing. This division is marked by the contralateral initial contact, i.e. the impactful start of weight transfer to that foot. This impact is the main energy absorbing event during gait that will be decreased by a pre-emptive push off. It is hypothesized that the medio-lateral position of the Center of Mass of the body controls the weight shift and thus the division of the ankle power into these two mechanisms. Since the trunk has a rather large mass compared to other body segments, the position of the Center of Mass of the trunk has a large influence on the total body Center of Mass. This led to the hypothesis of this study: the trunk controls the ankle power during gait. To verify this hypothesis eleven healthy subjects participated in this study, where gait kinematics and kinetics were obtained using motion capture and force plates. A lower- and upper-trunk was defined, based on a dedicated marker model. The tasks included normal walking as well as conditions to influence the medio-lateral trunk movements and the ankle power during gait. Differences and relations between the amount of ankle work during push off, the amount of ankle work within the two different mechanisms, maximum ankle power, and medio-lateral trunk angles for the different walking conditions were calculated. The amount of ankle work during push off is significantly – but modestly – related to the maximum amplitude of the lower trunk angle. This suggests that with an increasing trunk angle the amount of ankle work decreases. This relation was not found for the upper trunk angle or the Center of Mass of the entire upper body. The maximum ankle power during push off also has a small but significant relation with medio-lateral trunk movements. It can be concluded that with increasing medio-lateral trunk movements the amount of ankle power and work is slightly decreased. The division of the ankle work during push off into two parts is not significantly related to any increase in medio-lateral trunk movements. In the end, these results cannot point to a strong relation between ankle power or work and medio-lateral trunk movements. However, this is an exploratory study and to draw definite conclusions about this relation more extensive research is needed. It might also be interesting to investigate the possibilities of using increased medio-lateral trunk movements to relieve the ankle joint during walking.","gait; trunk; ankle power; push off","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Biomedical Engineering | BioMechatronics","",""

To this end, the Lunar Zebro project competes within this field through its small lunar rover design, drastically decreasing deployment costs and risk of the mission. The road map of Lunar Zebro aims to have a multitude of rovers deployed on the Moon, being able to complete several tasks like exploring, observing, and mapping. Since this concept of rover cooperation adds a novel level of complexity to the mission, a feasibility study is required to look into the difficulties of navigating the Moon with a larger group of rovers. LunarSim is the software package developed during this project. LunarSim aims to facilitate a simulation environment in which Lunar Zebro rovers and space mission designs can be tested and validated. To legitimise the workings of the simulation, a few scenarios have been developed to test the core functionalities of the software product. These scenarios are based on phases in a practical mission plan that consists out of navigating to and observing a crater location. The scenarios is evaluated through examination of a set of defined fitness criteria. In this report, the reader will find documentation on the development process of LunarSim: the simulation in Unity, the ROS back-end, and the bridge between these two systems. Additionally, the report elaborates how the developed software was used to aid in the feasibility study of LUFAR. First, initial research and requirements are formulated to define the scope of the simulation, after which the software architecture is introduced. Then, the systems implemented for the simulation are explained. Subsequently, the implemented rover behaviour algorithm that was used for testing is explained, with additional resources on how to develop a new custom rover behaviour. After this, an evaluation is given of the simulation based on the initial requirements and research with future research and concluding remarks. At the end of the report, the technical specifications in terms of software architecture, simulation environment, and rover behaviour are defined to give an in-depth view of LunarSim.","Space; Moon; Rover; Mission design; Simulation; Multi-Agent System; ROS; C#; Unity; C++; Systems Engineering","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science and Engineering","Lunar Zebro",""

To tackle the intelligibility of speech through Public Address Systems (PA Systems), an Intelligibility-Enhancing Automatic Volume Control system was proposed. The total system to be made must be able to alter a clean speech signal according to a noise estimation. Then the altered, enhanced, signal should be amplified before being sent to an existing Public Address System. A subsystem is added in order to dampen the outside noise in a car-like environment. The whole project is divided into three parts: Noise Statistics Estimation, Intelligibility Enhancement and Amplifier and Noise Cancellation. These parts have been performed by three different subgroups. In this report, the Amplifier and Noise Cancellation is discussed. The other parts are explained in the respective reports [1,2]. The Amplifier and Noise Cancellation group will amplify the enhanced audio signal with the use of a pre-amplifier. This group also introduces an additional noise cancellation subsystem for usage in enclosed spaces, like a car. It does so by inverting the recorded environment noise below 500 Hz, and adding this to the to be amplified signal before sending it to the PA System. This thesis is divided in two main design sections: the design of the pre-amplifier and the design of the active noise cancellation circuit. At the heart of both circuits lies a LM386 Audio Operational Amplifier (Op-Amp) but they both have different objectives. The pre-amplifier is designed to have a flat transfer function in audio range, 20 Hz to 20 kHz. The output level of the pre-amplifier is a standard level for consumer electronics, being 447 mVpp. The pre-amplifier inverts the signal from the microphone and the audio signal to achieve noise cancellation. The noise cancellation circuit features a microphone amplifier and a Low Pass Filter (LPF). The microphone amplifier amplifies the signal so that the microphone circuit’s output level is at the same level of the audio input of the pre-amplifier (200 mVpp). The filter makes sure only sounds below 500 Hz are passed to the pre-amplifier. With the inverting capabilities of the pre-amplifier and both signals being completely out of phase, a theoretical cancellation of sound signals is possible. Because of the LPF used in the microphone amplifier this cancellation is done for signals below 500 Hz. At the end of the project, a system was built which met most of the requirements. Some of the requirements can not be satisfied due to incapability of the test equipment available. The system does amplify the signal to the desired amplitude and is capable of slightly cancelling noise in a car. However, improvements of the product are needed to function more optimally.","pre-amplifier; noise reduction; intelligibility enhancing; car; PA System","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Circuits and Systems","",""

Normally an earthquake would be considered as a natural hazard, however extracting gas induces these earthquakes. Whenever a hazard is induced, it is perceived as man-made and therefore controllable. This leads to differences in risk acceptance in relation to natural hazards. When ambiguity about risks exists, a participatory strategy should be used with involvement of the local community. In cases of induced hazards, low trust between local communities and authorities exists, leading to ineffective risk mitigation. The first step of improving mitigation measures is finding out whether differences in risk acceptance lead to differences in mitigation measure preferences. In this paper this research objective is carried out by gathering data in the earthquake area in Groningen with the Participatory Value Evaluation (PVE) method. Next the data is analysed using factor analysis and logistic regression. Based on the results is concluded that citizens with lower trust in authorities prefer measures that directly target the consequences of the induced hazard. While citizens with more trust in authorities and more belief in the benefits of the activity causing the hazard are more open for measures that target the indirect consequences of the hazard. During this research, assumptions were made to construct the context of the PVE method. To improve the validity of this research it is suggested to repeat the research with different variables.","Community involvement; Risk acceptance; induced hazards; Risk mitigation; PVE methodology","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

(mentor); Vermolen, F.J. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","The present thesis discusses two modelling endeavours that serve to provide insights into both the magnetic and structural dynamics associated with a first order magnetic phase transition. <br/>Firstly, density functional theory has been used to model the lithiation of a supercell of 2x2x2 the conventional unit cell of the ferromagnet Fe2P. Subsequently, the magnetic moments in the resulting structure were set to proxy a paramagnetic state and compute the energy difference between the ferromagnetic and paramagnetic state. It has been found that non-magnetic Li-atoms substitute for magnetic Fe-atoms at 3g-positions in the a,b-plane. Moreover, since these are the positions of Fe-atoms that carry a high magnetic moment and induce a magnetic moment on the Fe-atoms in the 3f-layer, the lithiation of the respective positions leads to a reduction of the magnetic moment per formula unit. The energy difference between the ferromagnetic state and the selected proxy of a paramagnetic state showed to decrease linearly in the fraction of lithiated 3g-positions. This deviates from experimental findings suggesting an increase of Tc of the structure upon lithiation. This difference can stem from the fact that the lithiation fractions considered here were higher than those achieved experimentally or that the selected proxy of a paramagnetic state was incorrect. <br/>Secondly, the finite element method has been applied to approximate the displacement field of a 2D structure consisting of grains distributed over two structural phases with different associated lattice parameters. The development of shear stress discontinuities across grain boundaries has been studied in relation to the degree of porosity in a domain. The replacement of grain boundaries by voids appears, after correction for the orientation of edges at these grain boundaries, to lead to a reduction in the values for these discontinuities. More delicate development of the grid to correspond to physically realistic orientations of grain boundaries is needed to gain more robust quantitative measures for this relation. Moreover, the relation between the orientation of grain boundaries and shearing stresses at these boundaries forms an interesting venue for further research to which the present FEM-model can be readily applied.","Magetic phase transitions; Curie Temperature; Density Funtional Theory; Finite Element Method","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics | Applied Physics","",""

One of the most evident risks is sea level rise. We need to reconsider the way we have been preparing cities to face the climate change related issues. The hard infrastructure that has been used in the past to deal with these issues requires high investment and has very limited adaptive capacity. Instead of fighting nature, we should understand better the natural processes that take place in the ecosystems and use them in our favour to become more adaptable. The use of these Ecosystem-based Adaptation (EbA) strategies can contribute to the sustainable development of our regions. The main challenge in this discussion is to acknowledge the dimension of these ecosystems and their processes, which normally does not align with the administrative and political divisions that we have established for our territory. This issue is very apparent in the case of the Western Scheldt, the remaining open arm of the Rhine-Meuse-Scheldt delta that has to satisfy the needs of the Dutch and Belgian development. Some cross-border initiatives have already been implemented in the region, the most important one being the Western Scheldt Commission. This commission created an outline and long-term vision for the sustainable development of the Western Scheldt. Increasing port activity, dealing with multiple risks associated to flood and maintaining ecological qualities in this tidal estuary were defined as the main functions to be addressed. Because the systems related to these functions are interdependent, dealing with them separately can have many negative impacts. Port activity is the main driver of change in the Western Scheldt. Until recently, it has mostly developed autonomously and resulted in increasing flood risks and further deterioration of the valuable ecosystems in the region. Port development has high potential to be integrated with the other functions and will be used as the driving force for the proposal. Port development projects in the Western Scheldt will be paired with the expected local impacts in the values of safety and ecology. Each of these projects will be addressed through a multi-system approach, taking the Building with Nature (BwN) principles and exposing its potentialities. The pairs not just give way to BWN as technical solution, where systems support each other, but also, will establish pathways for beneficial governance arrangements. The new governance arrangements will respond to the site specificities and consider the following aspects: - It identifies the site-specific group of stakeholders that would have an important role in the implementation of the proposed EbA strategies. - The regional drivers are established and connected to local-scale groups that benefit from the provision of ecosystem services. This contributes to initiate and maintain the conditions of these ecosystems. - The network highlights synergies between different sectors, facilitates the exchange of interests, knowledge and perspectives and distributes responsibilities to ensure the networks robustness. These aspects of collaboration will contribute to the implementation of EbA by increasing the overall support, minimizing trade-offs, revealing additional potentialities and channelling resources efficiently.","Ecosystem-based adaptation; Adaptation strategies; Building with Nautre; Regional planning; Cross border collaboration","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Urbanism","","51.400000, 3.716667"

Nowadays, Rotterdam is one of the largest harbour cities in Europe, with a strong and prosperous harbor industry. On the other hand the city is also a place of contrasts. A key characteristic of port cities is the wide range of nationalities and cultures. People whose families once arrived in the city hoping to build a future for generations after them regard their living environment as an area with poor living quality and poor perspectives. Previous research has pointed out that it is hard for non-native inhabitants in Rotterdam to feel connected to their living environment. The aim of this thesis was to develop a toolbox on how to transform the existing immigrant neighbourhoods into places in which these groups of people feel home, welcome, and able to take their position in the city (thus increasing place attachment). It includes the work of Doug Saunders ‘The Arrival City‘(Saunders, 2018), which elabourates on possible scenarios for areas in order to create perspective, attraction, and a vibrant living place for its existing and new inhabitants with a migration background. The ‘Arrival City‘ is a book written by an American journalist, and is written from a more sociological point of view. In this thesis, this phenomenon is connected with the current challenges of place attachment, and the actual wishes and needs of people in Rotterdam South. By doing so, the outcome of the thesis is a toolbox on how to transform an immigrant neighbourhood into an Arrival City neighbourhood in a Dutch context, at the same time increasing place attachment among people with a migration background. This thesis describes an approach on how to translate the sociological ideas into a toolbox for urban designers. Because of the challenges European cities face nowadays with regard to immigration, this toolbox is also useful for other, international, Arrival cities.","Arrival City; Place Attachment; Rotterdam; design toolkit; Pattern language","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Heritage & Architecture","",""

(mentor); van Wijk, A.J.M. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","The focus of this investigation is the location, sizing and performance of a Hydrogen Fueling Station (HFS) in The Netherlands in 2030. The transportation sector is one of the main air pollution sources, reaching 17% of the total emissions from The Netherlands in 2015. By promoting zero emission vehicles, like Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles (FCEVs), The Netherlands could reduce its environmental impact and reach its future emission goals.<br/>The proposed HFS model consists of a wind turbine, electrolyzer, hydrogen compression and storage system, hydrogen cooling and dispensing system, and a hydrogen tube trailer for buying or selling hydrogen on the industrial market. This system is capable of producing hydrogen on-site with wind energy, reducing the emissions from hydrogen production. The location was based on the re-utilization of existing petrol fueling stations in The Netherlands, meaning that around 3,800 locations were considered. Based on existing legislation for wind turbine placement that regulate noise, safety, and environmental protection, locations were filtered to eliminate infeasible petrol fueling stations, thus leaving 106 locations that allow to install a wind turbine (2.7 % of the existing petrol fueling stations).<br/>By extrapolating the possible hydrogen demand from a single HFS, an hourly demand profile for a whole year was created. The annual consumption was based on the expected petrol dispensed by an average Dutch petrol fueling station in 2030. This demand profile considered hourly, weekly, and seasonal variations in demand. The GIS study indicated that Zoetermeer had average conditions from the feasible locations. Therefore, the wind speed profile was taken from a nearby weather station in Voorschoten. Surface roughness was studied to perform the wind speed extrapolation from 10mto 160 m, the hub height of the wind turbine.<br/>To select the sizes of the wind turbine, electrolyzer, and grid capacity, 90 HFS configurations were simulated and compared with minimum values of environmental (kgCO2eq/kgH2), reliability (Loss of Supply Probability and Equivalent Loss Factor), and financial metrics (CAPEX, OPEX, and LCoH). The recommended system configuration was: one 4.2MW wind turbine, a PEM electrolyzer with a capacity of 45 kgH2/hour (2.4 MW), and 1 MW grid connection for the electrolyzer. The HFS is capable of producing 335 tH2 per year, at 5.034 Euro/kgH2 with 2.74 kgCO2eq/kgH2. This configuration requires a CAPEX of 13.2 MEuro and an annual OPEX of 1.39 MEuro. The efficiency of the complete HFS is 56.4 kWh/kgH2.<br/>If implemented in all the feasible locations, the proposed HFS has the capacity to supply hydrogen to 289,000 passenger FCEVs, removing 467 ktCO2eq from the environment every year. Although this is only 1.4% of the total transportation emissions, it is a step in the right direction to reduce the CO2 emissions in The Netherlands.","Hydrogen production; Wind energy; GIS; Hydrogen fuelling stations","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

This is a new approach on indirectly heating as the heat is released from the inside to the outside, compared to existing indirectly heated gasifiers, where the heat is released from the outside to the inside. The main objective of this thesis has been to analyze the hydrodynamics and heat transfer occurring within the reactor, by applying ""Computational Fluid Dynamics"" (CFD) techniques. The analysis has been carried out using the commercial CFD software ANSYS® FLUENT. First the physical phenomena occurring within the reactor have been identified and then research was done on the models and parameters developed to describe the physical phenomena. First the hydrodynamic behaviour was evaluated and then it was looked into how the heat transfer can be coupled to the hydrodynamics in the reactor. In regards to the hydrodynamics, the Euler-Euler Two-Fluid Model (TFM) has been found to be appropriate, and the inter-phase drag coefficient was chosen as a parameter of interest. The Gidaspow drag model and the Syamlal-O-Brien modelwere compared to one another, and the solid volume fraction, pressure, axial velocity and granular temperature within the reactor were evaluated. The results were compared to the numerical solutions obtained in previous work, in order to understand which model gives a better prediction. The Gidaspow drag model was found to provide a better prediction of the core annular flow in the bed zone, and was therefore implemented in the heat transfer evaluation. In regards to the heat transfer, models were already developed for the conductive and convective heat transfer in multiphase flows. For radiation there is still a lack of rigorous coupling between radiative heat transfer and hydrodynamics in simulations of non-dilute multiphase flows. The heat transfer simulation was performed in two steps, first with only the conductive and convective heat transfer, and then with radiation added to the system. The thermal properties such as the thermal conductivity, absorption and scattering coefficient have been made dependent of the volume fraction. For the case without radiation, a small temperature increase was observed with high temperature gradients near the wall. For the case with radiation, the Discrete-Ordinates (DO) Radiation model was evaluated. From the results it can be concluded that the DO Radiation model overpredicts the radiation that is emitted and scattered from the bed, causing the bed to heat up continuously to temperatures much higher than the radiant tube. More research and experimental validation is required in order to improve the coupling of the radiative heat transfer to the hydrodynamics.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-07-10","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

Using traditional weather station (usually one or two within one city and placed in rural area) to monitor and model the canopy layer urban heat phenomenon does not provide enough spatial resolution. Alternatively, the Netatmo weather station, a low cost and citizen science weather sensor, is able to collect crowdsourced temperature records and has significant strength in spatial and temporal resolution in temperature measurement. Thanks to the variety of uses of the Netatmo weather station and its open API, more temperature data could be used for UHI research. However, for scientific use, the main challenge is the data quality. For one thing, the stations’ locations are set by users and are thus not accurate enough for temperature modeling in a complex city environment. For another, sensors some time generate unreliable records when exposed to solar radiance directly. These two things are actually highly interactional. Knowing the accurate location of stations could be helpful to calculate when the stations are exposed sun then filter outliers, and vice versa. However, the location information could be used to improve its accuracy is quite limited. Thus, the current work is focusing on develop an approach to determine the likely correct location of the stations. For the development of the relocation method, different spatial and sensor datasets have been used. The temperature data in the Hague in May, 2018 have been collected from Netatmo weather stations. Additionally, the AHN3 points cloud for solar simulation and BGT shapefile for creating new location have been investigated. The methodology of relocation process is divided into 6 steps: Sensor data pre-processing, Detecting higher temperature time, Generating potential location of stations, Computing sky view (dome) and solar parameter, Finding the most likely horizontal location of the station, and Assigning height value to points. These steps also have been used with another period time in the Hague for validation and one sample Netatmo sensor experiment in Delft will be conducted. The results proved the feasibility and rationality of the adopted methodology. Around 67% stations (new location) is shown more than 0.5 similarity when comparing with their solar simulation. Validation result detained by two period comparison indicates that over 70% Netatmo stations’ new location show high quality on both the horizontal and vertical dimensions after applying the process. Validation experiment is shown a real example of fluctuated air temperature and how it will be influenced by solar radiance. In the experiment, the location error is reduced from 16 meters to 4 meters, which proves that the methodology adopted by the project is helpful to improve the station’s location accuracy.","Crowdsourced data; Netatmo weather station; Location accuracy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geomatics","",""

Evidently, frames manifest as abstract concepts as easily as they assume material forms. With the endless ways in which it can manifest come also a multiplicity of agencies, ways in which the frame influences, instigates, or enables actions, and most importantly, ways in which frames can perform. It is here that the frame should not only be considered as an object (e.g. an architectural one) or a condition (e.g. a political one), but also as the subject of a specific action, of framing. In this, architecture is not merely the autonomous production of architectural objects, it is intrinsically interwoven with the frames that at once define it (the discipline) and us (people). Fundamental to this is the assumption that an architectural object, whether in its most widely recognised form as a building, performs by framing life. The way in which this performance is enacted, the way in which life is being framed, is thus informed, defined, or mediated by the frames around us, be it socio-cultural or politico-economic frames. And precisely because architecture is compliantly responsible for the construction and strengthening of certain frames, whether intentional or unintentional, it is also capable in providing a better understanding of these underlying multiplicities of frames. Architecture is the very frame through which the thesis explores the frame. In addition to discussing the frame in relation to architecture by exploring its performative aspects, the thesis attempts to critically assess its inherent issues: its affective potential on the extents of human behaviour; the creation of a duality between an inside and an outside of the frame (dichotomisation); the reflection of a (Western) culture of binary thinking; its connotations with well-defined limits, closed boundaries, hard borders, and therefore restrictiveness, exclusiveness, and prescriptiveness. The thesis will take the position in favour of an open approach to architecture, in which instabilities and ambiguities are allowed and encouraged, not for the sake of aesthetic consideration, but for its contingent productive outcome — new interpretations, understandings, and activities. Frankly, the goal of the thesis is not to create ‘methodologies’, ‘toolboxes’, or other inherent prescriptive means for architectural and urban design. In fact, the research, and the subsequent project in its entirety, ‘frames’ an introspective, sceptical position towards the wide range of predefined notions in architecture. In our time of increased societal polarisation and a persisting culture of antagonisation, architecture’s role should be to rethink its own binary thinking, to unframe some of its own established frames, to allow instabilities and ambiguities to emerge, to productively open up for contingencies, and to blur its perimeters, boundaries, and limiting frames — architecture liberated from its problematic fixed preconceptions, norms, and dogmas.","Frame; Walls; Dichotomisation; Ambiguity; Otherness; Militarised Territory; Polemics of Architecture; Yongsan Garrison","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","Explore Lab 26","37.536216, 126.982986"

A further increase in this temperature can have disastrous effects on our society, thus the increase in greenhouse gases must be attenuated. Electrochemical water splitting and CO2 reduction have been identified as promising routes to generate carbon neutral fuels. Efforts are made to increase the performance of the electrochemical configuration, however, a stable system that is applicable for industrial applications has not yet been achieved. The research field is ever changing and thus the choice of electrolytes and catalysts fluctuates. There is a desire for a stable configuration that can cope with these changes. A bipolar membrane (BPM) has the unique ability to pair two different electrolytes which can be optimized for their respective oxidation and reduction reactions. A BPM configuration is applicable for high performance rates, since it splits water at the interface layer, therefore accelerating the rate of ion transport compared to a conventional monopolar membrane. Despite the advantages of the BPM, there are still knowledge gaps on the exact mechanism behind the BPM and its electrochemical response. It is known that co-ion permeation through the BPM lowers the efficiency of the water dissociation reaction, thus decreasing the stability of the system in the long run. Therefore, it is relevant to further explore the effect of ion characteristics on ion cross-over. This research focuses on the degree of ion cross-over for a variety of electrolytes, with different pKa values. Multiple buffer solutions were tested at the cathode in a flow cell configuration for a current density range of 0-150 mA/cm2. The anolyte was a 0.5M NaOH solution for every tested catholyte. All experiments were performed for a constant period of time, after which the electrolytes were analysed for ion cross-over. It has been observed that the pKa value, the mobility and the valence of an ion influence the ion cross-over through the bipolar membrane. A large ion size decreases the ion cross-over to negligible amounts, for permeation through the membrane is limited. However, high BPM potentials have been detected for large molecules due to an assumed diffusion boundary layer, which increases the resistance at the cation exchange layer. For all tested catholytes low co-ion permeation (%) is measured at high current densities. Thereupon, the age of the BPM significantly affects the degree of ion cross-over. This observation is stronger for the anion exchange layer, for its permselectivity is lower. Additionally, the catholyte choice appears to influence the opposing Na+ flow from the anolyte to the catholyte. <br/> This thesis demonstrates that for high current densities co-ion permeation reaches negligible values. In addition, the results indicate that an ideal ion size region exists, where ions cannot permeate the membrane easily, yet do not form a diffusion boundary layer (thus do not increase the BPM potential). This knowledge is relevant for optimizing the BPM configuration for industrial applications, since a clever choice of electrolytes can further stabilize the system. Future research should focus on up-scaling the set-up and testing the commercial BPM for stability and permselectivity.","Bipolar membrane; CO2 reduction; Water splitting","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","51.9898529, 4.3798121"

The abundance of ocean plastic waste and the societal pressure for Europe to manage its plastic recycling system creates an opportunity for designing recycled ocean plastic products. Therefore, using ocean plastic for new product development should be encouraged. In general people have a strong positive attitude towards recycling and ocean plastic products. Cleaning up the oceans is considered a must and giving retrieved ocean plastic new purpose is beneficial. However, people currently still feel somewhat confused in how to behave more pro-environmental due to a lack of ease and lack of knowledge. Also they are not quite able to distinguish recycled products from other (non-recycled) products. In addition, they have reservations towards ocean plastic products which make to direct personal contact and therefore prefer to be made aware of the fact that a product is made from ocean plastic during purchase. Nevertheless people have faith in the future potential of ocean plastics. People especially like products made from ocean plastic that are easy accessible, produced in large scale, approachable and long lasting. The most suitable product categories to fulfil all these wishes are packaging and furniture. Through examination of the two different product categories it is possible to make more generalised design assumptions for ocean plastic products in order to be adopted by consumers more easily. This is valuable for promoting large scale implementations of ocean plastic products. The products representing these two product categories as used in this research are a bottle of dishwashing liquid and a chair. In order to find out how to design these types of products, information has been gathered regarding the importance of different design elements of ocean plastic products. Highly ranked design elements for ocean plastic products are the shape typicality and the recognisability of an oceanic pattern/texture. Four design alternatives have been created per product in order to test the effects of these design elements. The bottles and chairs were either typically shaped or atypically shaped, and either had an oceanic pattern or did not have an oceanic pattern. The visual appearance of products can evoke different responses. These responses have been analysed for ocean plastic products. It can generally be concluded that triggering a stronger ocean plastic perception through appearance elements proves to be successful. It is possible to communicate the presence of ocean plastic through design elements effectively. Products with an ocean plastic pattern/texture evoke more oceanic feelings and are found attractive. Since attractiveness is correlated with purchase intention, ocean plastic products with (specific) patterns/textures are likely to be bought more frequent. In addition, typical products evoke a higher purchase intention than atypical products. People currently feel more positive about buying less durable products from ocean plastic which increases the purchase intention for these less durable products. The perceived lifespan of durable products can be positively affected by adding oceanic patterns/textures. Since attractiveness is considered less important for durable products, this increased durability perception could have a positive effect on the purchase intention of such products.","Ocean plastic; Recycled; Recognisability; Typicality; Design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To accumulate a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering at the Delft University of Technology, it is compulsory to pass this course. The project, spanning a duration of ten weeks, is described in this report. The project client was Adviesgroep Strategisch Gebouwbeheer Nederland B.V. (ASG). This is a Dutch energy consultancy company based in Delft that uses big data innovations for energy management and for gaining insight into sustainability issues. The client encountered a real-life problem regarding the transmission of the data from their measuring devices. We were tasked to solve this problem. The project goal was to create a better data transmitter for the client. For naming convention purposes, we call the transmitter a gateway, as the device acts as a port between the measuring devices and the servers. It receives data from the measuring devices within its proximity and after filtering and processing this data, it is transmitted to the servers. The main objective was to design and develop a gateway that is better than the previously used gateway, the one that the client encountered numerous issues with. This improved gateway would then be deployed throughout the country such that the client enjoys numerous improvements. The most important improvements include cost reduction and a more robust, feature-rich and configurable solution.<br/>Furthermore, the goal of this report is to inform the reader about the work that has been completed during the duration of the project at ASG. This report also contains possible future recommendations for this project. The objective of the future recommendations is to act as advice, guidance and instructions for the continuity of this project as the client might decide to further expand the solution by co-workers.","energy; Big data; energy measurement","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The main goal of this project is the aerodynamic model identification of this novel aircraft configuration, using wind tunnel data from a 4.6\% scaled model. Models using Multivariate Orthogonal Functions and splines were postulated for the aerodynamic forces and moments, in order to construct a global input/output model to estimate the aerodynamic response of the Flying V. The aerodynamic model structure was unknown a priori, and was determined from the measured data using a modified stepwise regression technique, which achieved parsimonious models with tight confidence bounds. The models were validated against a partition of the data, showing good prediction capabilities and reasonably random, uncorrelated residuals, especially in the case of the spline models. <br/><br/>The resulting models are analytical functions in the state and control variables, which can be used to determine the aerodynamic forces and moments of the Flying V at any given flight condition inside the region of validity of the model. Using the estimated models, a trim routine was programmed to calculate the thrust and control settings required for trimmed flight at different airspeeds and flight path angles. Bounds for the center of gravity regarding controllability and stability were calculated using the estimated models, and a feasible center of gravity location for the Flying V was identified. In addition, a safe flight envelope for the flight test can be defined from the results of the trim routine. <br","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","Turboprop engines are known for their high fuel efficiency on short-range missions compared to turbofan engines. A disadvantage of turboprop engines is the noise they produce. The dominant noise source of the turboprop engine is the propeller. The goal of this research is to develop a propeller source noise model which has the future goal to extend already existing noise prediction tools like the VCNS (Virtual Community Noise Simulator). In this research the Helicoidal Surface theory is coupled with two external aerodynamic tools, XFoil and XRotor, for the computation of the harmonic noise sources of the propeller. The developed tool is called the HeliX-tool. The harmonic noise sources that are implemented for the computation of the propeller noise are the steady loading noise and the thickness noise. The HeliX-tool is successfully implemented in Matlab and the tool is validated using literature data and two NLR-tools (one for the propeller aerodynamics and one for the propeller acoustics). From the validation some limitations came to light. For operating conditions that result in high local Mach numbers (&gt;0.7 Mach), the HeliX-tool shows bad agreement with the literature data. For lower local Mach numbers the HeliX-tool shows good agreement with literature data and the NLR-tools. Additional comparisons are made using the HeliX-tool and NLR-tools for operating conditions that are not considered in the literature data. The agreement with the NLR-tools is shown by these comparisons. However, for harmonic numbers higher than 1 the difference between the HeliX-tool and NLR-tools becomes more noticeable as the harmonic decay of the HeliX-tool is larger. More research into the higher harmonic numbers can possibly improve the agreement for the higher harmonic numbers. The ultimate aim of the HeliX-tool is to be able to perform a noise simulation of a propeller. Therefore an auralization of a propeller fly-over is performed. Several propagation effects are taken into account. These are the ground reflection, spherical spreading, atmospheric absorption and the Doppler frequency shift. As a result an audible simulation of a propeller fly-over is obtained.","Propeller noise; Aeroacoustic; Noise prediction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

(mentor); Itard, L.C.M. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","The Dutch government claims that upgrading office buildings to an energy label C building is enough to reduce the environmental footprint of companies for now. Research has shown that when a building receives an energy label, it does not mean that the operational energy use of the building is in line with the received energy label; this results into an energy performance gap. The gap consists of the building-related energy use or the user related energy use. This research focusses on how the behaviour of office users can be influenced to reduce the energy performance of an office building in use. This research is divided into four parts. First the energy performance gap is discussed, afterwards measures which influence the energy performance of an office building are researched, followed by which factors stimulate pro-environmental behaviour and finally which methods are effective to implement the measures and behavioural changes. First, the energy performance gap can be explained by the difference between the theoretical energy label and the operational energy use. There are two possible causes for this gap: the building related energy use or the user related energy use. This research focusses on how to reduce the user-related energy by activating the user behaviour. Secondly, during this study a measurement list is developed to show possible measures to reduce the energy performance and environmental impact of a building. Significant change can be achieved, not by implementing these measures on a small scale (one office), but on a large scale (all offices). It is also the case that these types of measures will not always have a significant effect the environmental impact of the building or the energy use of the building, this depends on the current building characteristics. When a building already implements that measure, the impact will be less significant than when they do not use the measure. Third, pro-environmental behaviour (PEB) is a behaviour type that focusses on minimizing the negative impact of the consequences of human behaviour on the environment (V. Blok et al., 2015). Trough literature, interviews and the delphi panels it can be concluded that comfort, economic and intention play an important role in shaping pro-environmental behaviour (Kollmuss &amp; Agyeman, 2002). The factors which do have the highest impact on encouraging and stimulating Pro-environmental behaviour according to the users and experts are: Intention to act, Perceived behaviour control, Social norms and Eco-communication. Finally, methods to activate these factors are related to the measure and how this measure affects the behaviour factors. In this research three examples of implementing measures are given. The three main methods to reduce the environmental impact of an office building and thereby activating the pro-environmental behaviour of the user are: Pro-environmental behaviour guidelines, Eco- communication platform and Social incentivesCombining the methods will get the optimum result of the measures which are implemented. These four parts combined answers the research question: How can the behaviour of office users be influenced to reduce the energy performance of office buildings in use? ","behaviour; Behaviour change; Pro-environmental behaviour; office building; Energy Reduction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","",""

For cities in general, for the residential housing for elderly and for people who live (elderly) and ‘work’ (healthcare organizations) inside the buildings. The existing elderly homes as well as public spaces can not accommodate the growing numbers of elderly anymore. Due to this fact and the transitions in the elderly care policy, there is need to rethink the architecture of home and living environments for elderly. We must start to think about new concepts for a more inclusive environment for elderly. The goal of this project is to provide Harderwijk with an urban structure where elderly can dwell, live life and interact with each other but also with other target groups, because we have to get rid of hiding elderly in nursing homes, they should become part of society again! With other target groups I think for example about people who need revalidation, so create a link with the hospital which is located nearby the site. The urban structure will provide residences but it will also become a vital network which prevents loneliness and creates a vibrant community. This new social ecosystem will put the elderly in the centre of society. Nowadays, the pace of the world is so fast that not only elderly, but people of all ages, get anxious, overwhelmed and overstimulated quite easily. They will take a step back from society due to this fast pace and that’s where loneliness kicks in. In order to make elderly part of society, it is important to slow down the city to the speed of the elderly. Make them feel comfortable and safe, in that way you will motivate vulnerable elderly to go out again. So, in order to create an inclusive environment for elderly you need to start at the urban fabric. Only a building can not solve the problem, the whole urban network around it should be upgraded as well.","Architecture; Elderly; Flows; Healthcare architecture; Age-friendly cities","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","Designing for Care","52.3460437, 5.6130631"

There is no room for the target group that is too good for the nursing home and too bad for home care. In this Graduation Studio ‘Designing for Care I will anser the following question, ‘What kind of buildings and neighbourhoods do we need if (older) people take care of older people?’ In this context, care is seen as non-professional care. To answer this question I lived for one week in an elderly home to study the target group in their context. The main observations are passive behaviour and ‘being alone together’. Life in that elderly home reminds me of a factory. An ‘elderly factory’ that produces passive elderly. The relation with a factory is because of the daily routines and the behaviour of the residents. Everyday is the same, everything is planned, nothing is spontaneous. My goal is to transform the ‘elderly factory’ into a ‘fun factory’. A design where elderly live together and take care of each other. Fun in this context refers to the lifestyle and the living environment. Fun can be for instance social interaction or making yourself useful to help someone else. <br/> To come up with a concept I asked people in my surrounding how they would live when they are old. The main answers focused on the people. Interviews gave me insights in what people are willing to share with others. Namely a kitchen, living room and a garden, a good balance between private and collective space is important. The kind of support that people are willing to give to their roommates is divided. They like to do leisure activities, are willing to do some household tasks but not provide medical care. Caregivers are needed and will offer home care. <br/> To create a place where you are together, help and motivate each other we can learn from an existing co-living typology for a new target group, namely ‘student houses for elderly’. A house with private and collective rooms that are shared with a small group of selected people. The design is a modern courtyard typology. A collective greenhouse is surrounded by elderly houses and care-free houses. A surrounding that stimulates small talks, interaction and social control.","Elderly; care; the elderly factory; being alone together; passive behaviour; student houses; co-living","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","",""

A focus is placed on post-war walk-up apartments of which 635.000 were constructed in the Netherlands. Renovation (zero-energy) methods for this specific building type are still missing.

Therefore, the goal of this research is the design of a new zero-energy renovation method that improves the current method. The approach they used is still promising and it is often seen in other renovation projects. Therefore, it will be used as the base for the new renovation method in this thesis. In addition to the research on the 2ndSKIN project, other renovations methods that involve upgrading the envelope were investigated together with building services and the post-war walk-up apartment typology, forming the first part of this research: the literature review. From the review, different conclusions were found that formed parameters for the design process.

A regional spatial vision on energy, based on which issues like landscape integration can be coordinated shortly, is called for. Parkstad Limburg currently is described as the fastest growing tourist destination in The Netherlands. It is a region full of contrasts and extremes. This place located in the southern part of the province of Limburg in the Netherlands, with an estimated 2017 population of 245109 and consists of eight municipalities. It covers a total area of 211 km², with a population density of 1,161 per square kilometers. This region used to be known as the Eastern Mining Area. Around 1900, the formerly agricultural area rapidly developed as the epicenter of Dutch coal mining. In 1965, the Dutch national government decided to close the state mines. Most former mining complexes were demolished and replaced by natural areas, parks or housing areas, but the old miners hardly profited from those new jobs, so the city began to shrink. It is fascinating when the landscape is a tool to deal with a social and economic problem. My main interest in this Lab is energy flow in a landscape. In a large scale perspective, shrinkage is an inevitable stage and does not mean passive; While in the sight of Parkstad scale, it is a shame to losing both the identity and population. It is thought-provoking as a landscape architect to rethink about what will landscape act in this procedure and what will Parkstad benefit from. The energy transition is a spatial issue because it is forms of sustainable energy inherently entail new demands on space. To do energy-conscious spatial planning, and achieve synergies in such a complicated place, the questions are invited for: What are the energy-conscious spatial strategies, to integrate with energy sinks, urban green network, and differentiation of niches, to facilitate sustainable energy landscape design to improve environmental quality in Parkstad? With this research question, I come up with three strategies for the whole Parkstad region, based on the existing problems on a big scale. They are a green grid strategy, energy flow strategy, and spatial composition strategy. These three strategies are parallel and correlated in some respects, for example, social and cultural activities.

These losses of biodiversity in many places create problems for the resilience of the ecosystems in which we live. How we design our spaces has an impact on all the species that live in them. In order to protect and improve the biodiversity, spatial designers should change their approach from an anthropocentric towards one that has a plural perspective towards environments. All species have their own basic (spatial) needs that allow them to live. These basic needs can be generalised as follows: climate, infrastructure, shelter, food and water. Climate are the basic conditions of a place, that is formed by the atmospheric, hydrospheric and lithospheric conditions. Infrastructures make it possible for species to move. Shelters are needed for protection. Food and water form the basis of their energy and hydration. Environments are filled with textures that create the affordances of these basic conditions. One can therefore argue that in order to design for multitude of species, one needs to view space as textures that hold affordances, rather than only seeing it with the human meaning in mind. Textures can be analysed on basis of their affordances and combined with the limiting impacts on biodiversity. This will show where the rich textures are that have many different affordances and the places that limit biodiversity. In order to alter space in order to improve coexistence, a designer should use the following design principles: (1) Diversify textures; by having many different textures, there are many oppurtunities for species to find food and places for shelter. (2) Enrich textures by allowing it to grow; a simple method to create rich and diverse textures is by allowing plants to grow. Heavy maintenance not only limits the life of the plant that is being limited, but also the life that could have benefitted from the plants. (3) Connect rich textures; this creates the ability to move. Spatial design can be used to plan infrastructures for species, both human and nonhuman.<br/>The Thames Estuary is used as a case study to test the approach and design principles. It resulted into a new vision for the Thames where human impact on biodiversity is reduced. In order to come to that vision a strategy is made by focussing first on the minimal effort, then on restoring infrastructures and finally to use these infrastructures to transform the areas surrounding.","coexistence; species; biodiversity; ecology; urbanism; affordances; Thames Estuary","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","","51.462974, 0.491251"

First, the general stability theory for delay differential equations was highlighted before giving an in-depth stability analysis of the equation y''(t) + ay(t) + by(t-1) = 0. It turns out that a theorem of Pontryagin (1908 -1988) is really helpful for answering these stability questions. Due to this theorem all values for a and b are determined such that y=0 is asymptotically stable for y''(t) + ay(t) + by(t-1) = 0. However, this does not cover the stability type of y=0 for all values of a and b. So more analysis was done in order to give a full answer of the stability problem. The full answer was not achieved as there are still values for a and b where the stability is unknown. Finally, numerical solutions of y''(t) + ay(t) + by(t-1) = 0 are shown to confirm the results that are obtained.","Delay differential equation; Exponential polynomial; Harmonic oscillator","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics","",""

My proposal does not pretend to be able to govern the current processes within the site I studied, nor does it pretend to offer solutions to straightforward problems, for example, ‘problems’ within those informal communities along Baku's railway I investigated - actually it is controversial to decide if the ‘problems’ need to be solved or if there are really 'problems' exist. Instead, I applied the theories and image study methods from my research to the new practice. In a complex block with potential in Tbilisi, I introduce a set of infrastructure, which offers marginal spaces available for occupation and use.

Detecting it at an early stage enables to significantly reduce the mortality rate. Mammography is the golden standard technique used for screening but it has some disadvantages, among which the difficulty to scan women with dense breasts. Ultrasound is a promising technique enabling a cheap and fast diagnosis. More precisely, waveform inversion reconstructs the 3D speed of sound distribution within the breast, enabling an easier differentiation between healthy and non-healthy tissues.<br/><br/>In this work, two inversion methods are investigated, namely Algebraic Reconstruction Technique (ART) and Born inversion. Born inversion is a non-linear waveform inversion method aiming at solving an integral equation. To increase its performance while keeping the computation time constant, the frequencies used for the reconstruction are chosen randomly over a given bandwidth for each source receiver combination, at the expense of an additional noise in the reconstruction. The sparsity of the reconstruction in the wavelet<br/>domain has been utilized to implement two new regularization methods aiming at reducing this noise. To test and validate the three algorithms (namely ART and Born Inversion with the two regularization methods), a phantom study has been performed with both synthetic and real data. The phantom, made out of agar, is<br/>placed in a square water tank in the centre of a measurement setup designed during this study, allowing to scan the phantom from its four sides.<br/><br/>The results of the methods are presented and discussed. ART does not perform well with real data as the assumption on which it relies is not satisfied at the frequencies used in this study. Born inversion is presented with transmission and reflection data, as well as a combination of the two. With synthetic data, both reflections and transmissions give very satisfying results with the help of the regularization. With real data the phantom is correctly imaged by the reflections but the transmissions do not perform well enough to give an accurate speed of sound map.<br/><br/>The knowledge gathered in this work can help building a better measurement setup, with a phantom closer to the breast geometry and internal structure, with which the reconstruction techniques could be tested and further improved.","Breast ultrasound; Born inversion; ART; sparse regularisation; l1-regularization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As measurement of this force is often difficult or impossible a technique that identifies this force in an alternative manner is desired. A wide variety of methods is available in literature. Obtaining this force in the frequency domain is done often. However, in certain cases where the input force is non-stationary a frequency domain technique does not suffice. This thesis therefore focuses on obtaining a reliable force identification method in the time domain. The force identification problem can be seen as an ’inverse problem’ to which a simple analytical solution is not trivial. A more advanced method is required. Methods found in literature can be grouped into three categories which fundamentally differ in the way the dynamics is modelled. Deterministic force identification methods are defined as methods where the dynamics is modelled deterministically. Whenever a methods uses a stochastic model it is considered a stochastic force identification method. A third group of force identification methods uses artificial intelligence to obtain a model of the system when no model is available. In this thesis it is assumed a model of the system dynamics is available and therefore artificial intelligence methods for force identification are not considered. Deterministic force identification method including regularization methods, recursive methods and iterative methods are compared to stochastic methods which are all based on the Kalman filter. The most relevant methods are evaluated using simulated data of a single and multiple degree of freedom dynamical system and measured performed on an aluminium structure. It was concluded that the Least Mean Square Adaptive Algorithm outperforms the Joint Input-State Estimator with Artificial Displacement Measurements in identifying forces acting on the simulated single and multiple degree of freedom system as well as the forces acting on the aluminium structure.","Time domain; Force identification; Least mean square adaptive algorithm; Kalman filter; Joint input-state estimator","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Each eco-based design, such as the case-study ‘the River as a Tidal Park’, is subjected to a wide range of environmental, societal and political risks. Considering the extremely uncertain projected risks for increasing sea levels and more extreme river discharges after 2050, the river does not provide the flexibility the future demands. After the implementation of relatively short term and local scale initiatives the projects are still subjected to these uncertainties, which makes the long-term values uncertain as well. Therefore, it might result in a loss of capital for partners as the project appears to be unsustainable. Accordingly, the thesis aims for ensuring the project provides the desired ecosystem services for 2100 and costs and benefits are distributed more evenly among stakeholders through time and space. To bridge the gap between time and space, the thesis considers the concept of seeing and working with “Nature as a New Economy’ as a starting point. This concept focuses on the development, preservation and regeneration of nature to obtain most values from it. The thesis approaches two scenarios for 2100. The Rest Scenario considers moderate climate change and socio-economic decline and the Steam Scenario investigates extreme climate change and socio-economic growth. The research follows in a search for value synergies among both scenarios to find ‘no regret’ measures for the short term. To guide decision-makers in the process between short term investments and long term needs, an adaptive framework is developed. This framework provides guidelines to take action when specific tipping points in time are reached. The hypothesis is to what extend the value of ecosystem services can be inverted in time to use it as a design instrument in relation to decision-making processes. The research question which leads the thesis is: ""How can the concept of ‘Nature as a New Economy’ be used for the development of an adaptive design for the spatial transformation of the fluvial zone of the Nieuwe Maas considering the uncertain future?"" The thesis’ results show that, with the proposed adaptive design, most ecosystem services increase through time. This results in increasing interest and a model of revenue for stakeholders, which makes sure that the project can be extended until 2100. The concept of ‘Nature as a New Economy’ is providing decision-makers with a language to give insight in the benefits for them on the long term, is increasing the financial support for the project and will reduce the risks for future generations. It makes decision-makers aware of the value of nature and that it could go beyond economic growth. It can be seen as an inversion of the concept of nature: nature is no longer seen as something we have to fight against to strive for economic growth. Nature can now be seen as an economy itself which is the new value for producing economic growth.","Nature as a New Economy; Ecosystem Services; Ecosystem Service Assessment; Adaptive Planning and Design; Delta Urbanism; Adaptive Policy Framework; River as a Tidal Park","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","River as a Tidal Park","51.899415, 4.435758"

However, urban regeneration approaches based on the creative city concept have negative side-effects such as gentrification and segregation, and are not able to provide an answer to the current trends of an increasing underclass and mass migration. This asks for the development of a new urban regeneration approach wherein these side-effects and trends are taken into account: a more sustainable social urban regeneration approach. Creative events might contribute to sustainable social urban regeneration by increasing social inclusion, social cohesion, social justice and spatial justice. It is not scientifically proven whether creative events could contribute to sustainable social urban regeneration, since the creative events concept is not exhaustively described in literature yet. As a result, the meaning and implications of creative events — especially their short-term and long-term effects on urban regeneration — are not known.

In this investigation, the difference between a grave containing a human body and a refilled empty pit is explored at the Amsterdam Research Initiative for Subsurface Taphonomy and Anthropology (ARISTA) facility, using common-offset GPR data collection. In addition, common-offset data is gathered at a test site at TU Delft, in order to redefine the locations of previously buried targets. Multiple-offset GPR datasets are also col-lected at both sites, one of which is processed using electromagnetic interferometry (EMI) and adaptive subtraction (AS) in an attempt to remove direct waves. <br/>The positions of the targets at the TU Delft site were redefined, but with some questions as to whether the site has been altered in the past year without the knowledge of the author. High lev-els of interference in the ARISTA facility data due to close proximity to various metal and plastic objects makes it difficult to determine the true differences caused by the presence of the cadaver. The author suggests using a 500-MHz antenna for further investigations at the site due to high wave velocity which leads to a low resolution when using a 250-MHz antenna, and due to more homogeneous soil at the ARISTA facility. The optimal procedure for EMI+AS is discussed, and sug-gested to be the use of a bandpass filter to remove very high and low frequencies from the raw data prior to EMI. The method is shown to be reasonably effective, especially when the data is strongly impacted by the presence of direct waves, where simply topmuting the data would re-move too much information. A script was prepared in MATLAB which has been optimised for the application of EMI to GPR data, and further scripts were prepared for use in Seismic Unix for the purpose of AS, in the hopes that others may find these a useful beginning to further applications of this method.<br","GPR; electromagnetic interferometry; forensics","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

The current model and lab setup used to create insight into the systems working mechanisms are based on a Kalina cycle configuration. This method uses a working fluid mixture of water and ammonia. After evaporation, the liquid and vapor are separated and the heated liquid is used in a recuperator to retain (some of) the heat and increase the efficiency of the system. The first 3 [MW] test plant that is planned to be built will be using an ORC configuration. This method solely uses ammonia as a working fluid and doesn’t use a recuperator to retain heat. Understanding the effects of liquid separation and re-circulation are important aspects while using this configuration. The working method of the current OTEC off-design model and lab setup will have to be altered to accommodate the ORC configuration. An extensive study on both available literature, the current OTEC off-design model and OTEC Demo lab setup lead to conclude that a gear pump will be implemented to drive the liquid re-circulation from the separator back to the evaporator. Parallel to the gear pump, a one-way valve is installed into the cycle so natural re-circulation experiments can also be conducted. From literature, a hypothesis is made on what the effect on the evaporator heat transfer rate could be by changing the re-circulation rate. The re-circulation rate must not be too high, because increased amounts of vapor bubbles increase fluid mixing and thus heat transfer. The re-circulation rate also must not be too low, because dry-out in the evaporator will occur, reducing the heat transfer rate. The OTEC off-design model that currently exists at Bluerise B.V. is used and expanded upon to accommodate the ORC configuration. The evaporator is changed in more detail, adding a heat transfer correlation and the possibility to calculate the evaporator pressure drop through two phase pressure drop correlations. After implementing the gear pump liquid re-circulation technique, the OTEC Demo can be used to create experimental data. From experiments, it is found that the re-circulation rate does not significantly change the evaporator heat transfer rate between 1.2 to 2.9 re-circulation rate. This is a remarkable result but can be explained by the low flow velocities in the evaporator, which indicate that the heat transfer process in the evaporator is mostly driven by pool boiling heat transfer mechanisms over flow boiling heat transfer mechanisms. Knowing that the re-circulation rate does not affect the evaporator heat transfer rate, liquid re-circulation can also happen naturally, by the liquid column driving force in the separator. Using this technique, a comparison with the Kalina cycle configuration using pure ammonia is made. The evaporator performance is higher in the Kalina cycle configuration, but the ORC configuration net power output is slightly higher. The main reason for this phenomenon is a lower required pumping power for the ORC configuration. The OTEC off-design model in ORC configuration is validated to the experimental data collected. The two phase heat transfer correlations used show to be very mass flux dependent, and applicable to flow boiling evaporative heat transfer. The correlations proposed by Taboas and Han et al. have the best fit to the experimental data. The correlation proposed by Taboas is used to validate the full cycle model. This two phase heat transfer correlation has a consistent negative deviation from the experimental data, causing the full cycle model to be conservative in the cycle performance it calculates. Finally, a scaling analysis is made in support of the efforts by Bluerise to create a 3 [MW] OTEC plant. Using the geometries supplied by Bluerise it is concluded that a 3 [MW] net power output could be achieved, but it heavily depends on the water side pump power needed and the turbine efficiency, which are not investigated in the current research.","OTEC; organic rankine cycle; Kalina cycle; Performance","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

Moreover, the climate change, causing rising water level and air temperature, together with political crisis will result in unavoidable migrations.

It will allow it users for relocation between different destinations, while living in their personalized unit - pod. For pod's relocation the project assumes the use of upcoming global network of Hyper-loop combined with a metro. The project consist of two parts: permanent, built on site structure, which hosts public and shared functions for co-living, and the other part of the building, which is a dynamically changing arrangement of plug-in private pods. Pods enter the building through the underground distribution system, are lifted up by pods elevators and plug-in to the permanent structure.

Rehabilitation of the Great Barrier Reef is crucial for Australia, both socially and economically because it provides $6 billion in revenue and 63,000 jobs. The Queensland state government issued a challenge within the ""Small Business Innovation Research"" program to quickly restore ecological functions provided by the reef. Van Oord and CSIRO participated in this challenge by testing a concept designed to scale-up rehabilitation efforts. This concept involves rehabilitation of the reef by increasing the number of larvae deployed onto the reef. To achieve this, coral-spawn slicks should be collected from areas with healthy coral populations that show a redundancy of embryos. During transport, these slicks should then be stimulated to grow into settlement competent larvae. Subsequently, they can be deployed at a degraded coral reef. The collection phase should be executed with pumps to reach considerable volumes of coral embryos for significant ecological scale. Unfortunately, the mortality rate of coral embryos due to pumping is so far unknown, yet crucial to determine. Therefore, the objective of this research is to develop a method for designing a pumping system that can pump coral embryos and larvae into a vessel-based container or hopper with maximal survival rates.<br/>To achieve this objective, the strength of coral embryos and larvae as well as the stressors in a pumping system are investigated. In order to design and optimise the pumping process for survival, it is useful to have a framework that estimates the balance between strength of coral embryos and larvae and stressors. In literature, comparable strength and stress balances are known in, for example, thermal stress onto corals. The cause of failure (or mortality) is a combination between the strength, the exposed stress (or load) for a certain period of time and the capability to regain strength. Failure happens when the strength cannot withstand the stress (or load). These failure effects are also described through threshold limit values (TLV) which indicate a limit that the stresses may not exceed. Examples of such limits are time weighted average, short-term exposure limit and ceiling limit. Within the design of a pumping system, these values are expected to be acute (e.g. in the pump) and chronic stress (e.g. in the pipeline). In order to distinguish between pumping systems, the stressors in the system can be calculated by using tools such as a mathematical model. <br/><br/>The coral life cycle commences with gametes that contain eggs which are fertilised in the slick at the ocean surface, before developing into embryos. Because the buoyancy of coral embryos is positive until 36h following spawning, dispersion is limited. Hence, they are easiest collected within this period of time. The pumping related strength of coral embryos and larvae is therefore investigated in this research. The assumption is made that the strength of the embryos and larvae differ in the first period following spawning. In order to gain insight in the strength limits of coral embryos and larvae within this period, strength tests are executed. During the mass-spawning event in November 2018, fertilised eggs were collected and used in a Couette-rheometer test at the Heron Island Research Station. These tests consist of a cylinder rotating at different speeds in a container filled with water and embryos. Due to the rotation of the cylinder, the coral embryos and larvae experience stress. The living coral embryos are counted before and after each experiment by use of a microscope experiment in order to define the survival rate. After 5-7 hours the embryos have developed a considerable strength (larger than can be applied by the Couette-Rheometer). Therefore, it is recommended to start the collection process after 5-7 hours following spawning. Nevertheless, the tests do not define the exact strength of the embryos. Hence, it is advisable to investigate the exact strength in further research.<br/><br/>To design a pumping system that can pump coral embryos and larvae with low mortality, the stressors in the system should be minimal. The main technical criteria of the pumping system include low shear stresses, low-pressure fluctuations and low flow accelerations. Practical criteria such as availability, scalability and handling should also be considered in the design. A mathematical model was designed to calculate the previously described factors by calculating the magnitude of the stressors in a pumping system. Based on the model, it can be concluded that the pipeline configuration of a coral slick collection system should contain minimum pipe length, maximum diameter, minimal surface to encounter (e.g. bends and connections), low rpm and flow velocities and submerged in- and outflows openings. <br/><br/>Laboratory tests in the Netherlands and field tests in Australia have been executed in order to validate the relation between the strength of coral embryos and larvae and stressors in a pumping system. During laboratory tests, pumping system aspects that contribute most to damage have been investigated, and potential practical issues have been identified. Damage rates were estimated for different pumps and pipeline configurations using different proxies such as, hydrogell balls, peas, berries and fish eggs. From these tests, the Hidrostal and Diaphragm pump resulted in low damage rates and were selected to be applied during the field tests. Additionally, a skimmer (intake) to collect the floating particles was designed and tested, both in the laboratory as well as the field. <br/><br/>The field test has been executed in the Southern Great Barrier Reef around the Heron and Wistari reef. Currently, this part of the reef boasts the highest level of coral cover throughout the entire reef, and is almost at its historical maximum. Therefore, it was chosen as research location because of its expected large supply of coral spawn. The main goal of the field study was to investigate the possibility to pump coral embryos following the mass spawning in November 2018. The experimental setup consisted of a tug vessel with two pumping systems, each with a different pump (i.e. the Hidrostal and Diaphragm pump) and the same configuration. A total of total twelve tanks was used for cultivation of which six plastic and six steel. The total number of living coral embryos that have been pumped was approximately 29 million from which 19% developed into competent larvae within five days. The competent larvae were pumped through the same system to investigate their survival rate, which was around 88%. This indicates that deployment of larvae onto degraded reefs should be possible by pumping without much loss and that coral larvae are less fragile compared to coral embryos. <br/><br/>The objective of this research was to develop a method for designing a pumping system that can pump coral eggs, embryos or larvae, from the sea surface onto a vessel housing an aquaculture facility. By using the previously described criteria, it is concluded that coral embryos and larvae are able to survive pumping related stressors. Further research should aim to find the exact strength of coral embryos after which a more precise model can be created to estimate mortality. Furthermore, limitations for pressure differences should be determined. For now, the assumption is made that for designing a pumping system, atmospheric pressure should be the minimum local pressure which is conservative. Additionally, the controlled deployment of the competent larvae onto degraded reefs should be further investigated because this project was not focused on that phase. To conclude, the project needs up-scaling towards hopper sizes, with a broader range of coral species and various weather conditions. <br/><br/>Given the previous described challenge, this research proofs that it is possible to pump coral embryos, after which they can grow into competent larvae and be deployed onto degraded reefs. Significant quantities of new recruits can be collected at healthy reefs and by using hopper size vessels, the collection of coral embryos from slicks become promising.<br","Coral reefs; Coral-spawn slick pumping; Hidrostal pump","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","RECRUIT","-23.442300, 151.914800"

The Hyperloop system that Musk describes relies on partial vacuum tubes through which vehicles can travel at speeds up to 1000 km/h with great efficiency. An innovative breakthrough in the transportation sector if it can be made into a reality. Therefore his company SpaceX organised a contest to which many teams applied to built a concept vehicle to be used in the tubes. In 2017 a team of students from TU Delft won the overall prize for the best design and afterwards the team leaders founded Hardt to develop their ideas and make Hyperloop into a reality. BAM Infraconsult supports Hardt and together they develop the Hyperloop and its tube infrastructure. Currently the preliminary design for the tubes is made in steel and no alternatives have been considered. This research focusses on an alternative tube design in concrete. The tube has to not only satisfy the strict requirements that apply to the Hyperloop technology in general, but it also has to adhere to the specific design philosophy of the Hardt vehicle concept. A concept in which the vehicle is suspended from tracks on the ceiling of the tube by a series of magnets. The report is based on the following research question: Is a concrete design a feasible alternative for the design of airtight Hyperloop tubes compared to the considered steel tubes? To answer this question two philosophies are considered and researched into depth. Firstly a design in prefabricated normal strength concrete is analysed, making use of prestressing and conventional reinforcement, following the requirements set in the Eurocode. Secondly an innovative ultra high performance steel fibre reinforced concrete (UHPFRC) design is considered. Again prestressing is applied, however conventional reinforcement is not present in this design as it relies on steel fibres and prestressing alone. This design is modelled according to the French UHPFRC guidelines. A requirement for the design is that the inner diameter of the tubes is equal to 3.6 m and that the tubes span 30 m between pylons. The design methodology is based on a variable thickness of the tubes in order to find the optimal concrete structure that satisfies all requirements. Checks are made for multiple failure modes after which the governing minimum thickness is derived. Other than proving to be structurally sound according to the Eurocode, the tube also has to abide to a strict deflection limitation under dynamic loading conditions. In order to research this criterion the tube design is validated using finite element modelling. Here a combination of different parameters related to the concrete material characteristics and the dimensions of the tube is researched by means of a sensitivity analysis. Using the dynamic amplification factor specified by Hardt, the maximum deflections of the tube are checked and the parameters that have the greatest influence on the deflection are discussed. The obtained results are compared to the steel tube. Furthermore the possibilities for the construction of a concrete tube are considered, including a recommendation for the connections between tube sections. Moreover the transportation of the tubes to the building site and final assembly are taken into account. After all factors are considered a cost estimation is made for the design of the concrete tubes and compared to the cost estimation of the initial steel design of the tubes. This cost estimation does not only consider the material and production costs of the tubes, but also takes into account transportation, assembly, maintenance and site costs plus an allowance for risks and profit. It is concluded that a design in normal strength concrete is possible, but not practical. Its dimensions make the production and assembly very difficult. However a design in UHPFRC is feasible, as its required dimensions are considerably better. Furthermore it satisfies all structural requirements without the use of conventional reinforcement and even the strict deflection criterion at dynamic loading conditions can be achieved. Moreover the design in UHPFRC is a competitive alternative to the steel design, as it has a higher score when all criteria are considered.","Hyperloop; Concrete; Tube","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2030-01-01","","","","","",""

A common characteristic is that they are poorly insulated compared to the current Dutch building regulations. This research will focus on post-war walk-up apartments, they account for approximately 8% of the total residential building stock. 70% out of this 8% is social housing. All housing corporations agreed that in 2020 the residential portfolio should have an energy label which is at least B. The refurbishment of post-war walk-up apartments is really needed to achieve this energy label. The 2ndSKIN approach is a prefabricated system for the renovation of walk-up apartments. This approach contains a zero-on-the-meter concept, where building services are integrated into the façade. The 2ndSKIN approach is still too costly and the zero-energy target is only met in specific conditions. To optimize the retrofit of residential buildings different energy systems should be applied. The approach can then be used in different urban contexts, which will result in upscaling the refurbishment of walk-up apartments. <br/>Literature research on several existing renovation approaches and different energy systems has been conducted. Together with the analysis of post-war walk-up apartments, it resulted in four main energy systems. These concepts have been simulated with the software Uniec2.2. The goal of the simulation was to achieve the BENG regulations (Bijna Energie Neutrale Gebouwen [Almost Energy Neutral Buildings]). In order to achieve the BENG regulations, a low and high impact variant have been designed. These variants differ in insulation value and how ventilation is provided. The conclusion of the simulation provided direct input for the design phase. A case-study is used to apply the outcomes of the simulations in detail and to design an approach where it is possible to accommodate different energy systems. <br/>The outcome of this research is a prefabricated renovation approach for post-war walk-up apartments that is applicable to accommodate energy saving measures with different energy systems. Building services are integrated into the façade and different building services units can be placed in the backyard to have different energy systems in the building. With the new building services and the increased insulation value of the building envelope, it is possible to fulfil the BENG regulations with a post-war walk-up apartment building. Except for one concept, all other concepts are even zero-energy. <br/>The different energy concepts and variants for the building envelope have been included in a decision-making diagram. With this diagram, housing corporations or homeowners associations can choose between the different concepts, based on three different goals. Also, some considerations concerning the choice between the low and high impact for the building envelope are made. <br","Refurbishment; Energy Systems; Prefabricated; Post-war walk-up apartments; Building services; Building envelope","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","",""

The Yugoslav wars from 1991-1996 still linger in Mostar today, as we find a ‘divided city’, which is mostly enforced through institutions that ethnically divide public buildings. At the same time, citizens find this unnecessary and consider Mostar as ‘one’, as they move all over the city. Fountains in public places, particularly the ones with drinking water, used to be a major inclusive quality as a common good that were able to be used by anyone. Currently these are left neglected from a lack of responsibility to take care of these. Using these places as a spatial method to analyze the city, their inclusive qualities are utilized into creating an inclusive place where people can encounter each other, exchange and share knowledge, collaborate and essentially can reclaim public space. 'Inclusive' in this project refers to accessibility and a sense of ownership, where people are able to add a piece of themselves in the program. An existing ruin that used to be a popular department store called Razvitak, resides between two popular streets and through that holds potential to connect a new inclusive place to an existing social tissue. Razvitak plays the role to be unlocked as a common resource, in order to counteract divisional narratives and reconnect the city socially(and aquatically). The project gives this ruin its third life as a social centre, where the inclusivity is shaped through an experience from public to private, encountering different intimacies along the way that shape diverse spaces of encounter, to which the programme relates, while making use of the structure’s existing qualities.","Public space; community; reclaim; social space; ruin","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","Neretva Recollection: Materiality of War, Flowing Memories and Living Archive",""

A rapid change of a city from urbanization and over-growing population have somehow eradicated the traditional way of living. One of the best examples is in Ho Chi Minh City, in the South of Vietnam. The city is located in the prime location of the Saigon Delta, and it is the biggest city in Vietnam. Within the last 30 years, the population rose from 4 million people to 10 million people. This led to severe environmental problems and housing shortage. Consequently, local people began to settle their houses illegally along the canal to live with the water as their traditional way of living. This so-called informal settlement has expanded all over the water structure of the city, and they are continuing to grow. The current situation has triggered me to explore the potential of landscape architecture to create design interventions to redefine the zone of informal settlement as an opportunity for Ho Chi Minh City and the environment to ‘breathe.’<br/><br/>The test site has been chosen in the area with the highest density of informal houses in Doi-Te Canal. The design strategies are composed of four layers which are Collect, Purify, Connect and Adapt. The first two layers are contributed to waste management and water purification. The floating waste on canal surface is captured and separated before transferred to the Biogas station which will be transformed into biogas for community cooking purposes. All of these procedures involved the design intervention which is operated by the community. At the same time, the polluted water is diverted to the purification park, it is directly delivered to 10 different biological ponds before released back to the canal. The third layer referred to the social aspect; the two sides of the canal are linked by the proposed pedestrian routes. The different experiences along the routes together with design interventions created interaction between a diverse group of people and brought the social space back to the Canalside. Lastly, the design also concerned about the adaptable ability to tackle with the unexpected future in the “Adapt” layer. The entire area has been studied to find the possible sponge surfaces to hold the water in case of excessive water. Furthermore, the zone of informal settlements also proposed to function as a low dike to protect the urban district come flooded. <br/><br/>Through the process of research by design, the zone of informal settlement is being redefined and integrated into the city. The project has revived the existing landscape and enhance the entire area into a living system which is not only created a better environment but also offered a better quality of life to community and Ho Chi Minh City inhabitants. Most importantly, the intangible quality as the culture of “life with water” is being represented and preserved for the future generation.<br/><br/><br","Landscape architecture; Informal Settlement; Resilience; Adaptive design; Urban Acupuncture; Vietnam; Delta city","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Landscape Architecture","","10.73628, 106.64517"

Geophysical tools have potential to improve these investigations, on the ground that they can detect shallow buried objects in a non-invasive way. This report studies the use of electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) in combination with ground penetrating radar (GPR) to detect buried objects at two different sites, both with conditions found here in The Netherlands. The first is a test site at the Technical University of Delft, The Netherlands. Here, two plastic barrels are buried, one is empty and the other is filled with metal rods. The second site is at the ARISTA Facility in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. Here, human cadavers are buried for forensic research. The ERT was used in two ways, the first was to produce 2 dimensional (2D) surveys, which were combined to create a 3 dimensional (3D) model. The second method made measurements that created a 3D model directly. For each the dipole-dipole array was used. At the TU Delft site the results for the 2D method showed clear resistivity anomalies at the locations of the barrels. These anomalies corresponded to clear reflections in the GPR radargrams. The results at the ARISTA facility are inconclusive due to damage in the instrument used. The grid designs made for both ERT methods could however be used in a continuation of this study, and future research should be done within this topic to improve forensic investigations.","","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Earth Sciences","",""

This project proposes a new interplay between pre- and inner-alpine areas by giving particular consideration to the natural environment. It seeks to coordinate the use for water as a resource under the framework of institutional thickness. Thereby it explores national planning cultures, existing cooperation programmes and the added value of a macro-regional strategy for the integral management of hydraulic resources in the alpine context.

This type of war dominated the late twentieth century, leaving many cities vulnerable. According to J. Calame and E. Chalesworth(2009) in Divided Cities: Belfast, Beirut, Jerusalem, Mostar, and Nicosia, since World War II there has been a marked shift in global warfare trends from inter - to intrastate conflict: of 64 wars between 1945 and 1988, 59 were intrastate or “civil” wars, and about 80 percent of those who perished were killed by someone of their own nationality. Mostar can be added as one more case some years later. Because of the division these cities hypofunction spatially and socially. In the case of Mostar, Neretva River is used in the frame of the politics of division, providing mental and physical spaces of shame. More specifically, it forwards a surface common memory, as supposed effort of reconciliation of the past with scattered stones, calling them monuments, around the city, leaving the core of its identity, the river, as an abandoned area. In order for the city to start functioning social normally again, it’s necessary to be created a common space of history, which will produce common memories for the future generations. The thesis tries to give a new insight on how to deal with a landscape where ordinary pleasant memories replaced with memories of terror (Neretva), responding to the need of the city for a new memorial architecture. Even though, it addresses a specific area (Neretva), could be influence for many other cities which suffer from post-traumatic events, since it will propose a memorial, not as a spot but, as a system, taking into account the complexity of social, historical, religion, economical, morphological parameters. The new memorial scape in Mostar will not represent a reason for being sad but rather a way to look and hope for the future, becoming with the river a symbol of the city. It is designed as part of the history, being a powerful reminder of society and how citizens of Mostar should stand together in the face of the tragedy of the war. It redefines the relationships between the local community helping the future generations to understand a bit of their history as well. The memorial scape tries to become a part of the Mostar culture, being based on the powerful connection between man and nature. The idea is not only to create a space that stands as a symbol of memory but also to allow people the opportunity to relax and enjoy a new green space. It is just as important for the memorial scape to serve the collective memory as it was to have a high functionality level, providing residents of the area with a new space to enjoy the open outdoors.","trauma; Mostarry; landscape; Neretva; Mostar","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Landscape Architecture","Neretva Recollection: Materiality of War, Flowing Memories and Living Archive",""

For instance, storm surges, sea-level rise, and droughts have all resulted in many regions left with critical systems and interdependencies exposed. The impact and risk of modern disasters have caused substantial adverse socio-economic impacts by damaging and disrupting infrastructure services that modern societies have become heavily reliant upon. Long-lasting disruptions can result in complete losses of essential services such as water, energy supplies, transportation and community networks. <br/><br/>The frequency of these extremities should now be considered as the new norm. Critical infrastructures play a crucial role in supporting society, and if major systems were to fail by a sudden shock, a ripple effect would be felt. A single failure in the system can easily cascade across a network of critical infrastructure (CI) that would render otherwise unaffected sectors inoperable. Presently, there are a myriad of issues in the UK governmental system, as there is little action being done to ensure service continuity and security of supply. Nor is there an agency that has an overall responsibility for defense against system failure. <br/><br/>Within the UK government, a long-term capital program has been launched to provide greater certainty and efficient planning in response to water defense infrastructure. However, the current model has no clear long-term objective for the level of flood resilience that the government is seeking to achieve. Although it will be impossible to prevent all types of flooding, the current planning system is too piecemeal, reactive and disjointed. Thus, this translates to the main research question: how to develop dynamic and adaptable strategies for vulnerable critical systems to address deep uncertainty and flood risk for the Thames Estuary Region?<br/><br/>The thesis aims to address several key elements:<br/>•To develop a methodology and framework to understand how to assess and develop resilient critical infrastructure and services.<br/>•Translating a spatial contingency plan while improving safety and living standards.<br/>•To develop a set of propositions based on research-by-design with insight on up-scaling or replicability of the project.<br/><br/>The design interventions have the intent to increase safety parameters that encourages a faster response and recovery time while improving livability. However, the pitfall of designing without considering an extreme option of how we plan or develop cities can result in more risks compounding in the future. Economic hubs like London will continue to grow dependent on critical infrastructure and this will continue to stress the existing system. Not only will this remain to put pressure on the floodplain, but it will also create higher forms of exposure and risk. The concluding propositions involves a series of safety parameters, states of isolation, a trans-scalar feedback loop and the creation of emergency backbone services.

It is crucial that critical infrastructure systems should continue to grow, learn and adapt as time persists.<br","critical infrastructure; risk management; deep uncertainty; Adaptive design; contingency planning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","","51.5000, 0.5833"

Therefore, a lot of (high)speed train stations have been analyzed as well as international oriented transfer hubs, such as airports and terminals. Due to the position taken in the first stage of the design process, also significant research has been done in the way mother nature designs its structures, for example, the honeycomb, animal skins, cracks in stone, merging of bubbles, structure of snowflakes, and so one. Therefore, research and design had a close relationship between each other during the process. A lot of design decisions have been made by looking closely in to the research done during the past months, somewhat like the definition of research/evidence based design. Objectivity is an essential point to be able to state that a design can be used purely for research purposes. In practice, however, this rarely applies, certainly in architecture due to the fact that also my own approach is mainly evidence based design true the scope of the analysis of relevant reference case studies. The fact that this form of design research in no way describes what the absolute scientific reality is, corresponds with the position of the design studio project, which is about designing a masterplan for the year 2100. This naturally involves a lot of hypothetical questions and assumptions, where it is usually difficult to provide a substantiated argumentation reflecting your knowledge gained by research, but this is exactly why the focus of the studio is primarily on doing thorough research as much as possible. In addition, many impulsive or intuitive decisions were taken as expected, only the research done was mainly focusing on finding a narrative and a style in which to design a future mobility hub. A surprising observation is that there is a strong correlation between the process of research and design. Many elements from the case studies of other existing train stations and infrastructural nodes, therefore, arise almost simultaneously, between research and design. A fruitful interaction between the relatively 'objective' research and the more 'subjective' design process. Research based and evidence based design are research methodologies that can significantly influence design decisions in de whole process. In the Complex Projects studio, most people approach the problems and research questions in a very analytical and data driven way. This elaborates the fact that everyone has to thoroughly analyze, investigate and argue every aspect of the researched area and come up with lots of diagrams and data based drawings. So, one could say that evidence based designing, as it is for me, is more uncomplicated and optimal for this type of studio.","Hyperloop; Station; Interchange; Public transport; Infrastructural innovation; Nodes; hexagonal; Honeycomb structure","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Complex Projects","Complex Projects, AMS Mid City","52.2982293, 4.9599438"

(mentor); Molenaar, W.F. (mentor); van Koningsveld, M. (graduation committee); Booij, M.C. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","Summary<br/>In the twentieth century a substantial number of navigation locks were build in the Netherlands. The navigation locks built in that era mostly had a life span of 80 to 100 years. This means that in the coming years most of these locks will be in need of either renovation or replacement. Rijkswaterstaat, the administrator of most of the locks in the Netherlands, is likely to put out tenders for the renovation and replacement of these locks. Companies can subsequently submit a proposal for design and/or construction. This proposal includes a preliminary design of the lock. During this phase of the design multiple possible alternatives will be reviewed to check which of those satisfy the design requirements and how they will be implemented. The time available to create a proposal is limited and the preliminary design phase is time consuming due to the numerous design alternatives available. Therefore, several alternatives are often not elaborated, which already leads to converging in the design process in an early phase. When the time needed to create a design of the alternatives can be reduced, the converging can be postponed to the detailed design and more attention can be paid to out-of-the-box thinking during preliminary design. This time saving can be accomplished by the use of automation and parametric design. With parametric design all the possible alternatives can be calculated in a given range of parameters. After comparison of these generated alternatives a well-educated choice can be made for the direction in preliminary design. This research aims to optimize preliminary lock design in the tendering phase by creating a design-tool that automatically generates all plausible alternatives based on the Design Criteria and boundary conditions of the client. <br/>Eventually, the complete preliminary lock design can be accomplished with a parametric design tool. However, an advantage of a design tool is that it can be composed of different building blocks which all design a specific part of the navigation lock. The basis of the parametric design tool should be a relevant part of the lock when looking at the total costs of this part, the design costs, the variety of options and the relation with other parts. The lock chamber is chosen as a starting point for the design tool. The lock chamber, like the lock head and the mechanics, has high investment costs and a high percentage of design costs. The lock chamber however, is in contrast to the other parts of the lock, not heavily dependent on other components. This makes it an interesting component to make a parametric design tool out of. <br/>The parametric model, that has been developed as a part of this thesis, includes the commonly used chamber types for inland navigation locks. These common types are retaining wall structures with an under water concrete floor including sheet pile, combi and diaphragm walls, and a U-basin structure, which can be constructed in an open building pit or in a temporary retaining wall building pit. <br/>When the design tool is finished, research is conducted on the behaviour of the alternatives in different circumstances. The effects of the main design criteria are examined. These include the length of the chamber, width, depth, water drop and local soil profile. These values are mostly depended on the vessels that need to be accommodated and the local circumstances. Next to that, the impact of different construction methods, the use of materials and the variation in unit prices are elaborated. <br/>In this thesis the second Juliana lock near Gouda is used as reference case. For this case it has been found that a sheet pile wall structure is economically most attractive, followed by the U-basin with an open building pit, a diaphragm wall structure and least feasible a U-basin structure with a retaining wall building pit. It is concluded that the length of the lock does hardly impact the design of the alternatives. The width of the chamber does influence the dimensions of the structure. The floor has to be stronger for larger widths and, because of this, the diaphragm wall structure will become more attractive compared to the U-basin structures. The depth and water drop mainly impacts the dimensions of the walls. This, combined with the increased soil handling with open building pits, leads to decreasing interest in U-basin structures. When looking at the construction methods and materials, it can be noted that the length of the tension piles is especially important for the pile plan and the floor. The concrete strength for the U-basins is of importance, while the under water concrete strength and the casting method hardly influence the total costs. <br/>When looking at environmental impact, the alternative with the least material use is most attractive, the sheet pile wall structure followed, by the diaphragm wall structure. The type of material does heavily influence the environmental impact. The U-basin structures have more environmental impact due to the construction of a larger temporary building pit. The environmental impact consists of three main components, the used materials, transport of these materials and the processes for the construction of the lock. For the U-basin structures the last two components have a large impact, while for the retaining wall structures the materials used have a large footprint. <br/>The proposed CO2 taxes of € 0,05 an €0,20 per kg CO2 equivalent will lead to an average cost increase of respectively 4,5% and 16.5%. The impact per alternative differs, but does not influence the order of economical feasibility. As from a CO2 tax of € 0,68 per kg CO2 equivalent the diaphragm wall structure will become financially more attractive compared to the U-basin structure with open building pit. <br/>Despite the calculated strengths and costs, each structure has its own advantages, disadvantages and limitations in construction, final use and maintenance. Special attention should be paid to these properties, since certain construction methods may be excluded by design requirements and uncertainties can lead to high risk. Further research could focus on steel sheet or combi piles constructed in bentonite excavations, resolving the limitations of vibrations during sheet pile construction and the uncertainties of diaphragm walls.","thesis; Locks; Naviagtion lock; Sluice; Design; Lock Chamber; Automation; Parametric Design; Tool","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","",""

These efforts have reduced the number of road accidents significantly over the past years, yet it was observed that the number of rear-end crashes have not decreased but has rather maintained its proportion which is about 1/3rd of all road accidents. An evasive maneuver, a limit-handling situation, involves quick steering or braking action to avoid colliding with the vehicle in-front (thus avoiding a rear-end crash). A normal human driver is not trained to drive and control car in such demanding and high stress inducing task. This warrants the needs of an autonomous controller design that can itself take over the control of car and perform the maneuver successfully. The aim of this research was to verify this statement by designing a novel control scheme that can steer and brake simultaneously ensuring collision avoidance and passenger safety at all times.

To contribute to the reduction of global warming, The Netherlands signed the Paris Agreement on 12-12-2015, which dictates that in 2030, a reduction of 55% in CO¬2 emissions compared to 1990 must be achieved (P. Boot et al., 2016; Sociaal-Economische Raad, 2013). To meet these goals, several Dutch regions started their Regional Energy Strategy (RES) formulation process in 2016. A RES is a collaboration of private and public parties that strives to effectively balance energy supply and demand within the regional boundaries by focussing on sustainable energy generation, energy savings and the benefits from economies of scale (Schuurs &amp; Schwencke, 2017). Going through such a process with the relevant stakeholders will ultimately result in new regional policy in the field of energy. The ‘Metropolitan region Rotterdam The Hague’ (MRDH) is one of the 30 regions of the Netherlands. Its diverse economic activity, great variety in municipality sizes and key economic and infrastructural players such as the Port of Rotterdam and Greenport West-Holland contribute to the region’s complexity. The MRDH started the RES formulation process in February 2018 and endeavours to deliver the outcome in July 2019. The owners of this process are its 23 municipalities, its waterboards and the province of South-Holland. <br/>Knowledge gap. In the field of process management, several core values exist which play a role in each process, such as trust, openness, progress, and content. Scientific literature does not express the weight of these values, as these depend on the process’ context. Additionally, it is unclear how a high level of complexity impacts the process architecture and potential process interventions. In the field of regional governance very limited scientific literature is available. That in itself is remarkable, as the process approach is growing steadily (Boogers, Klok, Denters, &amp; Sanders, 2016). Regional governance –a governance level in between the municipal and provincial level– is controversial. The scientific debate focuses on several aspects. First, regional governance would lead to administrative chaos and complexity. Second, regional governance could lead to the hollowing out of local governance, thereby reducing the democratic quality. Lastly, the question is what organisational form of regional governance can best be employed; is it monocentric, a concentration of regional governance in one authority, or polycentric, a fragmented system of collaborative arrangements into which independent municipalities are free to enter?<br/>Central research question. The process’ stakeholders have different perceptions of the RES assignment. These ‘different assignment perceptions’ are caused by the abstractness of the assignment, and the fact that the original assignment has been changed by the influences of the interim reports of the Climate Agreement. The Climate Agreement is a national treaty that mainly aims at the reduction of CO2 emissions in the Netherlands. The fact that the stakeholders perceive the assignment differently leads to several problems in the formulation process. Some of these problems even form a severe threat to the core values of process management. To solve these problems, the process managers perform a variety of process interventions to align the perceptions of the stakeholders.The main research question is: ‘How are problems resulting from stakeholders’ different perceptions of the assignment ‘Energiestrategie regio Rotterdam Den Haag’ addressed by the use of process management?Research design and methods. This study applies the case study method on the MRDH region. To answer the research questions, both qualitative and quantitative methods are used. First, an examination is made of what the leading assignment for the RES MRDH is and how it has been influenced by the Climate Agreement. Second, the assignment perceptions of the owners are examined through 26 stakeholder interviews. The parties that published the RES assignment (i.e., IPO, VNG, UvW and the Ministry of Internal Affairs) are interviewed on their perception as well. These data are analysed using the qualitative data software ‘ATLAS TI’. Through a workshop with the process managers it is determined how the different assignment perceptions impact on the process. Utilising an influence tree, the consequences of these different assignment perceptions are visualised. It has turned out that real problems that actually occurred in the process could be linked to the consequences. Next, the process coordinator has been interviewed several times to analyse the context and the performed process interventions of these problems through a lens of process management. The last part describes the currently relevant problems that still need process intervention(s). For one problem, a ‘solution-panel’ has been gathered, consisting of several experts, to find suitable process interventions. <br/>Results. The findings show that the interim deliverables of the Climate Agreement demand a higher level of detail of the RES outcome. The interviews indicate that the majority of the owners share the following image: ‘The RES is a municipal and regional plan that is based on facts and figures, intended to work towards a future energy system in pursuit of the regional or national climate objectives’ (Section 5.5.1, Figure 7). The assignment perception of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the umbrella organisations comes down to: ‘The RES is a masterplan which combines multiple perspectives. Eventually, these different dimensions must be merged and realised in the municipalities’ spatial environment’ (Section 5.7). Concerning process management, the process architect and coordinator have chosen to implement two foundations for a robust process course. These provide solidity, controllability and should prevent problems. Nevertheless, ten problems have been identified as a result of different assignment perceptions. Six of them have been resolved by conducting municipal consultations and the extension of the process lead time. These process interventions have been performed to secure an adequate involvement of the municipalities’ official organisation to the RES formulation process. Another process intervention included the reframing of the RES to meet the expectations of specific stakeholders. Next, to stimulate the spatial integration of the assignment, the spatial area civil servants were invited for the workshops during the spring of 2019. Lastly, bilateral meetings were held between the process coordinator and the aldermen of the municipalities to clarify points of view and to adjust the aldermen their attitude in the RES process. To solve the problem of ‘the national RES assignment demands for concrete top-down objectives while the RES needs bottom-up collaboration’, the solution panel has suggested that process management can be employed for creating a safe environment in the pursuit of ‘shared ownership’ of the assignment.<br/>Discussion. An interpretation of the applied process management is that the high complexity of the region has led to a wide range of assignment perceptions which in turn needed comprehensive process architecture and several process interventions. Besides, the process managers value the core values of process management of De Bruijn, Ten Heuvelhof, &amp; In ’T Veld (2010) depending upon the process agreements and the agreed level of ambition. Also, the results led to the assumption that the core value ‘progress’ forms a trade-off with ‘content’. Concerning regional governance; ‘administrative chaos and complexity’ carries a negative emotional charge. The popular thought is that administrative chaos and complexity causes reduced democratic legitimacy, less trust due to the multitude of partners, and poor effectiveness. These are incorrect by fact. Therefore, the researcher opts for new terminology: ‘administrative intensification’. The results of the democratic quality of the RES can be interpreted as excellent, as only two of the 23 municipalities have no (or partial) influence on the RES formulation process. In fact, these two municipalities were not represented as they had internal problems. Based on this result, the findings of Boogers et al. (2016) –indicating that around 90% of the alderman having an effective influence on regional decision-making– can be confirmed. Further research. Regarding process management, further research should examine the RES formulation processes of the other Dutch regions to discover how the core values of process management have been applied, and whether relations between the process context and the core values exist. In the field of regional governance, further research should investigate how this ‘new renewable energy implementation challenge’ can be poured into the current multi-layer governance system while preserving democratic legitimacy. Furthermore, when regional governance structures resulting from the RES process have been set up, further research should be undertaken to investigate the effectiveness of the collaborations in such structure.","Process Management; Energy transition; Regional Governance","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-07-03","","","","","",""

From the analysis it follows that taking dependencies into account can have varying effects for different methods. It turns out that a straight-forward implementation makes the method often practically unusable. The sampling of model evaluation points becomes too computer expensive. The amount of copula evaluations is growing exponentially with the dimension and for copulas without an analytic expression these are already lengthy. The computational intensity can be reduced in two ways. First, one can approximate the probabilities. Different ways of approximating the probabilities are researched. Numerically integrating with the midpoint rule seems to be the best way of approximating the probabilities in the copula-based Morris method. Next to approximating the probabilities, one can also use the independent groups when implementing the method. When the input parameters are correlated there are usually a few groups of correlated parameters rather than that all the parameters are correlated with each other. This can be utilized to more efficiently implement the copula-based Morris method. When the group sizes are not increasing the computational intensity depends linearly instead of exponentially on the number of model parameters. By using both improvements the method can generally be applied to tens or hundreds of parameters in reasonable time, which is desired for a screening method.","Sensitivity Analysis; Morris method; copula","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics","",""

This study addresses the effects and efficiency of coral restoration in four steps. First, a simple reef hydrodynamic model is formulated to identify important drivers of runup at a reef fronted beach, to be used as a quick scan tool before using more intensive process-based models. Next, 30.000 US reef profiles are classified to gain insight into the prevalence of different reef shapes. Four dominant reef profiles are then used in the subsequent modeling step, in which the hydrodynamics and flood vulnerability of different reef shapes are investigated using the XBeach process-based model. With the knowledge gained, the hydrodynamic effects and runup reduction potential of different restoration configurations at various reef morphologies can be assessed.","Coral reef coastlines; Reef Restoration; Reef hydrodynamics; Wave runup; Runup reduction; Clustering; XBeach","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

Through their superimposition they react to the present surroundings, affect and change them, therefore become active components of the setting. In order for the architect to design an edifice that responds to its locale and creates a pleasant user experience, one must learn how to extract knowledge not only from the present context, but from as many practices as possible. Design and research are interdependent practices that cannot be separated by hard borderlines within the field of architecture. They complement and inform each other on the way towards a humanitarian built environment that successfully responds to the needs of its users. Just as the traditional notions of science and art do not exist in detachment, since even in the scientific context every new, not yet proven theory or paradigm is a product of a creative process [2], in architecture design is the tool which asks the right questions while research provides with the right answers.","Design Proposal; Public Building; Hybrid Building","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","","50.079104, 14.440997"

While increasingly there are efforts being made globally to spread awareness about the impact of human activities on the natural environment, the talks on the direct impact of the change on the human are still nascent. There are an increasing number of people who are losing their land, livelihoods and basic access to food and potable water due to the adverse effects of climate change. In an attempt to survive these people have no option but to seek sanctuary in nearby settlements (Myers, 1997). A rough prediction of 200 million climate induced migrants by the end of the century has brought this issue to the forefront and is being termed as the ‘human face of climate change’ (Myers, 1997). Caught in a ‘negative vulnerability cycle’ (illustrated in Figure 1) the displaced population lacks visibility, recognition and even a basic definitive category which makes it impossible for them to seek refuge or get national or international aid. Their migration is usually termed as ‘economic’ in nature and classified as an act of desire rather than survival. This research aims to establish this definitive category through a review of scientific literature. Further it highlights the social, economic and spatial injustice faced by the environmentally displaced people and investigates the role of spatial planning, strategy and good governance as a tool to address the issue. Using methodologies like case studies, field trip, deductive mapping, data and comparative policy analysis, the research presents a strategic framework to socio-spatially and economically accommodate the EDP’s. The strategy uses the ongoing and future migration for the socio-economic benefit of the sending and receiving regions. It aims to generate a sustainable livelihood pattern for the affected to enhance their climate-resilience as well as trigger their growth. It presents migration as an adaptive strategy for the affected population and focuses on community-based initiatives and self-organisation as central concepts. The research constructs and tests this framework in the context of the cross-border region of the Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta (GBD). Being the largest and one of the most densely populated deltas in the world, it has been experiencing the impact of climate induced migration for decades. Further, the displacement of 40 million people by 2050, has been estimated.","Circular Climate Migration; Regional Development; Delta Regions; urban-rural relation; Secondary urbanisation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Urbanism","Complex Cities","21.949700, 89.183300"

While being mostly produced as flat sheets of float glass, it can also be casted into components that have a thicker geometry and thus a higher buckling resistance. These properties make cast glass components suitable for the construction of shell structures that are mainly subjected to compressive stresses. Shell structures often have the shape of surfaces with varying Gaussian curvature. When constructing such a shell structure out of cast glass components, components of varying geometries are needed. During this research, an adjustable mould was developed that can be used for the casting of glass voussoirs of varying geometries. The possible voussoirs geometries that can be cast in the adjustable mould are limited to voussoirs with planar, convex polygonal intrados and extrados. These voussoirs can be used to construct fully transparent shell structures. The voussoirs are dry-assembled with an interlayer in between that compensates for any production tolerances and avoids glass to glass contact. Furthermore, by using dry-assembly instead of an adhesive as a bonding method, the structure allows for disassembly and full recyclability. Tongue and groove shaped interfaces ensure an interlocking connection. The interlocking connection prevents any lateral movement and will guide the voussoir into the right position during assembly. By tessellating a shell structure, the shell structure is divided into a discrete number of voussoirs that can be cast in the adjustable mould. Several aspects have to be taken into account when optimizing the tessellation pattern including planarity, alignment to the flow of forces, face size, interior angle size and if the pattern is staggered or not. A comparison was made between three different regular tessellation patterns (triangular, quadrangular and hexagonal) with these aspects kept in mind. A shell structure was designed to cover a courtyard of the Armamentarium in Delft. This shell structure served as a case study used to demonstrate the design and production process developed for this thesis. The shape of the shell was generated through a form finding process and its structural performance was validated with a FEM analysis. The shell was tessellated into a triangular tessellation. An algorithm used for assigning either tongues or grooves to the interfaces of each voussoir was developed. A list was generated containing the following information for each voussoir: voussoir index number, interface types, edge lengths, voussoir joining angles and the adjacent voussoir index numbers. The data in this list serves as input data for the set-up of the adjustable mould. Furthermore, the connection between the shell structure and the existing structure was designed and an assembly method was developed.","Glass; Cast glass; Shell structures; Adjustable mould; Adjustable mold; Casting; Voussoir; Dry assembly; Tesselation; Tongue and groove","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Building Technology","","52.006578, 4.360412"

A circular economy has emerged as a model that is restorative by design, and a response towards the high material and energy intensive linear model. However, a transition to a circular built environment implies a radical change in design and construction. Remanufacturing is one of the three product life extension strategies located in the technical cycles from the circular economy. It is an alternative to demolition, and it allows products to be longer in use, with a constant upgrade. However, for products to be remanufactured, they have to be designed according to certain guidelines, and supported by the application of circular business models.<br/>Kawneer, an American manufacturer of aluminium architectural systems and products, seeks to optimize façade systems to meet the demand for circular building products. This means that the components of the systems should be designed with product properties such as disassembly, modularity, and flexibility, which allows them to be circular. Different (re)life options, such as reuse, remanufacturing, and refurbishment, should also be taken into account from the early design stages. The RT82HI+ window system is one of the most competent products manufactured by Kawneer. However, the only (re)life option currently available is recycling. Therefore, the product is currently unable to meet the requirements of a circular building product.<br/>Objective<br/>The objective of the presented research is to evaluate the performance of the existing façade components of the RT82HI+ window system in a circular economy, and according to such, redesign towards remanufacturing and other product-life extension strategies.<br/>This is done, first, through the understanding of the relationship and dependency among the product design, development, and product-life extension, especially remanufacturing. Secondly, through an analysis of the current lifecycle scenarios of the existing components, and identification of their challenges and potentials in a circular economy. And third, through the elaboration of three different circular window systems that react upon the main findings from the analysis.<br/>Main Findings<br/>Three different designs are explored. The first one is an optimization of the existing RT 82 HI +, where only the critical aspects are redesigned. The second and third are hybrid variants that combine aluminum with wood polymer composite pro les (WPC).

Additionally, different remanufacturing, reuse, and adaptability scenarios are analyses to understand the performance of the window system in a circular economy.<br/>On the other hand, four main different types of façade systems and construction are reviewed to understand the type of attachment of the window to the construction. This resulted in a critical point because it could affect the performance of the window in terms of circularity.<br/>The results indicated improvements in different aspects. The key one was ease of assembly and disassembly, but also in terms of type of connections, and geometry of product edges. Furthermore, it is discussed how the loop is closed, and the importance of the different stakeholders involved in the façade manufacturing and construction area.","circular façades; remanufacturing; DfRem; design for remanufacturing; design for disassembly; design for adaptability; circular economy; circular built environment; kawneer nederland; window systems; wood polymer composites; aluminium","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The buildings in this area were not designed for these unexpected earthquake loads and have shown to be vulnerable. However, current strengthening measures are considered to be time-consuming, expensive, and a great hindrance to the residents. Consequently, the question rises whether unconventional strengthening measures can offer relatively simple and quick-to-implement alternatives. This thesis researches if replacing existing windows by structural windows could provide an effective strengthening alternative. The structural window design aims to increase the in-plane seismic force capacity of an existing masonry structure by utilising the glass pane as a structural element. The structural window is designed to be composed of a timber frame, a semi-rigid adhesive, and a double glazing unit. The structural layer of the double glazing unit has a thickness of 20mm and is composed of two laminated annealed glass panes with equal thickness. <br/><br/>The potential of the structural window is investigated in various numerical studies, using DIANA FEA 10.2. The numerical studies are split into validation studies and seismic strengthening predictions. In the validation studies, results from numerical models are compared to and validated against experimental results reported in literature. Subsequently, the potential of the structural window is assessed by seismic strengthening predictions that combine and extrapolate the validation studies. A mass proportional one-directional monotonic pushover loading scheme is adopted. The seismic strengthening predictions address masonry walls and one type of terraced house (Dutch: “Rijtjeshuis"") with two rigid floors, masonry spandrels, and two large windows in the front façade wall. <br/><br/>The numerical strengthening predictions of the masonry walls and the terraced house indicate that a structural window improves the in-plane seismic performance significantly. It is found that strengthening not only greatly increases the seismic force capacity, but also reduces the expected damage. For example, the strengthened terraced house with openable window sections reaches 205% of the seismic force capacity of the unstrengthened terraced house. Furthermore, it is found that the stress levels in the glass pane are expected to remain well below the stress levels at the onset of glass cracking. The numerical strengthening predictions are promising. Therefore, it is recommended to validate these numerical predictions with an experimental testing campaign.","Groningen earthquakes; Terraced house; Unreinforced masonry structures; in-plane strengthening; timber-glass composite wall; structural window design; structural adhesive; Structural glass; Numerical modelling; Pushover analysis; monotonic load; seismic performance; Damage Limitation; Near Collapse","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Building Engineering","",""

As they have more freedom in shapes and can therefore be designed with a large cross-section, it is more suitable as a<br/>structural element than fl oat glass. However, most cast glass structures that have been completed suffered from compromised transparency, or could not be recycled, and required meticulous construction. This is caused by the building system, that requires adhesive bonding of the elements, or a metal substructure.<br/>These issues can be resolved by the use of interlocking geometries, where the glass components are designed to directly provide structural stability, and the structure can be disassembled. This allows re-using the glass. This thesis investigates the design of an interlocking structure and compares this with an adhesively bonded structure in terms of its structural behaviour and assembly. To this end, a brick geometry for an irregular curved surface is designed, different connector shapes for the interlocking elements are evaluated based on their ability to withstand lateral forces, found through experimental testing. Furthermore, the interlayer between different brick layers is chosen based on literature review, a building system is designed and its structural behaviour is validated. It is found that interlocking structures have a lower stiffness than adhesively bonded structures. But because of the lower stiffness, it has a higher flexibility. In case of an impact, it has the tendency to move back in its original location when the impact force is removed and gives a warning before it fails where an adhesively bonded structure would suddenly break.

After conducting 1D and 2DH wave simulations, a distinction is made in three types of tsunami waves; a non-breaking front (surging), a breaking front (plunging) and an undular bore breaking front (spilling). Tsunami waves transform into these three wave types for a steep continental shelf, an intermediate sloped continental shelf, and a gentle sloped continental shelf respectively. A new tsunami breaker parameter (xi_tsunami) is proposed to predict the type of wave at the coastline in a quantitative way. <br","Tsunami; Breaker parameter; Undular bores; Surging; Classification; Continental shelf; Bay geometry","en","master thesis","","","","","","This is a report of a master thesis, where a draft version of a publication is combined with the final report as an appendix.","","2020-06-26","","","","","",""

It offers a great freedom of shape for designers and engineers, beyond the two-dimensional float glass that is still primarily used. Despite this, cast glass in practice has only been used for solid bricks, mimicking traditional ceramic brickwork. Little exploration has been made on the complex shapes that can be achieved in cast glass. One of the largest challenges of cast glass is its slow and meticulous cooling process required after casting, to prevent the occurrence of internal stresses. This costly annealing process is the main limitations for producing large scale cast glass elements in an affordable way. Experience in large scale solid glass mirror castings performed for NASA show that annealing times can be reduced through smart design. <br/>Structural topology optimisation is a design tool for creating light-weight, material efficient elements. Its application has mostly been limited to industrial and aerospace design, though it is slowly being introduced in the built environment as the additive manufacturing required for these geometries becomes more advanced, and affordable. So far, topology optimisation of cast glass design has remained unexplored. The goal of this thesis is to investigate the potential of using topology optimisation as a design tool for complex structural cast-glass elements with a reduced annealing time. For this, a complex-shaped grid shell has been redesigned in glass, using optimised cast glass nodes. The entire fabrication process, from digital design, to physical fabrication using additive manufacturing has been explored.","cast glass; topology optimization; Topology Optimisation; Shell Structures; Generative Design; structural optimization; Glass structures","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Building Technology","",""

This old defense/retaining wall is in itself a colossal architectural structure. It forms an enormous boundary as it was made to defend and close off the city. Now the city has outgrown its walls and does not need them for defence anymore. Devoid of its original purpose the wall is now a mostly underused structure. While in horizontal direction it functions as a road the vertical direction has barely been touch and just forms a barrier now. It is in this place the old city, fast traffic(Sopraelevata) and the big works of the port lie very close together yet there is no relationship between them. The height difference of the wall and the elevation of the Sopraelevata function as borders in a city where height differences and elevations usually are exploited to the fullest. The port itself functions also as a border, but of a different kind, because of customs the port needs an administrative border. However, they maintain this border throughout the whole port but exceptions can be seen, the Fiera for instance, an exposition and event area does not reside within these borders. Through a series of interventions along the wall I strive to redefine the relationship between the orography, the port and the old city. The city wall will start acting as a plinth, •mediating between the different conflicting programs. •While at the same time qualifying or revitalizing the bufferzone in between and •open up the borders to make the spaces operational. Because of the different grain size of the urban fabric in the old city and the port there are no straight connection possible between the void spaces in these spatial systems. In the residual space between the port and the city the points of entry from these different systems are connected. This causes a shift in the route. Because of these not immediately apparent connections this in-between zone becomes a destination on its own. Next to connecting port and city these intervention create an area meant to be explored and discovered. While the interventions on their own can be used to create a fast route to the fiera for instance, the interventions can also be experienced in sequence offering a parallel route along the wall instead of only lateral movements. The interventions themselves fulfil different functions •some are clearly defined, like a bus stop or an extension of a museum •others host a more informal program open to the interpretation of the user. These interventions consist of excavations and additions, where the excavations have a more rigorous space creating character the additions are more precise and really pinpoint locations to connect to the local urban conditions.","genoa; thresholds; port; Excavation; excavation pits; addition; Pavilion; city wall","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","","44.413055, 8.912366"

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","In recent years, research in the field of autonomous driving has been subject to a significant increase in interest. Along with the advances in automation and electrification, cars are slowly transitioning to computers on wheels. The ever-increasing processing power in vehicles gives rise to the implementation of advanced control strategies. The increase in computational power not only allows for novel solutions to automated driving but can also be used for advanced control systems aimed at collision avoidance. At the same time, significant advances have been made towards efficient nonlinear optimisation methods, giving rise to new possibilities for real-time applications. This thesis focuses on an Evasive Manoeuvre Assistance Function (EMA) to avoid obstacles at the limits of handling using a Model Predictive Control (MPC) approach. Vehicles at the limits of handling typically operate in the nonlinear region of the tyre. For this reason, a Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) approach is employed. A baseline scenario with a lateral displacement of 2 metres is considered, representing a common near rear-end collision situation. An optimal trajectory and steering sequence is computed by the MPC over a defined horizon. As MPC considers a model to calculate an optimal control input, a nonlinear two-track model with a simplified Magic Formula is used. The main drawback of real-time NMPC has always been its computational burden. For the baseline scenario, the limits of real-time NMPC are explored, using the state-of-the-art non- linear optimisation methods: Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP) and Interior-Point Method (IPM). Both methods are compared in simulation and an SQP approach is tested on an embedded system within a test vehicle, subject to the disturbances and uncertainties that come with physical driving. It was found that the proposed NMPC strategies make for a robust yet aggressive manoeuvre with high lateral accelerations, utilising the nonlinear operating region of the tyre. Furthermore, computation times on an embedded system in a test vehicle were found to be sufficiently low for real-time application.","Nonlinear; Model; Predictive; Control; Evasive; Manoeuvre; Assist; Function; Sequential; Quadratic; Programming; Interior; Point; Method; Optimisation; Real-time; Embedded","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","","57.728228, 11.859602"

At the end of the project, with the features imple-mented by the team, Zesje can automatically grade multiple choice questions, identify blank solutions andhas the corresponding front-end changes that allow the user to create multiple choice checkboxes on theexam PDF. These features have been tested extensively. The use of Zesje also poses some ethical challenges. Using automated grading may result in the event thatsome submissions may never be seen by a grader.

As a lender it is important to have a clear record of the customers applying for a loan, as this helps assessing the risk that comes with providing a loan. Furthermore, it is required by law to know who it is that you are providing a loan to. To achieve this, loan providers gather a variety of personal and financial information. The gathering of such information has traditionally been a time consuming practice, both for the customer and the lender. The customer is required to manually find and submit information, and in turn the lender has to verify that the received information is not fraudulent or incorrect. If collection of personal information, payrolls and credits could be done in an automated way, both the customer and the lender will benefit greatly. We have designed and developed the Customer Verification Engine, the CVE, in order to solve this time consuming process of collecting and submitting documents. The CVE is capable of cleverly combining several external data sources, creating a clear record of the customer. While previously the customer had to manually provide a large set of documents, it is now done at the push of a button. Furthermore, by having a system where the information is retrieved, rather than provided by the customer, the verification becomes significantly more reliable, as there is little to no room for the customer to provide fraudulent information. The CVE is a robust and scalable system that is capable of handling unexpected behavior both in terms of input and connection to external sources. An extensive test suite verifies correct behavior of the CVE under both normal and unexpected circumstances. The information gathered by the CVE will be relied upon to determine whether or not a customer is eligible for a loan. As the CVE will be continued to be worked upon, we have put effort into making it extendable for future developers. Using the extensive documentation and the modularity of the system, it should be straightforward for future developers to add new integrations with external parties to the CVE.","Finance; API; Software Development; Serverless","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science and Engineering","Bachelor End Project",""

Resilience defines as the ability to bounce back, but the everchanging complexity of a city requires more than a simple rebuilding to pre-disaster conditions. My research identifies different notions on urban resilience but adopts the principle of “bouncing-forward”, where redevelopment aims far beyond the mere physical recovery and restoration. The “bouncing forward” notion implies the system’s ability to apply a transformative, “learning-curve” attitude for long-term development. By analyzing the historical moments of destruction and reconstruction of Enschede, I define a “learning curve” that teaches us that each redevelopment offers an opportunity for a paradigm shift based on the societal requirements of time. Also, historically, each reconstruction used the specificity of place to determine the direction for urban redefinition. I use these perspectives and lessons on urban resilience to re-evaluate the Roombeek redevelopment. After the fireworks-factory disaster, a participatory mode of governance – based on consensus decision-making – was applied to restore the disrupted relationship between the public and the local government. By putting architects into a power vacuum, the Roombeek redevelopment displayed pragmatism over a “transformative” vision for urban redefinition. A 200-car parking-facility close to the disaster-site indicates favoring the wishes of a small collective over the requirements of the city. By extrapolating from the learning curve, I formulated a future urban redefinition. I argue that the city should try to establish symbiosis between the inner-city creative forces and the edge-city’s innovative forces to establish itself as the cultural-technological city. By building a “sustainable, cultural breeding ground” on the location as mentioned earlier, the city could take the first step in shifting towards urban redefinition.","Urban Redefinition; Urban Resilience; Post-Disaster Redevelopment; Interactive Governance; Enschede; Roombeek","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","A Cultural Breeding Ground","52.231167, 6.894222"

The main advantage of Automated Vehicles (AV) will be the significant decrease in road accidents and casualties. However, a significant shift from conventional to automated vehicles must occur before it can have a positive impact on society. If the behaviour of the vehicle is not perceived as natural, the user will most likely not activate the ADAS features again. During this study a naturalistic dataset is used to investigate the driver behaviour, in the hope of bringing the current ACC logic to a more human-like behaviour that will feel more natural to the driver. The research question summarizes the final objective of this study: How can Naturalistic Driving Study (NDS) datasets be used in target performance setting for ACC systems? This study will answer the research question by studying human behaviour in the scene of following an accelerating vehicle. The main body of this thesis is divided in three chapters, one for each step of the research. First the information about the used datasets are provided together with the methodologies used to extract the relevant time-series data. Secondly driver behaviour models are created in order to mathematically characterize human behaviour. The strength of the created models is their ability to represent the full range of driver behaviour in terms of driving style. The aggressiveness parameter of the model can be easily adjusted to represent different percentiles of driver behaviour. This allows for a quick and effective tuning process: by changing a single parameter the driving style of the model can be fully modified. Finally, the driver behaviour models are implemented into a simulation environment. The models are simulated against an existing ACC logic in order to assess the difference in behaviour. The comparison highlighted two conclusions: first, the ACC logic behaves in a very conservative way compared to driver behaviour, especially when starting from standstill. Secondly, the kept by the ACC logic was not consistent throughout the speed range. This variation of the logic's driving style could result even more bothersome to the customer than its general conservative behaviour. The string stability of the driver behaviour models was also assessed. Although the proposed logic proved more stable than the regular ACC logic, it still cannot reach full string stability. <br/>Hopefully, with the method developed in this study, the process of getting accustomed to this new technology will become easier for the customer. Thanks to the driver behaviour models the motion of the vehicle can feel familiar and predictable, with the controller becoming part of the Human Machine Interface (HMI). As the customer gets more familiar with this technology his expectation will also increase and change, especially as the levels of automation start to increase. This will inevitably push automakers to continue to improve the technology to deliver increasingly advanced and safe vehicles.","ACC; ADAS; driver modeling; driver behaviour; Automated vehicles; car following; naturalistic driving study","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-07-02","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Vehicle Engineering","",""

Company X wants this data represented in a dynamic, scalable and interactive visualisation. To create a product that fulfils the expectations and needs of Company X, a Proof of Concept (PoC) was created. This basic version was used to make sure that Company X and the development team had the same basic idea of the application to be created and was then extended to an Minimal Viable Product (MVP). Having completed this MVP, additional features were implemented. Such features include making the solution generic for different data sources, the ability to filter and search through the data and highlighting/focusing specific data types. In order to ensure that the visualisation can be used instinctively and deliver the information it is meant to, a user study was set up. In this user study, multiple employees of Company X tested the visualisation by completing a set of tasks within the application. By tracking the different results (i.e. number of clicks, time, subjective opinions), the team was able to derive that the application is quite promising, but still had the need for some improvements to explore its full potential.","Visualisation; Generic; CSV; Ruby on Rails; Vue.js; Delphi; Data","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science","Bachelor Project",""

Alternatively, the increase in maintenance costs and utility costs will render the building undesirable and hence cause premature demolition of the facade or the building itself.

This research project aims to aid the architect in developing a design which has a comparatively lower ecological footprint and focuses on opportunistic utilization of renewable resources readily available in the context. Within the preview of this thesis the potential of developing a sustainable water management scheme for the Negin safari park located in the Fars province of Iran is studied.<br/>Iran is facing a situation of drought for the past few years which has had an adverse impact on the region. One of the communities to have been affected by this are the Qashqai nomads of Iran, who have been threatened with deprivation of their freedom due to the economic woes brought by drought. The Negin safari park being developed in the region aims to uplift this community and provide a platform for them to be able to share their work and culture. However, the influx of tourists due to the development of a Safari park further increases the stress on the depleting water resources in the region. In turn development of water technologies facilitating the reclamation of waste water, conservation of water and mitigation of extreme withdrawal of resources needs to be studied and implemented.<br/> In order to create a design which consciously uses the water resources and facilitates re-use of waste water, different water technologies have been identified and studied to understand its feasibility for installation in Iran. Once the ideal technologies were identified, a water management scheme was developed which facilitated water autarky in the park. Further on the relation of the built form with the technology was explored. The technologies which were shortlisted entailed requirements which had a direct impact on the design of the built form and its spatial organization. The final product of this thesis entails a customized set of design guidelines for the development of a Safari park in Iran. These guidelines have stemmed from the optimization strategy used in designing the Negin safari park with the intended water technologies. <br/>Adhering to the concept of developing the park as an eco-tourist destination attention has been placed to propose sustainable technologies with lower energy requirement and maintenance. It is believed that through implementation of these technologies the added stress on water demand caused by the erection of a Negin safari park in a drought hit region can be reduced. The implementation of these technologies can also further help in educating the local community and lead to encouragement of widespread implementation of these systems. This graduation project is an attempt to develop an informed relation between resource flows and spatial design in order to enable an uninterrupted functioning of the Safari park leading to prosperity of the region and its people.<br/> <br","Building technology; Water management; built environment","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","","29.012988, 52.499701"

Reed is most commonly used for thatch roofing in Europe, providing insulation and a weather-tight surface. Elsewhere, traditional techniques of weaving and bundling reeds have long been used to create entire buildings. This research develops a new alternative to these techniques with the aim of showcasing the ability of reed to perform as structure, insulation, and cladding all at once. In the Netherlands, the availability of inexpensive imported reed has led to a decline in demand for Dutch reed for thatching. This is problematic as the management of reed beds is essential for nature conservation. The research aims to promote the use of Dutch reed for construction through utilising a digital production chain in order to reduce labour costs. Through an iterative process of designing from the micro to the macro scale and by experimenting with robotic assembly, the result is a reed-based system in the form of discrete components that can be configured to create a variety of structures. The project questions permanence in architecture, through the proposal of a series of nature observation structures for the National Park Duinen van Texel. The structures are intended to last ten to twenty years and utilise completely biodegradable materials which can be disassembled whenever necessary. This semi-permanence allows for future flexibility and ensures preservation of the natural environment.

In a built environment like the city of Bandung where social segregation between the formally structured communities and the more organic kampung villages dominates the city scape contributing to a significant extent to most of the urban challenges like environmental pollution the projects strives for inclusion. The project's ambition was to show how by understanding the context and by putting first the people and their needs, architecture and heritage adaptive re-use can contribute to healthier and more resilient cities. More specifically, the project unfolds with the integration of a plastic waste recycling cycle combined with a more communal environment, with creative spaces and educational facilities that not only makes people aware of the issue, the consequences but also allows waste to become part of the daily routine and thus for the people to explore the possibilities around its re-use and up-cycling and thus create business opportunities in a inclusive environment for all. The combination of bottom up and top down approaches both in terms of the programme but also in the physical materialisation of the design offers the means for change. Architecturally, the project explores the relationship between waste and people between working and public environment between openness and enclosure in various different scales. From city scale with the transformation of the former railway into a new tram line accompanied by a green belt, on a neighbourhood scale with the transformation of Knil Magazinjen into a creative and learning cluster of plastic waste, while on a building scale this integration is explored through architectural design and building technology.

(mentor); Tensen, S.C. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","Nowadays, large scale district heating networks (DHNs) in the Netherlands do not reach their potential as a renewable heat supplier, as the thermal energy is often produced by fossil-fueled installations. By 2030, the share of DHNs in the total thermal energy supply will increase and the thermal energy will mainly be supplied by renewable sources. The transformation toward renewable heat supplied DHNs is accompanied with a decrease in flexibility. Seasonal thermal energy storage (STES) systems are to a certain extend able to bring back flexibility.<br/>The research question has been answered in four steps. First, the seasonal thermal energy storage technique with the highest potential for implementation in a large scale district heating network has been studied. Secondly, the most relevant characteristics of the STES were analyzed and used to create a model in Matlab of the thermal performance. Thirdly, the desired dimensions of the STES and its impact on a DHN were determined. A Matlab model was used to analyze the performance of the STES. This model also determined the optimal strategy to supply the thermal energy to the DHN. Finally, an analysis provided the economic performance of the optimal STES. Throughout the thesis, the district heating network of Utrecht is evaluated as a reference. This research confirms that it is economically and technically feasible to implement STES systems in an existing large scale DHNs. The most suitable STES technique is high temperature aquifer thermal energy storage (HT-ATES), as the investment cost and the required surface area are relatively low. The results show that multiple suitable locations are identified for HT-ATES in the DHN of Utrecht. A decentralized HT-ATES operating in a 'Total Coverage Winter' mode promises to have the best economical performance and can be economically competitive with other heat sources in the DHN. These results are based on the current prospect of the characteristics of the DHN of Utrecht (price of surplus heat, available sources, desired thermal power, supply temperature). The economic performance of the HT-ATES depends strongly on the specification of the DHN. A higher economic performance can be achieved with different characteristics for the DHN. The HT-ATES is expected to have a lower LCOH if either the storage volume is increased, the supply temperature is decreased or the thermal power is optimized with the stored volume. When these adjustments are satisfied the HT-ATES can out perform the current gas peak boilers (14 €/GJ).","seasonal storage; district heating; Utrecht; HT_ATES","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-12-31","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

A new innovative approach of engineers is needed to reach socio-economic development with care for the environment. In the Netherlands, an EcoShape consortium is initiated where multiple experts came together from the Dutch private and public sector. In this consortium governmental organisations, knowledge institutes and business companies are involved to search for adaptable and sustainable engineering solutions to exploit and promote the ‘Building with Nature’ program. The main goal is to move from building in nature towards building with nature, using the natural forces present in the system.<br/> <br/>Chile has shown interested in the Dutch Building with Nature program and the question raised whether a similar concept could be introduced in the country. Therefore, the organisational structure of the Chilean water sector related to coastal engineering is investigated in this research, as well as several case studies are used to illustrate the potential of Building with Nature in Chilean projects. These projects are the coastal erosion in Pichilemu, a port expansion in San Antonio and coastal erosion in Los Vilos.<br/> <br/>The Chilean coast shows in different aspects a very dynamic behavior. For the design of a coastal structure it is important to understand this dynamic behavior and the possible consequences. In addition, the study concluded that Chile is a very privatized country which is important to consider when applying Building with Nature into coastal projects. The privatization has the consequence that a substantial amount of stakeholders need to be involved in the projects also funding can be a challenge.<br/> <br/>In general, the conclusion can be drawn that there is lack of information on the coastal characteristics in Chile. More data needs to be conducted to implement trustworthy Building with Nature designs. Additionally, one could state that there is a communication gap between the governmental parties as the Dirección de Obras Portuarias and Ministerio de Obras Públicas and the local parties involved in coastal projects. This is important to solve, as these parties needs to be involved in all coastal projects. Another outcome of the case studies is the absence of an environmental vision for most of the initiated coastal projects investigated and the absence of a long term vision of coastal management.<br/> <br/>Meeting with various engineering consultancy firms showed the presence of a strong incentive to enlarge the consciousness on the environmental and societal aspects in Chile, and the ambition for a more co-creative and multidisciplinary design approach. Arcadis Chile has shown interest to establish a platform to introduce the Building with Nature approach in Chile. Together with the Universidad de Valparaíso, Arcadis Chile can be the initiator for the implementation of the philosophy and the increase of awareness among other important actors in the water sector. <br","Hydraulic engineering; Building with Nature; Nature Based Solutions; Sustainable; Environment","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering","Master project report","-33.0, -71.6"

These plastics can be divided into a number of types of plastics, namely PET, HDPE, LDPE, PP, PS, EPS and others. However, many plastic packages consist of different types of plastics and are often contaminated, therefore these plastics end up in the mixed plastics. While monostreams of plastic waste still have a certain value the mixed plastics are worthless and accumulating. With an ever-increasing amount of mixed plastic waste, it is very important to recycle these plastics too. The EU, the Dutch government and municipalities in the Netherlands all have their sustainability goals. Almere as a municipality in the Netherlands wants to create their own mixed plastic household waste (MPHW) value chain to reduce their total amount of residual waste per citizen.<br/><br/>The aim of this research is to find out how the municipality of Almere can encourage local recycling of MPHW. The research question of this research is therefore: What are opportunities to stimulate the niche of mixed plastic household waste recycling, in the municipality of Almere, and how can this be organized?<br/><br/>To answer the research question there is made an overview of the plastic waste recycling infrastructure in the Netherlands and interviews are held with the municipality of Almere and with companies that are active in the recycling of MPHW. To be able to analyze the developments a theoretical framework has been designed which is based on the multi-level perspective, strategic niche management and business model innovation.<br/><br/>The results show that municipalities in the Netherlands, such as Almere, have gained more control over their own waste processing. Almere can stimulate developments in the local niche for recycling MPHW by creating the right conditions such as a guaranteed supply of MPHW and demand for products made from these plastics. Technological innovations in the recycling of mixed plastics can be conducive to the success of the niche when Almere brings the various players together. Successful development of the local MPHW niche in Almere can stimulate other municipalities to follow their example.<br","Sustainability; Mixed plastics; recycling; MLP; Multi-level perspective; strategic niche management; SNM; transition; household waste; Almere; mechanical recycling; innovation; plastic; Plastic recycling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As a result, it is becoming increasingly important to businesses to invest in their employees' well-being and health. The VTTI group cares for the well-being of their employees, and is looking for a tool to optimize the utilization of their building for perceived thermal comfort and indoor air quality.<br/><br/>This report documents the development of Claire, an indoor air quality dashboard that helps to identify local air quality problems. Using Claire, employees can be rearranged throughout the space, learn about the characteristics of their office, and for example switch to another meeting room. Claire translates measurements into insights. Claire learns about the behavior of the office, and gives recommendations once she notices that the indoor air quality can be improved.<br/><br/>Claire is backed by an indoor air quality sensor mesh network, which has been developed as part of this project. The sensors continuously measure temperature, humidity and carbon dioxide concentrations. The sensors connect to a cloud infrastructure through a local internet gateway. In the cloud the data gets processed. All measurements are displayed real-time in the dashboard.<br/><br/>Claire is different from existing products in several ways. First, the sensors developed measure both dry-bulb and black globe temperature, which gives it a temperature reading that describes human thermal comfort more accurately. This is not done in competing products. Furthermore, the sensors fill the gap for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs): the sensor network is able to get fine-grained results due to its high sensor density, whilst still being very easy to setup with no adjustments to the building being required. Finally, the developed data analysis methods translate the measurements from the sensor network to concrete suggestions, sent through a push notification, which enables workers to get involved with improving the indoor air quality in their office space.","Indoor air quality; wireless sensor networks; Thermal comfort; time series analysis; HVAC","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science and Engineering","",""

However, flight paths tend to have a stochastic character causing their predictability to decrease with the look-ahead time. In this research a quantitative analysis is made of the statistical properties of flight trajectory deviations and their dependency on the look-ahead time based on historical ADS-B flight segments and corresponding flight plan data. An empirical boundary on the prediction horizon for future aircraft locations in en-route flights is determined based on a deterministic state propagation method. Using these results, an analysis is made of how these uncertainty distributions affect conflict detection performance. A comparison is therefore made between deterministic, probabilistic and intent based conflict detection methods when applied to medium-term conflict scenarios. Results show that for lower look-ahead time windows up to 10 minutes, a deterministic approach proves to be the most reliable. Only beyond this time window, the use of flight plan information proves to have beneficial effects on the detection performance. The outcome of this research can be used as a benchmark for the development of novel conflict detection approaches.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering | Control & Simulation","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","Technology is being used more and more to aid elite athletes in improving their performance. Recently there have been promising developments in the research using IMUs regarding wheelchair rugby and basketball. Applying this same measurement setup to wheelchair tennis could give better insight in the wheelchair mobility of wheelchair tennis athletes. This knowledge could aid the athletes in causing less sport related injuries, altering the focus of their training or even training entirely new aspects of the sport. This is why this research will be answering the research question: “What is/are the most influential factor(s) regarding the mobility of wheelchair tennis athletes to discriminate between the winning and losing player?”. We define the wheelchair mobility performance as all the measurable parameters related to the movements of the athlete. These mainly consist of the velocities and accelerations reached by the athletes. The measurements resulted in three different ways to output variables. Match statistics, these include information about the distance travelled, turns made and points played during the match. This was chosen to give general insight into the match. The wheelchair mobility performance (WMP), shows information about the velocities and accelerations during the match. This was chosen to compare the velocities and accelerations of athletes, they are plotted against the average value of the entire database of all measurements, this will be a standardized baseline to compare the results to. Lastly the speed zone plots, the plots give an indication of how long the athlete has been driving within a certain velocity range. To give better insight in the dynamic of the match all outputs also includes the constraints of winning/losing and serving/receiving. It is therefore possible to compare the differences between won and lost points and served and received points. There was also experimented with the possibility of making a plot that shows the location of the athlete on the field as a heatmap. However, because the IMUs only record accelerations the cumulative error to distance had to be manually adjusted for, therefore this was only done for one match as a pilot case. The match statistics, WMP plots and speed zone plots showed no significant differences between winning and losing points. Therefore, this study found that the mobility performance has no deciding effect on the outcome of a tennis match. The technique used to hit the ball and place it on the right spot in the field will probably be the determining factor here. This said, the mobility does however have to be above a certain threshold for the player to compete at a certain level of play, so neglecting it completely is not recommended, however the focus should be on the technique that involves hitting the ball. The heatmap case shows that the winning player plays more aggressive, but whether he is playing aggressive because he is winning or winning because he is playing aggressive cannot be concluded by this research.","Wheelchair; Tennis; Sport; Data analysis; Inertial Measurement Unit","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

The cooling demand in India is going to increase up to 8 folds by 2030. Almost 50% of the energy is spent on space cooling for offices in Indian climatic conditions. In order to reduce the cooling demand alternative low ex cooling technologies are being researched and implemented. In this thesis, various types of evaporative cooling and their various properties and its application on Delhi’s climatic scenario and its limitations were studied as one of the low-ex techs. The study concludes by choosing Dew-point indirect evaporative cooler because of its high wet bulb effectiveness with no addition of humidity. For continuous operation, the humidity in the air needs to removed before supplying it to the cooler. So, the design involves a combination of Dew-point Indirect evaporative cooler (D-IEC) coupled with Desiccant coated heat exchanger (DCHE). The system also requires a source for heating and cooling down the water for Regeneration cycle and Dehumidification cycle, evaporative cooler respectively. The cooling demand of the building needs to be addressed by multiple devices in a decentralized ventilation system. The total number of devices required determines the cost of installation and ease of maintenance over the years and it depends on the cooling load. So, it is necessary to reduce the cooling demand of the building using passive strategies before integrating the evaporative cooler. The building’s cooling load has been reduced to 50W/m2 by adapting suitable passive strategies like shading systems, reducing U values of walls, glazing and roof, reducing infiltration and the internal heat gain. The above-mentioned strategies result in 146.41kWh/m2/yr with a water-based chiller (CENTRALIZED), and it is efficient when compared to the recommended national figure of 180 kWh/m2/yr. But using the De-VAP systems (DECENTRALIZED) cuts down the energy by even much further to up to 40% (92.26kWh/m2) in which almost 1/3rd of the energy can be generated by installing PV on the roof. This design takes us further one step closer to the NET ZERO building.","Sustainabilty; Low-ex Cooling; Evaporative Cooling; Facade; Desiccant Cooling; Tropical Climate; Hot and humid; Decentralized Ventilation System; New Delhi; Offices","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-07-10","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Building Technology | Sustainable Design","COOL Facade","28.409038, 76.993914"

These challenges lead to design goals, such as a user experience focus, optimization of performance, and continuation of the project. To achieve these goals, the project is approached in an agile way with weekly planning meetings and tri-weekly stand-ups to keep it organized and well planned. The front-end features are based on a specific target audience: the Relive users that do not use a third party app for sporting activities. The screen is intuitive and supports storing of planned routes. A route can be created, edited and loaded in the Record functionality of the Relive app. To support the front-end, the back-end handles route calculation and route storing. The route calculation is done using Dijkstra’s shortest path algorithm. In addition, a proof of concept customized route calculation is created that focuses on popularity oriented routing. Route storing makes use of the internal databases of Relive and is integrated in the existing systems. Each feature is tested with automated end-to-end and unit tests. Additionally, user tests are performed to get valuable feedback from external users. Apart from active user participation, random users were selected to join a route builder experiment. During the project, more than 22 thousand users obtained the route builder feature. Each click is timed and tracked to make sure that the feature performed as expected.

Bandung has many Indonesian-Dutch heritage sites and buildings as a result of the long period of colonization by the Dutch. They are part of both Dutch and Indonesian history and have become part of the expanding cities and changing landscapes of modern-day Indonesia. The challenge of this studio is to give new meaning and use to this environment, in order to realize an inclusive, thriving and healthy city, taking past, present and future into account.As part of the Heritage &amp; Architecture team in this Shared Heritage Lab, I focused on the development of the Railroad, and its impact on the city. While initially it was on the borders of Bandung, during the years and the expansion of it, the Railway line ended up being a dead zone in the center of the city, splitting it into two, enhancing segregation and obstructing normal every-day activities. A transformation of the Railway line into a “green belt” is proposed, that includes public and green spaces, cycle path, and a new tram line. My project is located in a former military complex along the Railroad backbone, and attempts to tackle the existing problems on a neighborhood scale. The site holds both tangible and intangible values of the shared past and is transformed in order to serve current societal needs. Through the merging of traditional and modern activities with education, the aim is to maintain and develop the cultural identity and critical cultural knowledge and practices of the community, and to create the necessary environment to equip locals with skills and motivation towards their future.The architectural process is used as a tool to empower the local communities. So the whole concept is about two things - the process and the project, centralizing the users in each phase. The design explores the values of honest materiality, craftsmanship, expressive tectonics, and vernacular sensitivity. Through the deliberate selection of materials and construction methods with the potential to be adapted by local workers, the construction process will serve as a mode of capacity building and livelihood training. The transformed complex will provide much needed space for collective activities for the surrounding communities, and at the same time it will get a new life. Involving the users in the process of making the space will create a total new meaning for them regarding this place. It will become a symbol of change manifested through their effort.

Within this web of relations, the Netherlands play an important role as the gateway to continental Europe on the one hand and the United States and United Kingdom on the other hand. At the same time, the stable political conditions, reliable energy supply and friendly business atmosphere, have given rise to an intense economy of data centres within the Netherlands. The hierarchy of these networks is determined by other territorial factors such as economic relevance, national borders and existing infrastructural ecologies. <br/><br/>Equally, the typology of data centres is focused around three main parameters that determine the location and architectural design. Firstly, the proximity to high capacity fibre networks is a determinant factor for the geographic location of data centres. In many cases this also implies a proximity to the sea and the global connection this warrants. Secondly, as they require sizeable and stable energy supply, they are either located close to energy sources or transmission cables. Thirdly, they usually require a lot of space to fit as much server space as possible, which results in a backcountry location. Hence, data centres are usually planned in a remote location, consuming a lot of space while not returning any spatial quality. <br/><br/>My project challenges these paradigms in a number of ways, while adhering to the underlying network logics. Currently, the two system edges are usually separated in such that data networks are located close to the global network but far from the actual user. Therefore, my project proposes to collapse the geographic proximity of global connections and local user by bringing the data centres into the cities. The resultant urban network is able to benefit from a number of network effects and agglomeration benefits. These include the reduced latencies that are needed for the Internet of Things and the integration of energy infrastructure, allowing energy storage and dissipation on an urban scale. To achieve this integration the project distribution is based on a variety of urban parameters, which include the existing infrastructure networks and morphological analyses such as space syntax and isovists. <br/><br/>On an architectural scale the project proposes a typological understanding of the urban data centres, which respond to a number of different parameters and organisational modes. In consequence, the project proposes three types that are responding to three different site conditions. Furthermore, the types vary according to their socio-economic organisation, their structural independence and most importantly size. The three types or architectural artefacts range from a ‘large’ publicly maintained building, via a medium sized civic centre to small miniature private buildings. The resultant architecture proposes to redefine the standard type for data centres making them an outstanding part of the urban fabric. <br/><br/>While the project proposes a specific infrastructure in a specific place it is structured to be replicable in other sites. At the same time, it carries a number of important messages. Firstly, it shows quite clearly the scale and impact of society’s use of data by bringing it closer to the user and making it palpable in our daily lives. At the same time this presence also liberates the ‘world exterior’ from another predatory infrastructure allowing us to read the functional dependencies of our cities more clearly. Secondly, the project also questions the territorial dependence of data flows by illustrating the possibility of local data. In times of data scandals and increased political awareness, the vision of keeping your data close allows us to challenge the way we currently deal with this abstract matter. Finally, the project also illustrates the scale of our data use. It warns us of the impact it can have on our lives. <br/><br/>While the project takes place on the urban scale of the city of Scheveningen and is developed as an architectural proposal that reaches the detail scale it is part of a larger project. The project and its scale are determined by the site, the architectural proposals are specific to a location and their detailing is adjusted to local circumstances. Nonetheless, the project also proposes a territorial shift, where decentralisation and ownership are challenged. The urban component of this thesis is a case study for a larger project, a project that takes place on the personal and territorial scale simultaneously. <br","ICT Networks; Infrastructural ecology; Urban design; data center; Rhizome","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Transitional Territories","","52.104625, 4.273079"

Situated in the uncertain context of Brexit, the project is a critique of how architecture, a profession that often claims to mediate and resolve socio-political and economic issues through spatial intervention, is a vehicle that continuously drives marginalisation, embodied state violence and power. Buildings make visible conflict, control and prejudice and in the context of late-capitalism and Brexit, will continue to perform as a means through which income is produced for the wealthy. An architecture that can instead unfix, destabilise, blur lines and edges, as opposed to fix and define, acting at fragile moments uncovered within oppressive socio-political processes, is a relational practice through which collectivity and publicness can be maintained. This concerns an architecture that is not physical (static / fixed), that composes and aestheticises, but that is collectively negotiated, practiced, choreographed, enacted, evolving, adaptable, fragile (dynamic / unfixed). The thesis proposes a fragile network of infrastructural interventions that can facilitate the emergence, transformation and deterioration of social spaces, inhabiting the ongoing changing state of the quay walls of the River Clyde in Glasgow. The fragile state of the quay walls draws a parallel to the uncertain context of the Brexit vote, as a moment in which something else could happen. Emergent inhabitancies that temporarily maintain an illusion of regeneration or certainty, that fluctuate in relation to flows of water and the hydrological cycle, embrace Glasgow’s wet climate: a disruptive force that threatens privatisation. The project investigates a fragile architecture that can exploit destabilising processes as an opportunity to curate edges, choreograph surfaces and inhabit spaces within and from the wall, that in turn deter market speculation. The temporal inhabitance of the wall is a process whereby infrastructure is reactivated and extended, claiming back public land: as long as the city is kept as wet as possible, unstable edges and landscapes allow for processes of privatisation to be subverted.","Fragility; Architecture; Politics; Brexit; Privatisation; Subversion","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Explorelab","","55.679528, -4.971306"

(mentor); Brinkgreve, R.B.J. (mentor); Hendriks, M.A.N. (mentor); Brinkman, Sanne (mentor); Dantuma, Gerrit (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","Since the exploitation of wind as a renewable energy resource, jack-up vessels equipped with more than three independent legs are increasingly employed to transport and install the components of offshore wind turbines. By lowering the movable legs the vessel is able to elevate the hull from sea water level. In elevated position the vessel provides a stable platform to perform installation activities. The legs are equipped with spudcans which serve as foundation of the vessel. The elevating process consists of a preload phase to ensure sufficient capacity to withstand operational and possible storm conditions. The preloading of four-legged jack-ups is performed by alternately applying vertical loads on diagonally opposite leg pairs, up to achieving a stable condition in which nearly constant load levels can be held by each leg. The aim of this research is to develop a 3D model to asses the preload duration of the jack-up vessel Aeolus in cohesive soil. The viscous behaviour of cohesive soil, like clay, influence the acting leg load during preload of the jack-up vessel. The shear strength of clay is a function of strain rate meaning that resistance increases due to viscous effects with increasing penetration rate. During spudcan penetration the shearing resistance is high but will reduce significantly when penetration is stopped as the viscoplastic resistance diminishes. Together with the onset of isotach soil behaviour this causes the loads to redistribute between the legs occurs. In this study it is assumed that sufficient preloading is achieved when the leg load reduction is limited to 400 ton / 15 min. To satisfy this criterionmultiple load cycles of each leg pair are performed. Site specific geotechnical data and information on the structural stiffness of the Aeolus have been available for this research and allowed for an accurate analysis of the processes during the preload procedure. The Soft Soil Creep (SSC) model is used as constitutive model and accounts for viscous effects by formulating irreversible strains by means of viscoplasticity. The soil at the project site is classified and the constitutive model is calibrated based upon the available soil test results. The structural behaviour of the vessel is captured via a simplified beam configuration representing the deck structure and legs, the stiffness of the beams is verified using the results from a so-called predrive analysis. The extension of the legs is established bymeans of negatively pre-stressed node-to-node anchors. Simulations of a single spudcan penetrating at various depths and penetration rates are performed to identify the extent of viscous strain rate effects fromthe results. With the developed 3D model Small Deformation Finite Element analyses of the preload procedure are performed. The leg loads and penetrations are monitored and compared to jacking data fromthe actual project site. The processes in the soil and structure are analysed and the influence on the preload procedure and preload duration is identified. For both type of simulations six different case-calculations are performed addressing variation in the initial spudcan depth, the OCR, the penetration rate, the permeability and the type of preload procedure. The simulations indicated that the penetration of a spudcan influences the penetration of an adjacent spudcan, this reciprocal influence of the spudcans emphasizes the importance of onemodel comprising all spudcans in the same 3D soil domain. The developed model slightly overestimates the spudcan penetration and underestimates the total preload duration. Simulations of the overshooting preload procedure and an alternative preload procedure are performed with the FE model. For the soil conditions used in this research, both the overshooting and the alternative procedure are effective in reducing the number of preload cycles to satisfy the preload criterion. Compared to the normal preload procedure, it is expected the overshooting procedure improves the preload duration. For the alternative procedure however, the duration of a preload cycle increases significantly and consequently the procedure does not improve the preload duration. Using a lower spudcan penetration rate during the normal preload procedure is also effective in reducing the number of preload cycles but significantly increases the elapsed time to complete the preload procedure. The above conclusions have been made on the basis of the model results, which is calibrated for the soil conditions at the specific project site.","Jack-up; preload; cohesive soil; finite element analysis; Offshore Wind; aeolus; spudcan; viscous effects","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering | Structural Mechanics","",""

The tidal marshes accommodate multiple plant and fish species. As a result of the stressful conditions in tidal marshes, unique intertidal ecology develops. However, due to the densifying of the river banks, tidal marshes are disappearing. <br/>Restoration of tidal marshes can reintroduce the unique intertidal ecology on several locations in the estuary. To obtain restoration of tidal marshes, constructed tidal marshes come into play, which can be built at designated places along the river. <br/>However, constructed tidal marshes are not necessarily built to restore the unique tidal nature, but can also have other functions as recreation and contribution in green city area.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, is it still unknown how constructed tidal marshes behave and what the optimal design is. Namely, a mismatch exists between the policymakers and designers on the one side and academic knowledge on the other side. To fill up this gap, accessible knowledge from the experts should be available for designers. <br/>Therefore, this research provides guidelines for designers and gains more insight into the behaviour of constructed tidal marshes. This thesis focusses on extracting general knowledge from the results of a numerical model, applied on a case study.<br/><br/>Simulations of a numerical 1D Sobek model applied on the case study achieves the influence of model configurations on accretion. Therefore, tidal forcing, marsh design and system adjustments are divided into multiple components. The model simulations of the separate components give the influence on bed shear stress and potential sedimentation. <br/>Furthermore, executed fieldwork calibrates the model on measured flow velocities. Besides, the Manning coefficient is estimated, and cross-sections are obtained by gps measurements. The parameters are subsequently used as model input. <br/><br/>From the simulations, it can be concluded that tidal asymmetry determines the duration of stagnant water and thus the settling of fine particles. A considerable increase in sedimentation is reached when flats are participating. However, an increasing flat area encourages ebb-dominance and can even lead to erosion. <br/>Next, when the width of the cross-section is large compared to the depth, more sedimentation is predicted. With flood-dominant bed shear stresses, a broad cross-section leads to accretion.<br/>In the case study, the presence of sand particles is not expected, as sand is deposited close to the inlet, where the bed shear stress is ebb-dominant. In contrast, silt settles throughout the system. Especially at low energetic conditions, such as bends, silt settles. As the occurring bed shear stress is mostly flood-directed, it is likely that sediment entering the system, does not leave the system anymore, and accretion of the bends is presumed. <br/>The placement of gate culverts in flood direction leads to higher accretion rates due to the longer slack duration. However, at the exact locations of structures, higher bed shear stresses can develop, and erosion is expected.","marsh; design; tidal marsh; accretion; sedimentation and erosion; tidal forcing; design parameters; structures; constructed","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Water Management","",""

Accounted for only 2.7% of the area in the Netherlands, the MRDH consumes 17.3% of the total energy use. However, the MRDH is almost impoverished in terms of energy resources. Most of the fossil fuel energy used in the region is imported. Therefore, this energy intensive development model has also brought challenges from both climate change and fossil fuel depletion, resulting in multiple ecological, environmental, economic and social issues, which obstruct the further growth of the region. There has been an urgency in transforming traditional energy landscape to sustainable energy landscape.<br/><br/>Although the Netherlands has released many policies and regulations on sustainable energy, the current approach is still far too slow. Only 6% of the energy used in the Netherlands comes from renewable sources in 2016. One of the reasons that can explain the slow approach is that the renewable energy technologies are facing public resistance. People keep holding protests because of the negative impacts on landscape. Thus, the practical gap within energy landscape which separates sustainable energy transition and landscape quality apart needs to be addressed. Energy transition and landscape quality have, to date, been treated as two separate conceptual domains. The deficiency in spatial planning and design has evoked the public resistance because people are more aware and concerned about the quality of living environment. <br/><br/>With the focus on sustainable energy landscape and landscape quality, this project gives a new insight on how spatial planning and design can improve the landscape quality of energy landscape, in order to increase public concern and support about sustainable energy transition, thus to contribute to creating a more sustainable, livable and resilient MRDH.","energy landscape; sustainable energy design; landscape quality; spatial planning and design; energy neutral","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","",""

Now the whole Parkstad region is facing several challenges. The halt of the coal industry has caused the decline of economy and the shrinkage of the population. The rising mine water in the flooded coal mine threatens to contaminate the fresh water aquifer on the shallow layer. And since all the facilities of the past coal mines have been demolished and replaced by new urban development, this random urban sprawling has led to a fragmented metropolitan landscape and the lack of identity. This research focuses on the landscape approach to help solving all these challenges. By studying the existing landscape and open space, create a new blue-and-green structure, from which a new landscape system or a park system can be generated, so that the whole fragmented urban region can be integrated into it. At the same time, this landscape system should have other benefits. It has its own ecologic and economic values. It can help maintain the rainwater in all the neighbourhood, creating micro climate and supplementing the groundwater. By reusing the shaft and the tunnels system underground left from the former coal mines, create a underground pumped hydropower system to store and regenerate renewable energy. The infrastructure of this technology can also be integrated into the new landscape system and bring about new kind of space and experience. In this way, the industrial heritage is reused. The hidden landscape is revealed. A new kind of identity can be created. The research can be a relevant example for the development of other post-industrial cities. Many past coal regions can draw some strategy for the future sustainable development from it.

These photons have to travel through the Earth's atmosphere before arriving at DESHIMA, but this atmosphere adds noise to the signal. Using a principal component analysis on still-sky measurement data, the influence of the atmospheric noise on these observations is analyzed. To achieve this, several principal component analyses are performed on still-sky observations, which are measurements of the brightness temperature of the sky, Tsky. These observations are assumed to be governed by three noise types: atmospheric noise, photon noise, and detector 1=f noise. A PCA on a still-sky observation reveals the effect of the most dominant noise sources. By creating an artificial data set, the physical origin of these noise sources can be found. This data set was produced by using an existing atmospheric model, based on the fluctuation of the precipitable water vapour, or PWV, in the atmosphere. A principal component analysis on this artificial data set reveals the effect of this PWV fluctuation on the data. The first principal component of the artificial data is found to represent the derivatives of the Tsky-PWV relations for every channel. The second principal component has a non-zero explained variance and is found to represent the second-order derivatives of the<br/>Tsky-PWV relations for every channel, indicating that these relations are not linear. This can be explained by performing a Taylor expansion on the Tsky-PWV relation. Comparing the principal components of the real data to those of the artificial data shows that the first principal component generally has the same shape as the fist principal component of the artificial data, which represents the first-order PWV fluctuation, confirming that PWV fluctuation is the most dominant noise source for still-sky observations. It is also found that, when the PWV fluctuation is large, the second-order Taylor expansion term of the Tsky-PWV generally becomes more important in the real data. In this case, the first<br/>principal component has a very high explained variance, and the second-order term is usually represented by the second principal component. Conversely, when the PWV range is small, the first-order term explains significantly less variance, and random noise like the photon noise becomes more dominant than the higher-order terms. The results show a few exceptions to this interpretation, so further research on these systematic errors is strongly recommended. In order to achieve better results, the experimental method can be improved by including the bandwidths of the channels and better estimation of the PWV fluctuation. This research can also be extended into a design of a random noise level and ultimately, the design of a better atmosphere calibration method for DESHIMA.","","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This allows an efficient integration also in less powerful VR headsets.<br/>EOG eye-tracking exploits a property of the eye which behaves as an electric dipole. When the eyes rotate, the dipole vector rotates accordingly. Signals that are a measure of the rotations can be obtained with the EOG technique by placing electrodes on the skin around the eyes.<br/>It is recognised that these electrodes can be efficiently integrated on a VR headset on the foam mask surface which is contacting the user’s face. With a minimum total of five electrodes it is possible record signals that are a measure of horizontal and vertical conjugate (parallel) eye rotations, which can be converted into coordinates of the user’s gaze point in the virtual reality environment.<br/>In order to receive EOG signals, a stable contact between electrodes and the user’s skin must be assured. Standard VR headset masks do not provide uniform contact for all users, due to high variability of the human face shape. For this reason, the foam mask piece was re-designed by creating multiple sizes that could better accommodate different face shapes.<br/>An anthropometric analysis was conducted on a database of 3D scans of European subjects, with the aim of identifying three clusters of face shapes. Such results were then used to create digital mannequins to be exploited in the design of three mask sizes, with the ultimate purpose of improving the contact with the face and the overall comfort.<br/>Electronics and materials were researched and a final prototype with the desired characteristics was built with the purpose of demonstrating the integration of EOG into a VR headset and conduct user-tests. Finally, testing was successful to prove that the with such sizing system there is at least one size out of three that ensures stable contact with EOG electrodes for each subject tested.","Virtual Reality; Electrooculography; Biosignals","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

Which leads to highly polluted areas, affecting urban health. Besides, the growing mobility results in a higher number of traffic accidents on the main road network (NU.nl, 2017). And not only growing mobility, but also the urban development of our cities will have an influence on urban health. Suburban development causes a population level reliance on car use every day. This imposed reliance causes low physical activity levels in a lot of residential neighbourhoods among many industrialized countries (Badland &amp; Schofield, 2005). Physical inactivity, caused by dominance of the car in cities, the car dependency and infrastructural barriers in the city, can result in major health risks, especially in industrialized countries (Badland &amp; Schofield, 2005). When engaging in physical activity, local streets and public spaces have been identified as the most suitable spaces (Badland &amp; Schofield, 2005). <br/>The introduction of automated mobility will provide car users with new possibilities to do while traveling. As a consequence, people are willing to travel longer, and the frequency of trips might increase (Stead et al., 2018). Automated forms of traveling will be chosen over active forms of travelling, because of the ease and comfort of automated vehicles. All of this results in more and more cars on the streets and an increased traffic complexity. Summing up, the ever-growing mobility puts urban health at risk. On top of this, the introduction of automated mobility is posing a threat on various facets of urban health (personal lifestyles, accessibility, etc.), especially in residential neighbourhoods (because of the high car dependency). The following question is leading in this project: ‘‘How can the implementation of automated mobility contribute in improving urban health, in residential neighbourhoods in the city of Almere?’’.  Since this project is concerned with the topic automated mobility and the impact of it urban on health, the research type is a predictive one. Automated mobility is still in an early stage, it is uncertain what will happen in the future. Therefore, scenario planning will be at the heart of this project. For the progressive scenario a design is made for two neighbourhoods in Almere. Urban regeneration strategies are developed with a set of design elements and recommendations. Creating and retrofitting urban environments which will improve urban health. Promoting physical activity through urban design at the micro scale (neighbourhood scale) is one of the most effective measures to improve urban health. On top of this, strategies in reducing air pollution on the macro scale (city scale) will also be highly impactful in reducing diseases worsened by poor air quality. Besides, in the development of urban areas (on the district scale) a good accessibility to leisure facilities, healthy food, and public and green spaces can be integrated into the design to support health and well-being (Pineo &amp; Rydin, 2018). Slow traffic should get the full priority, therefore fast automated vehicles are only allowed on a limited number of roads.","Urban health; Residential neighbourhoods; Automated mobility; Scenario planning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Urbanism","","52.3508, 5.2647"

The topic of the graduation studio is the Hembrug area, a former military production site located South of Zaandam, Netherlands. Within the fortification “de stelling van Amsterdam” the Hembrug site functioned as the central point where weapons and ammunition were not only produced, but also tested. With the military leaving the site in 2000 it has become a large area to redevelop in the metropolitan area of Amsterdam. The object of the graduation is a building ensemble named the Ladder. The Ladder consists of 5 factory buildings, with a total floor surface of 7400 m², located in the South-East part of the military terrain. In this building, the shells of large grenades were produced. Notable is the fact that buildings in this ensemble are built within a span of 50 years (1926- 1969). The current trend in the development of the industrial harbour areas along the IJ and the Noordzeekanaal is to transform into living and working areas, to expand the metropolitan area of Amsterdam. This means that the overall inquiry of the project is that the area needs to be redeveloped, but the buildings, with their specific cultural historic values, are not direct in a usable state. The result of this graduation project is the architectural elaboration of the building ensemble The Ladder in relation to the cultural historical and social context. The new function of the ensemble will be a sport village, including housing and a public swimming pool.","Hembrug; Zaandam; transformation project; sportcentrum; Housing development; Swimming pool; industrial architecture; factory building","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","52.420318, 4.835917"

This project aims to implement a method for detecting when people fall, an issue that has seen much research and practical implementations already. In contrast to other work, this project aims to create a non-intrusive, non-wearable solution through the use of cameras. It extends an existing patient monitoring system developed by Eya Solutions, a start-up in the medical field. Their system monitors patients and is composed of embedded systems (clients), a back-end with a database, and a web-based dashboard (the front-end) for administrators, caretakers and users. Our client wants to extend their system by introducing: (i) a video processing component which performs face recognition, (ii) functionality for indoor positioning of people, (iii) functionality to automatically determine near-optimal placement of cameras, and (iv) automatic detection of fall incidents. To understand the relevant research, we survey the field investigating five key research topics: (i) object detection, (ii) fall detection, (iii) facial recognition, (iv) floor plan modelling, and (v) camera placement optimisation. The first part of the project is detecting fall incidents in video footage. By means of image processing (in particular, subsequent frame subtraction), our system detects objects in the foreground and tracks these between frames. Based on the properties of such objects, namely size and shape, we detect fall incidents. The second part of the project is the floor plan editor. This editor is integrated into the existing dashboard, where administrators can model the building. Eya Solutions wishes to provide the product to customers as a complete package, including (i) showing where fall incidents have occurred, and (ii) how and where to place cameras. Our system allows administrators to edit the floor while allowing caretakers to see the modelled floor and see where falls are detected. Considering (ii), it is desirable to generate a configuration where the number of cameras is low while the view coverage is high. Our contribution includes a genetic algorithm which can generate automatically a suitable configuration. Alternatively, cameras can be placed manually by the administrator.","Fall detection; Image processing; GUI; Elderly; Optimisation","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science and Engineering","",""

The demodulator, on the receiver side, can detect these variations and retrieve the audio signal. The modulator is implemented using a voltage controlled oscillator, which is based on the Colpitts oscillator. The input audio signal controls the oscillation frequency by modulating varicaps. The demodulator consists of mixer, amplifier and a slope detector. The amplifier is not discussed in this thesis. The mixer uses a local oscillator to shift the RF input signal to an intermediate frequency. This thesis proposes a mixer integrated into a local oscillator, using only one transistor. The detector is based on a slope detector, which differentiates the FM signal and converts it into an AM signal. The differentiator is implemented using a bandpass filter. The audio signal is retrieved from the AM signal using an envelope detector.

With the increasing share of variable renewables in the European power system, it becomes increasingly more important to find a way to deal with generation volatility. The Northwest European electricity system is particularly suitable for wind energy due to its vicinity to the North Sea. The large share of wind power generation can cause seasonal flexibility needs in the Northwest European power system. This research is focussed on the system effects of seasonal energy storage and cross-border transmission capacity on the future Dutch power system with a large share of wind energy. System effects in this context are the effects on the Dutch electricity market regarding the dispatch of both flexibility options. Moreover, complementarity between the two options is researched. The unit commitment economic dispatch model Powerflex is used to analyse different levels of storage capacity in the Netherlands and different levels of interconnection between the Netherlands and Germany. The model was extended with a storage module based on dynamic programming for the purpose of this study. The storage is connected to the electricity market and to a hydrogen market with hydrogen price based on the production costs of steam reforming of natural gas. It can be concluded that cross-border transmission capacity leads to small system benefits if it is used to interconnect areas with similar RES potential, weather patterns and demand patterns. Moreover, it was found that storage capacity complements (increases the need for) interconnection capacity deployment, while interconnection capacity does not influence the need for storage capacity. Additionally, storage capacity leads to fewer price extremes and a reduction of curtailment needs. A storage capacity of 50% of the maximum negative residual demand in the Netherlands has been identified as an upper bound of storage requirements in the Netherlands. Limitations to this research are the limited scope with the Netherlands and Germany, the unrestricted hydrogen demand and the limited number of flexibility options. The results can be influenced if a more diverse set of flexibility options is modelled, such as curtailment, demand response and different storage technologies. A more diversified storage portfolio and more flexibility options are expected to lead to smaller storage requirements. Moreover, future research should focus on the limited predictability of renewable generation, research a broader set of flexibility options and on cost-benefit analyses of specific cases. Policy recommendations are to promote the development of hydrogen storage, encourage a highly interconnected European electricity grid and secure back-up capacity by for instance capacity remunerations as their profitability lowers when storage capacity is available.","Seasonal storage; Cross-border transmission capacity; Electricity market effects; Complementarity; Unit Commitment Economic Dispatch Model; Power system flexibility","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The scientific relevance of my thesis project is reflected in the design, as the entire research process was closely related to the three themes. I started off my thesis with the research question of the character of my site, i.e. the Head of the Cape. Along this line of inquiry, I evaluated the existing buildings around my site by their typology, structure, spatial quality and also materiality. I realized from the results that they are the crucial components to cultivate the industrial atmosphere, the greatest cultural value of my site. To translate the findings into an architectural design that inherits the industrial character, I took the building typology as a design starting point. The former ammunition factory is made of four consecutive and identical 70-meters long curved shell tubes, a profile of repeated components which is typical for the factories built in 1950s. A new tube with the same curved profile is added and attached to the factory on its southern side. The idea for the transformation is to create a gradual change in spatial experience throughout the building, from solid to transparent, from closed to open, from dark to bright, from indoor to outdoor, from rough surfaces to fine finishes. In order to distinguish the new intervention and the existing building, the new tube is made of transparent material, creating a contrast to the existing brick facades. A new time layer is added with respect to the old ones. The third aspect of the studio is building technology. The new intervention is more than a repetition of the existing shape; it is also a statement of being innovative. As the ambition of my project is to inspire innovation, I was convinced to integrate innovative solutions that can make the building more climatically sustainable, yet at the same time still retain its qualities. It aligns with the central theme of the heritage studio, the exploration on how to give an old building a new life. The new tube can be opened and closed to regulate temperature in different seasons. In summer time, the glass box is open to allow breeze into the building and thus enhance natural ventilation. In winter time, the glass tube will be closed completely and create a sun space to mitigate the cold weather.","Heritage & Architecture; Innovation; Hembrug; The Head of the Cape; Kinetic facade","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Despite venipuncture being the most performed procedure at hospitals, almost 50% of all cases fail at the first needle insertion attempt with adults and more than 60% with children.

This product will have minimal viable functionalities to aid the venipuncture procedure. The Veindicator is a device which uses Near Infrared spectroscopy to visualise veins. Near infrared spectroscopy analyses the transmission and absorption of photons within the near infrared spectrum. Veins contain deoxygenated hemoglobin which, when exposed to near infrared radiation, almost completely absorb this radiation. By utilising the absorption characteristics of deoxyhemoglobin, veins can be distinguished from surrounding tissue. To further enhance the contrast of the vein pattern and the surrounding tissue, the exposure of NIR is increased. Looking at the optical absorption window, a light source is used with a wavelength between 700 - 900 nanometer within the electromagnetic spectrum. Here, the deviation between the attenuation coefficients of deoxyhemoglobin and human tissue are the highest. The image of the enhanced veins is captured and contrast is further increased by the use of digital image processing algorithms.

In the past years, several incidents and accidents have made RWS see the value of innovation when it comes to the control of objects. This master thesis will, therefore, start with defining which problems are relevant to operators and which solutions benefit them in object operations. To gather inside on the deeper knowledge, experiences and emotions of operators during the operation process, contextmapping was used. Contextmapping enhances the operator’s own understanding of experiences around safe object operations. To validate the contextmapping findings, 13 operators were interviewed using a combination of semi-structured interviews and the Scenes™ method. The results from the contextmapping sessions and interviews were visualised in an operator segmentation and an operator journey map. The segmentation allows for a better understanding of the target group, when to utilise their expertise during the innovation process and how they will react towards specific solutions. A design roadmap containing 5 horizons was created to provide RWS with an innovation strategy for the future of object control. In order to deliver an optimal service for both road and waterway traffic, while accommodating both RWS and the operator’s values the future vision regarding object operations will be: the future of object control will be an all-inclusive system to increase safety and traffic flow on water and land. The concepts proposed in these horizons all contribute to reaching this final vision. Furthermore, it is advised to keep involving the operators throughout every horizon using creative methods.","Roadmap; Contextmapping; innovation implementation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

The determinant role of architects in design process and free interpretation of the inhabitants pose the conflictions. Our (architects) creativities and imaginations are confined within the given role and limited with operabilities. Given the roles of designers, we keep outputting active forms for specific functions under the established rules. Programs, dimensions, functions and circulations etc. are introduced into the design, not necessary for the needs of inhabitants, but the demands for well-functioned and convenient purposes. While inhabitants’ perceptions and sensations are constrained within the frameworks set up by the architects. The understandings of determinacy in space are always structured under the existing systems. Even though, it remains a certain extent of indeterminacy in these spaces which is hardly controllable by the ‘dictators.' The inhabitants construct our understanding of the environments by composing fragmented pieces that we encountered by chance. Even if buildings have significantly been distanced from social life through technical and bureaucratic processes, architecture still reflects society. The fast rate of social and technological change and an increasingly autonomous building process led in the same period to a widespread belief in loose-fit between buildings and their contents, and a romantic desire for open-ended flexibility.","Indeterminacy; Blurry; uncertainty","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","Borders andTerritories","41.724046, 44.803119"

GANs have achieved great results in realistic image generation, among other fields. Recently, stunning images have been produced. The theory and application of GANs has received much attention. However, the evaluation of these models has not been studied nearly as extensively. GANs are often evaluated by visual inspection. This is a time consuming process, that inherently suffers from being subjective. There has been research into quantitative metrics, which can be automated. There has even been some research into the relative merits of such metrics. [1][9][4]. However, the question which metric is the most suitable for evaluating GANs in the field of realistic image generation remains open. It is important that consensus is reached. If there is no agreed upon method of objectively measuring progress, it is hard to say which techniques are effective. This impedes the entire field of study. This paper hopes to contribute to answering this question by applying a variety of proposed metrics to a variety of different GANs. This way, it is possible to tell which metrics agree with each other, and which rate GANs differently. If all, or many, of the likely metrics proposed in earlier work agree with each other, this is a good sign that they are rating GANs objectively. The results of this experiment are combined with a very brief survey of earlier work, in order to recommend some quantitative metrics for rating GANs.","GAN; GAN evaluation; Generative Adversarial Network; Quantitative metrics; Quantitative analysis","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Due to the low altitudes, a satellite's orbital state is highly affected by the atmospheric drag force acting on the satellite's body. The largest variation in this drag force is caused by the changes in thermospheric density due to the complex interactions of the Sun with the Earth's thermosphere. In order to properly forecast the orbital state of a LEO satellite, the thermospheric densities need to be predicted as accurately as possible. The thermospheric density values can be estimated by using for example empirical atmospheric density models, such as the DTM2013 (Drag Temperature Model). During this thesis study it has been investigated whether the highly researched field of machine learning models could be used to develop a predictor for the along-track density values for the Swarm satellite constellation. This constellation has an abundant amount of trajectory-based time series of thermospheric density values from Precise Orbit Determination (POD) data. This research has focused on the development of Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) models which are a type of Feed-Forward Neural Network. These MLP models have been trained and tested on past acceleration and solar activity data sets provided by the Swarm satellite mission and space weather observatories, respectively. The performance of these MLP models was then compared to two baseline models, namely a Calibrated Persistence Model (CPM) and the density values modelled by DTM2013. The results in this research led to the conclusion that a three-layer MLP model performed best when it was trained on data of the same spacecraft like the one it was supposed to perform along-track density forecasts for. The forecasting accuracy increased the most when the model was trained on long periods of training data characterised by high solar and low geomagnetic activity. When trained on these data sets, the MLP model has shown to outperform the baseline models when making predictions up until two days into the future during periods of high solar activity. The DTM2013 seems the best option to forecast density values during low solar activity. As an alternative to the DTM2013, the CPM seems a suitable model when one needs to quickly implement a forecasting model with decent performance irrespective from the presence of geomagnetic storms.","DTM2013; Thermosphere; POD-derived Densities; Machine Learning; Neural Networks; Multi-layer Perceptron; Tensorflow; Python; Time Series Forecasting; Swarm Satellite Constellation; Low Earth Orbit","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Hydrogen gas is such a contender, as it can partly use the existing natural gas pipeline infrastructure, is feasible for long-term energy storage and emits no greenhouse gasses. By utilizing green electricity from renewable energy sources, water electrolysis can be applied to produce hydrogen gas. In this thesis, the integration of a large-scale electrolyser within an industrial grid is proposed. The industrial grid consists of a 15-bus medium voltage grid with numerous industrious loads, two wind farms and a power exchange with the transmission grid. A 10MW Proton-Exchange Membrane electrolyser is coupled with a 18 MW wind farm with the aim to produce green hydrogen in a cost-effective manner, while also providing power scheduling and balancing. Load demand depends on the available wind power over the long-term, while also mitigating fluctuations due to intermittent renewable power production. The economic feasibility of the large-scale electrolyser is analysed as well. <br/>OpenModelica is used to model the industrial grid with PSAT components, based on a CIGRE benchmark system for renewable technologies. A mathematical model is implemented to simulate the electrochemical process of water electrolysis, and a rule-based controller is designed and implemented with a smart control strategy to control the load demand of the electrolyser. The power demand is determined by various input data such as wind forecast, intraday market prices and real-time wind power. The results showcases an effective integration of a large-scale electrolyser that can adapt to changing wind power patterns to provide a stable power flow to the industrial grid. The economic analysis shows a cost price of hydrogen to be in the range of ""50.99-90.65/MWh, which is still significant higher compared to natural gas prices.","Electrolyser; Smart grid; Hydrogen; Industrial Microgrid; Power System Modelling; Scheduling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

(mentor); Ploeger, Hendrik (graduation committee); Hagemans, Ivo (graduation committee); Dabroek, G (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","In this thesis, a proof of concept is developed that describes a complete data processing chain for registering new apartment rights in 3D. This chain starts by defining and adding legal space to Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) Building Information Model (BIM) models. Once the IFC BIMs are enriched with legal space, the 3D parcels are automatically extracted. The legal space is checked and validated, and stored in a Land Administration Domain Model (LADM) compliant database. Finally, the legal space is visualised on a desktop and browser-based client. Currently, there is no functional 3D Cadastral system functional in the Netherlands. A pilot study has been conducted to register 3D rights on the railway station in the city of Delft. This complex area contained many stacked objects such as a tunnel, offices, shops, etc. [Stoter et al., 2017]. However, the 3D drawings of the area were stored in a PDF document, which only serves as a visualisation tool in a separate document in the Public Registers. As a result, it is not possible to check for overlap with other 3D Cadastral objects. This research focuses on registering apartment rights for a 3D cadastre by using IFC BIM models as source data. Apartment rights are one of the most common rights found in apartment complexes. The IFC file format is chosen because it is the most widely used open data format for the exchange of BIM. In the Netherlands, submitting a IFC BIM file is mandatory for obtaining a construction permit for buildings with a value of 10 million euro or higher. IFC BIM files contain a lot of information, including 3D geometries of the indoor spaces, constructions and building infrastructure. However, there is no explicit information defining the individual apartments (property units). Therefore, the IFC is enriched with legal space in order to enable fully automatic extraction of the 3D spaces that belong to one apartment. This enrichment is based on analysing the current way of registering apartment rights using annotated 2D floorplans as part of a notarial deed [Kadaster, 2014, 2019c], analysing the Dutch legal system related to apartment rights, and based on this knowledge make a proposal for enriched IFC IFC files. To reach practical suggestions for the IFC enrichment, that can be used in the Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry, stakeholders such as notaries, the Dutch cadastre, BIM experts and other parties are involved. Also, current guidelines and practices in the Netherlands on IFC usage have been taken carefully into consideration, such as specification documents of the National Government and the National BIM Platform. The conclusions of this research are that it is possible to enrich IFC BIM model with legal space in such a way that it fits current IFC BIM practices and legal system as much as possible. This is demonstrated with two use cases that describe the registration process of a (fictional) new apartment building, and sub splitting apartment rights of a (fictional) existing building. It is also concluded that there is still many future work to be done, such as improving the definition of legal space in IFC, further researching cadastral administration systems, and the changes to the current in the legal system that are required to facilitate 3D registration of property units.","ifc; bim; cadastre; legal; space","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geomatics","",""

Today, nearly fifteen percent of the world's population lives in poverty in urban areas, of which the majority can be found in the Global South. This includes India, which has the second largest urban population in the world. Mumbai is India's largest city and the most densely settled city in the world, with around 21.000 people per square kilometer. An on-going process of urbanization has led to an increasing urban population of 1,8 million in 1812, to 18,4 million in 2010. Unfortunately, only 5 percent of the population can afford a house in the city of Mumbai, causing more than half of its population living in informal settlements, such as slums and chawls, covering only 6 percent of the city's land. The inability of the government to provide sufficient formal, affordable housing has emerged as a serious crisis. With a still increasing urban population, the housing shortage is expected to reach 34,1 million units by 2022. Current densification developments to provide more dwelling units to deal with the increasing demand for affordable housing is only focused on efficiency. In other words: building as much, as quickly and as cheaply as possible. It totally ignores the aspects that improve the quality of life and disregards the understanding of how the built environment affects social sustainability.

The Bosnian genocide in the early 90’s not only impacted the political and urban structure but also was a severe blow to the social structure. Mostar and Mostarki were synonymous to tolerant cohesive society. Neretva was one such important element of this society but over the years the people distanced itself from the river. The underlying effects of the war overpower the affordances and affects that are existing throughout the city and especially along Neretva. With these gradually decaying territories co-existing with rampant reconstruction to bring back the just image, a heterogeneity has resulted in present day Mostar. The urban transformations have also resulted in an overused and exploited river with increased erosion, sewage discharge and energy generation. In order to respond to the complex situation as experienced in Mostar, the project adopts a framework based on the theory of affects.

Long known as one of the country’s richest agricultural regions, in recent years it has also become known as one of the world’s most densely urbanized areas. Decreasing space for water through dyke-ring construction, channelization and urbanization has led to increased flood risk from the river, rain, and the sea. To protect residents from flood risk, a more adaptive urbanization strategy is required, one that takes account of ecological agriculture (e.g. the traditional dyke-pond system) as well as historical water-management methods, which uses a multi-scalar approach. The objective of this thesis is to identify landscape architecture principles for multiscale water sensitive design based on traditional agri-aquacultural practice in this region. In Shunde district, a flood prone lowland located between the West and North rivers in the PRD, there is a century-old tradition in working with water via integrated agri-aquaculture systems. By learning from traditional agri-aquacultural practices, new design principles can be developed to mitigate flood risk while allowing for increased but sustainable urbanization, not just for the Shunde district, but also for the Pearl River Delta, so that they can be more resilient to flood risk in the future. Finally, an article called ""Learning from Agri-Aquaculture for Multiscale Water-Sensitive Design in the Pearl River Delta"" is also written by the author and Steffen Nijhuis and Gregory Bracken about principles and application through study.","Adaptive urban transformation; Water sensitive design; Multiscale strategies; Dyke-pond system; Landscape design principles","en","master thesis","","","","","","An article called ""Learning from Agri-Aquaculture for Multiscale Water-Sensitive Design in the Pearl River Delta"" is also written by Chuanzhi Sun, Steffen Nijhuis and Gregory Bracken about principles and application through study.","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Landscape Architecture","AUT",""

Markermeerpolder's rejection in the 80's meant that the decision was made to develop the city centre elsewhere causing Lelycentre lose its intended position. Today Lelycentre shopping centre, which once resembled Rotterdam’s Lijnbaan, serves the local communities with a quiet but healthy bustle of activity. However the majority of surrounding office buildings have gone through a series of changes in use over the last 40-50 years and are now vacant. One such building is the former police station, which the police vacated in 2018 in favour of a more central city location. The police station is integrated into Lelycentre's characteristic elevated infrastructure and boasts a unique and recognisable façade. It is positioned as the southern gateway into Lelycentre. In a masterplan wherein much of the existing vacancy is filled with housing, this work explores a situation where the former police station a.k.a. ZIJP gebouw is transformed into a cultural centre for new and existing residents. The main challenges are establishing a balance between the architectural qualities of the existing office building whilst introducing transparency, openness, accessibility in direct contrast to the existing monumentality and sense of anonymity. Preserving and revitalising the elevated infrastructure is key, whilst creating a new relationship with the transformed ground level. The final point is to design sustainably and introduce passive design concepts.","transformation; heritage & Architecture; Office vacancy; sustainability; cultural values; preservation; dutch new towns","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Heritage & Architecture","",""

However, after decades of coastal accretion, in the last years, a strong coastline retreat is observed at the island head in the northwest. In tidal inlets, various forcing conditions of tides, waves, winds and estuarine circulation can all influence the pathways and magnitude of sediment transport. The dominance of any one of these processes can have a controlling influence on the morphology of the delta, inlet and island coast. In the case of Schiermonnikoog it is unclear what drives the recently observed coastal erosion. Therefore, the relation between the ebb-tidal delta development and the coastal transgression has to be studied. With knowledge on the behavior of the system, well-founded decisions can be made about the policy and the management in the area. In this thesis, the newly developed Delft3D Flexible Mesh (FM) modeling suite has been used to set-up and calibrate a morphostatic model. This model consists of the coupled D-Flow FM (Kernkamp et al., 2011) and D-Waves modules (SWAN, Booij et al., 1999), and can adequately hindcast measured water levels, wave heights and the expected sediment transports in the investigated area at Schiermonnikoog. Model uncertainties are overcome by incorporating the entire Dutch Wadden Sea in the model schematization. The unstructured grid allows for a local increase of the resolution in the area of interest. By analyzing the influence of individual physical processes on the system, it is found that wave action is the main driver of the migration of the approaching sand shoal. With the present-day bathymetry, the flood channel in front of the island coast no longer experiences significant tidal currents due to its hydraulic inefficiency. This indicates its upcoming abandonment, which would allow for the attachment of the sand shoal to the island coast. However, wave-driven currents and related sediment transport through the channel obstruct a closure. Similar to the situation at a the neighboring barrier island Ameland in 2014, a divergence point in the channel is visible at the location where the largest waves reach over the approaching sand shoal. The resulting gradient in the wave heights and consequent gradient in the alongshore sediment transport can be linked to the observed coastal erosion. This shows the importance of the shape of the sand shoal for the coastal dynamics in the system. To better understand the final stage before the abandonment of a flood channel, a conceptual model is presented.","ebb-tidal delta; Schiermonnikoog; shoal migration; wave sheltering; flood channel","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","","53.497679, 6.139687"

Therefore more and more highways are widened and expanded. These wider highways create a demand for bridges which are suited for longer spans. These bridge solutions should constructed with a minimum of hindrance for other traffic. Rijkswaterstaat, also wishes to reduce the number of intermediate supports so the space underneath a viaduct can be used more freely. The currently most used solution to build a highway overpass without disrupting the traffic too much is a concrete viaduct consisting of prefabricated prestressed concrete bridge beams. But for spans longer than 60 meters those beams become too long and too heavy for transport by truck to the building site. Therefore the existing bridge solutions are reaching the maximum distance to which they can be built. The primary goal of this report is to find a concrete bridge solution with which it is possible to construct longer bridge spans in prefabricated concrete up to 100 meters. With such a bridge solution it is also possible to span a waterway or a small river in the Netherlands. A beam bridge in which the beam is composed of three parts is the most suitable solution to build these longer spans in prefabricated concrete. This solution can be constructed with relatively little hindrance for the other traffic. This solution is also relatively flexible in the shapes of bridge decks that can be constructed, skew bridges and wide bridge decks are both possible. The design of this beam bridge is extended and analyzed with a more detailed calculation. A bridge span of 100 meters is possible with a construction height of only 3 meters. This relatively slender design is possible because high strength concrete is used and because the bridge deck is designed to spread the traffic load efficiently over the full width of the bridge deck. The beam parts of this bridge can be transported by truck to its destination. <br/>A rough cost estimation shows that the designed solution is expensive compared to existing concrete beam bridges, but it is also possible that the designed solution has a lower cost price compared to existing solutions in steel. It is advised to continue the research to and development of the bridge design because of the possible lower cost price and because with this design, bridges can be constructed which currently cannot easily be constructed with the existing solutions.","Bridge design; Prefab; Concrete; 100 meter Span; High strength concrete; Multi-Cell Bridge; Spanbeton","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-07-01","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

Finally we use the matrix exponential to get a general measure of distance between proteins and locations. We find that, compared to the first simple algorithm, more complex methods fail to make adequate predictions. Analyzing the algorithms reveals that this might be a result of the fact that the networks are strongly connected. As a result the simple localized algorithm performs much better than the other algorithms that take the complete graph into account.","","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science and Engineering","CSE3000 Research Project",""

The goal of the fall detection system is to detect and alarm when an elderly person has fallen. The subsystem covers communication between hardware and software, using the WiFi protocol MQTT. The communication is fast enough so that it does not limit other subsystem performance and allows for high expandability to accommodate the hardware’s modular design. The interface module receives a probability of fall occurrence from the separate processing module, from which an average is taken over a 30 second time window to avoid false positives. Alarming is done through the use of text-to-speech voice API to make automated phone calls that retrieve user input to confirm or deny that help is on the way. A habit tracker proof of concept is provided that could improve the accuracy of fall detection by checking if the client is showing anomalies during a given day. A user interface is implemented using the Kivy environment. This environment has its own language which allows for separation of functionality and layout, which keeps the interface elements separate and leads to ease of use. Overall, this results in a strong alternative for fall detection that could be used to improve the time an elderly person can live at home safely without the need to move to a nursing home.","Fall detection; MQTT; Habit tracking","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering","Bachelor End Project",""

It represents a significant opportunity to shape the future of the Pearl River Delta region. <br/><br/>In the last decades, this region has experienced an unprecedented rise of urbanisation and a rapid economic growth positioning itself as the future centre of global economy. However, the uneven development has been the reason behind several environmental and socio-spatial challenges that threaten the future of this mega region. The research intends to comprehend these issues under the fragmentation perspective, by classifying and analysing the challenges within three main themes (Society, Economy and Environment) in three different scales. Furthermore, the research proposes that the integration of bio-physical infrastructures (Green and blue network) respecting the natural ecosystem and the delta conditions throughout the whole process of development and urbanisation, will help redefine the future of globalisation in the GBA. In order to achieve that, an explorative method using the ‘strips game’ was used as a method to produce a vision and urban scenarios on multiple scales providing functional and spatial distributions. This method was conducted in Hong Kong to give access to the feeling and environment in question.","Urbanisation; Globalisation; The Greater Bay area; Hong-Kong; Green and Blue infrastructure; Integration; Fragmentation","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","","22.3193, 114.1694"

Con- ventional production methods limit the performance by putting constraints on both. With additive manufacturing, or 3D-printing, there are signi- cantly fewer geometry constraints and together with the ability to combine multiple materials into a continuous gradient new performance optimization opportunities are created. In the current 3D-printing world it is possible to print single-material or discrete gradient multi-material objects by trans- lating a CAD model to printer instructions. This translation is done with slicer software that slices a 3D-model and outputs printer instructions in a G-Code le. This thesis looks at how an object with a continuous gradient can be printed. A modied version of the popular Cura slicing software is presented that can apply an approximation of a continuous gradient to an input model. The printer paths are simulated with the slicer software and ultimately printed using TNO's multi-material 3D-printer. While the print results show that energetic materials behave in such a dierent way than normal plastics that 3D-printing them it is not an easy task, printing a 3D-model with a multi-material continuous gradient is certainly viable.","3D-printing; Additive Manufacturing; Energetic Materials; Multi-Material Additive Manufacturing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-07-01","","","","Electrical Engineering | Embedded Systems","",""

The goal of the system is to detect falls and alarm the relevant personnel when an elderly person has fallen. The fall detection algorithm has a strong connection with the interface subsystem, which uses the algorithm as a function. The interface subsystem supplies matrices containing the raw sensor values of the pressure floor. The algorithm has been divided into multiple sub-algorithms. First, pre-processing: data linearization was applied on the raw sensor values and the sensor matrix was processed such that an image formed that looked like the real world scenario. Second, image processing techniques were applied to detect contours. Contours were being tracked through time, and being grouped. The characteristics of the contours and groups were used to classify falls. Tests have been done to validate the behaviour of the algorithm, from which an average false negative ratio of 30% was achieved in a time window of 30 seconds. The created prototype proves that image processing is a viable tool for detecting falls with the use of a pressure-based floor sensor.

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","Industrial heritage buildings are a significant part of the total building stock. Most of these buildings have a higher energy consumption. This means that it will have a positive impact on the climate when these buildings are renovated. Next to that, the vacancy of heritage buildings, especially industrial heritage, is increasing. In the early 1900 industrial buildings were placed on the edge of a city. Now that cities are expanding they are becoming obsolete and near the city centre. After renovating these buildings they can be reused and will benefit the surroundings. <br/>These buildings have certain cultural values and are part of the cultural heritage. This is why it is valuable to maintain their cultural values during a renovation. This can be complex if there is a lack of knowledge about the different renovation measures. To lower the threshold of these renovation projects a research is done with the main question: ‘How can a decision-support model be created that analyses renovation measures to improve the balance between costs, sustainability, and cultural values in industrial heritage renovation projects?’. The focus is laid on several aspects: cultural values, sustainability, heritage laws, costs, and technique. The research will be done based on literature reviews, empirical research containing case studies and an operational research conducted during an internship at ABT. The goal is to create a model that supports decision making by weighing the impact of different renovation measures on the aspects costs, sustainability, and cultural value in a renovation project. This will result in an overview of which measures, such as applying insulation, will be best to use during a renovation project.","industrial heritage; Decision support model; cultural value; sustainability; Costs","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
