This has resulted in an opportunity for passwordless authentication technologies. Biloq is an early stage venture which aims to develop hardware and software to provide continuous authentication without the burden of extra login steps that are present in existing technologies such as 2FA. This project aims to identify lead users for Biloq’s new product in the cybersecurity space. To answer this research question, first desk research was done to identify current trends in authentication technologies. This was followed by a stakeholder analysis to identify the people who are involved in ensuring the cybersecurity of their organisation, specifically with respect to the robustness of digital systems and how their staff perform authentication on a daily basis. After this, semi-structured interviews were conducted with the identified stakeholders to spot behavioral and preference patterns and narrow down as precisely as possible the type of persona which would most likely be interested to adopt Biloq’s new products and services. The final outcome of the project is identification of lead users for this new paradigm of authentication.<br","User Authentication; Lead Users; New Product Launch","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The Physical Internet (PI) proposes a paradigm shift in the way we move, store, supply, realize and use goods. The goal of the PI is to interconnect global supply chains, amongst others, on a digital level. For this, information systems are needed. Seaports, being drivers of global supply chains, therefore also need information systems on an integral level. In certain ports, Port Community Systems (PCS) serve as port’s information systems. They facilitate information exchange between stakeholders to better connect port processes. This research explores the potential role of PCS in PI ports. It does so by performing a Design Science Research (DSR). The artefact that is designed, is a conceptual information system that addresses key (PI) port functions. A case study analysis at Portbase, the Dutch PCS, has revealed what information is exchanged between which stakeholders. PI literature provides grip for PI information system requirements. The integration of the PCS analysis and the PI requirements has led to a design of an information system that shows the potential of a PCS in a PI port. The design shows that, according to the current offer of PCS services, PCS’ potential role focuses mainly on compliance related processes in PI ports. It also shows that the offer of logistics related services that are needed in PI ports, is limited. It is therefore recommended that PCS focus on an extension of logistics related services that are needed in PI ports. Future research may address the potential of PCS in a federated network of platforms.","Port Community Systems; Physical Internet; Information systems; Design Science Research; Case study","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Transport, Infrastructure and Logistics","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Excess CO2 in the atmosphere has been a troublesome problem for humanity for the last few decades now. Academics, governments and industries are working together to tackle this problem to avert a global warming disaster. Research on many technologies is in progress to tackle global warming, with carbon capture being one exciting solution. The process of converting this captured carbon dioxide into something useful has gained momentum in research and academia since the 1980s. Out of the many catalysts worked upon to convert the excess CO2, copper has gained particular limelight because of its exceptional ability to reduce CO2 into valuable products such as methane, formic acid, ethane, methanol, to name a few.<br/><br/>The literature study associated with this project identified a knowledge gap between the present literature and the understanding of the microstructural impact on CO2 reduction. The thesis project studied the effect of microstructure changes on the electrochemical properties of copper and its subsequent impact on CO2 reduction capabilities to bridge the knowledge gap. Sigma- Aldrich copper of purity 99.999% was selected for this thesis work, and four samples: as received, electropolished, and two annealed samples were prepared. Optical microscopy and XRD measurements were used for microstructural characterization, and it was found that annealed samples lost their rolling direction, and their grain sizes increased. Evaluation of electrochemical behaviour through CV and EIS results indicated the formation of a complex triple passivation layer on the copper samples. Through evaluation of EIS results, we found that the electropolished sample had the most robust Cu2O layer.<br/><br/>From the CO2 reduction experiments, it was found that as-received samples had the highest F.E. for CO2 reduction, and non-electropolished samples had a high F.E. for hydrogen production. The performance of the electropolished sample stood out with a high F.E. of 46.3% for hydrocarbon production. The reason for this behaviour was, possibly, the presence of robust Cu2O layers that prevented the sample from catalyst poisoning and helped form a strong bond with CO* (carbon monoxide free radical).<br/><br/>The thesis opened up avenues for further research. By further investigation of factors like grain orientation and grain boundary density combined with XPS results, the understanding of the complex nature of passive layers formed on copper during CO2 reduction can be improved, which will ultimately help develop better catalysts.","CO2 reduction; Electrochemistry; CCUS; co2 conversion; Cyclic voltammetry; Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Materials Science and Engineering","",""

MOND is a theory proposed to explain the flat rotation curves of galaxies and the velocities of galaxies within galaxy clusters, as an alternative to the Dark Matter (DM) model. MOND states that Newton’s law of gravitation is incorrect at accelerations of the order of and smaller than Milgrom’s constant a_0 = 1.2 · 10^−10m/s^2 [1]. <br/>The MOND potential φ_M created by a certain mass distribution ρ satisfies the MOND equation, a non-linear partial differential equation. For accelerations much smaller than a0 this equation gives a quadratic relation between the gradient of the potential (∇φ_M) and the mass distribution ρ, this is called deep MOND. This is much different from the Poisson equation, that infers a linear relation between ∇φ_M and the mass sources, and which still holds for accelerations much larger than a_0 [1], referred to as Newtonian Dynamics (ND). For accelerations around a0 an interpolation of deep MOND and ND is used. It appears that the potential and acceleration in Virgo-like clusters is according to ND at the center, and approaches deep MOND at the edge. Therefore an interpolation function µ is necessary to model such clusters accurately.<br/>When the MOND potential φ_M is substituted into the Poisson equation, a new mass distribution is found, the apparent mass distribution ρ_AM, which would need to match the actual mass distribution in DM models, which use the Poisson equation. This apparent mass distribution ρ_AM is the sum of the actual mass distribution ρ extracted from optical observations and the apparent dark mass distribution ρ_ADM, a distribution that is interpreted as a theoretical DM halo. This allows us to compare MOND and DM. With our method, realistic mass configurations of galaxy clusters that are Virgo-like, generate apparent mass distributions ρ_AM with regions containing negative mass. The existence, shapes and locations of these regions are in agreement with what Milgrom found [2]. The total mass of the actual mass distribution is M = 10^15M_sun, while the sum of the negative mass is M_negative ≈ −0.09 · 10^15M_sun = −0.09M is approximately 9% of the total mass. Since negative mass is not acceptable, this gives us the opportunity to create conditions to falsify either the MOND model or the DM model. ","MOND; Dark Matter; Virgo; Galaxy cluster","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics | Applied Physics","",""

When targets share their path, agents can calculate where each of the targets can be intercepted and with that, increase the efficiency of the assignments. This leads to about half the number of iterations needed or about two-thirds of the distance that the agents need to travel.<br/>We also introduce two variations: allowing agents to catch multiple targets and using only specific stopping locations. Allowing agents to catch multiple targets slightly lowers both the number of iterations and the agent distance needed. Using only specific stopping locations increases the number of iterations needed, but has next to no effect on the agent distance when using the targets' paths.<br","multi-agent; target path; cooperative; chase; algorithm","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This training dataset is divided in different feature classes and analyzed by SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to identify robust predictors. Also, the proposed XGBoost model application is separately trained on the experiment data and synthetic data, which is generated on the properties of experiment data. Both these applications are evaluated on the experiment data. The synthetic data, unlike the experiment data, allows the model to capture individual skill retention curves on a day-to-day basis, resulting in a 21\% prediction improvement for the learning curve data. Generalizing this XGBoost model to more types of tasks remains challenging since experiments to gather concise task data are uncommon, and (complex) skill experiments usually demand long time intervals. <br/>However, this research shows that the experiment data of a skill-based tracking tasks could be used to predict individual skill decay curves, which, in the future, could assist in improving retraining schedules of individuals.","XGBoost; SHAP; cybernetics; manual control; regression; synthetic data; individual skill retention","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2027-01-31","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

(mentor); Denkova, A.G. (mentor); Picken, S.J.

Iron deficiency is the most common cause of anaemia, and the most common nutritional disorder in the world. To increase dietary iron intake, iron fortification of staple foods commonly consumed by the general public is an effective approach to prevent and control iron deficiency anaemia. It is important to maximise the iron bioavailability (absorption by the human body) in these fortified products, since iron overload is also known to cause Since the diet of infants and toddlers revolves around milk, milk is a good food carrier to address iron deficiency anaemia in children. The aim of this project is to assess the influence of five factors on the bioavailability of iron fortified skim milk: (1) iron concentration, (2) molecular form of the added iron, (3) storage time after fortification, (4) the addition of an iron enhancer and (5) the addition of an iron inhibitor.<br/>Skim milk was fortified with FeC l2 and FeC l3 to 5 and 20 mmol Fe L−1<br/>and stored for 24 hours or one week.<br/>Part of the milk was further left untreated and to another part ascorbic acid (vitamin C) or tannic acid were added as respectively iron enhancer and iron inhibitor. The bioavailability of the iron in these milk samples was assessed on phase distribution and oxidation state, since it is believed that iron in the soluble phase of the milk and in the oxidation state Fe2+ is more bioavailable.<br/>Analysis showed that the difference in iron concentration induced a pH decrease, which was greater for the higher concentrations of iron and the molecular form FeC l3. The pH difference caused the percentage of iron present in the casein fraction to increase, in the protein fraction to decrease and did not influence the iron in the soluble phase. It was also found that the 20 mmol L −1 FeC l2 showed more iron in the soluble phase and more Fe2+, whereas no statistical difference was observed for the 5 mmol L −1 , which might also be due<br/>to the pH difference. The increase in storage time to one week was reflected by an increase in iron bound to the caseins. This shift was not reflected in a change of oxidation state. The addition of the iron enhancer (ascorbic acid) increased the iron present in the protein fraction and soluble phase, which was strengthened by the further decrease in pH. The chelation of iron by ascorbic acid did not necessarily reduce Fe3+ tot Fe2+; the Fe2+ decreased for the 20 mmol L −1 FeC l2, whereas it increased for the 20 mmol L −1 FeC l3. Lastly the<br/>addition of the iron inhibitor resulted in a significant decrease of Fe2+. Most iron was bound to the casein or precipitated as iron-tannic acid complex.<br/>Overall, this research confirmed that the bioavailability of milk is not easily evaluated, since the behaviour of iron in milk depends on many different factors that can not be studied isolated. Only by evaluating many possible combinations of concentration, molecular forms, additives and storage conditions, the bigger puzzle can be solved. This project attributed to a part of the solution and is therefore a valuable contribution in the development of bioavailable milk products, that will reduce iron deficiency anaemia in children.","iron; bioavailability; milk","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Physics","",""

(graduation committee); Trienekens, George (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Rapid intake of intermittent generation units, more decentralised production and electrification of demand impose serious challenges on transmission- and distribution electricity grids. Part of this challenge is an increasing amount of congestion on the grids. The Dutch redispatch market for congestion management needs to be adapted to include small-scale flexible assets in the electricity system for congestion remedial purposes. It is however unknown how the institutional configuration of this market-based congestion management system should be altered to facilitate small-scall flexible assets to provide their flexibility. To do suggestions to improve the current market design, this research combined an institutional analysis based on transaction cost theory with a market design approach. The research has looked at how the transaction from a congestion service provider is currently aligned with the current governance structure, such that possible misalignments could be found. Next, a design space was constructed indicating several choices leading to the eventual market design. By relating this design space to the earlier found problems, different means were found in- and outside the design space. This research has found two main issues that need to be solved. First, a solution needs to be sought regarding the relationship between a congestion service provider and a balancing responsible party. Secondly, it was found that the transaction of flexibility from a congestion service provider to a system operator is surrounded with too much uncertainty and asset specificity is too high. These characteristics of the transaction lead to transaction costs. Given the incentives that follow from the current market-based governance structure, these transaction costs are too high and hamper market parties in utilising their flexibility. The research thereafter has provided insights in means to lower transaction costs related to this uncertainty and asset specificity. Examples of these means are related to the information provision by system operators, defining capacity-based products and making changes to current product definitions.<br/>Further research is necessary to investigate the impact of the broad landscape of transactions in relation to the transaction that was examined in this research. Further research could also focus more on the relation between physical congestion and structural congestions, and relate congestion to other system services. <br","Electricity market design; Distributed energy resources; Congestion management; Redispatch","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

(mentor); Bisagni, C. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","The Europa Lander is a mission by NASA to land scientific instruments on the Jovian Moon by 2030. The current design of the landing system envisions fixed landing legs with the lander being lowered down at very low velocities (≈ 0.1 m/s) by use of a Skycrane. This latter system not only adds mass, but also requires complicated moving parts and a high reliance on control systems to work properly. This thesis wants to propose an alternative design to the Europa Lander Landing System that uses sturdier legs that can withstand landing at higher velocities than originally envisioned. This eliminates the need to use a Skycrane system. In order to pack them in a more efficient way while coasting, the landing legs are of the deployable type.<br/>In order to track the deployment dynamics of the landing system a 2-dimensional Matlab deployment model based on double pendulum motion with damping is created. Furthermore, in order to prove the landability with a prescribed landing case, a landing model is created using FEA software Abaqus. The landing model is used to make sure that stresses, strains and G forces applied to the rest of the lander don’t exceed prescribed values as dictated by requirements. The implementation of both models is verified by comparing models found in literature with the ones made for the purpose of this thesis. Good correlation is shown with less than 10% of difference between literature results and results for this thesis.<br/>The result through the modelling found a specific geometry with parameters that include, but are not limited to: length of leg elements, joint damping and maximum deployment angles. The 2-dimensional geometry features output by the Matlab deployment model are fed into the Abaqus landing model in order to assess the landing performance with a single leg landing. The landing case has been chosen as a worst case scenario. 2 landing leg designs, with the same geometry, but one made of metallic parts and the other made of composite materials are compared in the landing model. In this model it was found that both designs pass the stress (or strain for the composite leg design) and G forces<br/>requirements when a shock absorber is attached to the leg and when they land on deformable Lunar like soil. On the other hand, the landing legs don’t pass G forces requirements when landing on stiff soil.<br/>Through the modelling, it was also possible to give preliminary design guidelines over the subsystems making the landing system. Therefore, system engineering practices have been used in order to initiate the design of some of the subsystems such as the landing damping, the leg joints and the locking mechanism to lock the legs at the desired angle and make sure they don’t retract. Simplifications have been made in order to model some of the landing and deployment aspects of the system for this thesis. Matters related to the adaptability and the detailed design of each of the subsystems have been left as future work.<br/>In the end, a comparison between the design developed in this thesis and the current Europa Lander Landing System design is made difficult by the lack of technical data on the latter related to mass. Nevertheless, a design that uses the decelerations of the engine module before touchdown is developed and the suggested material for the leg elements is CFRP. The design, though, didn’t pass mass fraction requirements when computing the mass of the extra subsystems. Even so, locations where potential gains through mass optimization can be performed for future studies have been pointed out.","Landing System; Finite Element Analysis; Europa; Deployable Structures","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","This work provides a water balance-based approach to improve understanding of drought trends by calculating root storage deficits in the United States. To do this, data is ultimately compiled from 1125 watersheds for the years 2001 to 2016. The root storage deficit is then determined using iteratively optimized transpiration values minus the water available to plants and compared to the latent heat of the FLUXCOM energy fluxes data. The stimulus for this work is a better understanding of desiccation processes. Answers to this are given only indirectly. For example, no concrete consequences can be derived from the calculated root storage deficits. Further-more, it turns out that the water cycle-based approach provides clearly interpretable results only for catchments with sufficient water supply. Thus, increasingly arid catchments do not satisfy the general conditions required for the calculations. Catchments in which the root storage deficit exceeds one meter are declared as ever-growing deficit. In these catchments an increased dry-ing process is to be assumed. In all other catchments, temporally congruent developments are shown for both applied methods. Due to the increased dependence on incoming precipitation, calculations performed with the CHIRPS dataset were repeated with the CRUNCEP dataset. This turns out to be generally smaller but confirms the drying processes suggested by the CHIRPS dataset. In contrast, the extents of drying suggested for both methods differ by up to 972 mm for the CHIRPS precipitation dataset, with holistically calculated root storage deficit maxima differing by an average of 178mm. This work is nonetheless useful because otherwise only grid dataset-based and thus statistically adjusted approaches are common in climatological science. Thus, the water cycle-based approach provides a concrete application of the raster values to point measurements.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This makes increasing the safety level more complicated than in other areas. The safety level of Valkenburg has a lower standard in comparison to the rest of the country, namely 1 in 25 years. The combination of those two characteristics is not desirable. Official documents<br/>state that this lower standard is based on detailed (societal) Cost-Benefit Analyses. In reality however, the safety standard is based on simple back of the envelope calculations. The Limburg Waterboard has indeed developed a Cost-Benefit tool which they could use to find out whether the implementation of safety measures are cost effective, however they have not been able to<br/>implement it until now. Additional safety measures to increase the safety level are assumed too costly based on the same brief calculations. It is doubtful whether individual risk laws are met, since the Limburg Waterboard assumes no casualties in the Geul area. The 2021 flood however showed that this might be false for future floods which get more severe over time due to climate change.<br/><br/>The citizens and entrepreneurs in Valkenburg were not completely aware of the risks they were exposed to and their sense of safety related to flooding decreased after the flood. Most of the people questioned in a survey demanded a higher safety level than the current standard. They would even be open for an increase in tax to realise this improvement. Raising the quay walls would be a cost-effective solution according to some of the citizens. However, the entrepreneurs who rely on tourist based income, do not prefer this option due to loss in aesthetic value.<br/><br/>Hydraulic, structural, and non-technical solutions which are investigated in this report, have the aim to increase the safety level or make the safety level more acceptable for citizens. The hydraulic, and structural solutions focus on four main aspects. The first aspect is related to the redesign of bridges in the city centre. This is mainly done by applying a flat bridges design, which is further elaborated with a case study for the collapsed Emmalaan bridge, and a liftable bridge design. The second aspect is related to closing the gaps in the quay walls, and increasing the height of the quay walls. The third aspect is related to the implementation of water tunnel concepts with six different design concepts. The fourth aspect is related to implementing parts of Meerssen’s 4-step approach. The first three aspects of the hydraulic and structural solutions are focused on increasing the discharge capacity of the Geul, while the latter aspect focuses on retaining, delaying, and storing the precipitation. Non- technical solution are also proposed<br/>that focus on making people more aware of the risk they are exposed to. This could eventually lead to more acceptance and thus more pleased citizens.<br/><br/>The first order estimations for investment costs and safety level for the hydraulic, and structural solutions are graphically displayed in order to provide an overview of possible interventions to the municipality of Valkenburg and the Limburg waterboard. Although preliminary, and based on limited available data, these results should encourage both stakeholders, and other relevant parties, to reconsider safety standards and search for measures that could increase the safety level of Valkenburg when desired.<br","Safety Standards; Valkenburg; Geul","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","","Multidiciplinairy project",""

Although low-cost crystal oscillators can easily be realized and are available to the market in large quantities, crystal oscillators with frequency stability in the ppb(10^{-9}) range over a wide temperature range are only available at high costs. In 2018, SemiBlocks B.V. proposed an improved technique so-called Multi-Mode Crystal Oscillator MMXO. The MMXO determines the output frequency through a triple mode oscillator and corrects this by an algorithm running on the internal microprocessor. The advantage of the MMXO is that it uses regular AT-Cut crystals and the whole circuitry can be implemented in silicon, and the frequency selective network is implemented by digital technology. This results in a low-cost and high-stability crystal oscillator solution.<br/><br/>However, the measurement result of the first generation MMXO showed that the large temperature dependent phase shift of the analog crystal chain significantly influences frequency stability of the MMXO. This inaccuracy is out of the compensation ability of the multi-mode system since it is highly dependent on the analog network rather than the crystal. For the improvement of the next generation MMXO product, this thesis aims at designing a CMOS crystal filter, which should reflect the characteristic of crystal accurately. Any change of resonance frequency of the tested crystal should accurately match that of the frequency characteristic of the crystal filter. The objective is to control frequency error below 10ppb for the three resonance tones of the tested crystal over -40 to 100 $^{\circ}$C.<br/><br/>The design of the crystal filter follows a structured methodology and combines analysis and simulations in Cadence together with SLICAP (Symbolic Linear<br/>Circuit Analysis Program), which helps researchers quickly find the early design solution and show-stopper before circuit design. The crystal filter is a two-stage amplifier. The first stage is a transadmittance stage, which reflects the frequency characteristic of the crystal by a current output. The second stage is a transimpedance stage, which makes the output of the TA stage observable to the ADC of the MMXO system. The pre-layout simulations show the the frequency error of the base tone and the third overtone is close to $10$ ppb, while the fifth overtone has a large frequency error around $252$ ppb. The crystal filter allows full range input of the tested ADC and is stable under all typical corners, with<br/>$12.83 \mu W$ power consumed by crystal, $95.6 mW/pixel$ total current usage, and the chip area $1.75\times 10^{-8} mm^2/pixel$. The output-referred noise PSD of the base tone and the third overtone is $3.4\times 10^{-13}V^2/Hz$ and $7.3\times 10^{-15}V^2/Hz$. which meets the noise requirements with enough design margin, while the fifth overtone fails with noise specs due to the quantization noise and aliased noise caused by ADC.","Crystal filter; Oscillator","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Microelectronics","",""

Attempts were made to get the CycleGANs in combination with CIConv to train in a stable manner.

Both these loss functions apply a CycleConsistency Loss, one applies an additional Adversarial Loss [1] and the other an additional Wasserstein Distance and Gradient Penalty [3]. In this paper we show that CycleGANs with CIConv as the first layer in either the Discriminators or the Generators resulted in unstable training. We conclude that the root of the instability issues lies in the CIConv layer causing exploding gradients resulting in unsuccessful training of the model. Finally, we propose an adjustment to the CIConv layer which shows promise in resolving these issues for the architecture with CIConv in the Generators.

Vlute can outperform Brute and escape local optima encountered by Brute also only for string transforma- tion. A limitation of Vlute is finding large programs.","Program Synthesis; Inductive Program Synthesis; Very Large Neighborhood Search; Large Neighborhood Search; Variable-Depth Neighborhood Search","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","https://github.com/victorvwier/BEP_project_synthesis.git Branch with my last changes: ""brute_extend_invent""","","","","","","Computer Science and Engineering","CSE3000 Research Project",""

Patients on the waiting list for kidney transplantation die because of a kidney shortage. A part of this problem can be solved by prolonging the period of preservation between the removal of the kidney from the body and the transplantation. However, oedemas and vascular obstructions are more likely to occur with longer perfusions. The kidney donor risk index doesn’t take this into account so a new technique needs to be established to assess the development of oedema and vascular obstruction. Another approach for increasing the supply of donor kidneys is de- and recellularization of the kidney. Electrical impedance spectroscopy shows promising results in the pancreas and this technique can probably be transferred to the kidney. EIS is a non-invasive, low cost, portable measuring technique that shows the results in real-time. A Spectra Bioimpedance and EIT Complete Kit with the 4-electrode attachment have been used at low frequencies (500 Hz) and high frequencies (70.000 Hz) for the evaluation of the porcine kidneys. Two different measurement techniques will be used, measurements through the renal artery and measurements on the kidney. These techniques are tested during the decellularization process, oedema formation, and vascular obstruction simulation to determine if impedance changes can signal these defects in the kidney. Robust changes have been made to the porcine kidneys in this regard. The sensitivity of the methods is less than expected. Only the decellularization results showed a notable change over time. The conclusion of this research is therefore: The results cannot prove a clear connection between vascular obstruction and oedema detection and electrical impedance changes. There is a probable correlation between electrical impedance and the phase of decellularization in which the kidney is in. Follow-up research is needed to substantiate this further.","electrical impedance spectroscopy; kidney perfusion; vascular obstruction; oedema formation; decellularization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Biomedical Engineering","","52.1660025, 4.4773269"

One such an approach is prolonging the use-times of smartphones, and for that repair should be popularised. This thesis examines how to prolong the use-time of smartphones through stimulating repair actions. The most occurring defect is to the display, while using the smartphone for one more year after a display repair saves about 20 percent in greenhouse gas emissions. For users to choose repair over replacement, repair needs to be affordable, accessible, and attractive, which current repair options do not adequately deliver. Smartphones can also be designed more reliable and repairable to support repairs and prolong use-times. These strategies need to be balanced with the smartphone’s competitiveness for a sizeable impact.<br/><br/>Therefore, a repair platform is proposed for stimulating repair, alongside a repairable smartphone that aims at further triggering repair actions and competing with high-end smartphones for a sizeable impact. A collaboration between repair shops and manufacturers needs to deliver value to the user. The proposed system delivers accessibility by creating a repair network of independent shops, which gains user trust by offering original parts and warranty. It makes repair more attractive by reducing the time and effort it takes and giving users insight into their environmental contribution. This creates value for repair shops by delivering customers and enabling quicker turnaround times. The manufacturer benefits by receiving the old parts, being more in control of their supply chain and gaining a strengthened competitive positioning. By being more accessible and attractive, users are more motivated to repair. Affordability is the third factor necessary for favourable repair yet this is only achieved in part by quicker repair times. It needs to be further investigated how to reduce the costs of spare parts. This thesis contributes by combining the need for a repair network with repairable smartphones. A repair network needs more repairable smartphones, and a repairable smartphone needs a well-functioning repair network.","Smartphone; Repair; Premature obsolescence","en","master thesis","","","","","","Integrated Product Design and Strategic Product Design","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

Convolutional neural networks are used to diagnose diseases, determine risk of disease development, finding the exact area of abnormalities and and so on. Mammography is an imaging technique, which aims at the early detection of breast cancer. Invasive Lobular Carcinoma (ILC) is a type of breast cancer with properties that make it less visible on mammography. This study compares six models which apply convolutional neural networks to detect breast cancer, on its ability to detect ILC. Furthermore, transfer learning with ILC and healthy images is applied to one of these models to improve the performance on ILC data.<br/><br/>For the evaluated breast cancer detection models, the performance on ILC data is worse than for a dataset which includes all breast cancer types and more healthy images. The model that transfer learning is applied to performs better on ILC data after transfer learning than before, with an increase of 0.09 for the AUC value. Additional analyses of the results show that women with high breast density have a lower chance of getting a correct ILC diagnosis from the model than women with low beast density and this also holds for other types of breast cancer. Lastly, the model outcomes are compared to radiologist reviews, to determine the additional value of models to the routine screening performed by radiologists. Within the images that are labeled as healthy by the radiologists, a model could be applied to detect tumor that have been missed by radiologists. When a specificity of 89% was allowed, 23% of the missed tumors could have been detected by the original GMIC model. In this way, the models used in this study and other deep learning models that are in development now, can contribute to breast cancer detection from mammography, and ILC specifically.","Mammography, breast cancer detection, deep learning, transfer learning,","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics","",""

To achieve this, we evaluate surrogate decision tree models produced by Viper on three different environments and attempt to interpret these models. We find that Viper generally produces high performance interpretable decision trees, and that performance and interpretability are highly dependent on context and oracle quality.

Concerning energy generation, the use of fossil fuels must be decreased, due to the carbon pollution they produce, and more and more green energy is required to be integrated into the power system. Solar energy represents a valid alternative to generates electricity without harming the environment. Furthermore, compared to other renewable technologies, photovoltaic (PV) panel are easier to integrate in the urban environment. Indeed, the concept of Nearly Zero-energy Buildings has been frequently mentioned in EU’s energy plan, which requires the new buildings, as of 1 January 2030, to perform energy efficiently almost without any consumption of non-renewable energy. However, building integration of PV systems comes with some challenges, such us complex installation and performance under partial shading.<br/><br/>This thesis proposes an isolated module-level converter to address the challenges mentioned above that arises in urban PV systems. Such a converter is expected to transfer energy as well as ease the installation of PV modules by splitting the magnetic core of its transformer in two parts: the first installed on the PV module and the second on the building. In the idea, the magnetic core of the converter is the key element to realize the objective. Therefore, the thesis starts with investigating the materials used in the magnetic core of the converter, after which the possible isolated topologies fit for the project are studied.<br/><br/>By combining analytical models with Finite Element Method (FEM) simulations in COMSOL, different cores are designed for the various converter topologies, core materials and core geometries.

I design MUTE, a new IPS system which uses MCTS guided by a heuristic-based loss function. MUTE's performance is tested and compared to other IPS systems in three diverse domains, namely robot planning, ASCII art and string transformations. MUTE's performance for string transformations is a first indication that MUTE can outperform Brute and other IPS systems.

Lineage level abundance estimates for SARS-CoV-2 can be obtained from viral material present in domestic wastewater. The abundance predictions can be made at different levels of granularity-individual lineage level(high granularity) or variant level(low granularity). The question this paper answers is to what extent abundance predictions are more accurate at lower granularity. Here we show that when wastewater samples contain only one lineage low granularity predictions are in general more accurate than high granularity for all lineages across Alpha, Delta and Mu variants. No variant level overestimation was observed for this experiment, which was thought to be something that could have made low granularity predictions less accurate than those at high granularity. When lineages of a variant were combined into a wastewater sample, the prediction error rose because of the smaller relative abundances of the genome sequences. Overestimation due to predictions of all lineages being pooled into one lineage was observed here with the overestimated high granularity lineage being more accurate than the low granularity predictions. If samples are expected to contain a very small amount of lineages then it is better to make predictions at low granularity. On the other hand, as the relative abundances of lineages decrease in a sample due to a large number of lineages, the chances of lineage level predictions having a smaller relative prediction error rate increases- making high granularity the better choice for more accurate predictions.","SARS-CoV-2 Variant Prediction; COVID Wastewater Abundance; RNA-Sequencing","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science and Engineering","CSE3000 Research Project",""

To achieve this, an extension of GAIL was made allowing it to extract decision trees. The decision trees were then measured in terms of performance, fidelity, behavior, and interpretability in three different environments. We find that GAIL is able to extract decision trees with high fidelity and can give insightful information into the expert models.

To answer this, the genre has been narrowed down to rock and the chosen audio codecs are FLAC, MP3 LAME and OGG Voribs.

The rural town of Gruyères specializing in milk production and cattle breeding remains a popular tourist destination for the traditional precision craftsmanship of the infamous cheese and chocolate production. The existing family-owned chocolaterie, Chocolaterie de Gruyères, producing artisanal craft chocolate is integrated with the existing fortification at the entrance of Gruyères with proximity to regional products—such as double cream, Friborg milk, Morello cherries, Swiss kirsch, and Swiss cane beets—for their dark or milk ""bean to bar"" chocolate products.

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","The number of space objects has largely increased in the recent years, becoming a considerable threat to the present and future of satellite operations and human spaceflight. This introduces a need to accurately compute the risk of collision between satellites and space debris. Current methodologies are limited by the type of encounter and the vehicle shape, usually simplified by a sphere. These assumptions rely mainly on linearization of the dynamics and simplification of the uncertainty distribution as a Gaussian function. Developing a collision probability calculation method that overcomes these limitations and provides high-accuracy results is the topic of this work. The methodology developed follows the hybrid Differential Algebra (DA) and Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) method for uncertainty propagation. The DA technique allows to propagate the covariance of the satellite position and velocity without applying linearisation. Moreover, the Gaussian assumption for the satellite uncertainty is dropped by using a weighted sum of Gaussian distributions that can approximate any probability density function. Finally, the method is adapted to any satellite geometry by developing a numerical quadrature technique based on a combination of spheres to model the real body shape. The combination of these methodologies to compute the collision probability is labelled as the multi-sphere DA-GMM method. This technique has been verified with a set of test cases by means of a Monte Carlo simulation and compared to alternative algorithms. It is found that the method improves the accuracy in calculating the collision probability by more than 70% with respect to conventional alternatives. Regarding real-life scenarios, the Cosmos-2251/Iridium-33 and the Chang Zheng-4C/Cosmos-2004 encounters are simulated. In both cases, the time of encounter and collision risk have been correctly estimated with the DA-GMM method. Finally, in view of the recent destruction of satellite Cosmos-1408 as a result of an anti-satellite missile test, a screening of its resulting debris threatening the International Space Station (ISS) is performed.

When applying the method considering the real shape of the ISS, the collision probability decreases by two orders of magnitude, proving the significance of this approach to correctly estimate the risk and guide space operations.","Space debris; Collision avoidance; International Space Station; Gaussian Mixture Model; Differential Algebra","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2025-01-28","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Limited knowledge of the aerodynamic properties of meteorite is speculated as one of the major reasons for partial recovery of the meteorites. Therefore, this work experimentally investigates the meteorite aerodynamics during dark flight using a subsonic wind tunnel. The drag coefficient, free fall analysis from 10 km altitude and the rotational aspects were studied using a 3D printed meteorite model.

(mentor); Pini, M. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","To cater to the increasing demand in short-range passenger air transport and the research in electric and hybrid aircraft, there is a renewed interest in the research of propellers. Propellers are known to have high aerodynamic efficiency, which translates to lower fuel burn in comparison to other jet engines, making it an attractive option for airlines to operate it in regional transport. With such a heightened interest in the research of propellers for future applications, it is crucial to study the effect of the shape-design of the blades on its aerodynamic performance parameters. The combination of advanced numerical methods with computational fluid dynamics allows determining the sensitivity of cost function to variations of the design parameters. In this thesis, a RANS-based CFD methodology incorporating the adjoint method is developed to perform the sensitivity analysis of the propeller's aerodynamic performance to the variation in the shape design of the blade. This methodology is applied to two propeller test cases- straight and swept blade. The propeller aerodynamic analysis is performed with SU2 for a range of advance ratios and compared against ANSYS Fluent's. Based on the verification and validation of SU2's flow solver, a larger discretization error was obtained with SU2 in comparison with ANSYS Fluent, for the simulations on the same computational mesh. Once SU2's flow solver is verified and validated using the two propeller cases, it is used to draw a comparison between the aerodynamic performance of the two blades. the swept blade operated with higher aerodynamic efficiency at high advance ratios with the largest gain of 0.47% at J=1.2. While it experiences a marginal loss in the efficiency at lower advance ratios with the largest decrement being 0.37% at J=0.6.<br/><br/>SU2’s adjoint solver is used to perform discrete adjoint-based sensitivity analysis of the propellers at multiple design points with thrust coefficient and torque coefficient as the objective functions. The sensitivity analysis of the thrust coefficient suggested that the regions of high sensitivity are located along the leading-edge and outboard portions of the blade's suction side. The concentration of the regions of high sensitivity varied with the advance ratio. For a given blade, similar trends were seen for the surface sensitivities of the torque coefficient. Both blades exhibit similar trends for surface sensitivities of both objective functions. Whereas based on the gradient information, the highest gradients of thrust coefficient are attained for the design variables located near the trailing edge of the straight blade, at a given radial position. Swept blade shows a chordwise gradient trend similar to the straight blade at most radial positions, except the tip region. It was inferred that the introduction of sweep at the tip results in the shift of the dominant design variable from trailing edge to mid-chord. Similar to surface sensitivities, trends of the chordwise gradient of two objective functions were alike for a given blade. Based on this study, the resulting understanding of the sensitivity of the propeller’s performance parameters to the variation in blade shape design can be used as an input for future design studies aimed at designing efficient propellers. Likewise, the RANS-based CFD methodology incorporating the adjoint method used in this work can be aimed at developing adjoint-based multidisciplinary design capabilities for propellers.","Adjoint; Aerodynamic; Propeller; Sensitivity Analysis; SU2","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

(mentor); van den Berg, M.A. (mentor); Owen, C.C. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Structures built in lakes and rivers or at sea are under huge forces induced by ice. These cause friction at the ice-structure interface that may pose a threat to the structural integrity of the construction. For the detailed design and realisation of structures in such regions an understanding is required of this friction process. The friction process at the ice-structure interface is driven by a phenomenon called the stick-slip phenomenon, where during stick mode the structure and the ice move simultaneously with the same velocity, and during slip mode the ice and structure interface slide over one another. This phenomenon has been observed and researched extensively, yet the corresponding static and kinetic friction coefficients reported show a wide range and the relation between the involved parameters and the friction coefficients is inconclusive. The most common theory used in describing general friction processes is Coulomb's Law of Friction. This thesis aims to determine whether and when ice-structure interaction can or cannot be described by Coulomb's Law of Friction in particular cases.<br/><br/>For this graduation project, first an analysis of several test set-ups was carried out to determine which set-up was best suited for experiments with stick-slip behaviour. The chosen test set-up consists of a one-dimensional rotating conveyor belt made from sandpaper on which an ice sample would be placed. This sample would be held in place by four springs attached to the back and front of the sample. This would allow the ice sample to move over the rotating belt, but remain relatively in its place. This would enable to the ice to displace in one direction, the direction of the rotating conveyor belt. This test set-up would be compact and it would be easy to switch the belt or ice sample if they had deteriorated too much. However, the use of a 1D conveyor belt prohibits construction materials such as steel or concrete to be used. Using sandpaper with similar roughness as concrete or steel would serve as a substitute to overcome this problem. <br/><br/>Ultimately, it proved to be impossible to realise the set-up and the focus of this thesis switched towards modelling the two-dimensional stick-slip behaviour based on data from previous research. For this a three degree of freedom (3DOF) model was created. As the forces exerted by the springs on the mass act under an angle that is depending on the position of the mass four different approaches were tested to see how this angle could best be incorporated. Furthermore, the friction force acting on the ice-structure interface was modelled using the friction coefficients found by previous research, and using two different approaches to find out whether the friction force should be modelled using the relative sliding velocity at the interface or not. It proved that the angle between the springs’ original position and it’s instantaneous position should be updated every step during slip mode, and that the friction force should be modelled using the relative sliding velocity. Both are cause for higher computational time. When validating this model against the experimental data it was found that friction coefficients were overestimated substantially for the 3DOF model. Using this the 3DOF model was updated and it was found that it now matches with the experimental data.<br/><br/>After analysing the output of the model, it was found that the kinetic friction coefficients are now in the range of 0.05-0.11 for the used parameters (mass 0.67 kg – 2.03 kg, slab velocity 0.15 m/s – 0.82 m/s, stiffness 20.17 N/m – 68.22 N/m). Also, the friction coefficients show a linear dependency with mass, and an slight inverse linear relationship with the slab velocity. Furthermore, with a low stiffness varying friction coefficients were found when varying the slab velocity, but when increasing the stiffness the friction coefficients converge and this variation decreases. Although further improvements can be made to create a better model, in general it is concluded that under the made assumptions, the 3DOF model describes the two-dimensional behaviour well, and shows how research into friction can be carried out while still using construction materials in an experimental set-up.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

The use of Ac-225 in TAT is especially interesting as in the decay of Ac-225 four alpha particles are emitted. The recoil effect will however disrupt the daughter nuclide from the targetting molecule, allowing the daughter nuclide to drift away from the tumour cells to healthy tissue. In order to study the redistribution of radionuclides due to the recoil effect imaging tools are required. An existing technique is the classic alpha camera, this technique is based on the scintillation of alpha particles. Emitted photons by the scintillating layer are registered by a charge coupled device. This technique allows for a spatial resolution of up to 35 μm but is limited by the uptake of other radiation forms (photon, beta). Another alpha imaging technique is called the Timepix, this is a hybrid pixelated semiconducting sensor that consists of an array of 55 μm square pixels. The semiconducting material (silicon) converts ionizing radiation into charge carriers that are collected at pixel sites. In this research the limitations of the Timepix chip with regard to spatial &amp; energy resolution in alpha particle imaging are investigated. The spatial resolution was investigated by the use of fine edged alpha absorbing objects, a small pitched collimators to ensure a monochromatic beam of alpha particles, and an alpha emitting source (Am-241). The Timepix chip registered the incoming alpha particles. By binning the counted alpha particles in small inter- vals a step function was obtained, from which a Gaussian function was obtained. The Full Width at Halve Maximum (FWHM) is a measure of (spatial) resolution of the Gaussian function. Results showed a spatial resolution of 9.8 μm obtained by a collimator with pitch of 6 μm. The obtained spatial resolution shows that sub-pixel resolution in alpha particle imaging is possible. The energy resolution of the Timepix chip was investigated by the use of a collimator to ensure a monochro- matic beam of alpha particles, several Mylar foils to slow down the alpha particles and an alpha emitting source (Am-241). The use of the time over threshold mode (TOT) indicates the amount of time a signal is above threshold, which is a direct indication of the particles energy. Output of the chip is Gaussian shaped, from which the energy resolution was obtained. The obtained energy resolution of the Timepix chip was 0.8 MeV, which allows for identification of most daughter nuclides from the decay chain of Ac-225. This energy resolution does not allow for the identification of the disintegration of Fr-221 (6.64 MeV) and Ac-225 (5.94 MeV).","Timepix; TAT; alpha-imaging; spatial resolution; energy resolution","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Sciences","",""

Relevant examples of this include the failure of skin panels in the X-15 vehicle, or violent oscillations in non-adaptable nozzles during start-up, such as the space shuttle main booster. With the contemporary trends of decreasing weight and increasing operational speeds in the design of next generation aircraft and launch vehicles, such structures will become more common, and flutter needs to be inherently accounted for in the design.<br/><br/>In recent years, advancements in numerical techniques, such as Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and the Finite Element Method (FEM), have led to numerous studies that address the effect of non-linearities, such as flutter behaviour in the transonic and hypersonic regime. In spite of that, experimental data needed to validate these studies is limited, based on coarse pointwise measurement techniques, and only focused on the structural response of the panel rather than on the entire Fluid Structure Interaction (FSI). The use of simultaneous, full-field and non-intrusive measurements can be used to address these issues. To this extent, panel designs were developed and an experimental campaign was proposed where Digital Image Correlation (DIC) and Schlieren are simultaneously used by means of high speed cameras to study classical panel flutter at Mach 2 inside the ST-15 wind tunnel at the Delft University of Technology. Additionally, a Laser Doppler Vibrometer (LDV) was used to validate the DIC measurements. The experiment allowed for a comparison with well understood theory, such that the setup can be proven to be robust, and can therefore later be used to assess the effect of panel flutter non-linearities or other supersonic FSIs.<br/><br/>Synchronisation between DIC and schlieren was demonstrated through a matching frequency spectrum, and maximum correlation inside corresponding pixel windows between panel displacement and schlieren grey-scale fluctuations with a zero time-lag. One finding was that during the panel down-stroke phase, a travelling wave character was observed which has previously been found only under transonic conditions. Furthermore, at moderate dynamic flutter pressures, a typical second bending panel flutter mode shape was observed, which grew into a single bending mode again with increasing higher dynamic flutter pressures. From the spectral analysis it was found that all configurations fluttered at the same frequency of 770 [Hz], independent of dynamic flutter pressure or edge conditions. This was higher than expected from analysis. These combined observations led to the conclusion that, in the current facility, a frequency lock-in occurs due to merging of the flutter phenomenon with a wind tunnel resonance vibration.<br/><br/>These observations provide an insight into combining these experimental techniques to study supersonic FSI behaviour, and particularly into certain unexpected behaviour encountered at the TU Delft ST-15 wind tunnel. This can be used to further tune future experiments and guide researchers to obtain a better understanding in the non-linearities found in panel flutter.<br","Panel Flutter; Fluid Structure Interaction; Digital Image Correlation; Schlieren; Vibrometer; Supersonic flow; Wind tunnel testing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

This will be of significant benefit to different areas of research and engineering and through improvement achieved in these to society at large as well.<br/><br/>As simulations grow in dimensions and accuracy the wall clock time is bound to increase substantially, reaching days and potentially months depending on the parameters and geometry of the chosen simulation. The performance of different finite difference solvers with different degrees of optimization on different types of compute hardware was investigated and the achieved speedups assessed. Specifically, one serial CPU-based solver was presented as a baseline, which was then transitioned to a GPU-based solver. This in turn was then optimized further with regards to improved memory redundancy. To make comparisons fairer all of the solvers used the same temporal and spatial discretization techniques. Further, a benchmarking scenario was proposed to be used for the different solvers across used hardware, including the relevant geometry, gird, and initial and boundary conditions.<br/><br/>The speedups between the different solvers were observed and contextualized with regard to the effort that went into implementing the solvers and the capability and cost of the used hardware.

In addition, in at least one case, combining two well-performing regions further improves accuracy at lower simulated abundances of variants. This suggests that sequencing depth is preferred over sequencing breath as long as the region being sequenced contains enough information to distinguish between variants. These findings are important as they can aid in the improvement of this method of variant quantification. Moreover, they can also help in improving other algorithms applied to the SARS-CoV-2 genome by highlighting the genomic sections containing the most differentiating information between variants.","kallisto; Covid-19; sars-cov-2","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science and Engineering","CSE3000 Research Project",""

This process of two organisations collaborating together is very complex and becomes even more difficult when organisations are large and very different in their organisational culture or function. This research describes the design of a tool to aid Collaborative Innovative Capacity in public - private organisational partnerships. The research is based on a case study within the Dutch national rail infrastructure management organisation and focuses on the relationship between this organisation and its maintenance contractors. Through literature research and semi-structured interviews the studied situation is found to consist of two parties trying to innovate together using an imperfect collaborative system. Their separate, struggling relationships with this system are not shared or understood by the other party. This gives rise to a wall of misunderstanding. The designed tool is based on the assumption that through better understanding of the barriers which are present in the other party’s struggling relationship with the collaborative system, the wall of misunderstanding can be lowered which in turn increases Collaborative Innovative Capacity in the public - private organisational partnership. This tool takes the form of a serious game which presents players with scenarios which (potentially) hinder them in their game objective. These scenarios are representations of real-world barriers to innovation. Through confronting players with scenarios which are related to another organisational role than the one they occupy in their professional life, they should gain new perspectives about the struggling relationship of the other party with the collaborative system. Thereby lowering the wall of misunderstanding and increasing Collaborative Innovative Capacity. The results of the design and preliminary testing show that the developed serious game does have an effect in the form of gained attitudes towards the importance of sharing different experienced barriers towards innovations with one another. However measurements show no actual newly gained insights into practical barriers which were not already known to the players. While further research, more extensive testing and measurements, and further specification and expansion of scenarios can be undertaken to increase the value of this tool, after reconsideration a revised design objective is formulated which focuses on the interaction between the participants and relaxes its rigid view on the wall between them. This could yield a tool which is more in tune with the essence of the problem which would also cause it to be much simpler in nature.","Collaboration; Innovation; Communication; Serious game","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Sciences | Science Communication","",""

Combined in a circular way, the sum of the three interferometric phases is called the closure phase which necessarily adds up to zero on a single pixel level. However, if the interferograms are spatially averaged, phase consistency is not guaranteed. In most of the interferometric studies, those mismatches were assumed to be caused by decorrelation noise alone, and were either not considered or deemed negligible, eluding further investigations of its origin. However, recent publications have confirmed that inconsistent phase closures are systematic and not the exception, pointing to an underlying geophysical cause. Comparisons of the spatial signatures of phase closures with land cover maps suggest a spatial and temporal correlation that is related to the characteristics of different land cover types. Since interferometric measurements are sensitive to variations of the dielectric constant, those similarities have been attributed to dynamics in vegetation and soil moisture. A closure phase significance test developed at the Geoscience and Remote Sensing department at TU Delft aimed to increase the signal-to-noise ratio of this geophysical signal component by providing a significance ratio for phase closures. However, the sensitivity of (significant) phase closures to dynamics in vegetation and soil over different land cover types has not been assessed yet. Here we show that with enough averaging of the interferometric phase, the spatial and temporal characteristics of closure phase can be used to distinguish between different land cover types. We found that the degree of spatial averaging has a significant impact on both the phase closure values and its spatial and temporal consistency. The magnitudes of significant phase closures generally increased over low-vegetated land covers, suggesting that closure phases are most sensitive to soil moisture dynamics, whereas vegetation cover was associated with decreasing phase closure magnitudes and spatial inconsistency. Besides spatial averaging, significant differences were observed between closure phases from different polarizations. Furthermore, we found that amplitude backscatter and closure phase are spatially and temporally correlated, pointing to similar influencing mechanisms. Our results demonstrate the importance of applying a closure phase significance test and describe the effect of spatial averaging on the characteristics of phase closures with respect to different land cover types. We anticipate this study to provide useful steps towards using the closure phase for soil and vegetation monitoring in the future. For example, the findings could be used to further exploit potential synergies with amplitude backscatter for soil moisture retrieval from closure phase or develop more sophisticated methods for land cover mapping using InSAR. If not used for applications linked to land cover, vegetation or soil, being able to better predict the effect of those parameters on the interferometric phase and coherence, eventually enables to separate their contribution from other signals, such as deformation estimates. Additional research is needed to relate significant phase closures to moisture changes in vegetation.","Closure Phase; Sentinel-1; Land Cover; Vegetation; Soil Mosture","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geoscience and Remote Sensing","",""

This demand is accompanied by a demand for high-speed and reliable communication. One of the challenges faced by the RF design engineers is to fulfill these demands while utilizing the limited resource of the frequency spectrum to its full potential. High-bandwidth, multi-channel communication protocols are often used to address these requirements. Over the past decade, digital intensive transmitters are gaining popularity because of their suitability to be used with such protocols. This project addresses a requirement of a highly linear direct digital to RF modulator (DDRM) which fulfills the stringent adjacent channel leakage ratio (ACLR) and in-band linearity requirements of the modern communication standards. The main goal of this project is to design a low-power, highly linear DDRM with high modulation bandwidth that can provide an accurate reference signal to a high-power counterpart. This project presents a 2x11-bit, 4GHz digital-intensive I/Q interleaving DDRM with peak output power equal to 2dBm and maximum modulation bandwidth of 400MHz. The DDRM features a second order hold (SOH) interpolation filtering, digital pre-distortion-like unit cell configuration and complete digital CMOS based I/Q interleaving and mixing. The simulation results indicate that the DDRM achieves spurious free dynamic range lower than -50dBc in a 3.5GHz-4.5GHz band. Also the harmonic distortion (HD), intermodulation product (IM), counter-intermodulation (C-IM) products remain below -50dBc for a tone frequency of 400MHz. The entire design consumes 234mW of power. An additional harmonic rejection technique is evaluated which improves C-IM by 3dB-12dB.","I/Q interleaving; direct digital to RF modulator (DDRM)); signed DDRM; harmonic rejection; second order hold (SOH) interpolation; current-steering DDRM; digital-intensive transmitter; clock mapping","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2026-07-01","","","","Electrical Engineering | Microelectronics","",""

The heat transition is a multifaceted problem where fragmentation and a deficient direction role of municipalities is a key institutional challenge. To address the problem, regional energy strategies are established to collaborate with state and non-state stakeholders, but the heat transition is still stagnating today. Collaborative governance is a governing arrangement that engages public and non-public organizations in a collective decision-making process to implement public policy to resolve social-technical problems. However, today the application of the collaborative governance theory is scarce on sustainable transformation. For this reason, the author decided to apply a collaborative governance lense on the current situation for heat transition. <br/><br/>The thesis first examines the collaborative governance framework, which is the most suitable to apply in relation to heat transition. In the second step, the selection of a comparative empirical research methodology is selected. Third, two RES regions with rural characteristics are investigated to get insight into the current situation. Lastly, the empirical findings are discussed in relation to current collaborative governance literature and governmental policy. Finally, recommendations for municipalities and other regional stakeholders can be provided. <br/><br/>The empirical findings show that collaborative governance conditions are rarely present to facilitate the heat transition at regional scale. The author identified crucial conditions within the system context and collaborative governance process itself, which is explainable by the iterative nature of the model. The conditions include the current deficient policy and legal framework, high level of contention among citizens, inadequate resource conditions. In the collaborative governance regime itself this results in lack of interdependence, trust and high level of uncertainty, through which no shared interest or common language are practiced. The thesis concludes with recommendations for the regional collaboration regarding heat transition for practitioners and for future research on collaborative governance.","Collaborative Governance; Heat transition; Regional energy strategy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-01-27","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

People with physically demanding jobs tend to have poorer cardiovascular health than people with sedentary jobs. In contrast to leisure-time physical activity (PA), occupational PA (lifting, pushing, and pulling heavy loads over a long period without sufficient recovery) seems to have detrimental health effects. This phenomenon is called the ‘PA Paradox’ and requires interventions that counteract these harmful health effects.<br/>In the current occupational health research, interventions for this population are typically narrow, focusing on limited factors in a specific environment. These kinds of interventions are not effective for people with physically demanding jobs. Instead, an intervention for this population must respond to workers‘ complex context, fit their daily activities and preferences, and be integrated into their work and home environment. Therefore, this project aimed to explore these aspects to design a promising concept for a lifestyle intervention that shifts workers’ PA behavior in a healthier direction.<br/> <br/>At the beginning of the project, expert interviews with occupational health researchers and practitioners were executed. Moreover, literature was reviewed to comprehend the PA Paradox and current approaches to counteract it. It was found that an intervention should stimulate moderate-vigorous PA, variation, and sufficient recovery and that workers must have the capability, motivation, and opportunity to perform a healthy PA behavior. Therefore, an extensive field study was carried out to investigate workers’ PA behavior and the factors affecting it. That yielded an overview of factors influencing workers’ capability, opportunity, and motivation for a healthy PA behavior. It showed that it would be most impactful to tackle workers’ inadequate risk perception and over-exhaustion. Research through design was applied to explore how an intervention could address these factors in workers’ home and working environments and what interactions fit workers’ needs, preferences, and possibilities. <br/> <br/>The generated insights were merged to ‘Shift it!’, a concept that makes workers feel confident about shifting their PA behavior in a healthier direction. ‘Shift it!’ consists of two parts: A health week and a digital buddy. The health week starts with a toolbox meeting to make the workers aware of the PA paradox and its consequences. Afterwards, workers can visit the company doctor to examine their current health state and future risks and monitor their heart rate for one week to get insights into the intensity of their PA and the effect of their breaks.<br/>The digital buddy ensures that workers understand the issue and helps them to integrate recovery and PA into their daily lives. It offers them inspiration, helps them find a plan that fits their busy lives, and supports them to realize it by reminding, encouraging, and praising them. <br/> <br/>Finally, the concept was evaluated with the workers and other stakeholders to explore its potential. Everyone was enthusiastic about the concept and showed interest in implementing its elements. The health screening and the digital buddy with all its functions were identified as the concept‘s core, but it is not yet clear which elements can be realized.<br","Contextmapping; Research Through Design; Holistic Approach; COM-B model; Lifestyle Intervention; Occupational Health; Physical Activity Paradox","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction | Medisign","",""

Given that maintenance, repair and overhaul are a significant operational cost to organizations, it is imperative that the adoption of predictive maintenance techniques such as prognostics comes to the forefront. Prognostics models ensures that remaining useful life (RUL) estimates are available throughout the life of the component by leveraging sensor data. The obstacle faced by prognostics though, is the lack of standardized metrics, performance evaluation and their application to different case studies. Visualization results in understanding the evolution of the performance over time rather than single point estimates, which helps in identifying performance at crucial points in the life of systems. This paper focuses on assessing and visualizing the performance of prognostics models by addressing the shortcomings of the currently available performance metrics, advancing these metrics to suit the requirements and applying these to visualize the performance of two linear regression models over time. The results show that the modification of currently available performance metrics can enhance performance visualization, leading to better interpretation of the performance of prognostics models.","Prognostics; Predictive Maintenance; Performance Evaluation; Performance visualization; Remaining useful life","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Due to the high repeatability of motion, high therapy costs, and lack of proper quantitative assessment of patient status and progress, rehabilitation centers could benefit from the introduction of robotics.

In this thesis, the kinematics analysis for a modified Lokomat orthosis has been made and validated. These kinematics calculate the Euler angles of the orthosis hip joint as a function of eight degrees of freedom, two degrees of freedom of actuators driving the thigh, and six degrees of freedom of the orthosis pelvis body. The kinematics were validated by using a low-cost HTC Vive VR tracker system, to capture the actual angle of the orthosis hip joint. The kinematics were tested in three experiments. Firstly, the kinematics were tested by moving the orthosis around by hand, tracing the range of motion of the linear actuators. Afterward, the kinematics were validated with a person wearing the device. The first dataset has the person suspended in the air, simulating walking, whilst the final dataset has the person dragging their feet over the ground, to simulate walking. The results from the first experiment indicate that the kinematics calculation tracks the measured angles with an RMSE of less than 6% of the total range of motion. Later experiments suffered from drift in the Vive trackers, mainly in the flexion angles, worsening performance. Compensating for this drift shows the kinematics to still be similarly accurate to the first experiment.","kinematic modeling; Exoskeleton; Orthosis; bodyweight supported treadmill training; HTC Vive; motion tracking","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

Bitcoin has been praised for its impact on decentralizing trust and currencies but also criticized for its volatility and energy-inefficient consensus mechanism. To improve its limitations, in 2016, payment channels and payment channel networks were introduced in the form of the Lightning Network. Payment channels allow for so-called off-chain transactions that, in case of dispute, can be published to an existing cryptocurrency blockchain, like Bitcoin, for arbitration. After its introduction, the concept of payment channels was quickly adopted by many cryptocurrency users. However, although payment channels remove the need for many on-chain transactions, some still remain. An on-chain transaction is required for the opening and closing of a channel. This happens during the initial setup between two users but is also required if one of the users runs out of balance on their side of the channel. The latter is a common occurrence as transactions are often unidirectional, say between a customer and a merchant. To limit the amount of closing and opening on-chain transactions required, a user can start or take part in a rebalancing. A rebalancing is a process with the aim of bringing a channel to a balance as desired by its owners. The state-of-the-art existing protocol to carry out a rebalancing is called Revive, which is a distributed protocol using leader election and a linear program to calculate the optimal rebalancing between its participants. Although effective, the protocol provides little privacy to its participants. We, therefore, designed a new, privacy-preserving peer-to-peer rebalancing protocol. Alongside it, we also introduce an accompanying participant discovery protocol that allows users in a network to find other users interested in running a distributed algorithm. We show that both protocols are secure and that our rebalancing protocol provides more privacy than Revive, at the cost of a suboptimal result and an increased message and time complexity. Finally, we compare our rebalancing protocol and Revive using a payment channel network simulator that simulates transactions taking place during the rebalancing. Using this simulation, we show that both protocols have a negative effect on the payment channel network as they lock the to-be-rebalanced channels while they are executing. We, therefore, conclude that an ideal rebalancing protocol should both be privacy-preserving and concurrent, and propose ideas to achieve this in future research.","Rebalancing; Payment Channel Networks; Distributed Systems; Privacy-preserving technology; Payment Channel; Blockchain; Peer-to-peer; Cycle detection; Participant Discovery; Transaction generation; Revive","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science | Cyber Security","",""

One way to accomplish this is by increasing the wing aspect ratio, thereby increasing the aerodynamic efficiency, however this is not without consequences. Increased aspect ratio wings have a higher structural mass, are more susceptible to gust and maneuver loads and generally flutter at lower velocities. Due to the advent of both passive and active control techniques these issues can fortunately be solved by using gust load allevation (GLA), maneuver load alleviation (MLA) and flutter suppression. <br/>Current aeroelastic testing facilities at Delft University of Technology include a gust generator and aeroelastic apparatus, used to suspend a passive wing section in the wind tunnel. The need for ad¬ ditional research on aeroelastic control in order to improve the sustainability and safety of aviation necessitates the development of a new wing section with aileron and spoiler control surfaces that is compatible with current facilities. The development, manufacturing and initial characterization and test¬ ing of this wing section is the subject of the present work. <br/>As the new wing section includes a spoiler, a literature review is performed on this subject. Spoilers function by deflecting into the flow, causing separation aft of the spoiler and creating a large turbulent wake, resulting in a drastic decrease of lift. A linear potential flow model for spoiler aerodynamics developed by Brown and Parkinson was implemented in MATLAB with the intent of implementing this in future aeroelastic models. Verification of this model showed good agreements with original data presented in the paper describing the model. <br/>The passive wing section was chosen as a basis for the new design. The position and size of the control surfaces are determined based on a review of experimental and operational applications. The new wing section was designed, resulting in a self¬contained model, including a single¬board computer, sensors and power supply. Actuation mechanisms were developed for the control surfaces, with a parametric device for control surface free play included in the aileron actuation mechanism. The new wing section was manufactured successfully and control software was implemented using Simulink. <br/>A series of tests were performed to characterize the dynamic behavior of the wing section. Due to a combination of higher inertia and kinematics of the actuation mechanism, the usable bandwidth of the aileron is shown to be lower than that of the spoiler. Aerodynamic results show that the combined use of aileron and spoiler result in a reduction or reversal of the aerodynamic response of the wing. Gust load alleviation results with proportional control show an increase in damping by 1300% and a reduction in peak amplitude of 50% when using the spoiler. Results for the aileron are notice¬ ably less, with a decrease in amplitude of 15% and an increase of damping of 145%. The differences are attributed to both the differences in kinematics of the mechanisms as well as the greater absolute change in lift coefficient obtainable by the spoiler. <br","aeroelasticity; gust; experimental; aeroservoelasticity; Wind tunnel testing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Aircraft noise and its impact is one of the biggest challenges the aviation industry faces today. At airports, the number of operations and the flight routes are driven by the noise impact on the surrounding communities. To predict the expected aircraft noise levels around airports, noise models are used. The accuracy of these models is thus of great importance. This research aims to improve aircraft noise modelling by validation and calibration of the main input parameters using acoustic measurements. This research is focused on the Doc.29 aircraft noise model. This is an empirical model, based on Noise-Power-Distance (NPD) tables, which is convenient for fast computations of a large number of flight operations. The data set used consists of take-off measurements of the B737-800 gathered around Schiphol airport. To validate and calibrate the model with measurements, all input parameters should be correct to be able to identify where deviations come from. The power parameter thrust is an important input, but often not exactly known. The N1 rotational speed of the engines can be used to estimate the used thrust. An estimation of the N1% is performed by finding the fan tones from acoustic measurements. The found N1% is validated with Aircraft Condition and Monitoring System data (ACMS) from the measured flights. The estimation resulted in an average 4% root mean square error with the ACMS data. When using the estimated N1% as input for thrust, differences between model results and measurement are still found. These differences are assumed to be caused by errors in the NPD table. This allows altering the entries in the NPD table by adding the found differences from the measurements reduces the mean error to less than ±0.2 dBA and providing a 20-30% reduction in standard deviation. Another method of model improvement is done by looking at the measurements which have been standardised to reference conditions. The relation between thrust setting and sound level showed to be less dominant than originally expected from the NPD table. From these newfound thrust-noise relations, new NPD tables are created. This caused a 30-40% reduction in standard deviation, reducing the variation found between noise measurements and model results significantly. Next to an improvement in best-practice noise modelling, the methods described in this research give insight into the creation and validation of NPD values.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

The exact causes of MS are not well understood, and various susceptibility factors(e.g. age, gender, ethnicity) can cause large individual differences. To better understand and predict MS, it is ideally studied in a safe and controlled environment, such as a driving simulator. However, the validity of driving simulator studies on MS as a proxy for on-road studies with real vehicles has not been properly evaluated. We conducted an experiment where the temporal aspects and symptom profiles of MS in a real-road driving scenario are compared to Simulator Sickness (SS) in a reproduction of this scenario in a motion-base driving simulator. A cohort of 25 participants was exposed to both the car and the simulator conditions. The scenarios consisted of sections of provocative(slaloming, stop-and-go) and normal driving. Sickening stimuli of the simulator were similar to the car accelerations in design (r = 0.51) but different in outcome (r = 0.27) as a result of motion cueing.

Results showed significant correlations between the car and simulator conditions for 3 out of 4 MSAQ symptom categories (0.48 &lt; r &lt; 0.73, p &lt; 0.02) and a relation (r = 0.57,p = 0.004) for individual sensitivity to sickness. Sickness onset times did not differ between the car and the simulator[F(1,308) = 4.80, p = 0.029], after Bonferroni corrections had been applied. Both MS and SS increased and decreased as a result of the driving style, with the effect being larger in the car condition, than in the simulator (for MISC [F(1,248)= 19.15, p = 0.000] and for GSR [F(1,230) = 5.55, p = 0.019]). Results from all four measures indicate that the severity of sickness was higher in the car as compared to in the simulator. EEG responses did not fully show expected outcomes. However, the signal quality was limited and dedicated EGG equipment may yield different results. Because individual sensitivity and temporal aspects of SS and MS were similar between the car and simulator but different in magnitude, we conclude relative validity for the simulator. As the human vestibular system, a prominent contributor in causing sickness, is solely sensitive to accelerations, we attribute the difference in magnitude due to downscaling of the vehicle motion in the simulator. In order to obtain absolute validity, either extensive training or considerable technological advances may be necessary.","Motion Sickness; Simulator Sickness; Validation study; Fidelity; Driving Simulator","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-04-27","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","In recent years, the area of structural engineering has found new interesting prospects in the theory of waves. The acoustoelastic properties of materials are utilized in a new promising structural health monitoring (SHM) technique. The propagation of ultrasonic waves through stressed elements gives the ability to find invaluable information on the stress-state of the concerned element. This information is then analyzed with the use of Coda Wave Interferometry (CWI). This technique explores the late arrivals of the wave field, which is referred to as the coda. Due to scattering of the waves through heterogeneous elements, this part of the wave field holds additional information compared to the early arrivals, which makes it very suitable for application on concrete elements.<br/>The use of ultrasonic waves with CWI in concrete elements has been studied enthusiastically by engineers due to its promising prospects. Nevertheless, this technique is still developing both in theory and in practice. The majority of previous similar studies have been conducted in laboratory settings, and thus conditions are very controlled. In this study, the monitoring technique is applied in conjunction with Smart Aggregate (SA) to a concrete structure for practical use. The SA sensors are positioned in groups at key location in the first concrete cast of a cast-in-situ prestressed concrete bridge, which entails two bridge spans of approximately 30 meters length. Measurements are done at different phases during the construction of the bridge, when the stress-state at the positions shifts due to change in loading and boundary conditions. The resulting data is analyzed with CWI and subsequently evaluated whether it coincides with expectations. Deviations from these expectations are rationalized or an attempt thereof is made.<br/>The results show significant differences between field measurement results and expectations based on laboratory tests. These differences are explained by the presence of a greater amount of parameters, which influence the data gathered from field measurements. With the appropriate measures, the various factors acting on the structure are isolated and subsequently validated with laboratory data. The most prominent factors affecting the acoustoelastic properties of the structure are established to be time related. These factors involve concrete shrinkage, creep deformation and the concrete hydration process. With laboratory testing the effect of these factors on the wave propagation velocity are determined. By taking into account the additional factors, a strong correlation between changes in the stress-state and changes in the wave propagation velocity is observed when the data is read in an adjusted manner.<br/>With a proper protocol, the use of smart aggregates in combination with CWI could be very valuable in accessing concrete structures on-site in both its construction stage and service stage. As it stands, prerequisite knowledge of the monitored structure is necessary to make use of the full potential of the SHM involving CWI and SA. The demand for prerequisite knowledge of the structure increases as the monitored structure becomes more complex, because it increases the amount of additional endeavors required to properly asses the acquired data. As such, the discussed monitoring technique in its current stage of development generally has low accessibility for practical use. But with further research and more understanding of monitoring method, the discussed SHM technique might be applicable for general use in the near future.","Coda Wave Interferometry; Concrete Bridge; Smart Aggregates","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering | Concrete Structures","","51.34212209774863, 5.423738572943933"

In this thesis, 2 designs for wearable ultrasound neuromodulators for the vagus nerve are suggested, based on these designs a solution is made, solving the problem of detecting vagus nerve within a wearable environment. To detect the vagus nerve two methods are proposed: neural networks and template matching. Based on these methods and these proposed designs 5 unique works have been created, Vivo las vagus (VLV) an object detector using a neural network, a mobile implementation of both VLV as well as template matching, an FPGA implementation of template matching, and 2 FPGA implementations of VLV in which one uses a streaming dataflow architecture and the other a systolic array architecture. <br/><br/>The best results are achieved with the streaming dataflow architecture implementation of VLV within an FPGA, resulting in an accuracy of 87.5 percent on the test set with the 10.88 FPS/watt, and inference of 0.174 seconds.

As worldwide demand for it is growing while environmental issues are being increasingly addressed by regulations, the call for more sustainable practices in the refrigeration fields becomes louder and louder. Currently, refrigeration systems are mostly fragmented, each business having its own set of equipment. This brings along several drawbacks, such as inadequate maintenance, absence of waste heat reusal, high investment costs, and a tendency of especially SMEs to prefer installations with synthetic refrigerants which are cheaper to acquire, but which are more harmful to the environment in case of leakage, and less efficient in operation.<br/> A solution can be sought in “shared refrigeration systems”, a form of utility sharing and industrial symbiosis where a central refrigeration plant distributes cold refrigerant via a network of piping to individual companies. This concept has been poorly explored, and the current research aims to investigate the barriers and enablers that are in place for a potential implementation of this shared refrigeration technology among SMEs in Dutch industrial parks, as well as to investigate how the barriers can be overcome. The research is guided by the research question: “How can the implementation of shared refrigeration among SMEs in Dutch industrial parks be facilitated?”. Data was collected by means of explorative semi-structured interviews (N=13). A preparatory round of interviews (N=3) was added to create a consolidation of the shared refrigeration concept as a reference to ensure the quality of the main interview round.<br/> The results show that there is a range of barriers in place for an implementation of shared refrigeration in Dutch industrial parks: (i) a funding gap in the initiation phase, (ii) the long investment horizon, (iii) uncertainty due to a lack of financial and sustainable assessments, (iv) lack of prior experiences, (v) incapability of local business associations, (vi) inadequate information sharing, (vii) a lack of public awareness, (viii) a fear of being dependent, (ix) a fear of competitive threats, (x) scarcity of implementation opportunities, (xi) strict policies for complementary systems, and (xii) businesses having a short-term focus. Enablers that were identified are: (i) the currently favorable policy climate, (ii) congestion problems in the electricity network, (iii) the currently favorable investment climate, and (iv) active knowledge sharing by governments and consultancy firms.<br/> The research has led to the conclusion that the implementation of shared refrigeration among SMEs in Dutch industrial parks can be facilitated by combined efforts of governments, businesses and academia. Facilitation strategies include conducting scans for opportunity identification, conducting business case analysis to come to financial and sustainable ramifications, closing the funding gap in the initiation phase, disseminating experiences from similar projects, and setting up and/or strengthening the capabilities of local business associations through knowledge sharing and creating partnerships with governments, consultancy companies and research and education institutions.

Deep excavations are among the structures used for underground construction. The construction of such structures often affects nearby existing structures and causes possibly even damages.<br/>The prediction of these damages is usually done by following these steps:<br/>1. Determining the free-field ground displacements <br/>2. Imposing the displacements on the structure<br/>3. Determining the deformations of the structure<br/>4. Assess potential damages following these deformations<br/>The ground and the structure are often modelled separately taking no (LTSM) or a factor (Relative Stiffness Method) into account for interaction between soil and structure. Taking no interaction into account is particularly conservative when looking at vertical displacements. The non-linear behaviour of structural elements is neglected by these methods. This could lead to errors when assessing deformations of a masonry building due to the extreme non-linear behaviour of masonry structures. <br/>The objective of this thesis is to get a better understanding of the effect of deep excavations on adjacent (piled buildings) by using integrated 2D modelling. This is done by remodelling the construction of the building pit in PLAXIS. <br/>Based on the analysis performed in Section 4 the load on the pile is the largest contributor to the vertical and horizontal displacements of the pile relative to the soil around the pile. The diameter and stiffness of the pile are also very important factor determining the vertical movement of the pile. <br/>The difference in the soil between a free-field situation and a situation with foundation piles (and a building) the piles stiffen the soil around the piles. Especially, when these piles are in a group. This effect increases when the piles are coupled by a structure. Vertical displacements are more smeared out over the length of the pile. This is less the case for horizontal displacements. Foundation piles undergo negative skin friction as a result of the settlements of the upper soil layers leading to stress in the soil beneath the pile tip. The stress in the soil beneath piles increases with increasing load and skin friction on the pile. This increased stress results in more horizontal stress, which in close proximity to a retaining wall could lead to increased deformations in the retaining wall and therefore the soil.<br/>The results of the numerical calculations and the analytic calculations are analysed and compared in Section 6. In the numerical models both linear elastic as non-linear material properties have been assigned to the masonry building façade in different models. The numerical model with linear elastic material properties for masonry showed stiff response of the building to the induced soil deformations, underestimating the potential damages. The numerical model with non-linear material properties assigned to masonry showed more realistic results. These results are in line with the established analytical models. <br/>Integrated numerical modelling could be a viable solution for future projects where potential building damage is assessed next to deep excavation. it could help to identify weak points within a structure which need addressing during the construction of an adjacent deep excavation. This study has shown that it is possible to do damage assessment in a fully integrated model. The important factors in assessing such projects are the overall soil deformation. Secondly, the relation between the soil and foundation of the structure needs to be analysed. Thirdly, the interface between the foundation and the structure is important. <br","Deep excavation; Masonry Building; Plaxis 2D; Finite Element Analysis; Amsterdam","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering | Hydraulic Structures and Flood Risk","",""

There are, however, a few drawbacks. MPC controllers are not adaptive and therefore perform suboptimal in the presence of the uncertainties that always occur in urban traffic systems. Although very advanced prediction models for urban traffic signal control systems exist, these models also come with a price: the computational complexity of MPC controllers increases with the accuracy of the model. RL techniques involve a time-consuming and data-dependent offline computation, as the agent needs to pursue a training process. The training process is also the main reason why RL techniques have not been employed in real-world urban traffic systems. Through exploration in the training phase the controller may cause a suboptimal and potentially unacceptable bad performance in the system. Besides, most RL techniques do not have any stability and feasibility guarantees. With the goal of mitigating these drawbacks, the model-reference RL adaptive control framework is introduced. RL is used to obtain an adaptive law to adjust a stable baseline controller to follow a set reference. This thesis focusses on the design and analysis of this scheme where MPC control is used to obtain the baseline control input. The computed baseline control input combined with the traffic model used, determines the reference state to be followed. By performing a case study, the training characteristics of the framework are compared to those of a conventional RL-based controller. Besides, the system performance framework is compared to that of a fixed-time controller a conventional MPC controller and a conventional RL-based controller. The simulation shows that the framework outperforms the RL-based controller in terms of performance during training and the general simulation performance of the MPC controller.","Model Predictive Control; Reinforcement Learning; Model-reference adaptive control; Urban Traffic Control","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

Screw fixation strength can be increased by anchoring a flexible screw in a hole following the curved trajectory of the more dense cortical shell of the vertebral body, instead of the porous core. The curved trajectory can be determined by local diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) guiding. Currently, there is no commercial phantom or phantom recipe known that provides the correct optical and structural material characteristics for testing DRS guiding and curved trajectory drilling on, comparing it to similar devices, and perform surgical training sessions on. The research goal is to design and validate an integrated phantom that closes this gap. Preliminary test results: Preliminary optical and structural tests were performed separately on hybrid optical filler samples and structural matrix samples, respectively. The hybrid optical filler samples made out of water, fat (30%, 40% and 50% fat fraction) and silicone (95%, 80%, and 50%) were inspected visually, and spectra were obtained by means of a DRS device in week 0 as well as in week 10. The most promising optical filler sample consisted of 50% of silicone and 50% of water+fat, with a fat fraction of 40%. The measured DRS signals showed a clear correlation between the fitted and actual water+fat content, which, can thus be used as a tissue differentiation parameter. The stability and preservability of phantoms that were enhanced with silicone and resulted in homogeneous mixtures, was increased compared to samples without any silicone. For the structural matrix, different 3D printers, materials, and infill densities were evaluated on drill characteristics and compression characteristics. The best bone mimicking structural phantom consisted of an FDM printed part made out of ABS with a gyroid infill structure with an infill density of 50%. Integrated phantom validation: The combination of the optical filler and the structural matrix was validated by infusing the optical filler in the structural matrix with a vacuum chamber and measuring the drill characteristics and DRS spectra at various depths inside the phantom. A gradual increase in axial drilling force and a gradual change in spectral shape was noticed as a function of depth from the cancellous zone, to the pre-cortical zone and cortical zone. Discussion: The ABS material and the actual optical filler constituents (such as peanut oil and specific silicone types) should be implemented inviii the fitting algorithm. Nevertheless, the results of this research show not only great potential phantom design for a wide variety of bone types because of the structure and shape design flexibility of 3D printing, but also for soft tissues by using only the optical filler with a much better stability and preservability than traditional soft tissue phantoms.","Bone phantom; diffuse reflectance spectroscopy; Bone Drilling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-01-25","","","","Mechanical Engineering | BioMechanical Design","",""

Yet, the environmental consequences of using virgin plastics demand new sustainable solutions. In this quest, being capable of predicting the mechanical behavior of post-consumer recycled plastics is essential to support the adoption of these materials in engineering applications. This literature review focuses on recycled polypropylene and its mechanical viability when used in closures, a common part in packaging industry. Recycled polypropylene’s performance is found to be dependent on crystallinity, which in turn is dependent on the length of the polymer chains, isotacticity and other co-polymerization segments. This document also reviews constitutive models applicable to predict the behavior of closures via the the finite element method. A suitable thermo-viscoplastic model is selected, setting the stage for the finite element analyses to be conducted during the dissertation work. The application of recycled polypropylene is challenging due to its low mechanical properties. In the thesis, we demonstrate the possible aspects which decide the properties of post consumer recycled polypropylene (PCR-PP), including molecular weight, tacticity, interface structure and degradation. After discussing the material properties, the focus is to testify the application of PCR-PP in closures for particular functionality. For active closures, the weakest structure is the hinge, at the middle of lid. To verify if the material is applicable to active closures. Finite element analysis are conducted to help develop new products in a more efficient way, and also reduce the plastic waste. In the thesis, the explicit dynamic method and the static general method are applied with different boundary conditions in the model to simulate the differentiation of closures including manufacturing conditions. The explicit dynamic simulation involves higher computational cost, and due to the existence of inertial effect, the observed reaction force is significantly higher than it should be when the mass scaling is over a certain region. Considering an implicit static analysis was found to be proper. Once the loading condition was simplified and by carefully choosing an propriate thermo-visco-plastic constitutive model, the finite element analysis can predict the snap through behavior of the closure. The snapthrough behavior also shows that the equivalent plastic strain at the hinge middle is higher than the maximum tensile strain of polypropylene(QCP-300P) under room temperature. However, when subjected to 69 degree Celsius, the closure is expected to deform without failing. This result demonstrate the necessity of bending the closures right after injection molding, which fit with the experimental result.","Polypropylene recycling; Finite element analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-01-25","","","","Materials Science and Engineering","",""

The research relies on a participatory modeling process with 11 expert practitioners, supplemented with a case study of an auto manufacturer for model testing. The research conceptualizes and designs a spreadsheet techno-economic model to measure the firm-level transition risk in the auto sector, defined as the capital requirement and regulatory risks, operationalized using cash flow. The model results show that the policy risk influences the degree to which the auto manufacturers invest to address transition risk. In addition, the expert practitioners agreed that the model is useful.

This paper explores the effectiveness of (1) utilising a genetic algorithm (GA) to train the weights of NNs used for SCA, (2) using NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT), which is a commonly used approach for automated NN architecture search, to construct architectures for use in SCA, and (3) \textit{Neuroevolution to Attack Side-Channel Traces Yielding Convolutional Neural Networks} (NASCTY-CNNs), a novel GA that applies genetic operators on the scale of layers rather than neurons to automatically produce CNNs for side-channel analysis. The results indicate that weight evolution and our neat-based approach are successful when attacking weak, unprotected targets. However, they do not perform well on the ASCAD data set, against which SCA methods are commonly benchmarked, suggesting these methods require significant tweaking to be effective. NASCTY can automatically produce novel NNs that achieve performance close to state-of-the-art approaches on both masked and desynchronised ASCAD traces, demonstrating that such neuroevolution methods provide a solid venue for further research.","Side-channel attacks; Genetic algorithms; Neural networks; Neural architecture search","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science","",""

Due to the high transmissibility of the virus and with the aim of preventing the virus from continue spreading, several measures have been applied during the last two years, which now have become part of people's daily life. One of these measures is physical distancing, which has been proven to be an effective way to reduce the transmission risk. The objective of this research is to understand how the walking behaviour of pedestrians has changed during COVID-19 because of physical distancing at bidirectional flows in locations where people might encounter difficulties for complying with this measure, and conduct a calibration of the pedestrian simulation model Pedestrian Dynamics (PD) to improve its accuracy for reproducing such behaviour. As a result, this research aims at determining the capability of the model to reproduce the walking behaviour during the pandemic. The results show that the walking behaviour has changed over the course of the pandemic, since in 2020 and 2021 pedestrians kept respectively larger and shorter distances than in 2019. Moreover, a larger variability in velocity and higher effort to traverse the measurement area suggest changes in the awareness of their surroundings during the pandemic. The calibration results show that the relaxation time is the most relevant parameter as the accuracy of the model significantly changes when values lower than its default are used, which in turn indicates a faster reaction of pedestrians. In conclusion, a calibrated model considering one parameter would not yield accurate predictions if a general usage for all COVID-19 scenarios is intended. Finally, different types of behaviour are recommended to be analysed to obtain insight into the capability of the model to reproduce them and moreover, the behavioural assessment at strategic and tactical level are adviced, since this research focused on the impact of physical distancing on the behaviour at operational level.","Pedestrian Dynamics; Walking Behaviour; Active modes; COVID-19","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Transport and Planning","",""

This report aims to present an analysis method that can represent the joints of jacket support structures for offshore wind turbines with high fidelity while also ensuring low computational cost during the analyses. The joint stiffness is captured through an implementation of joint submodelling by applying the Craig-Bampton reduction technique. Along with this, the report serves to provide a comparison of innovative wrapped composite joints and traditional welded joints when applied to a 10MW wind turbine. The wrapped composite joint was developed by Dr. Marko Pavlović at the Delft University of Technology, and it was investigated due to its superior fatigue performance compared to welded joint alternatives.<br/>Two sets of analyses were conducted: the jacket analysed by itself, and the jacket analysed along with the tower, turbine, and piles (to be referred to as the ”offshore wind turbine”). Natural frequency analyses were conducted for the jacket and for the offshore wind turbine for the different joint types. It was found that for the jacket and for the entire offshore wind turbine, the models with welded joints had the lowest natural frequencies, the models with wrapped composite joints had the second lowest natural frequencies, and the models with rigid joints had the highest natural frequencies when compared to their respective counterparts. <br/>In conclusion, both the application of the wrapped composite joints and the application of the analysis method of submodelling joints of the jacket are beneficial for solving issues related to the construction of jacket support structures for large wind turbines.<br","Offshore Wind; FRP; Wrapped FRP; Craig-Bampton; Submodelling; Superelement; Jacket structure; Eigenfrequency","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

One of the issues regarding TSF management is the lack of site investigation and sample analyses, which cause the uncertainty of geotechnical properties of mine tailings materials. For a proper operation of tailings storage facilities, the owner should study the material involved and understand the physical and chemical properties associated with it. In case of mine tailings dam failure, the resulting flood wave supposes an environmental, social and economical disaster for society.<br/><br/>Mine tailings dam break studies use numerical models to predict the flooding area and assess the possible damaged area. Historically, these studies were carried out according to Newtonian modelling principles, but the presence of solids within the fluid suggests that the resulting flood wave of a TSF failure should be treated as a non-Newtonian fluid. Absence of laboratory data regarding the geotechnical properties of mine tailings materials make difficult the prediction of such flood wave, since the composition of the mixture is unknown. Therefore, the aim of this research is to study the flow behaviour of mine tailings materials in case of failure of tailings storage facilities.

Neutrally stable compliant mechanisms are a class of compliant mechanisms that use the flexibility of their members to deform and maintain that deformed configuration without requiring external work. In order to make a compliant mechanism neutrally stable, pre-stress is required. In most cases, this pre-stress is applied when the neutrally stable compliant mechanisms are being made. Therefore, neutrally stable compliant mechanisms are always in a zero-stiffness state. In this research, a new Compliant Active Neutrally Stable joint (CANS-J) is developed in which this pre-stress can be turned on and off using active materials. This means that the joint can switch between a stiff state and a zero-stiffness state. This change in the stiffness is realized by a Flexinol SMA wire. A Flexinol wire can contract when it is heated. This active behavior of the Flexinol wire is used to turn on and off the pre-stress when required. Results show that the CANS-J shows behavior which is close to neutral stability in the active state with a significant range of motion. The CANS-J can for instance be used to transport a satellite with solar panels to its orbit around the world. During transportation the solar panels are folded for which the joints are required to be in a stiff state. In orbit, the solar panels are unfolded for which the joints are required to have zero stiffness.","active materials; Compliant Mechanisms; neutral stability; pre-stress; SMA wire","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Mechatronic System Design (MSD)","Shell skeletons",""

It is shown that the RAS method converges to the correct solution in a small amount of iterations. However, the deflation method, in combination with another preconditioner, performs better in terms of computation time. An important observation is that the relative residual can only be used as a reliable stopping criterion when the deflation method is used. The methods can be combined into the DRASCG method, which converges in an extremely small number of iterations. In a parallel environment, the speedup of the RASCG method is limited by a load imbalance in the amount of work required for the application of the preconditioner for each subdomain. The deflation method obtains good speedup, that is close to the ideal speedup. The methods are compared when the number of subdomains is increased.

A material passport (MP) is seen as a collaboration tool that could close the information gap and promote the CE transition within the CI. There is little empirical data on MP implementation within science and practice, and the development of different MP initiatives is not harmonised. To standardise the development of MP’s so that data will be interchangeable and comparable, platform CB’23 has created guidelines for MP implementation and development. The objective of this research is to capture the lessons learned, and identify barriers and objectives for implementation within practice.

This research has analysed a first-of-its-kind BIM-based MP implementation for a new building in the Netherlands.<br/><br/>Reflecting the findings of this research against the broadly accepted work agreements of the guideline, it can be concluded that implementation within practice is much more unruly and ad hoc than the suggested implementation guideline and road towards standardisation.

Private and public support of the work agreements is not aligned and could lead to the separation of MP development. Nevertheless, parties recognise the need for data registration in order to transition towards a circular economy. MP development should work towards creating the essential committed cooperation of all parties in the value chain, as within a circular economy the whole value chain should be involved. This could either mature through governmental involvement or market force, but balancing the economic and societal values of stakeholders within the value chain will become necessary to ensure the full potential of the tool to facilitate circular material flow within the construction industry. Future research should gather more empirical knowledge, and it is recommended that perspectives from both private and public clients be included.","Circular Economy; Material Passports; BIM-based Material Passport; Guideline","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

One sorting technique that has received a lot of attention is based on acoustophoresis. Manipulating cells with acoustic forces allows for a sorting method based on physical properties in a non-invasive, label-free, and biocompatible manner. To date, acoustic sorting devices have been developed using either an interdigitated transducer (IDT) or a lead zirconate titanate (PZT) as an acoustic source. IDTs generate surface acoustic waves (SAW) that can sort particles with high precision, however only low throughput is possible. PZT, on the other hand, generates bulk acoustic waves (BAW) that allows for a simple device architecture with high throughput. Nevertheless, the current research done on BAW sorting devices also shows the disadvantage of frequency restrictions.<br/><br/>An attractive alternative to PZT in acoustic sorting devices that has yet to be researched, are the capacitive Micromachined Ultrasonic Transducers (CMUT). CMUTs are well-known for their broad bandwidth, batch production and the possibility for complex designs and integration with electronic circuits. <br/>In this work, we present proof-of-concept devices to examine that CMUTs can be used as an acoustic source for particle sorting. Two different acoustic-microfluidic device interfaces were considered, namely the sidewall and the top area of the CMUT. Additionally, the presence of an acoustic pressure within the silicon substrate of the CMUT's die was investigated.<br/><br/>Experiments show that CMUTs generate an acoustic pressure within the silicon substrate of the CMUT's die. This acoustic pressure increased 6.4 times when a phase alignment approach was used compared to when no phase alignment approach was used. Following these findings, acoustic-based sorting devices were assembled to perform particle alignment experiments. It was shown that continuous particle sorting could be demonstrated efficiently for both interfaces by using a pressure field based on standing waves. Additionally, structures integrated into the microfluidic devices, such as a vacuum horn, have the potential to amplify the acoustic signal. These findings indicate that CMUT-based microfluidic devices could provide a promising method for sheathless particle sorting.","Microfluidics; Acoustic separation techniques; Bio-applications; Bulk acoustic waves; Surface acoustic waves","en","master thesis","","","","","","Part of this work has been presented in the following publications: S.

The Flying V is a flying wing passenger aircraft designed to transport about 300 passengers. The handling qualities of such a new configuration aircraft are to be investigated before the aircraft can continue in its design process. The first step is to investigate the longitudinal handling qualities of the Flying V in cruise conditions. The handling qualities are heavily affected by the geometry of the aircraft, which has no tail and has a shorter arm to the elevons for the pitch control. These two main differences do not affect the pitch angle control negatively, which is the focus of conventional handling qualities evaluations, but have a strong effect on the flight path angle. This effect is a non-minimum phase response due to the large change in lift needed to generate the pitching moment. To test this flight path angle behaviour, a new evaluation of the handling qualities is implemented which uses flight path angle tracking.<br/>Two control allocations were created: one where both inboard and outboard elevons deflect in the same direction, and one where the change in lift the elevons generate is countered by deploying the inboard and outboard elevons in opposite directions. The longitudinal handling qualities in cruise conditions were investigated by pilot opinion in a moving base simulator. Three experiments were conducted: a traditional pitch experiment, the novel flight path angle experiment, and the latter experiment using the second control allocation. <br/>The pilots indicated the pitch attitude control to be Level 1 handling qualities, while the normal control allocation flight path experiment was Level 2. The new control allocation improved the performance of the pilots during the experiment, but the lowered control authority was too much for most pilots to rate it at Level 1.","Flying V; Handling Qualities; Piloted Experiment; Simulator","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-01-24","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Flying V",""

Vertebrae are conventionally fixated by means of pedicle screws, the downsides of which are accidental cortical wall breaches during drilling and poor holding strength of the screw. The holding strength of the bone anchor may be improved by increasing its contact area with the hard cortical wall of the vertebral body. To accomplish this, a curved hole needs to be made along the inside of the cortical wall. This research presents the design, manufacturing, and testing of a bone drilling device, that is flexible in one plane. To this end, the drill was developed on the basis of the tsetse fly’s proboscis, which is a mechanism that uses a cutting surface with its axis of rotation perpendicular to the drilling direction. Implementing this cutting motion has several advantages over conventional drilling: It facilitates using leaf springs as a flexible transmission, and it is not limited to drilling round holes. A prototype was built and tested on Sawbones closed cell foam, which closely mimics the mechanical properties of the cancellous bone found in human vertebrae. The prototype was capable of effectively cutting through foam with densities up to 10 pounds per cubic foot (PCF) with a feed rate of 50 mm/min. The ability to deflect off and follow a simulated cortical wall was also tested, and proved to be effective up to an insertion angle of 15˚.

In order to address these issues, information sharing techniques were devised, known as multi-task learning. These forms of learning algorithms learn multiple tasks at the same time, sharing numerical updates of their parameters. By doing this, a whole new amount of opportunities are opened up to mix and match tasks and datasets and the amount of applications of this are growing. However, while more and more promising results have been achieved using multi-task set-ups, there is an added amount of developmental complexity by having to deal with multiple datasets and tasks. This complexity grows signicantly the more dierences there are in the combinations. Furthermore, research requires experimentation and comparison of dierent set-ups, which is quickly complicated by the combinations, compared to single task set-ups. In order to promote research in this eld, these developmental roadblocks must be cleared up. So far however, no framework seems to aid in the development of multi-dataset, let alone multi-task set-ups. This work addresses the technical diculties in implementing, evaluating and experimenting with multi-task set-ups. By devising the multi-task set-up as a pipeline going from the raw datasets to trained and evaluated models with interchangeable parts, a framework is built that brings the development closer to single dataset, single task learning set-ups. The idea is for developers to only have to focus on implementing single pipeline parts, with the freedom to assemble and re-assemble them without having to worry about the combinatorial problems. This starts by investigating the current literature, where the elds in audio recognition and multi-task learning are analysed, specically for how and what they research and consecutively how these areas came together. Frameworks for the development of deep learning are also examined, determining which lessons to take in tackling this issue and nding the current state of aairs. This study provides the basis for the developmental software framework, CombinaTorch, built on top of PyTorch, that allows free assembly of multi-task pipelines. The framework is subsequently used to implement several set-ups described in the literature, where their comparative reduction in amount of work is assessed. In order to validate the expressiveness of the framework, another delve into the literature is made, discussing several scenarios and their implementation viability with the framework.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(mentor); Cao, Wen-Jun (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","The main motivation within this thesis is to explore the possibility of increasing the service life of box-beam bridge girders to aid the ambition of the Dutch government to become a circular economy. The construction industry still follows a more or less linear economy system. Many bridges in the Netherlands are approaching the end of their service lives, and efforts are being made to extend the lives of these bridges. This is but a temporary solution, and these bridges will require replacement within 20-30 years. This provides an opportunity to incorporate circularity within new and upcoming structures from the design phase onward rather than only as an end-of-life practice. Therefore this thesis explores the possibilities of incorporating the strategy of lifespan extension, in the form of a cover increase against chloride-induced corrosion. The exact increase was calculated through the use of a relevant service life design model (DuraCrete) and compared with the Eurocodes. The reliability of the model was checked using a Monte Carlo simulation. Subsequently, the circular aspects of future adaptability were also investigated considering a fictitious scenario of increased traffic load. Hence, it was concluded that a marginal increase in concrete volume and prestressing steel per beam would allow for a more durable and adaptable beam for the future. <br","box-beam; service life; Chloride ingress; durability; adaptability","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering | Concrete Structures","",""

Model predictive control (MPC) is one of the most powerful and practical tools currently available. It is important to select the parameters of the MPC, such as weights, in a way so that different control objectives can be met within the desired performance constraints. The tuning procedure of the MPC variables can be achieved automatically by employing appropriate approaches. To make the tuning process more robust to different scenarios, one approach is to choose a decision-making architecture that provides guidance. This thesis therefore aims at developing a system integrating an automatic tuning method with a decision-making module. In order to achieve the objectives, Genetic Algorithm and Behavior Tree are employed on top of an existing motion planner. The motion planner is based on model predictive contouring control (MPCC) and the proposed method is tested in CARLA simulation environment.

However, impact forecasts are often underestimated when consecutive hazards are not considered. In the Bicol region in the Philippines, typhoons trigger 90% of landslides, causing a lot of fatalities and damage to infrastructure and agriculture. The lack of information on past landslide events has hampered the construction of landslide forecasting models. Currently, a machine learning (ML) impact-based forecasting (IBF) model for typhoons is operational in the Philippines. The model was developed by 510, an initiative of the Netherlands Red Cross. The model predicts impact due to the high wind speeds associated with typhoons and includes the possible impact due to landslides only via a static landslide susceptibility map. Hence, this study focused on extending the 510 typhoon model via hybrid modeling into a multi-hazard forecasting model for both typhoons and landslides to improve the forecast by considering impact from typhoon-induced landslides. The implementation of the hybrid multi-hazard impact-based forecasting model was tested on two typhoon events in the Bicol region. <br/><br/>A hydrometeorological landslide IBF model was successfully created, even with the limited data on landslide occurrences and rainfall available. The newly established regional event duration threshold for Bicol was applied on the case study events with an increased impact boundary of 300 km compared to the typhoon impact boundary of 100 km. The results of the hybrid multi-hazard model showed an improved impact forecast -compared to the model considering solely static input of landslides, which underestimated impact- in both location extent of the impact forecast and in accuracy: the True Positives doubled, whereas the False Negatives reduced by half. The separate landslide IBF model as an extension of the existing ML typhoon model provided additional benefits as these models can be decoupled to optimize the performance and reliability of both. This study resulted in the prototype of an impact-based multi-hazard model for typhoons and landslides for the Philippines and demonstrated the importance of considering impact from consecutive hazards.<br/><br","Landslide; Typhoon; Consecutive hazards; Impact-based forecasting; Rainfall; Machine learning; Philippines","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Environmental Engineering","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","The water balance model has been an indispensable tool for quantifying water supply and demand and regulating water resources for decades. By convention, hydrologists use in-situ measurements of river discharge for model calibration. Whereas hardly is it possible for areas suffering from data storage. Researchers have been working on methods dealing with this problem for many years. Satellite datasets are potential substitutes for the in-situ observation of hydrological variables. This research proposes a monthly strategy using satellite time series as model inputs. This research aims to apply this strategy in the absence of gauged data for discharge simulations and predictions. Instead of streamflow, the strategy uses variables like actual evapotranspiration (ETa) and/or water storage for calibration. The research challenges lie in the situation that there can be significant errors in data derived from satellite products. Also, hydrological models designed for discharge simulation cannot necessarily function well when calibrated on other terms. This boils down to the research questions as follow:<br/>1. How large are water balance data errors and to what extent can they be reduced?<br/>2. How large are water balance model errors and to what extent can they be reduced?<br/>3. To what extent does quantifying and reducing data and model errors eliminate trade-offs in fitting multiple datasets?<br/>The strategy is constructed based on an error estimation and water balance data fusion method and the original and the advanced version of the Water Partition and Balance model (Wapaba), then tested in the Smoky Hill River catchment. When using unprocessed data, the water balance is not closed for the basin. The discharge simulation has the fitting precision index the Box-Cox transformed root mean squared error (TRMSE) in the range of 0.70 - 1.43 for different datasets and in calibration and validation period. Indexes of discharge fitting σma$ exceed 1.66. After closing the water balance with the mean time series of all fluxes, TRMSE decreases to 0.55. Considering data uncertainties, TRMSE is further declined to 0.29 and σ drops to 0.46. After that, the model structure is also improved. When using the modified model to calibrate on only ETa and TWSA for calibration (TRMSE for discharge = 0.87), the performance is similar to that of using the original Wapaba on all fluxes (TRMSE for discharge = 0.86). The fitting precision index σ for TWSA also decreases.<br/><br/>The research demonstrates the effectiveness of the data fusion method in correcting satellite time series and sheds light on the potential of application of this strategy in the ungauged area through the comparison of different calibration cases. After modification, the strategy is able to reproduce the flow regime, without using in-situ data, to the same degree as all three hydrological components (discharge, actual evapotranspiration and water storage) are used for calibration.<br","satellite time series; Wapaba model; data fusion","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Water Management","",""

Their function as a safety and security system could benefit from adding recording capabilities. With such capabilities, people could be located during evacuation or announcements could be adjusted to room acoustics for better intelligibility. However, adding microphones to a PA system is too costly and inefficient to be feasible. This thesis evaluates the feasibility of using the loudspeakers already in place as recording devices to provide information to the system. To this end, a system using a single loudspeaker as both a playback and recording device is analysed, modelled and simulated. The results show that using a current measuring set-up with an analogue-to-digital converter capable of detecting a range of roughly 120 dB, a speech signal up to three metres in a cone of 120° from a loudspeaker can be successfully estimated in an office room with an announcement playing and background noise present. As the estimated signal is unknown to the system, the solution generalises to other signal types as well. A system with a single loudspeaker can be utilised for the use cases presented, and is therefore proven feasible. To increase the practicality of the system, it is recommended to continue the research in two main areas. The first area considers improving the quality of the recording and extending the range from which the system can produce accurate recordings. The second area considers evaluating the practical implementation of the system, by extending the single loudspeaker case to a multiple loudspeaker case and generalising the system to be readily implementable in a large variety of PA systems.","loudspeaker; microphone; recording; public address","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore, it is easy to imagine that people with diminished hand functionality experience a reduced quality of life. This implies for patients with joint problems. Consequently, the hand functionality should be increased through splinting. Splinting is a non-operative treatment for patients with commonly rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis and ehlers danlos syndrome.<br/><br/>In this master thesis, an ultra personalized splint and service system has been designed. This product-service system includes the whole patient journey, from medical consult to gathering anthropometric data and producing the personalized splint. Throughout the design process, a computational design approach was leading. This started with defining the patient needs and the splint functionality. Thereafter, several options for data and parameter acquisition were explored. The options differed in the complexity of anthropometric data. The first concept was based on a 3D scan (3D), the second on a photograph (2D), and the third on hand measurements (1D). The latter involved the use of a statistical shape model (SSM).<br/>With regard to the 3D scanning procedure, both mesh wrapping and digital posture correction were implemented and evaluated. Unfortunately, this did not result in an accurate design reference. Further research on posture correction for orthosis design is therefore recommended.<br/>Additional research on 3D scanning of patients with rheumatoid arthritis gave great insight into the possibilities concerning the 3D scanning process. 3D scanning involves great challenges with regard to patients with pathological hands. The process remains not viable until an instant 3D hand scanner becomes available. The SSM is proposed as a bridging solution towards the instant 3D scan or eventually incorporating the hand scan in artificial intelligence (AI) processing workflows.<br/>Furthermore, a parametric computational design has been modelled. This design automatically adjusts to the anthropometric data of the patient. It allows for customization of the medical requirements and the aesthetic features. There has been emphasized on medical jewellery design. Different materials have been explored for this purpose.<br/>Finally, the fit and functionality evaluation showed good results.

However, for this technology to have a significant impact, it has to be successfully implemented on an industrial scale. Numerical simulations can aid with the study of process parameters and reactor design. </p><p class=""MsoNormal"">The overall aim of this project is to develop and utilise a numerical model that can describe phenomena arising in the CO<sub>2</sub> electrolyser inside the flooded catalyst layer (CL). First, the general operation of the electrolyser is addressed, and this is extended for the effect of liquid flow rate, electrolyser length, and operating pressure. To investigate the performance and limitations arising at the large-scale, the model is scaled-up to describe a one meter long electrolyser. The study is concluded with two considerations that could improve the electrolyser performance. These points were addressed by developing a 2D numerical model of a gas diffusion-based CO<sub>2 </sub>electrolyser in COMSOL Multiphysics. We assessed the performance of the electrolyser in terms of current density, reflecting rate of species formation, and of faradaic efficiency for CO (FE), reflecting selectivity towards the desired product.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Investigating the small-scale electrolyser we find that at high current density (200 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>), the pH in the CL immediately increases by 3 units and further diagonally increases from pH 10.1the inlet to 12.2 around the outlet. When operating the electrolyser with excess of CO<sub>2</sub> supply, we find the CL to perform the best near the gas phase boundary (311 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, 95% FE), while the regions close to the electrolyte are underperforming (250 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, 89% FE). This shows that the performance in certain regions of the CL needs to be improved. <br/></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">When scaling-up the electrolyser to a length of one meter we find that the performance does not change dramatically when operating at excess of gas supply. However, if a high CO<sub>2</sub> conversion should be achieved, the long electrolyser shows a 10% decrease in FE, and CO<sub>2</sub> conversion compared to a small-scale electrolyser, at the same level of current density (115 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>).  Analysing the current density locally, we find that difference between the inlet and outlet can be as large as 100 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>. Next, we find that FE can fall to almost 50% around the outlet. This shows that when adding extra length to the long electrolyser, this extra length only adds a fraction of its potential performance.</p><p class=""MsoNormal""><br/>The uneven utilization of the catalyst can be improved by varying the catalyst loading along the electrolyser length. This improves the FE by around 5% while using 40% less catalyst. We also find that while the current density is slightly lower, the amount of product generated per mass of catalyst has significantly increased. This shows that carefully engineering the catalyst loading can save the amount of catalyst needed and could potentially improve the cost-effectiveness of the CO<sub>2 </sub>electrolyser.</p><p class=""MsoNormal""><br/>In all cases the performance over the CL is unevenly distributed. To achieve a higher performance, research needs to find ways how to enhance the performance also in the poorly utilised regions of the CL. Scaling-up the electrolyser just by extending its length proves inefficient and inevitably leads to a lower performance. The beneficial buffering effect provided by the electrolyte at a small-scale does not translate to a large-scale. At this moment, performance of large-scale CO<sub>2 </sub>electrolysers seems satisfactory only when operating at very low CO<sub>2</sub> conversion. From the investigated parameters that address the performance issues, higher operating pressure and smart catalyst loading seem only promising options, however, other options should be found to speed up the development.","Electrochemical CO2 reduction; Modelling study; Local environment; Large-scale electrolyser; Current distribution; Local pH; Catalyst loading","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-08-31","","","","Applied Physics","",""

Mutation carriers of HCM who have not yet developed LVH are called genotype-positive left ventricular hypertrophy-negative (G+/LVH-) patients. The primary aim of this study was to investigate whether a radiomics model is able to distinguish between G+/LVH- patients and healthy controls, based on cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) images. In total three datasets are analysed. A development dataset was used to develop different radiomics models and to evaluate the performance of the models. The models were validated on both the prospective validation dataset and external validation dataset. G+/LVH- patients had to be known to carry a class 4 (likely pathogenic) or class 5 (pathogenic) gene mutation for HCM and a maximum left ventricular wall thickness of &lt;13mm.

From these segmentation 555 features including shape, intensity and texture were extracted. Evaluation of radiomics models was performed through a 100x stratified random-split cross-validation in development dataset. Next, the models were validated on prospective validation dataset and external validation dataset. The radiomics model with best performance developed on development dataset had a mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.89.

One of these sustainable developments is the transition towards a 100% circular building economy with high-quality reuse. However, the sector has insufficient knowledge and understanding about the possibilities and opportunities to transition towards a circular economy. In the current linear economy outdated existing buildings are demolished and replaces with new buildings. This research provides knowledge on a new design strategy of giving existing load-bearing components a proper end-of-service life application by reusing them. This research focuses on outdated school buildings in the Netherlands and sees these existing school buildings as urban mines to extract load-bearing components for new school buildings. In this way, the linear building cycle of load-bearing components closes, and the switch to a circular building economy is possible. <br/><br/>This research proposes a quantitative assessment of the potential reclaim and reuse of existing load-bearing components. Determining the degree of reclamation and reusability starts with assessing individual components on several indicators. A literature study, interviews, and surveys with practitioners determine the indicators and sub-indicators that influence reclamation and reusability. Each indicator and sub-indictor influence the reclaim and reuse of load-bearing components from the indoor environment. Moreover, the reuse of existing components takes place in new SE school buildings, and therefore, the component must meet the current technical requirements. Subsequently, this research collects the required information for each reusability indicator, the theoretical knowledge. Afterwards, the reusability indicators are translated into an assessment method. The assessment method can quantitatively measure the reclaim and reuse potential technically by giving each indicator and sub-indicator a score for reclaim and reuse. Each reusability indicator has a score ranging from 0 = ‘not reusable’ to 1.0 = ‘highly reusable’. The reusability indicators are independent and weigh equal. As a product, this research translated the theoretical knowledge and assessment method into a practically usable, rapid supportive assessment tool. In this way, awareness, knowledge and insight can be provided about the reuse of load-bearing components. The assessment of the reclaim and reuse potential can serve as a supportive tool that helps school organisations and the project teams with the initial decision to apply the reuse of load-bearing components in the construction process of a new SE school building.

However, a complete hydrologic evaluation of vegetated permeable pavement systems has not been found in existing literature. This research presents an evaluation of the hydrologic performance of VPPS under Dutch climatic conditions is using a combination of a literature study, field evaluation in controlled and uncontrolled environments, and modelling in Hydrus-1D, a software that is designed for analysis of one-dimensional water flow in variably saturated porous media.<br/>At first, the key processes and the potential influence on vegetated infiltration behaviour were identified in the literature study. The hydrologic performance is quantified by two main indicators: the infiltration rate and the water storage capacity, and influenced by changing soil hydraulic properties. Subsequently, the soil hydraulic properties are influenced by processes and factors (clogging, soil compaction, root content, organic matter, biological activity, and soil moisture content).<br/>In the field evaluation, the surface infiltration rates and soil moisture content of two VPPS (with differing amount of grass) and one bare-soiled reference plot were measured using, the Full Scale Infiltration Test (FSIT). Infiltration rates were determined during the tests whil ethe soil moisture content was monitored continuously. <br/>The field tests have led to a number of key findings. It was found that the presence of vegetation compared to no vegetation has a positive effect on the infiltration rate. Moreover, increased vegetation resulted in higher surface infiltration rates, as the soil structure was better maintained against soil compaction due to fast wetting. A possible reason is the increased grass content, which indicates higher root content, and potentially increased organic matter content and biological activity. Another important finding is that fitting the measured water depth curves of the vegetated plots can be calibrated to the Horton infiltration model. The model of Horton shows the dependency of infiltration rate to soil moisture content and water depth. The Full-Scale Infiltration Method is therefore a viable tool to determine infiltration rates and predict infiltration behaviour at the surface.<br/><br/>Although the model was able to make a representation of the observed dynamic water content, the fitted soil hydraulic parameters were very unrealistic compared to common measured values. Efforts to estimate more realistic parameters resulted in numerical divergence. Moreover, soil matric potential data was missing in this study to obtain the soil moisture retention and hydraulic conductivity curve..<br/>Even though the modelling effort did not succeed in this research, it is expected that HYDRUS-1D can be a useful tool to predict soil moisture behaviour provided that rainfall data is used as input over a longer time period, including soil moisture and matric potential measurements. <br/><br/>A base is created to start further research in the evaluation of VPPS hydrologic performance. This research obtained the initial results after construction. In further research, the long-term hydrologic effects of these systems can be investigated. As the experimental set-up at the Green Village is readily available, it is possible to immediately start monitoring soil moisture content and rainfall in the long term.<br","vegetated; permeable; pavement; systems; infiltration; SUDS","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Water Management | Urban Water Engineering","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Since 2019, Rijkswaterstaat has been applying flexible water level management in the IJsselmeer and Markermeer to make the Dutch water system more robust and future proof. The fixed target water level of -0.20 m NAP during summer is replaced by a flexible water level in which the water level can fluctuate between -0.10 and -0.30 m NAP to enlarge the fresh water supply and to anticipate on weather conditions. In the IJsselmeer region, 15,600 hectares of land is located outside primary levees. These areas are mainly pasturelands, recreation areas, nature areas and some buildings and infrastructure areas. By applying flexible water level management, the probability of high water levels increases and therefore flood risk in areas outside primary levees increases. However, the relation between applying flexible water level management and flood risk has not been investigated in detail yet. This research explores this relation further, on smaller scale as well as for the whole IJsselmeer region. <br/><br/>Flood risk is defined as the yearly probability of exceedance of hydraulic loads (lake water level, wind set up and wave run-up) multiplied by the consequences of inundation and is expressed in euros per year. Risk is a set of scenarios, with each a probability and a consequence, and therefore discretization is necessary. Hydraulic loads are calculated in Hydra-NL, a probabilistic model. By uploading hydraulic loads associated to their exceedance probability in the Waterschadeschatter, the consequences are defined and flood risk can be computed. <br/>Flood risk depends on the lake water level, wind set up and wave run-up. The lake water level and wave run-up are in general higher when flexible water level management is applied and wind set up is lower. This observation is valid for all areas outside primary levees in the IJsselmeer region. About 90% of the total damage comes from water damage in buildings and infrastructure areas, and then especially from residential areas. Since less than 3% of areas outside primary levees consist of buildings and infrastructure areas and less than 10% of buildings and infrastructure areas consist of residential areas, the flood risk is reduced. Moreover, most computations show overestimations. Water levels computed in Hydra-NL are higher than occurred water levels and the upper boundary of -0.10 m NAP is used to calculate effects of flexible water level management. Because both overestimations are used and there are just a few residential areas, most areas located outside primary levees in the IJsselmeer region will hardly suffer from applying flexible water level management. This research shows that interests of areas outside primary levees in the IJsselmeer region and applying flexible water level management go quite well together. Therefore, the IJsselmeer region offers many opportunities. <br","Flexible water level management; Flood risk; IJsselmeer region; Areas outside primary levees","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Water Management","",""

This research investigates the potential benefit of a 3D model of blood vessels on a 2D screen or Virtual Reality (VR) environment in preoperative planning for DIEAP flap breast reconstruction, compared to conventional CTA on a 2D screen. Materials &amp; Methods A qualitative study was conducted among six reconstructive plastic surgeons and four residents. Participants were asked to select the ideal perforator for unilateral DIEAP flap reconstruction in three viewing environments: conventional CTA in a 2D view, a 3D model in a 2D view and a 3D model in an immersive virtual reality (VR) view. Subsequently, a questionnaire on anatomical structure visibility assessing six perforator characteristics (perforator location in the flap, calibre, intramuscular course through the rectus abdominis, perforator origin, subcutaneous branching and connection to other vessels) was completed. Second, an adjusted Usefulness, Satisfaction and Ease of Use (USE) questionnaire on system usability was filled out.Results Ten participants completed the experiments. The overall score distribution for perforator visibility characteristics was equal or higher except for perforator calibre in both 3D model views compared to conventional CTA. In the USE questionnaire, the 3D model in 2D view reported the highest scores for satisfaction and ease of learning. 90% of participants considered a 3D model in VR view to be of added value to preoperative planning, 60% considered a 3D model in 2D to be of added value.

As a result of the extreme weather conditions presented by the STOWA, deteriorating sewers, and the increase of paved areas in urban environments, alternative solutions (i.e. SuDS) are becoming more relevant. However, the adoption of these innovations is still rather slow. Answers are sought by different scholars, however, for the Netherlands research remains limited. SuDS that are implemented in public space fall under the responsibility of the municipalities. Hence, recent studies have highlighted factors in the implementation process of SuDS for municipalities in general. The biggest municipalities seem to always be leading in research and disparities in how different organizations perceive influencing factors of the implementation process have not been studied yet.<br/>The research objective of this thesis is to find to which extent the perceived factors in the main- streaming process between different sized municipalities differ.<br/><br/>The methodology consists of a literature review, two case studies, and a focus group. The literature review concerned transition theory which was applied to climate adaptation. A conceptual framework has been developed that describes the mainstreaming process. Different theories were combined in this framework: the Mainstreaming model, four-A framework, Governance Capacity Framework, multi-level perspective.<br/><br/>The empirical research applied consists of case studies that have taken place in two Dutch municipalities: Rotterdam and Capelle aan den IJssel. The case studies considered were projects that implemented a new concept for the first time. The main criteria for the selection were the size of the municipalities and their (geo)hydrological boundary conditions. A comparison was made between the results of both studies and cross-checked in a focus group. The data in the case studies were collected through semi-structured interviews and documentation. The semi-structured interviews were based on themes identified in the conceptual framework. The semi-structured interviews were conducted via Microsoft Teams. Examples of questions that were asked were: ""What were the main drivers for the project in your city?"" and ""Do you find that propositions of innovations are well received in your department?"".<br/>The interviewees were part of these case studies and sampled through a stakeholder diagram and snowball effects. In total 10 participants were interviewed which were part of the case studies. To increase the validation of the case study results, different municipalities were invited to participate in a focus group to evaluate how they identified with the findings. This focus group consisted out<br/> <br/>The findings of the study imply that the mid-sized municipalities differ from larger municipalities mainly on three factors: <br/>• They still have to form climate adaptive strategies<br/>• Their allocated budgets are inferior<br/>• They lack policies that allow for alternative methods as opposed to traditional sewer management<br/>• They lack climate-adaptive experts who are actively involved in projects<br/><br/>Furthermore, it was found that knowledge sharing of pilot experiments should be pursued more actively to facilitate the adoption of SuDS. In addition, this knowledge is now mostly catered to engineers, developers, and policymakers. For which it was found that to facilitate adoption, the involvement of asset managers should be pursued too. <br/><br/>The research is of conceptual use and is of use for multiple groups. The problem statement has been initiated by VPdelta which is a valorization program that bridges innovative SuDS to the market. It is therefore interesting for them to gain insights into the barriers and driving factors on the side of the clients. For scholars, the research gap of heterogeneity between municipalities has been explored which helps to understand the problem from different perspectives. Lastly, it may be interesting for mid-sized municipalities as recommendations are formed for what they can do to become more climate adaptive. <br/><br/><br/><br","Innovation; SUDS; Adoption; Mainstreaming","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

Cooperative search behaviour can greatly increase the efficiency with which a multi-agent system creates situational awareness of and finds victims within an unknown environment. In this research we develop an autonomous mission planning approach that exploits non-homogeneous characteristics of the robots to increase the overall search performance. Furthermore, the proposed approaches incorporate a hierarchical, cooperative control architecture: At the lower level of control, every SAR agent is locally controlled by a heuristic approach that uses fuzzy-logic control (FLC) and A* search to guide its individual actions. At the higher level of control, a model-predictive-control-based (MPC-based) system coordinates the actions of all SAR agents when two or more agents intend on searching the same area at once. When simulated in a virtual SAR environment, we show that the area coverage performance of the cooperative search approach is comparable to a purely heuristic approach designed for area coverage, while simultaneously outperforming this and another optimisation-based approach in victim detection efficiency. This shows that the hierarchical combination of the heuristic local controller and the optimisation-based supervisory controller is able to outperform either one approach individually. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the cooperative search approach is able to efficiently resolve particular SAR-related search conflicts where a non-cooperative structure fails.","Cooperative Search; Hierarchical Control; Search-and-Rescue","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

(mentor); de Vries, R. (mentor); Ragni, D. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","The Advisory Council of Aviation Research has set the future goals of sustainable development in aviation by reducing pollutant emissions of CO2 by 75% and 90% in NOx emissions per passenger kilometre and noise emission by 65% of the perceived noise level compared with the measurements in 2000. This demand has led to the development of new aircraft concepts with alternative propulsive systems. The development of the all-electric and hybrid-electric aircraft concepts has regenerated the interest in distributed propulsion systems with propellers. Distributed-propeller systems are propulsive configurations with multiple propellers located along the wing or/and aircraft's airframe. Among the benefits of these systems is their electrical connectivity with the power generating sources or energy sources, like batteries, that make them attractive for vehicles performing electrical vertical take-off and landing for urban air mobility. <br/> Previous studies' investigation of multi-rotor systems has been primarily focused on the aerodynamic performance changes in hover conditions. The thrust decrease of these propellers during their operation at a close distance is accompanied by oscillations associated with the flow structures interactions. This results in a noise emission increase attributed to the thrust fluctuations. The investigation, therefore, of the distributed-propeller system in forward flight will contribute to the in-depth analysis of the performance of these systems and illustrate the root of potential changes, assessing the changes in thrust as well as the unsteady loading of the blades. Also, the present analysis will study the mechanisms that lead to noise emission increase and the potential benefits of the relative phase angle variation between adjacent propellers. The effect of the relative phase angle has shown a positive impact on noise emission of multiple-propeller systems without considering the interference between adjacent propellers. Thus, the aim of the present computational study is to investigate the aerodynamic interference and aeroacoustic signature of a distributed-propeller configuration in forward flight, including the effects of the relative phase angle.<br/>The comparison of the distributed-propeller model with the isolated propeller case showed minor differences in the time-averaged performance. The mean thrust coefficient increases slightly by 0.0004, whereas the time evolution plot reveals the thrust oscillation with amplitude equal to 5.3% of the mean value. The trailing vortex systems of adjacent propellers induce velocity components that alter the propellers' flow field upstream and downstream. These induced velocities result in axial velocity increase upstream of the propeller and in non-zero values of the tangential velocity, resulting in thrust oscillations. This results in a change of thrust as the propeller rotates. During the motion of a blade, its thrust is reduced when it approaches the adjacent propeller and subsequently increases during its retreat, resulting in an unsteady loading on the blades. The slipstream of the systems also presents differences from the respective one of an isolated propeller. The symmetric and circular shape of the wake flow behind the isolated propeller is broken and turned into a deformed wake flow behind the distributed-propeller system, as a result of the interference of the tip vortices. The tip vortices emitted by adjacent blades stay close with each other during their downstream motion, with their interaction results in change of trajectory, shape deformation and fast dissipation. <br/>The noise emission of the distributed-propeller system shows a noise level increase in front of the propellers while along the propeller plane, this increase is smaller. The comparison of the middle propeller of the system with the isolated one reveals an increase of 13.5 dB along the propellers axis, while the increase along the plane of rotation is 1.8 dB. The increase along the propeller axis is associated with enhanced tonal components at frequencies up to the 5th blade passing frequency. The directivity of the noise emission and the augmentation of tonal components imply that the unsteady loading is the reason for the noise levels increase. The increase of the broadband component (3.2 dB) at oblique angles with respect to the propeller axis is attributed to the interaction of adjacent flow structures. <br/>The variation of the relative phase angle between adjacent propellers results in blades passing from the region between adjacent propellers at different times. This has positively impacted the unsteady loading as it is decreased compared to the case without relative phase angle variation. The oscillatory behaviour of the thrust is reduced as the standard deviation of the thrust coefficient drops from 0.001 to 4.5e-04. On the contrary, the time-averaged performance of the propellers remains unaffected. The reduction of the unsteady loading results in noise emission reduction in the upstream direction by 5 dB, while at oblique angles in the downstream direction, there is a 1.8 dB increase. This increase is attributed to a different tonal component distribution than in the case without relative phase angle variation. Thus, the impact of the relative phase angle variation could be beneficial on noise emission angles normal to rotor plane due to the reduced unsteady loading.<br","Distributed propulsion; Propeller; Aeroacoustic; Aerodynamic; interaction effect","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

In this paper, we propose a novel predictive maintenance framework that is capable of mapping the individual component degradation levels to an optimal maintenance decision. The independent component degradation levels are computed by a supervised learning model, called ""Long Short-Term Memory Networks"". Subsequently, the computed degradation levels are utilized in a multi-component maintenance decision framework, by using a model-free reinforcement learning technique named ""Deep Q-Learning"". The predictive maintenance framework aims to minimize a cost objective based on the type and frequency of a maintenance action. In addition, we analyzed several key performance indicators, such as the number of components used, the component utilization level, as well as the wasted component lifetime. The predictive maintenance framework was evaluated using NASA's turbofan degradation dataset. Ultimately, the results of the numerical experiments showed that the proposed predictive maintenance framework resulted in lower costs than when using a time-based and corrective maintenance policy and competitive costs compared to an ideal maintenance policy. The proposed predictive maintenance framework opens new directions for multi-component sensor-based maintenance decisions.

Cultivated seaweed can provide a sustainable source of protein for humans and cattle without competing for land, freshwater supply or the use of fertilisers. Kelp forests are known to be a solid basis for an elaborate biome that supports biodiversity in areas that have been damaged by over-fishing or rising sea temperatures. Additionally, kelp forests can lock-in large amounts of Blue Carbon, expanding the oceans’ buffering capacity to mitigate anthropogenic emissions. Furthermore, with their densely seeded lines, offshore kelp farms are found to attenuate wave amplitude, thus providing coastal protection and benefits like increased workability for offshore operations. Both academic publications and industry reviews underline the potential of this sector and significant growth in cultivation is expected in the near future.<br/><br/>Methods currently used for quantification of the damping effects of large-scale offshore kelp farms are diverse and entail varying degrees of accuracy and computational cost. Experimental observations that support the outcomes of these methods are limited to scaled experiments in wave flumes, with various methods used to mimic vegetation. No convergence is found in the most suitable methods for application to large-scale offshore kelp farms.<br/>This research presents a novel modelling framework based upon the Finite Element method, implemented using Julia Programming Language. The effects of the vegetation on the wave climate are represented with a Darcy-Forchheimer term borrowed from porous medium flow theory, including a linear and a quadratic resistance term. The framework comprises a numerical wave tank, using the incompressible Navier Stokes equations. The single-phase model captures the free surface using the coupling of dynamic pressure with a virtual elevation variable through a linearized transpiration boundary condition. Wave energy dissipation is shown to increase significantly by moving the farm structure close to the water surface. Similarly, a decrease in relative water depth - compared to the vegetated height - increases damping potential. Wave period is found to be of strong influence on dissipation, where short waves are attenuated more. Scaling vegetation length with wave length, however, diminishes the reduction in damping of longer waves. Conversely, wave amplitude is shown to be of less influence on the transmission of amplitude through a vegetated patch.<br/>The framework presents a method that is easily scalable, flexible in application on a wide range of flows and vegetation characteristics, and at reasonable computational cost. Introduction of both the linear and quadratic terms extends applicability compared to traditional methods. The approach is verified using convergence studies, application of the model is validated by comparison to existing experimental data. It is shown that experimental set-ups can be reproduced effectively, and simulation results coincide with experimental findings. Validation of outcomes on scales larger than common wave tanks was found unfeasible due to a lack of measurement data. A theoretical case study was performed to predict wave damping of a full-scale kelp farm, demonstrating promising potential with up to 40% wave energy reduction at the local peak wave period.<br/><br/>Further research into the establishment of the Darcy- and Forchheimer-coefficients is recommended. A preliminary range of values has been found, based upon calibration on existing experiments that represent realistic ranges of vegetation characteristics. Furthermore, the main conditions of the flow and vegetation that dictate damping potential are identified. On this basis, research into a physics-based determination of the coefficients is recommended. Additionally, full-scale measurements are advised to validate application on future kelp farm designs.<br/>Through this novel approach, the range of application is increased compared to existing methods, while straightforward setup and usage are governed, and limited computational costs allow for simulation without the need for a dedicated computer setup. The framework is shown to be robust by generating consistent simulation results. In summary, the established framework shows to be a good alternative to existing approaches to investigate the wave damping potential of large-scale offshore kelp farms.","Numerical model; FEM; Julia Language; Porous medium; Kelp farming; Seaweed; Wave damping","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

The experiment includes the exploration of the corrosion process of steel under natural and accelerated conditions. Experiments on the influence of flow velocity and temperature are also included. The corrosion process of mooring chain steel is successfully explored during the monitoring process. Acoustic emission signals related to corrosion are separated. Their sources are reasonably identified. The effects of water flow velocity and temperature of the corrosion process are summarized.<br","Corrosion; Acoustic emission; Marine environment","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-01-31","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

As these dikes are generally covered with grass, insight into the erosion resistance of these grass covers against wave overtopping is desired. To assess the performance of dikes against wave overtopping, various concepts exist, such as the widely used cumulative overload method. However, these concepts lack a thorough understanding of the physical mechanisms at play during grass cover failure as a result of wave overtopping. Furthermore, the methods are generally not time-efficient and are labor intensive, leading to high costs. Therefore, a time-efficient and predictive method is desired that is based on the physical mechanisms of grass cover failure.<br/><br/>The grass pull device, which is used extensively in this thesis, may serve as an alternative for the existing assessment methods. The device, which is reminiscent of a tensile test used in mechanical sciences, is able to exert various load mechanisms on the grass cover. In this thesis, the grass pull device is used to study various aspects of grass cover failure. Special attention is given to the influence of cyclic loading on the grass cover. Additionally, material properties have been derived that may serve as input for numerical grass erosion models. Furthermore, the influence of grass roots, subsoil type and pore saturation on the failure mode of grass covers was investigated. <br/><br/>The results of this study showed a continuous growth of deformation and a decrease in stiffness when the grass cover is loaded cyclically. The behavior of grass during cyclic loading was found to be comparable to other composite materials, such as fiber-reinforced plastics. The material properties Young's and shear modulus were derived. The Young's moduli were found to be slightly overestimated, while the shear moduli were found to be comparable to what may be expected from literature. Differences in grass cover properties on different subsoils were identified, showing that grass covers on clay are generally better at resisting deformation, while having a brittle failure mode. For grass covers on sand, a large spread was observed and the material was found to deform easily, while still providing resistance at large deformations. <br/><br/>Based on the findings of this study, recommendations were made to improve the grass pull device. It was found that the grass pull device was successful in providing insight into various physical processes. Whether the grass pull device will be able to capture all relevant erosion mechanisms remains questionable, but it has proven to be a successful addition to existing assessment methods.<br","Grass covers; Wave overtopping; Erosion resistance; Dike cover; grass erosion; grass revetment","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering | Coastal Engineering","","53.242315, 5.491288"

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","High-flying autonomous aircraft are meant to be deployed in the stratosphere for days or even months. These aircraft share different applications from and several advantages over satellites. Therefore, such aircraft are an interesting subject for research and commercial applications. They are expected to be powered by solar energy and thus heavily depend on their mission profile. <br/><br/>An integrated, multidisciplinary design process is proposed to provide a fast way to evaluate an extensive parameter space while requiring minimum input parameters. This process is realised by developing a process which incorporates several critical disciplines required for a high-flying autonomous aircraft, implemented into a software-tool. The underlying disciplines include the basic aerodynamics and structural analysis of an aircraft, which must be connected with a mission analysis approach, considering the constantly changing irradiation conditions and the resulting aircraft power management and constant re-evaluation of aircraft parameters. <br/><br/>The aircraft’s dependence on solar energy led to the implementation of a time-based, iterative sizing approach which relied on handbook formulas and empirical estimation methods. The tool ultimately consists of different levels, permitting the use of a core process to evaluate aircraft configurations and missions and provide aircraft performance estimates for researchers and designers. This core process can further be used by outer levels for parametric studies, enabling users to change the basic parameters of the aircraft or the mission definition. These studies can be used to compare aircraft parameter configurations or to conduct use case analysis of a given aircraft. The tool is shown to be capable of evaluating the parameter space for the intended aircraft and mission configurations. Exemplary studies using the mission analysis algorithm revealed that the results where highly sensitive to irradiation compared to what was expected from earlier studies from the literature, ultimately influencing all aircraft parameters due to highly dynamic parameter relations. For example, the effect of adjustable solar panels can be rated using simple comparison experiments, which attest an efficiency increase for low irradiation angles with adjustable panels despite an included drag and weight penalty. <br/>This thesis and the included methods helps to close a gap between analytic aircraft analysis approaches and CPU-intensive 3D-simulations for high-flying autonomous aircraft. Future projects will have a detailed overview of battery management required for high-flying autonomous aircraft, and a process supporting aircraft assessment and design for faster research and development.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

A new, unrelated tumor may be treated similarly as the first one since treatment was successful, while a distant metastasis demands a change of therapy and has a more adverse prognosis. In clinic, a second tumor is generally regarded as a new primary. If there is clinical suspicion that the second tumor may be a metastasis, clinico-pathological characteristics of the two tumors are used assess the clonality status. Clinico-pathological characteristics, however, are not reliable predictors to determine if a second tumor is a metastasis. Recent studies have investigated tumor clonality using techniques from molecular genetics. These models appear to perform well, but have several drawbacks.<br/><br/>In this thesis a more advanced classification model is being developed that can detect tumor clonality based on SNP array data. For this, two segmentation algorithms, ASCAT and OncoSNP, and two comparison methods, Log LR and adapted SI, have been incorporated. For each tumor, the segmentation algorithms construct a copy number profile based on the SNP array data. Given the copy number profiles, the comparison methods compute a p-value which reflects the probability that a pair is of clonal origin. Both comparison methods are permutation methods which test the null hypothesis of independence against the alternative hypothesis assuming clonality. The proposed model consists of a decision tree which assigns each pair to one of six categories depending on the significance of the four resulting p-values.<br/><br/>The model has been tested on 23 fresh frozen pairs by means of expert judgment. The results were promising: the four pairs which were unanimously labeled as clonal by the experts were also regarded as such by the model. No independent pairs were assigned as clonal by the model. Moreover, the decision tree showed to have a higher sensitivity than the clinical assessments as the latter only managed to detect two out of four clonal pairs. A discordance between the clinico-pathological judgments and decision tree results was found for three out of 18 pairs for which both assessments were available.<br/><br/>The model appears to be suitable in practice, but is not yet applicable as a stand-alone model. There were two ambiguous pairs which were labeled as independent by the model but for which the experts had varying opinions about the clonality status. Until the ambiguous pairs can be reliably categorized, it is advised to take into account both the model results and clinical assessments when determining tumor clonality. Finally, the performance of the model remains to be tested on FFPE pairs.","contralateral breast cancer; clonality; SNP arrays; copy number profiles; permutation methods; decision tree","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics","",""

The goal of this study is to analyse the potential impact of crowdshipping performed by private cars to the local vehicle mileage and its result to the CO2 emission. This is done by simulating the passenger and parcel delivery transportation activities in agent-based modelling platform using MASS-GT and MATSim. An integration framework to bridge MASS-GT and MATSim was formulated in this study to model the interaction between the passenger and urban freight transport. Several scenarios are formulated to analyse the impact of crowdshipping. The results show that the CO2 and passenger-kilometres savings in parcel delivery vans transportation is exceeded heavily by the increase in passenger transportation performed by cars. This results in a slight increase in passenger-kilometres travelled and CO2 emission caused by car-based crowdshipping, although the value is very small that could be considered insignificant. It was found that car-based crowdshipping won’t either improve or worsen the impact of the current last-mile delivery system.

Another benefit related to the detection of parameters not affecting significantly the sound levels, is the reduction of simulations necessary to cover enough combinations. That is because if a property<br/>can be neglected in the generation of samples and be taken as a fixed value, less combinations are needed to be considered.<br/>Finally, a comparison between the obtained estimations and empirical measurements in the North Sea is made, to test the validity of the framework proposed.","Soil modelling; Sound propagation; Pile driving; Probabilistic analysis; Sound levels; Noise estimation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering","",""

One of the things that preventive trimming does is remove excessive claw overgrowth, which can occur evenly over the bottom surface of the claw but is often more present at the dorsal wall. In this pilot study, an automated claw trimming device is designed, manufactured and evaluated to see if excessive overgrowth can be countered. The device should be able to remove evenly over the surface of the claw (straight position) and it should also be able to remove more at the front(angled position), so the dorsal angle can be adjusted. In the straight position, the machine was able to remove claw tissue and most medial claws had a nice even surface after trimming. However, the hoof-wall of the lateral claws was left untrimmed in most cases. In the angled position, the machine was able to remove just the front 2 cm of the claw.

Understanding gap acceptance decisions can help mitigate these situations. Response time (i.e. the time it takes the driver to evaluate the gap and make a decision) has been shown to provide valuable insights into the cognitive processes during gap acceptance decisions in pedestrian crossing and left turn decisions. However, for overtaking, previous studies have not investigated the response time.<br/>I investigated how factors that play a role in gap acceptance decisions during overtaking (namely, size of the gap and the drivers’ velocity) influence the response time. I also studied the change of the drivers' velocity during the decision process. I proposed a novel method to measure the response time in drivers' overtaking decisions, and conducted an experiment to demonstrate the usefulness of the method. 25 participants were presented with multiple overtaking situations in a driving simulator experiment, with varying distance gaps. I analyzed how the probability of gap acceptance varied with the distance gap and participants’ velocity at the start of the overtaking situation using a generalized logistic mixed model. I also analyzed how the response time varied with the distance gap, participants’ velocity and the decision outcome using a linear mixed model. Lastly, I analyzed if the velocity changed between the start and the end of the decision process and whether there was a relation between the decision outcome and the distance gap and the velocity change, using a linear mixed model. <br/>The probability of accepting a gap increased significantly with the distance gap and the velocity of the participant. The response times for rejected gaps were on average 0.7s longer than accepted gaps. The response time increased with the distance gap (42ms per 10m), but decreased with the velocity (-92ms per 1m/s). The velocity changed differently between the decision processes leading to either decisions, with an average difference of 4 m/s.<br/>Using the proposed method, I found that the factors which influence the outcome of the decision, also influence the response time. The dependence of response time on the distance gap and participants’ velocity could be explained by the speed-accuracy tradeoff or the difficulty of the decision. Furthermore, it was shown that the drivers already adapt their velocity during the decision process, instead of after they have made their decision. So, I can conclude that using the proposed method for measuring response time can give insight in the way drivers make gap acceptance decisions during overtaking. My results provide basis for cognitive process models that can help further understand the results and are capable of predicting decision outcomes and response times.","Overtaking; Gap acceptance; Response time; Decision-making","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

CBAM obligates companies, from non-EU countries who want to import products from the selected CBAM sectors – Iron &amp; Steel, Aluminium, Cement, Fertilizers and Electricity – into the EU, to pay a certain tariff for the carbon content of that product. Initially, CBAM covers only imports and the carbon emitted during the actual production of the products. CBAM has four objectives: (i) preventing carbon leakage; (ii) protecting EU industries against reduced competitiveness; (iii) incentivising non-EU trade partners to adopt measures comparable to the EU’s; and (iv) yielding revenue to reuse in accelerating decarbonisation of the energy system. Using interviews and a literature study, a case study was conducted on the dynamics of the trade flows of aluminium between Germany and China. Given these dynamics, six themes were studied to assess the consequences of CBAM: (i) compatibility of the policy instrument; (ii) administrative work needed; (iii) stimulation of decarbonisation in non-EU countries; (iv) competitive position of the German aluminium sector; (v) economic and geopolitical winners and losers; (vi) the three major risks of CBAM. This led to four factors that help in assessing the influence of CBAM and making CBAM more effective in achieving its objectives. These factors are tailor-made, manageability, export dependency and geographical closeness. Assessing the impact of CBAM on a specific sector from an economic and geopolitical perspective proved to be a highly complex process, where each factor is surrounded by a lot of uncertainty. The four factors can be used in further research on CBAM, as well as its future implementation.","Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism; Impact Assessment; Economic impact; Geopolitics; Case Study; Aluminium","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

To the best knowledge of the author, this is the first pedestrian route choice study which is performed at country-level scope. This was made possible by applying an innovative quasi-revealed preference approach. Respondents self-reported their route preferences through an online GIS survey. Outputs were subsequently analysed by overlaying route data with a range of open geodata sources and searching for statistical similarities between certain urban features and (in)frequently taken routes. Results from statistical testing are verified by testing these against a qualitative text-coding analysis. The study finds that pedestrians in the Netherlands have a strong preference for the route which they perceive to be fastest, especially when they are en-route to a train station. Pedestrians dislike features which they perceive as ’slowing’ them down such as traffic lights. Detours are found somewhat more often on from-station routes, with such detours leading via environments which are attractive for social reseasons such as shops or busy streets. The method was found to work fairly well and should now be tested on a larger population sample with more variables.","Pedestrian; Route choice behaviour; GIS; Active modes; Walking; Transit Oriented Development; Train Station; Access/egress facilities","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Transport and Planning","",""

(mentor); Reijtenbagh, Dominique (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","b>Background and purpose</b>: One of the main challenges in external beam radiotherapy treatment of locally advanced cervical cancer patients is dealing with bladder and rectum filling. Organ filling causes inter­fraction motion of the uterus, requiring large treatment planning volumes, or a plan library. Current assessment of tumor position is mainly done by visual inspection of a Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) scan. Eventually, this can lead to inter-­ and intra-­observer variability when choosing the best treatment plan from the plan library based on bladder filling. The incoming introduction of auto­contouring tools to obtain automatically-­generated (AG) contours of the bladder and the rectum on CBCT scans, allows the easier identification of these organs at risk and consequently, faster localization of the tumor region. However, to rely on these AG contours in the decision of plan selection, it is necessary to know if they have been reliably segmented. The goal of this project is to develop a strategy based on quantitative image features, to evaluate the quality of the AG contours to know if they are suitable for plan selection assessment.<br/><b>Materials &amp; Methods</b>: 140 LACC patients from Erasmus MC were included. For each patient, bladder and rectum contours were obtained from each of the CBCT scans done throughout the treatment (five fractions (CBCT scans) per patient). These contours were automatically­generated using a deep learning­-based auto­segmentation algorithm. Gold­-standard contours were manually delineated in some CBCT scans, but the rest of the automatically­generated contours did not have the corresponding ground-­truth contour, hence they were labeled with a score between 1 (bad quality) and 5 (good quality). For consistency, gold­-standard contours were included in the dataset with the class label 5. The contours were relabeled to have a binary classification problem, and those with label 3 were removed. Each contour volume was divided into three subregions: core region, inner and outer shell. This contour data was used for a comparison study between two supervised machine learning (ML) methodologies:<br/>Random forest (RF) networks and Logistic Regression (LR). For both strategies, feature extraction and selection were implemented. In RF methodology, a prior step of dimensionality reduction using principal component analysis (PCA) was performed. In LR, univariate feature selection followed by a multivariate logistic regression analysis was done. Before implementing the classifiers, the dataset<br/>was split into a training set and a test set. The ML models were trained using the training set, and they were tested on new unseen data. Predictions on the test data were obtained and used for evaluation of the model's performance using evaluation metrics: accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, confusion matrix, ROC curve, and AUC.<br/><b>Results</b>: The RF classifier performed on the bladder test data with an AUC value of 0.87, while for the LR model, the value obtained was 0.77. The trained RF model identified the accurate and inaccurate bladder contours with a sensitivity of 94% and a specificity of 54%. The trained LR model resulted in a sensitivity of 91% and a specificity of 42%. In the case of the rectum, the RF classifier performance is indicated with the AUC value of 0.89, while the LR model obtained a value of 0.84. In the case of sensitivity and specificity, the RF model got 96% and 38%, and the LR classifier 95% and 38%, respectively.<br/><b>Conclusion</b>: Random forest classifiers give the best results in terms of performance and classification skills for the OARs considered, especially for the bladder. It has been demonstrated that quantitative image features, paired with the corresponding contour class label, can be used for deriving statistical relationships from the data. This allows the identification of contouring errors and classifying the contours based on their quality. With the increasing automation of different steps in the radiotherapy treatment workflows, the automatic contour QA tool developed would be a key step in the process to ensure a faster, more feasible, and consistent plan selection. The tool could act as a support tool for radiotherapy technicians when choosing the plan from the plan library that best fits the daily anatomy of the patient.","Cervical cancer; CBCT scans; Contour quality assurance; Machine Learning; Random forest classification; Logistic regression","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-03-31","","","","","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Digital platforms harvest end-users’ data for providing personalised recommended content. However, this data is also used to predict individual end-users’ behaviours and hook them to the content, eventually influencing their worldviews. This raises ethical debates related to the development of serious societal issues, such as fake-news diffusion, increasing polarisation and threats to democracies. On the individual level, end-users are affected by data leaks and privacy intrusiveness. People are therefore increasingly concerned about sharing their data without knowing what they reveal, for what purpose and to whom, and are consequentially unable to exercise their digital right to privacy and consent, as also concluded by the European Commission (2015). <br/><br/>This thesis investigates how consent practices and disclosure interactions can be redesigned to instate future data practices and digital platform relations which both digital platform organisations and end-users desire. This thesis adopts a sociotechnical perspective on digital platforms, as in de Reuver et al. (2018) and Tilson et al. (2012). The hypothesis is that future visions on 1) digital platform relations, 2) data practices, and 3) consent practices and disclosure interactions, from digital platform organisations and end-users should be explored, defined and compared to identify commonalities that provide a foundation for solution exploration, and to identify fundamental tensions that need to be resolved to create the conditions in which new practices can be effective and meaningful. <br/><br/>Future visions are defined through semi-structured interviews and Context Mapping conducted with eight field experts and eight (sensitised) end-users, led by the Path of Expression line of inquiry and analysed accordingly to the Grounded Theory Method. For every future vision topic, one theoretical framework is made to extract values and sources of friction. While the first are the drivers of the future visions, the latter contain conflicting interests to resolve before they can occur. By comparing the values extracted from the future visions on consent practices and disclosure interactions from the experts and end-users, it is concluded that some values match and others clash, which are defined as value similarities and value tensions respectively.<br/><br/>Methods to leverage value similarities in consent practice redesign are investigated through creative sessions with (former) design students employing How To – Questions, Brainwriting and Creative Confrontation. As all values can be leveraged in different ways, strategies for creating new consent practices are defined by using a Morphological Chart. A similar creative session employing Personal Analogy, Role-Play and Scenarios is used to investigate how to resolve value tensions in a consent redesign. All common tactics used to reach agreements on the value tensions are analysed and applied to the redesign for resolving the value tensions. Eventually the design objective of the thesis is reached by creating new (aspects of) consent practices and disclosure interactions based on the design propositions, for a total of 21 design directions including 88 different ideas from several ideation activities.<br/><br/>The digital platform organisation Flickr served as a real-life case for applying the research insights and design directions. A new consent journey proposal which balances privacy considerations from end-users and interests of the AI community is created for obtaining users’ photos to create image data sets. The proposal is validated with representatives from Flickr, Flickr’s end-users and the AI community, and evaluated as desirable, sufficiently feasible and viable, with part of it effectively contributing to solving the design case. Additionally, the proposal enables the exercise of end-users’ digital right to privacy and consent. It’s effect on individual-level relations also contributes to solving data practice-related societal issues.<br/><br/>This thesis concludes that consent practices and disclosure interactions can successfully be redesigned by leveraging the set of identified value similarities and resolving the set of identified value tensions. It is also found that ensuring a match between desired practices and reducing opportunities for dissension allows redesigning consent practices to be effective and meaningful. The early assumption that the identified sources of friction are solved limits however this thesis’ effective implementations, possibly requiring future research and investigations in these regards.<br","Value similarities; Value tensions; Digital platforms; Consent practices; Disclosure interactions; Sources of friction","en","master thesis","","","","","","Double degree in Strategic Product Design and Design for Interaction.","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","In the modern world, environmental concerns arise due to an increase in the green house gas (GHG) emissions of the shipping industry; in 2015, 2,5% of global GHG emissions came from the shipping industry alone. Measures must be set in place to reduce the future emissions. One way to reduce emissions is by imposing the Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI). This is a measure to define the ratio between the CO2-production and the cargo capacity and speed of a ship. In other words, this ratio defines the environmental cost over societal benefit of a ship. The International Maritime Organisation wants to have a set requirement on the EEDI of new ships and preferably reduce this for existing ships. One way to reduce the EEDI is by reducing the installed engine power of the ship. One risk is that the ship might then become underpowered when it sails in adverse weather. The underpowering of ships could lead to safety hazards for the passengers and crew. For that matter, this thesis will investigate whether the ocean-going chemical tanker 'Castillo de Tebra' is underpowered when sailing in large waves. Specifically, the effect of the waves on the inflow velocity of the propeller will be looked at and how this affects the propulsive performance of the vessel.<br/>An extensive literature review was carried out in order to find out what the state-of-the-art is within the determination of ship propulsion in waves. This has been divided into three separate subjects, namely wave excitation, propeller and engine operating in waves and finally manoeuvring and seakeeping. When determining the forces that occur on a ship when it advances in waves, most methods use potential flow as the results are reliable and have low time effort. Determining propeller performance when the full wake distribution is known can also be done using potential flow methods. Basic open-water characteristics are a valid alternative as well. CFD can be used for both wave excitation and propeller performance calculations, but this is time consuming and computationally complex. When simulating manoeuvring and seakeeping behaviour of ships, two-time scale methods or unified methods are mainly used. <br/>For the research part of this thesis, numerical simulations were performed to determine the change of inflow velocity at the propeller plane for a large range of wave frequencies and wave directions, for a vessel having a forward speed. This velocity change was used to determine what the thrust and torque generation of the propeller is in waves. The engine operating envelope and ship thrust envelope were used to check whether the engine has enough power to provide the torque that the propeller generates and whether the ship has enough thrust availability. Frequency-domain results were transformed into time records for irregular waves using the JONSWAP wave spectrum and a cosine funtion. It was concluded that the ship was underpowered in adverse weather conditions, when an instant control system was assumed that inject enough fuel instantly to keep the engine at the rated speed when it needs to deliver more power. It was also assumed that the ship speed was kept at the design speed. In reality, voluntary and involuntary speed loss will occur when a ship sails in bad weather. Voluntary in the form of manual speed decrease by the captain and involuntary in the form of added resistance causing the ship to reduce in speed. A number of solutions are finally presented in this thesis to omit engine overloading in adverse weather.<br","Propeller performance; Adverse Weather Conditions; Inflow velocity; Engine performance; Advance velocity; Potential flow; Seakeeping","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Marine Technology","",""

Previous research is scarce in this regard, especially considering the influence of trial experience on consumer acceptance. In this research, using qualitative methods including semi-structured interviews, this influence is described for EV drivers in the Netherlands. It is found that trial experience using V2G alleviates earlier worries regarding range anxiety and (desired) user-friendliness. Trial experience also revealed that EV drivers find controlling the state-of-charge a vital barrier for adoption, as this would take away most of their uncertainties. This research, being one of the only studies assessing trial experience of V2G at short term parking qualitatively, can function as a building block for other research, such as similar experiments in different geographical locations or with different case settings.","Vehicle-to-grid; V2G; Trial experience; Consumer acceptance; Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology; Dutch EV drivers","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

The design of the best possible medical image segmentation DNN, however, is task-specific. Neural Architecture Search (NAS), i.e., the automation of neural network design, has been shown to have the capability to outperform manually designed networks. However, the existing NAS methods for medical image segmentation have explored a quite limited range of types of DNN architectures that can be discovered, and, more importantly, do not evaluate the accuracy of performance estimation methods.<br/><br/>In this thesis, various performance estimation methods for DNNs are analysed for medical image segmentation tasks. Due to the use of different metrics, small datasets, and inter-physician variability, DNN performance values are susceptible to considerable noise. Through experiments on multiple datasets, it is shown that performance estimation needs to be more elaborate than proposed in previous literature on NAS for medical image segmentation. Only then can the noise induced by the problem be overcome. Based on evaluations of NAS performance with different levels of noise, a method is put forward to evaluate this noise, such that a more informed decision on performance estimation can be made.<br/><br/>The second contribution of this thesis, is the proposal of a novel NAS search space for medical image segmentation networks. This search space combines the strength of a generalised encoder-decoder structure, well known from U-Net, with network blocks that have been proven to have a strong performance in image classification tasks. The search is performed by looking for the best topology of the network, and simultaneously searching the configuration of each cell. This allows for interactions between topology- and cell-level attributes to be found. Experiments were performed on two publicly available datasets. The networks discovered by the proposed NAS method perform better than well-known handcrafted segmentation networks, and outperform networks found with other NAS approaches that perform only topology search, and topology-level search followed by cell-level search.<br/><br/>Finally, three search algorithms are compared for different performance estimation methods on a realistic clinical medical image segmentation task. The results show that the performance of these algorithms is very similar in noisy environments for initial runs, and show deterioration of performance for all algorithms when correlation with the validation performance values are low. This supports the findings that not adapting performance estimation to the task at hand will lead to poor NAS performance, no matter the chosen search algorithm.","NAS; Medical image segmentation; Deep Learning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

At the five percent significance level it is concluded that the variation in the combined score of experts cannot exclusively be explained by random fluctuations. When the assumption is tested individually for three different subject fields, health, policy and science, the Random Expert Hypothesis cannot be rejected for both health and policy related studies. Lastly it is shown that the variation in performances between the best and worst expert in a panel strongly correlates with the performance of the best expert against random panels.

(mentor); Pietrzak, P. (mentor); Vizcaino, M. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","It is well known that warming of deep Atlantic Water in recent decades resulted in extensive retreat of marine terminating glaciers in Northwest Greenland and increased their discharge, which contributed significantly to sea level rise. Here we use data and model resources over a wide range of space and timescales to determine how the pathways of deep Atlantic Water, through the complex bathymetry of Melville Bay, increased the vulnerability of glaciers over the observed ocean warming period. New observations of salinity and temperature of the ocean water and bathymetry from NASA’s Ocean Melting Greenland mission as well as Mankoff’s discharge estimates are combined with FESOM and HYCOM ocean model results. We have shown that these pathways of Atlantic Water are crucial for understanding the increase in discharge of certain glaciers over the ocean warming period. More specifically, the vulnerability of a marine terminating glacier in Northwest Greenland to Atlantic Water depends on its latitudinal position, the location of the fjordal channel entrance along the Southern or Northern canyon head and whether the fjordal channel is deep enough to be a pathway for Baffin Bay Intermediate Water. The Upernavik N and C glaciers, which are in the most vulnerable position, contributed 10% to the total discharge change of Northwest Greenland. In addition, the glaciers that exhibited the largest normalised discharge change showed correspondence between their discharge estimates and the observed changes in fjord geometry during the retreat of the glacier calving front. Warming of deep Atlantic Water impacted the normalised discharge estimates, but the sensitivity of the fjord geometry also controlled large parts of the observed trends. With this study, new insights in the vulnerability of marine terminating glaciers were obtained, which showed that the pathways of Atlantic Water should not be overlooked when developing climate models.","Glacier ice discharge; Northwest Greenland; Atlantic Water; Retreat","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-10-17","","","","","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","The knowledge of the raindrop size distribution is key for characterizing precipitation. It is however still a challenge to retrieve it with radars. Several polarimetric and spectral techniques are proposed for cm-wavelength radars (weather radars). What about the mm-wavelength radars (cloud radars), which have a better spatial and time resolution and can still measure light and moderate rain? Knowing that 90% of the rain volume in Europe comes from rainfall rates between 0.1 mm/h and 10 mm/h, this is worthwhile to investigate. The goal of this thesis is to retrieve 1 of the 3 parameters of the modelled gamma raindrop size distribution, the median volume diameter (<i>D<sub>0</sub></i>), during stratiform rainfall events using a slantwise profiling dual-frequency polarimetric cloud radar. Focus is given to phase measurements, which are not affected by attenuation. Simulations show that the differential backscatter phase (<i>δ<sub>co</sub></i>) strongly depends on <i>D<sub>0</sub></i>. At mm-wavelength, backscattering and propagation effects need to be disentangled first. To achieve this, an algorithm to detect and characterize Rayleigh plateaus is proposed and implemented. After the application of this algorithm, a methodology to estimate the differential backscatter phase and its error is given. The 95% confidence interval of <i>δ<sub>co</sub></i> is estimated with the re-sampling method bootstrapping. <br/>Using simulation results, an attempt is made to find combinations of <i>D<sub>0</sub></i> and the raindrop size distribution shape parameter <i>μ</i> that match with the confidence interval of <i>δ<sub>co</sub></i>. The confidence interval of <i>δ<sub>co</sub></i> restricts <i>D<sub>0</sub></i>, but not <i>μ</i> in most cases. This proposed technique is applied for both the 35 and 94 GHz frequency band of the new cloud radar at Cabauw (Ruisdael Observatory site near Utrecht). The resulting 95% confidence intervals of <i>D<sub>0</sub></i> with 35 and 94 GHz and their overlap are compared with in-situ disdrometer measurements of the mass-weighted mean diameter (<i>D<sub>m</sub></i>) which is closely related to <i>D<sub>0</sub></i>. The median volume diameter retrieved with the 35 and 94 GHz frequency bands both shows a normalized cross correlation coefficient of 0.845 with the measured <i>D<sub>m</sub></i> of the disdrometer. Therefore, the cloud radar seems to have the capability to provide the detailed variations of the raindrops mean/median diameter like a local disdrometer, but at different heights. Nonetheless, the values differ. The disdrometer provides higher values than the cloud radar. One possible explanation is the inability of the disdrometer to measure raindrops smaller than 0.25 mm and the expected underestimation of the number of raindrops with sizes between 0.25 and 0.375 mm. However, because <i>D<sub>0</sub></i> values retrieved from 35 GHz data are also higher than the ones at 94 GHz, further research, which can use all the methodologies proposed in this master thesis work, is needed to examine the quantitative values of the median volume diameter retrieval. <br/>These techniques can be implemented for all the single-frequency cloud radars (94 GHz) of the national Ruisdael Observatory (cloud and precipitation profiling mobile station and Lutjewad site above Groningen).","Drop size distribution; Precipitation; Rainfall; Cloud radar observations","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","51.9675713,4.9272399"

(mentor); Coster, Edward (graduation committee); Kers, Bart (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","To achieve the goals on greenhouse gas emissions, the energy supply and demand is in transition. Distribution power grids therefore are increasingly reaching their capacity limits due to electrification and the vast increase of distributed energy resource (DER) connection requests with large peak power output. Increasing physical grid capacity is a costly operation and take lots of time to realise. Grid operators are therefore allowed to connect additional energy resources to the power grid at the cost of N-1 reserve capacity. Having N-1 reserve capacity means that any grid component can go out of service, without causing overloading of another grid component. When this security principle is abandoned, coupled preventive and corrective control measures might be necessary to preserve security of energy supply.<br/>In this thesis, commissioned by the Dutch distribution grid operator Stedin Netbeheer, a preventive-corrective contingency control method based on differential evolution (DE) is designed to increase the maximum admissible DER generation on a distribution grid. For the contingency analysis process in this contingency control method, the full AC power flow method is compared to the method based on line outage distribution factors. The resulting DE-based preventive-corrective control method using the full AC power flow contingency analysis method allows for significant extra DER generation capacity to be connected to the study case distribution power grid, without requiring expensive grid expansions. The case study of this thesis work is the Stedin Middelharnis distribution power grid. Due to the computational complexity of the preventive-corrective contingency control method and the sparse connectivity of power system data, convolutional neural networks are deployed to reduce the computational time. In the first approach, the convolutional neural network is used to perform contingency analysis. Due to this neural network approach, the time to compute the preventive-corrective control actions is reduced by 40%. However, the accuracy of the control is significantly reduced due to the inaccuracy of the used contingency analysis method. In the second approach, a neural network is trained to determine the coupled preventive control actions. The performance of a neural network with and without convolutional neural networks is compared in this approach. Results show that the convolutional neural network outperforms the neural network without convolutional layers. This second convolutional neural network approach is satisfactory accurate and the computational efficiency of this control method is greatly increased compared to the control method based on DE, making realtime preventive-corrective control possible.","contingency control; convolutional neural network; distribution power systems; evolutionary algorithm; machine learning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

We designed a conversational agent based on the Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) model of agency that simulates a child victim of school bullying. Through interaction with the agent, a counsellor is able to learn the Five Phase Model, the conversation model that underpins the helpline's counselling methodology to ensure conversations remain child-centered. We tested a prototype based on this design with a group of counsellors at the Kindertelefoon with regards to their counselling self-efficacy and perceived usefulness of the system. Our results show that the conversational agent is able to influence the counselling self-efficacy of users, albeit a decrease in self-efficacy. The opposite would have been preferred for a learning tool to enable counsellors achieve more effective performance over time.

Om de bereikbaarheid van het gebied te vergroten wordt er onderzoek gedaan naar de mogelijkheid om hier een railgebonden voertuig op de introduceren. Dit leidt tot de vraag; “Hoe kan in het gebied Apeldoorn – Dieren een railgebonden voertuig worden geïntroduceerd op de oude spoorlijn van de VSM?” Om deze vraag te beantwoorden is er gekeken naar verschillende aspecten. Het gaat hier om de aanwezige infrastructuur, soorten railgebonden voertuigen, relevante referentieprojecten, verschillende technische aspecten, duurzame energietoevoer en aanpassingen die nodig zijn aan de infrastructuur om dit te realiseren. De lijn bestaat uit de stations Apeldoorn, Beekbergen, Loenen, Eerbeek en Dieren. De stoomtrein heeft een eigen dienstregeling en rijdt in het hoogseizoen ongeveer twee keer per dag. De huidige infrastructuur geeft beperkingen voor de introductie van een railgebonden voertuig. Zo ligt er enkelspoor en is de maximale snelheid op de lijn 40 km/h. Voor het railgebonden voertuig is gekozen voor een light rail voertuig. Dit is een licht voertuig wat snel kan accelereren. Verder mag er om de historische waarde van de VSM lijn te behouden, geen bovenleiding worden aangelegd. Om deze reden is er onderzoek gedaan naar verschillende soorten energietoevoer. Vanwege duurzaamheidsredenen en de aanwezige infrastructuur is er gekozen voor een batterij. De energie zal komen van windmolens die in de provincie geplaatst worden. Met behulp van de referentieprojecten zijn er verschillende technische aspecten uitgelicht. Hieruit is voort gekomen dat het van belang is dat de wissels en wielen goed op elkaar afgestemd zijn. Wanneer de wielen te klein of te groot zijn voor de wissels, kan dit zorgen voor ontsporingen, zoals gebeurd is bij de RandstadRail. Verder zijn de perronhoogte, seinen en communicatie tijdens de uitvoering van het project van belang om conflicten te voorkomen. Kijkend naar en rekening houdend met deze aspecten zijn er verschillende aanpassingen nodig aan de lijn om een railgebonden voertuig daarop te introduceren. Dit betreft onder andere de laadinfrastructuur op de perrons van Dieren en Apeldoorn. Verder zijn er ook verscheidene aanpassingen langs de lijn zelf nodig. Denk hierbij aan het verlengen van perrons en het plaatsen van wissels en extra stukken rails. Met behulp van deze aanpassingen is het mogelijk om een voertuig te introduceren wat er 35 minuten over doet om van Apeldoorn naar Dieren rijdt en andersom. Deze zal één keer per ruim half uur rijden. Echter, reflecterend op het onderzoek zijn er verscheidene aannames gemaakt die het niet reëel maken om een railgebonden voertuig op deze lijn te introduceren. Er is al een buslijn aanwezig met dezelfde frequentie die er een kwartiertje langer over doet. Voor de aanpassingen die gemaakt moeten worden aan de infrastructuur weegt dit niet op tegen de gevonden resultaten. Verder is er geen onderzoek gedaan naar de bereikbaarheid en is het niet bekend of de aanname dat deze verhoog moet worden, juist is.","Light rail; railway; Veluwsche Stoomtrein Maatschappij","nl","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

As a physical space, it does not belong nor is included in the structure and the organization of the urban tissue, and essentially, its significance, as a part that preexists and can reinforce the public space of the city, is ignored. When it overflows, it floods the city and the outskirts, claiming more space, but also damaging houses, farming, and infrastructure. As a place with cultural and symbolic role it is rejected from the urban memory. Flood events are relatively frequent, and in combination with the contemporary fast building- they displace locals and direct stakeholders living in adjacency to the river, away from the values embedded in it. <br/><br/>Thus, this project suggests that the locals should become actively engaged and committed to the place in their everyday life and through a physical experience that promotes further interpretation and bonds with the material and immaterial heritage of the location.

It explores the role of design in a rural landscape characterized by land ownership through the concept of ‘borderscapes’ as a political vacuum and area for minor interventions. The site of interest is located at the Hunze stream valley in the province of Drenthe, the Netherlands. The water conditions since pre-historical times have formed this territory through high and low plateaus, different soil types and dry or wet vegetation types. Located at a geomorphologically rich location but also vulnerable to land reclamation, the landscape of the Hunze valley has been influenced by ecological degradation. This research examines the spatial conditions that result from years of implemented policies and the effects on everyday experiences of nature. The Hunze stream valley has often been approached as a north-south water system that runs from highlands to lowlands, however this project depicts the area as an east-west system of material conditions and human inhabitation. Concluding that the territory is now characterized by separation (zoning of nature and culture), displacement of problem areas (soil movements), and the negligence of resource proximity. The east-west routing is used as a starting point for creating a new representation of site and experience on three traverses: the source, the crossing and the community.","Nature; Culture; Representation; Pluralism","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Landscape Architecture","","53.0435373899299, 6.791132254967833"

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","This thesis explores the possibility of circularity to regenerate the degraded agricultural systems of the Foodvalley region. The Foodvalley is a regional network organization, consisting of eight municipalities situated partly in the province of Utrecht and partly the province of Gelderland. Circularity is used to describe a way in which resource consumption, distribution, and production are managed. It is focused on cycling and regeneration of resources to make sure they are used more efficiently, as well as reducing the use of finite resources. At the same time it will tackle environmental degradation and interrelated socio-economic problems. Adopting a circular approach makes sure society can live and thrive within planetary boundaries. Regenerative circular development in the agricultural sector is needed because currently most of the area’s development is on hold due to the region’s struggle with the effects of the nitrogen crisis. The interaction between the current, linear and monocultural, agricultural system and climate externalities are causing problems related to resource depletion and scarcity, overexploitation of land, and fragmentation and degradation of ecosystems.<br/><br/>This thesis explores the question: How to reconfigure the territory of the Foodvalley region, to facilitate regenerative circular developments, using a co - creation method?<br/><br/>A territorial approach regarding circular resource management is promoted. In which agri-food flows are considered in their social, ecological and spatial context and managed according to participatory transition management. <br/><br/>Incorporating the territory in circular development is especially important. The territory can be used to connect circular development strategies to ecosystem, landscape or territorial assets and it allows different international, national, regional and local goals to be linked in spatial organization (Forster et al., 2021). <br/><br/>Stakeholders influence the territory, through addressing key challenges, by pursuing different interest, exploring new opportunities, and by identifying appropriate policies and actions (Forster et al., 2021). Therefore, this thesis has developed a method which enables reconfiguration of the territory in a co – creative way. <br/><br/>The outcome is a circular agriculture pattern language which translates solution, that increase the regenerative capacity of the current socio-ecological metabolism, into easily understood blocks of knowledge. In this way, the complexity of a circular agri-food chain can be rendered more accessible and manageable. The pattern language can be used in design workshops to foster effective solution oriented dialogue between stakeholders. The results of the co-creation process can be used to create context-specific designs illustrating the spatial implications of a circular agricultural sector.<br","Circularity; Hybrid landscape; Socio-ecological metabolism; Systemic design; Pattern language; Co-creation; Agri-food chain; Agriculture; Foodvalley Regio; Nederland","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Urbanism","","52.0967616,5.7499003,10.69"

We firstly evaluated seven precipitation products (TRMM 3B42v7, CHIRPS, PERSIANN-CDR, GLDAS 2.1, CFSv2, IMERG, and ERA5) using the rain gauge data as a reference and found that IMERG was the most suitable product for obtaining rainfall triggering conditions. We then studied the added value of incorporating the antecedent soil moisture from both a high spatial satellite data and from a distributed hydrological model following the trigger-cause framework. The results showed that the event precipitation volume E, the event duration D and the bilinear threshold E-D are the landslide initiation thresholds that accurately predict the highest number of landslide events while keeping the false and the failed alarms low. Including the antecedent soil moisture products as the causal variables -expected to account for the hillslope hydrologic processes predisposing the slopes to near failure- did not lead to any improvement with respect to the trigger only thresholds for predicting landslides in Rwanda.","landslide; empirical-statistical thresholds; trigger thresholds; trigger-cause thresholds; antecedent soil moisture; remote sensing; Hydrological model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Environmental Engineering","",""

The problem is first presented as a standard integer programming problem, but solving this problem is not feasible if complexity needs to be kept at a reasonable level. An alternative method of continuous optimization is therefore proposed that uses (meta)heuristics to find an optimal solution for maximizing the objective functions. The occupation status of the massing is used as inputs for the decision variables.<br/><br/>After the application of this method on small scale toy problems, a few of the<br/>design options are selected and evaluated by their performance indicators, as well as the measure with which the option makes sense from a more traditional design perspective. The comparison of the performance and results of both methods give insight into the recommended workflow, settings, and pitfalls for finding an optimal solution to a multi-criteria design problem with visibility objectives. From the initial results, the Non-Sorted Genetic Algorithm seems to be the best option for solving these types of problems, and the PV potential objective is validated.

(mentor); Bergsma, A.C. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Glass has been around for four thousand years and its demand to be used in facades has been increasing ever since. The appeal of a glazed facade is the transparency factor which can connect inside and outside environments without losing the protection a facade provides against the elements. Nowadays the glazed facades that have high transparency tend to be inefficient due to it being time-consuming to design, as it needs a lot of customization, and to produce and assemble on site. Other glazed options deal with the same issues, however, they do not provide the same amount of transparency. To address this gap in the market, this research will look into possibilities to achieve higher transparency in a unitized facade system. The first thing to establish in this research is the requirements with which the facade panel must comply. These can be arranged into five categories, transparency, unitized system, maintenance, sustainability, and design for practice, which includes structure, movement, tolerances, safety, thermal, and water- and air-tightness. Next, a provisional detail was created by using two projects as inspiration for its structural concept as they were examples of a two-sided support system and of how to use composite action to achieve a slimmer profile. With this detail, a reliable structural finite element model could be built to facilitate further analyses. The last steps of this research focused on investigative design. This uses variations of the provisional detail design to get an understanding of what aspects influence each other and how each performance compares against the set requirements. From these analyses, it was concluded that to achieve a highly transparent, unitized facade system the composite action between the glass panels and the mullion is crucial. Furthermore, having the mullion sandwiched between the glass not only provides a better composite action but is also the visually most pleasing option as it has little variety of materials shown on the surface. Even though the final design settled on, is considered the best option in this study, it nevertheless has some challenges. One of these challenges is the use of adhesives, as it can have a negative effect on the sustainability aspect regarding the endof- life. Another complication can appear when looking at the proportions between the glass panels and the mullion. The mullion is quite small compared to the glass and thus making it an intricate process when assembling.","Facade Design; Composite action; Sustainability","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","",""

(mentor); Forgaci, C. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","The climate crisis will require far-stretching changes to our urban systems, also called a transition. However, the direction in which our society will transition is still deeply uncertain. To become less vulnerable, cities and urban areas need to increase their adaptive capacity, establishing an evolutionarily resilient region. Delta cities in the Netherlands are governed through a decentralised and neo-liberal governance model, giving responsibilities for the long-term to local actors. As a result, climate adaptation relies on being integrated in local urban redevelopment projects to produce the necessary innovations that are needed for the transition.<br/>In the Netherlands, post-industrial port sites are redeveloped into mixed-use residential areas which should have an innovative and adaptive character to function as pilots for the regional transition towards a climate adaptive system. Nevertheless, in many cases short-term responsiveness and econmic values get the overhand, reducing the innovative value of experiments and the contribution pilot projects make for the essential transition. This leaves redeveloped neighbourhoods and the delta region vulnerable to the effects of the climate crisis and is predicted to result in a chaotic transition from the existing to the climate adaptive system (Rotmans, 2021).<br/>This urbanism graduation project therefore studies the following question: how can post-industrial port redevelopments contribute to the transition towards climate adaptive delta cities? Comparative case study research of cases in the Rhine-Meuse delta is used first to compose an understanding of mechanisms behind the integration of climate adaptation and industrial and societal transitions in post-industrial port redevelopment projects. Next, the case study lessons for adaptation are integrated with transition principles in a redevelopment strategy for a representative case and regional pilot for climate adaptation: de Staart in Dordrecht. Here, the Dynamic Adaptive Policy Pathways framework (Haasnoot et al., 2013) proves to be a promising methodolgy for making the complex and interdisciplinary transitions more insightful.<br/>An urban design simulation for a section of de Staart shows how the policy pathways should be used in combination with an inclusive process, a spatial framework and a set of dynamic rules to esure that short-term actions contribute to the long-term transition pathway and adaptation under uncertain future contexts remains possible. The strategy for climate adaptive redevelopment of post-industrial sites shows that it can improve local liveability through its inclusive process and accellerate the regional transition by being connected in a regional network. The project shows promising qualities for bridging the gap between ambitions towards realising climate adaptive delta cities and it can be a valuable design and redevelopment strategy for application in practice. Nevertheless, applicability in different context than the Rhine-Meuse delta can be evaluated by performing similar research under different cultural contexts.","Post-industrial port sites; Urban area redevelopment; Dynamic Adaptive Policy Pathways; Climate crisis; Transition; Dordrecht; Rhine-Meuse delta; De Staart","en","master thesis","","","","","","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oCTHGUZFCY An introduction video to the problem and location","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Urbanism","Delta Futures Lab","51.81869,4.69844"

The ageing population represents the gradual change. The ageing population brings an increased demand for care, while also an increasing need for cost control and a decrease in available capacity is noticeable in the healthcare sector. The Covid19 pandemic is an example of a sudden change, an unexpected change on which needs to be acted fast. Digitalisation is a representative for an expected change in the healthcare sector. Especially since the recent Covid19 pandemic there is a growing interest among hospital organisations in digitalisation. To be able to maintain to deliver the highest quality of care under the current circumstances, new innovative strategies and lean processes need to be developed. To accommodate these transformations the real estate of the hospital will have to change. Due to the pressure on hospitals to reduce costs and improve health service accessibility, there is an increasing demand for outpatient services. With the growing interest among hospital organisations in digitalisation and the lack of research on a real estate strategy for hospitals that includes smart tools, this research focuses on to what extent smart tools can optimise the use of scarce resources in the outpatient department of the hospital, taking into account the layout of the outpatient department. The following question is formulated to be answered: “To what extent can smart tools and layout contribute to the efficient and effective use of the scarce resources in the outpatient department of a Dutch hospital?“<br/>To be able to answer this research question, a qualitative approach is chosen to work with. Research on the use of smart tools in the outpatient department of a Dutch hospital is still very rare, therefore a qualitative approach is recommendable. The literature review acts as the backbone of the research. The case study and semi-structured interviews are derived from the network of AT Osborne. To validate the research a project visit of a newly built smart outpatient department and an expert panel has been conducted. <br/>The main goal of conducting this research is to find a solution for the facility and department managers of the outpatient department of the Dutch hospital to cope with the scarce resources, so the hospital can focus on its main goal ‘the delivery of high-quality healthcare’. <br","Hospital real estate; Outpatient department; Space utilisation; Smart Tools; Patient Journey; Future Hospitals; e-health","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Management in the Built Environment","",""

The range of the space where children are free to reach and explore the environment is decreasing with the exclusion of consideration of the need for children in urban planning and design. Growing up with little connection to nature is not only negative for mental/physical well-being, but helps create a society that forgets the biophilic needs of humans and ends up building a natureless environment and lifestyle.

When dealing with complex environments, the environment dynamics are frequently approximated with function approximators (such as Neural Netoworks) that are not guaranteed to converge to an optimal solution. As a consequence, the planning process using samples generated by an imperfect model is also not guaranteed to converge to the optimal policy. In fact, the mismatch between source and target dynamics distribution can result in compounding errors, leading to poor algorithm performance during testing. To mitigate this, we combine the Robust Markov Decision Processes (RMDPs) framework and an ensemble of models to take into account the uncertainty in the approximation of the dynamics. With RMDPs, we can study the uncertainty problem as a two-player stochastic game where Player 1 aims to maximize the expected return and Player 2 wants to minimize it. Using an ensemble of models, Player 2 can choose the worst model to carry out the transitions when performing rollout for the policy improvement. We experimentally show that finding a maximin strategy for this game results in a policy robust to model errors leading to better performance when compared to assuming the learned dynamics to be correct.","Reinforcement Learning; Model-Based; Adversarial robustness; pessimism; Robust Decision Making; Markov Decision Processes","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science | Data Science and Technology","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Starting from the 1950s, plastic has found its way into many aspects of life; from packaging to transportation and construction. The annual global plastic production was estimated to be 330 million metric tons in 2017 and will be doubled within 20 years if the current growth rate persists. In Europe, packaging accounts for 40% of the annual plastic production. To decrease dependence on fossil fuels and the related emissions and reduce the negative impact of plastics that enter the environment, the EU targets to recycle 55% of plastic packaging material by 2025. A steady production of large quantities of high-grade plastic recyclate is essential to sell the recycled material on the market and substitute virgin plastics. <br/>But, achieving this high grade is difficult due to the wide range of polymers, including additives and fillers. This research focuses on the sorting step of post-consumer packaging waste in a Material Recovery Facility (MRF) that takes place before recycling.<br/><br/>In MRF's, Near Infrared (NIR) sensor-based sorting systems are state of the art to create high-grade sorting products. NIR's use reflection spectra to identify and distinguish a range of materials including different types of polymers. However, while sorting, False Calls (FC) occur when particles are incorrectly classified leading to a loss of valuable material or contamination of the product. Thus, this research aims to increase the understanding of false calls of NIR sensor systems, contributing to higher quality sorting products.<br/><br/>To reach this goal, possible causes of FC's and their dependencies on the feedrate, feed composition and feeding mechanism were identified. These causes were arranged into a framework consisting of six types of FC's. A distinction was made between errors that are working range related and those that are not. Particles outside the working range may be classified incorrectly even when fed in a monolayer and under perfect circumstances due to the properties of the particle. <br/><br/>The created framework was applied to a NIR in an MRF in the Netherlands which was tasked to separate non-plastic particles and PVC from plastic particles. Experiments were performed to single out the probability of each type of error to occur for 13 material classes. Next, the test results were implemented in a statistical model and a Monte Carlo simulation was performed. In this research, the varying input values were used to imitate the changing feed composition. Three scenarios of adjusted feed characteristics were analysed using the statistical model.<br/><br/>It was concluded that to optimize the sorting performance of the analysed NIR, all types of False Calls should be tackled. The feed of the analysed NIR contained a large share of particles outside the working range. So, even if the particles were to be fed in a monolayer the average grade of the product is expected to be around 85%. The combination of the experiments and the statistical model allows for an effective evaluation of the sorting performance and a clear indication of the most problematic aspects of the feed characteristics.<br","NIR sensor-based sorting; Post-consumer packaging; Recycling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Calibration chamber (CC) tests are modelled for dry sand and results are compared with experimentally performed CC tests in the laboratory. Features regarding the numerical setup and applied boundary conditions which quantitatively influence modelling results are identified and assessed before the model is validated to real CC test data. Validation results show that the model is able to accurately produce cone resistance values for different types of sand for soil states that can be categorised as moderately-dense to dense.

Therefore, this research examined a type of financing method, called ‘land value capture’, that might be utilized to engage private developers in placemaking projects.

One of the new planning instruments concerning circularity are circular land tender procedures (OECD, 2020). By setting circular award criteria for land tenders, public planners ensure that they have an influence on real estate developments. Since this is a new phenomenon, almost no research has been done into this planning instrument. It is unclear whether the introduction of circular criteria raises problems and what the parties involved think about it. Heurkens et. al (2015) identifies the importance of cooperation between public and private entities. Public planners are increasingly dependent on market parties to achieve their goals.

Despite the strong aware- ness of non-stationarity in hydrological system characteristics, model parameters are often assumed stationary and obtained through calibration on past conditions. The representation of system change in hydrological models is challenging, as a lot of uncertainty abounds on changes in future climate and ecosystems. However, it is shown that ecosystems co-evolve with the prevailing climate conditions. There is increasing evidence that vegetation adapts its root zone storage capacity - considered as a key parameter in any hydrological model - corresponding to moisture deficits in the root zone. This is the main assumption underlying the water balance method. In combination with long-term water budget estimates from the Budyko framework, this method has the potential to meaningfully describe future climate-vegetation interactions within the context of process-based hydrological models. Accordingly, this study provides an exploratory analysis for six catchments in the Austrian Alps to in- vestigate future changes in root zone storage capacity and their impact on modelled streamflow in the past and under two emission scenarios in the future. Our findings show that, although parameter ranges of the root zone storage capacity significantly narrow-down for climate-based estimates, modelling performance on past streamflow is similar when using the calibrated and climate-based parameter sets. Following climate projections from 14 cli- mate models, adaptive climate-based parameter estimates are predicted to increase by 10-100% in all catchments in the future. However, little to no dissimilarity in modelled future streamflow is found when adaptation in root zone storage capacity is included in the hydrological model. Modelled differences in annual mean, maximum, and minimum flows remain within 5%, with slight increases for monthly streamflow and runoff coefficients. Thereby, little to no evidence is found that time-dynamic representation of root zone storage capacity significantly alters modelled future streamflow and suggests limited necessity for its inclusion in hydrological models to obtain rea- sonable descriptions of future streamflow in the investigated Alpine catchments.","hydrologic modeling; Climate change; Parameter; Budyko framework; Water Balance; Monte Carlo; Austria; vegetation change; Root zone storage capacity","en","master thesis","","","","","","Masters degree in Water Management and Environmental Engineering","","2023-01-11","","","","Water Management","",""

Automatic methods usually involve dividing the estimated height of a building by an assumed storey height. In some cases, this simple approach limits the accuracy of the results. Therefore, the goal of this thesis is to develop an alternative method to automatically infer the number of floors. <br/><br/>Three different machine learning algorithms are tested and compared: Random Forest, Gradient Boosting and Support Vector Regression. These algorithms are trained using data on the number of floors obtained from four municipalities in the Netherlands. In addition, 25 features are derived from cadastral attributes, building geometry and neighbourhood census data. These features are tested in different combinations in order to determine whether a specific subset yielded better results. Furthermore, a comparison is made between features derived from 3D building models at different levels of detail. <br/><br/>The results show that building height, particularly 70th percentile height, is most related to the number of floors. Other 3D geometric features are also found to be quite closely related to the number of floors, specifically roof area and volume. However, a higher level of detail did not improve the results. Cadastral features are also found to be relevant; mainly net internal area and, to a lesser extent, construction year. Furthermore, models based on a combination of different features performed better than models based on single categories of features.<br/><br/>The best predictive model achieved an accuracy of 94.5% and a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.06 for buildings with 5 floors or less. This represented a substantial improvement on the results of the geometric approach, which had an accuracy of 69.9% and MAE of 0.31. However, above 5 floors, model performance was substantially lower. Machine learning provided only a slight improvement on the geometric approach for these buildings. In this case, the best model had an accuracy of 52.3% and MAE of 0.62, whereas the geometric approach was 47.5% accurate and had a MAE of 0.70. A comparison of the cumulative error distributions showed that the best model mainly improved the fraction of buildings that were predicted with an error of less than 1 floor. Overall, these results show that machine learning partially provided a better estimate of the number of floors than a purely geometric approach.","Machine learning; Number of floors; Basisregistratie Adressen en Gebouwen (BAG); Random forest regression; Gradient boosting regression; Support vector regression; The Netherlands","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-12-31","","","","Geomatics","",""

Within architecture, regeneration is defined as an act of building with an active contribution toward the local ecosystem rather than simply minimizing environmental impact.<br/><br/>While the theory of regenerative design offers a precise understanding of what architecture should achieve within the ecologies of a place to be regenerative, it does not provide an understanding of how this different perspective can be applied to the design process, nor how precisely the building can enter an active partnership with an ecosystem. To explore the complexity of this question, this joined master thesis draws upon two bodies of research as a prerequisite to the design question. <br/><br/>The first one explores how biodiversity can be addressed through architecture and the building itself, while the second one investigates how the relationship between people and a local ecosystem shapes their architecture and determines its potential for regeneration. <br/><br/>The following design project explores the role of ecology in the design process by experimenting with design decision-making focused on architecture’s impacts and potential to interact with the local ecosystem, ultimately fostering the co-evolution of both. <br/><br/>Finally, this thesis stresses the importance of seeking contradictions, dynamic balance and contextual innovation as a way to foster an active architecture-ecosystems relationship. A thorough understanding of the ecologies of a place and so building from a more-than-human perspective opens the potential of architecture to move beyond sustainability on the way to regeneration.","Beyond Sustainability; Regenerative Design; Biodiversity; Ecosystem; More-than-human design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Explorelab","","0.7893,113.9213."

Inspired by the automated generation of design paradigm, a performance based parametric design approach is taken, where a parametric description of the warehouse lay-out is coupled to a pallet flow simulation. Iterative simulations are then performed until a lay-out design is obtained that provides the required handling capacity with minimal material handling equipment.

Urban public spaces provide opportunities for people to meet and interact with the community, contribute to the connection between human and nature and have multiple benefits to human and environmental health. With a rising global population and the largest human migration in history, more than half of the world's population currently lives in urban areas. According to the Recommendation on the Historic Urban Landscape, this rapid and uncontrolled urbanization can often lead to the loss of public space. Contributing to the loss of public spaces, the digital and technical developments result in increasing mobility and remote patterns of work and consumption. These changes in user behaviour threaten historic urban areaswith loss of population, vacancy, and eminent building degradation that may result in loss of cultural identity. To adapt historic cities towards a sustainable future, it is necessary to focus on the total experience of its users, including the routing and accessible and attractive public spaces. This research aims at developing a methodology for designing user experience-based public spaces as a process to reactivate vacant heritage. It focuses on the case study of the vacant department store V&amp;D Haarlem, built in 1934, and listed as national heritage in the Netherlands. The methodology includes historical analysis, urban analysis, and field observations of the 12 quality criteria for public urban spaces defined by Jan Gehl. The results provide guidelines for integrating user experience in the redesign of public spaces, preparing cities for a sustainable future while conserving its valuable heritage.","public space; Jan Gehl; user experience; Vroom & Dreesmann; Haarlem; department stores; Heritage","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Heritage & Architecture","","52.37946, 4.63329"

This explanation, also called the age-differentiated society, is opposed by the age integrated society, in which all activities can be practised throughout one’s entire life. This causes more interaction between varying generations which would reduce fragmentation in society. <br/>Architecture can contribute to the age integrated society by developing new housing models in which multiple generations live together. Accommodating multiple generations in one housing project facilitates suitable houses for a diverse living culture.

Those existing buildings represent about 70% of the building stock in 2050. Updating these buildings in terms of functionality but mostly in terms of sustainability is therefore a highly relevant task at hand. To quote Prof. Mauro Overend in one of his lectures: “The most sustainable building is the one that has already been built”.<br/>Among those buildings, what we could call brutalist buildings from the 1970’s and 1980’s represent a large part of our cityscapes. Those buildings are mainly built of concrete, are in general structurally sound, but although they are not to everyone’s taste, would cost a lot of energy to tear down. What’s more, due to poor insulation and dated climate systems, their energy efficiency is generally atrocious.<br/>One good example of those brutalist buildings is the Academic Medical Centre (Academisch Medisch Centrum) in Amsterdam. Built at the beginning of the 1980’s, it is a concrete megastructure, Europe’s largest at the time of completion.<br/>This graduation project is approaching the AMC building as a case study of how the brutalist buildings of the 1970’s and 1980’s could be renovated in a sustainable fashion.<br/>The project has two components of sustaianability: the spatial design aims to introduce a social aspect to the layout of the research facility of the AMC ; the climate design introduces natural ventilation as a means to make the building more sustainable.<br/>The education in the field of medicine has received new insights as to the advantages of exchange between researchers of different specializations. The current research facility is however not at all fit for such socializing. Where the official meeting rooms are already scarce, the informal meeting spots are practically inexistant. The spatial design of this project addresses that issue by creating informal meeting spaces, re-thinking the work floors’ layout and offering an inviting route to connect those spaces.<br/>The climate system of the AMC, an all-air system with central air handling units, generates a high energy demand. By exploring the possibility of retrofitting natural ventilation couple with passive thermal treatment of the air, this design aims to show that very sustainable solutions are possible for apparently very un-sustainable buildings.<br","renovation; natural ventilation; Hospital Renovation; social design; double skin facade","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","","52.29383634264009, 4.959632198804191"

This has the consequence that many people cannot find a suitable dwelling. To solve this issue the government made the plan to build one million houses between 2020 and 2030. Apart from the quantitative problem of too little houses what is even more important is to figure out what type of houses to build. Where should the houses be build? For whom should they be build? How do these people want to live? These questions need to be answered to make certain the houses that will be build have the potential to solve the housing shortage. <br/><br/>Demographic data of The Netherlands and the design location the city of Rotterdam shows that most household growth in the coming years will occur among families with children and singles of all age categories with the largest increase in the 65+ age category. Looking at the current housing situation of families and elderly people living in the city it seems like there is already a shortage of suitable housing. With the prognosis pointing out that there will be a growth in these households the shortage will only get worse unless action is taken. <br/><br/>Living environment plays a crucial role in people’s lives especially in the most vulnerable parts when growing up as kids or when nearing the last stage of life. This is because when we are young but also when we grow old we are dependent on caregivers and on what our direct environment can offer to meet our needs. <br/><br/>This thesis therefore looks into an intergenerational housing approach based on the thought that by creating buildings in such a way that they help with bringing people together and by creating inclusive communities many issues concerning families and elderly people living in the city can be alleviated. The building design serves as an example for the many opportunities there are to improve life in the city by keeping people in mind instead of only focusing on creating more houses to solve the housing crisis. By taking this approach it is possible to get to a much more long term sustainable solution for the housing crisis benefitting all the participants and leaving a much larger positive impact on the whole of society.<br","Intergenerational living; Inclusive city; Aging in place; Child friendly city; Community forming; Transformations through life phases","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Dwelling","AR3AD100 Advanced Housing Design Graduation Studio","51.90804143808056, 4.4170013717909775"

Biodiversity is needed for our ecosystem services which provide us with fresh water and medicine which means people are dependent on a healthy biodiversity. Cities want to greenify to battle the urban heat island effect and the bad water infiltration. If these cities want to connect to nature on the outside of the city there are often business parks situated in between. These Business parks are large grey areas that create a barrier between the green and the city and add onto the urban heat island. To change a business park from a barrier to a corridor there is a need for change. This brings us to the question “What are design tools an urban designer can use to improve biodiversity and human well-being on a business site and how can this be implemented? Using case study location Spaanse Polder.” Twenty design tools have been created to enhance biodiversity and improve human well-being. These tools have been divided into three categories wherein each category biodiversity will be enhanced and human well-being will be improved. These categories are blue, green, and grey. To understand how these tools interact with each other and their surroundings and what effect these tools have they have been implemented on the location site. In conclusion, multiple elements should be taken into consideration if these tools will be implemented. These are combining design tools, effect on different scale levels, the size of the location, and it is still a business park with private properties. By implementing these design tools in the Spaanse Polder the Spaanse Polder will function as a corridor with multiple patches on its site which are connected to the ecological networks instead of the barrier it is now.","Biodiversity; Human well-being; Business parks; Ecosystems; Corridor; Rotterdam; Spaanse Polder","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Urbanism","","51.930245, 4.418231"

As a consequence, the data itself no longer holds the highest value, but rather the information and context the data captures are. This principle also holds in the 3D environment modelling scene, as accurately depicting an environment holds more value than the number of models there are of it.<br/><br/>One of the major problems in 3D environments, especially when the environment represents a building, is the presence of glass. A lot of the data captured to model these 3D environments is captured using LiDAR laser scanning. This is where glass becomes a problem as glass is almost completely transparent to laser beams at the typical wavelengths used when using LiDAR laser scanning. As a consequence, glass can lead to problems with navigational routes as it is invisible in the environment but still blocks the path. It can also create false spaces in the captured environment as it can also partially act as a mirror reflecting the laser beam and showing these reflections in space as if they were captured in a straight line.<br/><br/>Alternative manners for capturing and identifying glass in environments captured with laser have been created over the years, but they often need a dedicated set-up, expensive equipment or a lot of data. These solutions are not always feasible for users of point cloud data.<br/><br/>Therefore, in this thesis a focus is put on how can a low entry solution be created for this problem, which leads to the main research question: How can the location of glass be deduced using only information acquired from 3D point clouds and a reference position?<br/><br/>To answer this question, this thesis focuses on the deduction of the locations of glass windows in the provided input. To find these a projection from 3D data to 2D is performed. In 2D image space, contours are then detected that match the criteria of window frames. These contours are then used to segregate parts of the 3D point cloud that should contain the window detected in the projection. After clustering these parts and the best matching cluster is deduced to be a window.<br/><br/>In this thesis, it is shown that using the proposed methodology it is possible to deduce the location of glass in a LiDAR point cloud using only an additional reference position, but there are some flaws with the simplified input of the method.<br","Glass; LiDAR; Point Cloud","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geomatics","",""

This graduation thesis aims to improve the liveability of pre-war neighbourhoods through the implementation and/or adaption of greenery. Greenery in the urban environment has a whole list of (possible) positive benefits like water drainage, increased biodiversity and air purification. There is one benefit that can also be a disadvantage for people with a lower socio-economic status: the rising property value. Due to a rising property value people that can not afford higher rents might be forced out of the neighbourhood. This form of gentrification is called green gentrification because it is gentrification caused through greenery developments. The aim of this project is to implement greenery into the neighrbouhood to improve liveability without the negative effects of gentrification. The main question addressed in this thesis is thus: How to green pre-war neighbourhoods to increase liveability for current residents, with minimising the risks of gentrification? Liveability is a broad and subjective concept which involves many different perspectives from both humans and nonhuman species. First a strategy was developed with the use of three main existing theories: Patchcorridor- matrix, 3-30-300 and Just Green Enough. Additional to these theories appropriation of public space is also important in the approach, to facilitate the different perspectives on liveability in a flexible way. The proposed approach is focused on small scale developments which are connected for ecological benefits and facilitate appropriation. To explore the implementation of this approach, this thesis is looking at the neighbourhood Oude Noorden in Rotterdam. The approach resulted in an neighbourhood strategy and a design for the Moerkapellestraat. In this design parking is seen as a way of appropriation which allows multiple uses for ‘parking’ spots. Parking spots now become a space for appropriation and improving liveability by residents themselves, allowing a variety of uses. To improve the liveability of current residents, with a human and nonhuman perspective, and limited risk of gentrification this thesis proposes a strategy focused on small scale greenery developments scattered through the neighbourhood. These small scale developments need to be ecologically responsible and connected to facilitate biodiversity. Appropriation provides the opportunities to let residents fulfill their individual needs in a flexible and low cost manner.","liveability; greening strategy; environmental justice; pre-war neighbourhoods; green gentrification","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Urbanism","",""

A design for an elderly specific housing project in the Merwehavens in Rotterdam tries to provide a possible solution. Since there are different social and economical backgrounds there are several different types of dwellings in the building, ranging from small care units to larger multi-bedroom apartments. To still offer the smaller apartments a space for (grand)children to visit, there are also lodging rooms on each floor. The dwellings themselves are all wheelchair proof. This means that the residents do not need to move again if their physical capabilities decline with age, therefore providing a future proof dwelling for the elderly in the Netherlands.

The main view of scholars on housing is that homeownership usually is the first step into improving the lives of people with a low income. The Province of Jakarta struggled with the same question. To address the housing challenge in Jakarta, they created the Zero Down-Payment Housing Program (ZDPHP) in 2017. This program's main purpose is to provide financing facilities to meet the basic need for adequate housing, targeting the LIH. However, the adaptation of this program has been slow, begging the question of what could be done to attract more beneficiaries. This article is intended to help improve the ZDPHP in Jakarta and give a perspective for other places thinking about implementing the same program. It explores the current eligibility criteria from the perspective of two out of five elements of the ""5 As of Adequate Housing"", Affordability and Accessibility, to understand the underlying housing challenge. Indicators of those two elements were collected from the data associated with the project. These data sources were supported and further explained using empirical data from policies analysis, interviews, FGDs, surveys and other existing databases. The most important findings were found as follows. Firstly, the best proportion of housing expenses to household income is to look at the actual comparison between household income and what a household pays for housing and transportation in its respective city. Secondly, to further strengthen the housing planning in Jakarta, an education program should be enforced alongside the ZDPHP. Lastly, with the recent launch of regulation regarding government land use permits, it is hoped that this will be a key solution to overcome land limitations and reduce house prices to become more accessible and affordable.","Social Housing; Zero down payment; Adequate Housing; Affordability; Accessibility; Low income households; Subsidy program","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Management in the Built Environment","","-6.2393615506780815, 106.94261248438768"

Feijenpoort area, located in the city district Feijenoord, became one of the migrant labourers‘residential areas during this period. Since, it has been regarded as a socio-economically challenged, deteriorated and underprivileged part of Rotterdam. Today’s multi-cultural population’s well-being is considered one of Rotterdam’s lowest and the municipality seeks to remedy this in a sustainable way. An approved urban waterfront development strategy based on gentrification and targeting mid- to high-income groups however, might lead to even more urban anxiety and socio-economic related stress for the existing community. By acknowledging that well-being must be defined as a system of interconnected dimensions of physical, mental and social well-being the project investigates how this might be used to improve the poor conditions of Feijenpoort through architecture. How can spaces oriented at well-being let city residents flourish in a context of sustainable city development? The project targets mental well-being as the way to enhance multiple dimensions of well-being. It aims to achieve this through its educational and cultural program and concept as the Performing arts academy for youngsters. The design integrates biophilic design principles with art education. With the premise of combining biophilic design principles with lessons learned from educational typologies, the Performing arts academy aims to enhance the community’s mental well-being. The project gathers neighborhood and urban goals by harmonizing the boundaries between nature and spaces that encourage physical activity are socially stimulating and mentally rewarding to its users. The design aims to enhance encounters and encourages inclusive interaction by creating an abundance of informal setting where spontaneous public performances may take place. <br/><br","Hotel New York; Complex Projects; Feyenoord City; Feijenoord; well-being; Rotterdam; school; performing arts","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Complex Projects","Performing arts academy","51.892063, 4.518341"

As a result, Many residents are not aware of the importance of separating and recycling organic waste at the source. This is also same for many high-rise green façade projects, a new trend in architectural design today. Many of today's high-rise residential green facades are inaccessible to residents, or have been designed by architects so that residents do not have the means to grow their favourite plants. These problems are ultimately social in nature and are closely related to the economic and cultural aspects of society. Although these problems are complex, we as architects can use our architectural expertise to try to provide solutions that are different from the norm. So this graduation project attempts to bring composting organic waste and planting, two activities most common in low-rise rural areas, to high-rise housing to enhance the community cohesion that is often missing in the high-rise residential tower, as well as allowing each resident to have their own small garden in the sky. And this project tries to offer a new way of thinking about how to bring the quality of life that is only found in low-density environments to high-density living environments.","household organic waste; high-rise; flow; circular; decentralised; social cohesion; transformation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","Architectural Engineering",""

(mentor); Adema, F. (mentor); Kockelkorn, A.M. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","The number of solo-dwellers is a rising trend in the Netherlands. While living alone is not a new phenomenon, the proportions of solo-dwellers have made this a significant demographic group. According to ABF Research, the total number of households in the Netherlands in 2020 is 8,02 million with 3,11 million solo-dwellers. In 2050 the total number of households is expected to grow to 9,2 million with 4,09 million solo-dwellers. Thus, the solo-dweller household is the household type with the most expected growth compared to the other household types (ABF Research, 2020). More people choose to live on their own as a lifestyle choice or as a consequence of social and economic circumstances. Also, the number of people who express feeling lonely is increasing in the Netherlands. Within the solo-dweller household type, 48% of the people express to feel either somewhat or very lonely. Of the solo-dwellers who express feeling lonely, 14,8% are emotionally lonely and 16,3% are socially lonely (CBS, 2019). There are different reasons for being lonely, therefore, finding the solution to combat loneliness can be difficult. In the context of this research, this paper aims to focus on the loneliness that is caused by social isolation. Social isolation can be very harmful to physical and mental health, according to Holt-Lunstad (2015). This is why human societies have organized themselves around the notion of living with others and not alone (Klinenberg, 2012). <br/><br/>Be that as it may, modern society is changing according to Sennett (2018) as strangers keep more to themselves and do not interact with other strangers as much compared to the years before. If in today’s age, as a solo-dweller, you do not interact in public and also not in your home, it is not surprising to see that the number of people who express to feel lonely at times increases. This is because not interacting with people in public and in private is a form of social isolation which can cause loneliness. As people are more hesitant to interact with other strangers it becomes evident how important architecture is that incite moments of social encounters. The obvious question that follows this statement is whether solo-dwellers even want moments of social encounters. According to the research of Klinenberg (2012), for solo-dwellers, these spaces for social interactions are very important. This is because to compensate for the social isolation at home, the solo-dweller looks for nearby facilities where they can socialize. As the life of a solo-dweller continues, their living arrangements can change. A solo-dweller will have moments where they are not a solo-dweller. To prevent an excessive concentration of single-use within a building or space, it is important to cater to the diverse and ever-changing needs and practices of a young solo-dweller. <br/><br/>Furthermore, Novotney (2019) mentions that co-living is a popular trend for young and old to improve social connections and combat loneliness. These co-living communities can be established in a neighbourhood with multiple single-family homes or with solo-dwellers in one large apartment block. I will investigate different strategies in precedent co-living housing schemes to reduce loneliness among solo-dwellers in the city.","Solo-dweller; Co-living; Loneliness; Social interactions","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Global Housing","","51.909348, 4.416698"

In this regard the town and city-centers should be given especially careful attention in seeking out potential spaces that plug into the existing infrastructures and building cultures. Filling up vacant lots and adding top stories to existing buildings is a particularly sustainable and non-destructive way of increasing the density in the city. Another way is the refitting or removal of existing building blocks and structures in order to enhance them with structures that offer more space and opportunities for the citizens of the city in question.","primary school; density; urbanity; transformation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Urbanism","","50.33.00,5.511001"

Whilst the increased use of biomass for biofuel within the Netherlands is considered a positive move, external factors known as indirect land-use change make current practices more unsustainable than consumers think. ‘The Migration of Energy’ therefore looks at the Dutch transition towards a bio-based economy. Such an economy recognises the true cost of natural capital and values nature’s capacity to produce balanced and sustained energy, food, and water. Within primary industry, the concept of balance is used to convert typically wasted resources into value-added, bio-based products. <br/><br/> This project proposes a three-step transition towards a new energy commitment. Firstly, a move away from conventional biofuels such as corn and wood pellets towards more energy-dense, less environmentally impactful biomass derived from microalgae as an advanced biofuel. Secondly, the facilitation of opportunities for public engagement, giving them agency to become more active stakeholders within the transition. Thirdly, the establishment of an emblem showcasing Rotterdam’s values and commitment towards a more sustainable renewable energy transition. <br/><br/>The Feyenoord City Football Stadium in Rotterdam, also known as the Kuip, is not just a municipal monument. It is also a landmark of cultural value, collective identity and national pride situated within the district of Feyenoord in Rotterdam South. The Kuip could potentially be succeeded by a new stadium, enabling a significant opportunity to create an ‘emblem’ for Rotterdam’s bio-economy transition. <br/><br/>This new 'Centre for Bio-Based Research and Recreation' is proposed as a 'productive landscape’. This will bring conventionally private primary industry to the forefront of public consciousness by integrating public recreational sports and leisure activities within visible energy and water management processes. Thus, creating opportunities for interaction and transparency between key stakeholders. This research and design proposal, therefore, aims to identify the programmatic capacity for an emblem to act as an educational and interactive tool for the public.

In order to clarify the pathophysiologic mechanisms and optimize treatment methods, monitoring of the sublingual microcirculation may be valuable. From studies in septic patients, we know that microcirculation is impaired and that the microcirculation better describes severity of illness than different macrocirculatory parameters. In this study, we aimed to investigate the changes of the microcirculation and the macrocirculation over time in patients with a COVID-19 infection who were admitted to the ICU and see if this was different in patients who are more or less severely ill based on SOFA score.<br/>Materials and methods: Macrocirculatory and microcirculatory measurements were performed as soon as possible after admission to the ICU (T0) and then at 24 and 48 hours (T1 and T2). Patients were divided into subgroups based on the median SOFA score to make a distinction between more and less severely ill patients. To investigate the development of the macrocirculatory and microcirculatory parameters over time and to compare this in patients with different severity of illness, a linear mixed model analysis was performed.<br/>Results: 21 COVID-19 patients were included for analysis. The median SOFA score was 8 and no differences were found in clinical and demographic patient characteristics between SOFA groups. Patients in the low SOFA score group had higher PaO2 values and lower lactate levels compared to patients in the high SOFA score group (p = 0.033 and p = 0.007 respectively). In the low SOFA score group, mean PPV and mean FCD were higher compared to the high SOFA score group (p = 0.018 and p = 0.034 respectively). TVD showed a trend towards significance, with higher mean TVD values for patients in the low SOFA score group.<br/>Discussion: We found that microcirculation parameters measured at T0 were not significantly different between patient subgroups. Analysis of the course of the microcirculation over 48 hours (T0-T2) however, shows that for less severely ill patients PPV and FCD remain higher than for more severely ill patients. So, there may be a relationship between severity of illness of patients with a COVID-19 infection and the ability to activate microcirculatory compensatory mechanisms in order to draw on reserve capacity in a situation of hypoxemia.","Technical medicine; Intensive care medicine; Covid-19; Cardiogenic shock; Sublingual microcirculation; Hemodynamic coherence","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-01-12","","","","Technical Medicine","",""

Also, the number of containers handled per call has increased for many terminals. This poses challenges to existing terminals for more efficient operations and higher productivity. Automation is a way some terminals have tried to achieve this. Most existing automated container terminals were greenfield projects, but brownfield automation is gaining momentum.<br/>Literature on brownfield automation of container terminals is limited. The PIANC MarCom WG Report n° 208 – 2021, Planning for Automation of Container Terminals is the most recent and complete guideline for automation projects, but it is mainly focused on greenfield projects. Challenges for automating brownfield terminals are different than for greenfield ones. All of this translates into little guidance being available for future brownfield automation projects. Therefore, the experiences and lessons learnt from historical brownfield automation of container terminals are a valuable source of information to guide future projects. The aim of this thesis is then to present a characterisation of historic container terminals converted, or in the process of being converted, to some degree of automated operations.<br/>An empirical research methodology was defined to gather data on drivers for automation, challenges, observed benefits, drawbacks, and solutions adopted by brownfield automated terminals. A questionnaire was used for this purpose. Also, satellite images of the conversion process were analysed to observe implementation strategies. Additionally, terminal throughput, equipment, yard size and quay length were determined through a desk study. Data was analysed through categorization. Trends regarding the type of automation, i.e., semi-automation (automated yard equipment) or full automation (automated yard + automated transport between the stacks and the quay), and regarding the type of yard equipment adopted were determined. <br/>For the historic conversions analysed, it was concluded that the main drivers for automation are operational cost reductions, labour shortage, productivity increase, reliability/safety, and capacity. But these drivers are case specific. No benefits can be assumed a priori from automation. Objectives for automating should be defined by each terminal and solutions to achieve them proposed. The main challenges were continuity of operations during the conversion, adaptation to new operations, labour relations, and communication systems. Most terminals adopted semi-automated solutions, due to fewer labour issues expected and improved vessel productivity compared to full automation, among other reasons. It was observed that terminals with yards smaller than 10 [ha] chose aRTGs as their stacking equipment, while terminals with larger yards chose either an aRMG or the automated version of their yard equipment before automating.<br/>Three implementation strategies were observed: greenfield-like, phased, and big bang approaches. The first one refers to developing the automated yard in a new location, with little disruption of the operations of the old yard. A phased approach means that the implementation is divided in phases, and operations of the old yard must be disrupted from phase 1. The big bang approach was observed only for conversions from straddle carriers (SC) to auto SC. In these cases, a small site is used to test the technology. When the testing is finished, the terminal is closed for 2-3 days, and the technology is rolled out onto the entire yard or a large portion of it.","Automation; Brownfield; Container terminals","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

Sixty per cent of EU emissions include sectors like buildings, agriculture, non-ETS industry and waste. Much research cannot be found to reduce emissions in the buildings, houses and community-based scenarios. Therefore, this research focuses on developing an innovative model to make the community a hundred percent reliant on renewable energy sources. Renewable energy produces power variably depending upon external conditions. At times, the variability of renewable energy cannot be fed into the power grid due to network constraints or low demand leading to curtailment of the energy or selling the energy at zero marginal price. Therefore, the curtailment of energy and its intermittency is the biggest barrier in delaying the transition towards a hundred per cent of renewable power into the power systems. Robust energy storage technology is required to integrate with an intelligent control system to increase the penetration of renewable energy into the energy mix. To meet this requirement, “Green Hydrogen” produced can contribute to energy security by providing another energy carrier with different supply chains, producers, and markets, diversifying the energy mix, and improving the system’s resilience.

The nautical bottom is usually assessed using the density of the bottom fluid mud layer as a criterion. However, for navigability purposes, rheological properties of bottom layers (and in particular yield stress), rather than density, are key parameters. The rheological properties of fluid mud depend on both the density and composition of mud and this composition can vary over time, owing to organic matter degradation.<br/>In this study, the influence of organic matter degradation on the rheological properties of mud is investigated. A total of 129 samples from different locations and mud layers (depths) from the Port of Hamburg were analysed. They were degraded in the laboratory under aerobic and anaerobic conditions for 250 days. The rheological properties of these samples were analysed before and after degradation using a rotational rheometer (HAAKE MARS I).<br/>The rheological properties of the samples before and after anaerobic degradation were significantly dissimilar. On average, the fluidic yield stress decreased by 26 %. This percentage had a strong positive correlation with the total organic carbon contents and degradabilities of the samples under consideration. In contrast, the seasonal variability of the samples did not show any correlation with the rheological properties.<br/>After degradation, the decrease in total organic carbon content is small and could not be correlated to yield stress changes. This leads to conclude that the structural breakdown of organic matter and/or the breakdown of organic bridges between organic matter and clay particles are the reasons for the decrease in strength.<br/>The fluidic yield stresses of the aerobically degraded samples increased by 2 %. The difference with their anaerobically degraded counterparts is suspected to be caused by oxidation, which could add cohesion to the mud. From this study, it can be concluded that intentional organic matter degradation during dredging operations could be very effective in making the mud navigable.","Rheology; Rheological properties; Sediment management; Organic Matter; Degradation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","MUDNET",""

A network of multiple sensors is employed to deliver information for this localization process. Loosely coupled integration of global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) and inertial navigation systems (INS) data is a common sensor-fusion method for such positioning. One of the problems of this approach, is that exact knowledge of the process- and measurement noise covariance matrices is often not available. The GNSS measurement noise uncertainties, in particular, are highly dynamic and, depending on the specific environment, might follow a non-Gaussian distribution. Since particle filter are known to be superior in non-Gaussian environments, a hybrid filtering variant is proposed: adaptive particle-aided cubature Kalman filtering. This algorithm compromises between a particle filter with kernel density estimation algorithm in periods of non-Gaussian GNSS noise, and a standard cubature Kalman filter in case of Gaussian GNSS noise. The results of GNSS/INS-based localization simulations indicate that the proposed adaptive particle-aided cubature Kalman filter outperforms traditional filtering methods in terms of minimal localization errors.","GNSS/INS-based vehicle localization; particle filter; cubature Kalman filter; hybrid filtering architecture; kernel density estimation; switching strategy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

(mentor); Gijón Mancheño, A. (mentor); Hofland, B. (graduation committee); Suzuki, Tomohiro (graduation committee); Winterwerp, J.C. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","The coastline of Demak, Indonesia has been eroded during the last 15 years. To restore the natural coastal protection which existed out of mangroves forest, permeable dams, consisting of bamboo poles with a brushwood filling, have been built to attenuate the waves and facilitate sedimentation behind the dams and thus creating a habitat for mangroves. However these designs required a lot of maintenance, so a new type of design is proposed without a filling of brushwood, containing only vertical bamboo poles. Next to this the possibility to include aquaculture in the design is proposed. Therefore this study assesses the wave transformation by the new designs in Demak, Indonesia with the numerical wave model SWASH. In order to do that first the hydrodynamic conditions are analyzed to obtain the design conditions for the structures, and then SWASH is validated against laboratory experiments to find the right drag coefficient values. The design wave conditions are based on the local water depth, offshore wave heights and periods and local bathymetry. The offshore waves are based on a dataset from WaveWatch III, which compares well with measurements of a local storm event. The dataset of WaveWatch III is filtered and extrapolated to determine the wave conditions for return periods(R) of 1 and 5 years. This resulted in offshore waves with Hm0 = 2.08 and 2.39m, and Tp = 6.9 and 7.5 s respectively. The water level is mainly influenced by the tidal elevation and the surge levels. The surge levels are obtained from a risk assessment of the coast of North Java (Willemsen et al., 2019), which vary between 0.63 to 0.68mfor R = 1 and 5 years respectively. The tidal levels are determined using the water depth measurements of two transects from Van Domburg et al. (2018) and analysed with Matlab tool Utide by Codiga (2011), resulting in a spring tidal range of 85 cm and a neap tidal range of 50 cm.<br/>Four different configurations from the experiments of Jansen (2019) are used to validate SWASH: single row, longitudinal(the spacing in flow direction is longer than the lateral spacing), open uniform and dense uniform configuration. These configurations are modelled in the numerical wave model SWASH by use of the vegetation module. The most influential factors are: the drag coefficient, the way to describe mass conservation and the number of stems(cylinders) per m2. For the drag coefficient the bulk drag coefficient of Gijon Mancheno et al. (2021) is used, which contains factors for sheltering, blockage and the KC state of the flow. For the densely packed configurations the bulk drag coefficient proved to have a better agreement than the drag coefficient of a single cylinder. The sensitivity to the number of stems per m2 is small when implementing the longitudinal configuration as an average amount of stems perm2 or by specifying the individual rows of the configuration and so locally increasing the number of stems. Three methods of describing the mass conservation in SWASH are evaluated: by means of a cross sectional approach that is expressed by the blockage factor in the bulk drag coefficient Gijon Mancheno et al. (2021), by a volumetric approach due to activating the porosity in SWASH which means that the blockage factor cannot be included in the drag coefficient and by a combination of these two. For the longitudinal configuration the best agreement is found the cross sectional approach and for the single row configuration the best agreement is found by the volumetric approach.<br/>Once SWASH is validated, the designs of several structures are investigated. Firstly, a design consisting out of two rows of bamboo poles is considered where the spacing between the rows is varied to find an optimum distance. The transmission rate Et /Ei decreased from 75% to 55% with a spacing sx = 0.42 m to 5.8 m, larger spacings did not result in less transmission. If one wants to be conservative at least three rows are needed to have a lower transmission rate of 50 %. When mussels are considered, the structures have to be placed in deeper water as mussels can only grow between MLWS and 40 cm above the bed. To provide enough space for mussel growth, the poles have to be placed more sparsely. The effect of a larger water depth in combination with a limited pole length and sparse structures is larger than the extra drag and frontal area provided by mussels, especially since they did not cover the whole pole length, and resulted in high transmission rates. It is thus recommended to, or place a high number of rows of mussel poles or place a few rows without mussels followed by poles for mussels. This decision however also depends on benefits that mussel poles may bring and the cost of the materials, therefore a cost/benefit analysis is required.<br/>This thesis found an efficient design that can be used in reducing wave attenuation along muddy coasts without the need of a brushwood filling. Hereby it provides an economically and user friendly alternative with respect to the current design, as it requires less material and maintenance.<br","mangroves; SWASH; permeable structures; Drag coefficient","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","MuMaCo",""

This traditional configuration is approaching a fuel efficiency asymptote. Besides that, with the increasing number of passengers and cargo transported by air every year, and environmental impact as an important factor in aircraft design, there is a necessity for a solution that is able to boost aircraft efficiency. Currently, the faculty of Aerospace Engineering at TU Delft is working on a promising aircraft configuration, namely the Flying-V. This is a specific type of flying wing that is tailless, V-shaped, and consists of two cylindrical pressurised cabins located in the leading edge of the wing. Wind tunnel experiments show that the aircraft is longitudinally statically stable up to an angle of attack of 20¶, after that pitch break occurs. Besides that, research performed on the aerodynamic coefficients obtained using the Vortex Lattice Method and results from the maiden flight test of a scale model of the aircraft conclude that the Dutch roll mode is unstable. Therefore, this research defines a set of key stability and handling quality requirements based on civil aviation authorities combined with military standards for cruise- and approach conditions. These key requirements are consequently assessed with a simulation model of the aircraft using aerodynamic coefficients obtained from the Vortex Lattice Method and wind tunnel experiments. In an attempt to make the key stability and handling quality characteristics of the TU Delft Flying-V adhere to the defined requirements, this thesis aims to contribute to this research field by designing a nonlinear Incremental Nonlinear Dynamic Inversion (INDI) flight control system that is applied to the simulation model of the aircraft. Finally, the performance of the aircraft using this flight control system is assessed and proposals for aerodynamic design changes and control layout design changes are given.","Flying-V; Handling Qualities; flight control; simulation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

The dose delivered to a point in the tumour depends on the type and activity of the source, the distance to the source and the time the source dwells at a predetermined dwell position. Current therapies have proven to be capable of tumour control. However, in contrast with other RTs there is no suitable integrated dose verification method available for HDR BT which does not disturb the clinical workflow. The focus of this research is on the dose verification for the most commonly used form of HDR BT. The one with the Ir-192 source. An optical in vivo dosimetry (OIVD) sensor assembly consists of a capsuled scintillator coupled into an optical fibre, which connects to a photodiode capable of processing the light signal generated in the scintillator. These systems are currently only available in experimental set-ups and not jet integrated with the afterloader, making them clinically unusable. Furthermore, the system needs to be coupled with an optical fibre of 100-300μm, give a linear output signal to remodel the delivered dose, be non-hygroscopic, be suitable at treatment temperatures, and have low production costs. By adding a OIVD sensor to the current clinical BT workflow, better treatment can be achieved. This sensor assembly needs to be made with a suitable scintillator and shape to have a high coupling efficiency in the OIVD sensor system to give reliable dose verification. Both a literature study and simulations are executed as part of my master thesis to provide a context for the project and to find the best-suited shape and scintillator, This report provides an overview of the current status of knowledge of OIVD from the available experiments and clinical studies derived from the published data, so knowledge for choosing the scintillator material, fibre diameter and the coupling geometry can be obtained. Special attention is given to identifying why scintillators excite light of a specific wavelength and how to achieve an efficient light coupling. The inorganic scintillator ZnSe : O has favourable scintillation characteristics and is has proven itself to be helpful in a OIVD sensor for Ir-192 BT with its high intensity, good energy resolution, slight afterglow and low production cost. The experimental part of this research is the verification of the OIVD sensor assembly with simulations executed within the COMSOL Multiphysics®ray-tracing package, which compares multiple similar OIVD sensor assembly heads. The OIVD model is inspired by the experimental set-up from E.Andersen and simulates for multiple configurations on a range of parameters (5). The simulations of the OIVD sensor assembly can conclude the following: 1. The most favourable scintillator is ZnSe :O, this scintillator has the highest light yield and low absorption. 2. With a fibre diameter of 200μ m, sufficient light yield reaches the detector to verify the dose delivery. 3. Couple the fibres off the centre from the central axis of the scintillator will negatively influence the coupling efficiency. The outcome of this research contributes to the design of a OIVD sensor assembly for HDR BT for with Ir-192 . These simulations lead to an optimal design that will fit the current afterloader system. Next to this, the OIVD sensor assembly head can be made with simple manufacturing steps so that it can be produced at a minimal cost. The combination of the COMSOL model with the scintillation properties from the literature shows that a sensor assembly of a ball coupled ZnsSe :O scintillation is has a higher light throughput than the prototype from E.Andersen (5), this shows that it is favourable to verify the dose delivery of Ir-192 HDR BT (5).","Brachytherapy; Dosimetry; COMSOL","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-01-03","","","","Biomedical Engineering","COMSOL Multiphysics",""

Hydrogen is a solution for heavy transport sectors that struggle to reduce emissions by direct electrification, such as the Dutch inland waterway transport (IWT) sector. However, the lack of economic viability is one of the most dominant challenges for hydrogen, which calls for a tailored and sectoral policy approach that considers the dynamics involved in the IWT sector. This study simulates the decision-making process of active ships in the Netherlands based on the economic trade-off between diesel- and hydrogenpowered drivetrains to identify policy measures that would catalyze the sector’s hydrogen transition.<br/><br/>In the simulated base scenario, NOx, PM, and CO2 emission targets are not met. Economic policies must contribute to the realization of these emission targets. Here, quantity-based economic instruments are preferred over price-based economic. Quantity-based economic instruments ensure that emission targets are realized virtually, while the effect of price-based economic instruments is subject to uncertainties related to cost developments, for instance. The introduction of a Renewable Energy (HBE) obligation and the inclusion of the IWT sector in the Emission Trading Scheme (ETS) are effective quantity-based economic instruments. When implementing both these instruments, policymakers must prevent double burdening of the IWT sector.<br/><br/>When introducing an HBE obligation, obligation levels must be set in accordance with the emission goals and a multiplier for hydrogen is recommended to create a level playing field with other renewable fuels. To include the IWT sector in the ETS, the minimum tonnage condition for ships must be removed. In addition to these policies, subsidies must be provided on the large capital investments for hydrogen to compensate for the higher marginal abatement cost in the IWT sector and create a level playing field with other transport modes, countries and fuels. Besides economic policies, the development of relevant regulation and bunkering infrastructure is a prerequisite for the hydrogen transition in the IWT sector.<br/><br/>This research mainly focused on a techno-economic trade-off between hydrogen- and diesel-powered drivetrains. Future research could focus on additional (qualitative) criteria in the decision-making process, such as upcoming legislation, safety, and (bunkering) infrastructure availability.","hydrogen; Inland Waterway Transport; Technological Transitions; Simulation; Policy; Decision-making process","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Industrial Ecology","",""

It appears often and in different types of situations. We concentrate on congestion caused by predicted temporary road blockades, such as open bridges. This research aims to reduce such congestion by focussing on solving a routing problem that accounts for these road blockades.<br/><br/>More specifically, we consider traffic that is to be guided through a network with a number of different routes, where bridges function as temporary blockades when they are opened. A river that is used by freight transport runs through this network, in which road traffic uses bridges to cross the river. These bridges would open to let the freight ships pass. In such a situation, open bridges are a predictable temporary blockade for the vehicles on the road, a disturbance on the traffic flow. <br/><br/>We propose a model predictive controller that routes the vehicles efficiently to their destinations, making a trade-off between waiting in front of bridges and taking a detour. Model predictive control has been selected because it can handle these predicted disturbances that the bridges pose. Furthermore, it can be tuned to make a trade-off between a computationally fast and an accurate solution. A traffic split determines which part of the incoming traffic flow on a road interchange is sent towards which emanating road. These traffic splits represent the actuator variables of the controller. The total time spent by all vehicles in the network is the cost function to be minimised. <br/><br/>We describe a motorway network with METANET, a macroscopic traffic model. We do not use the full model, but a piecewise-affine approximation, in order to simplify the optimisation calculations significantly. We discuss two ways of modelling this approximation: an existing Mixed Logical Dynamical (MLD) formulation and a novel Linear Programming (LP) formulation. An analysis of the novel LP model in an N-step-ahead simulation is performed. We show that this problem cannot be written in a single LP problem, but that it is actually a linear multilevel programming problem (where N LP problems have to be solved consecutively). <br/>As a means to model predicted disturbances, a novel store-and-forward bridge element is added to the nonlinear and the MLD model. A case study is performed to evaluate the effectiveness of this new bridge element. The results of this case study were satisfactory. Moreover, the results obtained with the MLD model provided an acceptable approximation of the results obtained with the nonlinear model.","Traffic Control; Dynamic Routing; METANET; Model Predictive Control; Linear Programming","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

This underlines the importance of effective and efficient waste management. <br/><br/>The Internet of Things (IoT) has proven to be a useful tool to increase the efficiency of waste collection and while many waste management organizations are beginning to adopt these solutions, many are struggling to fully adopt and implement the technology. It is still unclear, due to lack of research, what factors are hindering the adoption and implementation of IoT technology in these organizations and how the process can be improved. The research scope of this study was three-sided: Industry specific, organizational, and technological. The focus was set on the waste management industry, and the intra-organizational barriers that hindered the adoption and implementation process of IoT-powered fullness sensors. The core problems at hand were identifying what the intra-organizational IoT adoption barriers are, what are the most influential barriers, what mitigation strategies can be employed to mitigate these barriers and how it can all be illustrated within an IoT adoption and implementation process framework.<br/><br/>The main research question formulated to answer these problems is: How can the adoption and implementation process of IoT-powered fullness sensors in waste management be improved? Four sub-research questions were formulated that held partial information which were needed to answer the main question.<br/><br/>The overarching structure of this research project follows the Design Science Research Methodology (DSRM). DSRM provides a commonly accepted approach which involves a rigorous six step activity process for creating and evaluating an IT artifact intended to solve organizational problems. This methodology was altered to fit this particular study, and thus followed five of the six steps.

The case study revealed, through interviews, which of the identified barriers had the most significant effect on their adoption and implementation process. Expert interviews and desk research were used to formulate strategies that organizations could employ to mitigate the most prominent barriers identified. After all the interviews had been transcribed, coded, and categorized, data triangulation was used where data from multiple different interviewees was compared and analyzed. From the results of these research efforts, a framework explaining the IoT adoption and implementation process for waste management was then designed and developed. Expert interviews were again conducted to evaluate the framework and confirm the framework’s theoretical validity, application and expected performance in terms of its set goals and objectives. <br/><br/>The results of this research are the identified general intra-organizational innovation adoption factors, the most influential factors affecting IoT adoption and implementation within waste management along with their proposed mitigation strategies as well as a designed IoT adoption and implementation process framework in which these strategies are incorporated. The general intra-organizational innovation adoption factors identified are: Leaders’ attitude towards change, Centralization, Complexity, Formalization, Interconnectedness, Organizational slack, Size, Culture, Degree of risk-taking, End user behavior, Strategic objectives and Uncertainty of business benefits. The following are the three most influential barriers to IoT adoption and implementation within waste management and their proposed mitigation strategies: The first barrier is Uncertainty of business benefits and its proposed mitigation strategies are: Gaining a Proof of Value (PoV) and Incremental scale-up. The second barrier is Strategic objectives and its proposed mitigation strategies is: Using information to gain a competitive advantage. The proposed mitigation strategy for the third barrier, Degree of risk-taking, is Renting with an option to buy.<br/><br/>The applicability of the designed framework in a real-life setting is yet to be tested. Future research could involve using the framework and applying it in an actual implementation of IoT fullness sensors in a waste management organization.<br","IoT; Internet of Things; Adoption; Implementation; Waste management; Adoption process; Framework","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

(mentor); Storm, S.T.H. (graduation committee); Clancy III, R.F. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","In 2014 the Chinese government announced implementation of a so-called ‘Social Credit System’ which should solve three existential threats China is facing: 1. instability of the financial credit sector, 2. limitations in financial services, and 3. threats of social instability. By increasing the collection and centralization of (personal) data, which would result in increased control and transparency, the financial sector should be stabilized and penetration of financial services should increase. Additionally, social instability would be addressed by social management, in which good behaviours are rewarded and bad ones are punished, eventually inducing mechanisms of self-regulation. Although the system aims to solve existential issues China struggles with, the system has gotten a lot of criticism mainly coming from non-Chinese sources. Whereas most studies have focused on how the systems works, aim of this thesis has been to provide insight into the opinion and approval of individuals on SCSs. Based on a survey conducted among Chinese and Dutch respondents strong and higher levels of approval were found among Chinese respondents. Mostly, this higher approval among Chinese respondent can be attributed to the almost negligible share of disapproving Chinese respondents. An explanation to the lower share of disapproving Chinese respondents can be found in the explanatory factors that were identified for both samples, which are: 1. perception whether SCSs would increase accountability taken for actions, and 2. perception whether SCSs increase quality-of-life. As both variables were positively correlated with approval, the correlates show Chinese respondents perceive SCSs more as benefit-generating than Dutch respondents. Furthermore, another interesting correlate showing a positive relation which was only found for the Chinese sample, is trust in government with personal data. As Chinese respondents also reported a nationwide SCS should be run by the government, privacy concerns of approving Chinese respondents most likely is low (or even absent) for government-run SCSs.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

(mentor); van Straten, Bart (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","b>Introduction</b><br/>Each year hospitals in the Netherlands generate approximately 1.3 million kilogram of waste from the polypropylene (PP) wrapping paper (WP) used to wrap surgical instruments. The objective of this thesis is to acquire high quality PP, for the use of injection moulding, from blue wrapping paper waste as well as analysing and proposing solutions for optimizing the current melting process.<br/>Method<br/>In the first part of this thesis the WP was melted at different temperatures into bars, granulated and mixed with virgin PP. Dog bones were injection moulded to analyse the influence of the initial melting temperature, mixing ratio with virgin, pollution (sticker and tape) and ten washing cycles of disinfection at the sterilization department. <br/>The reduction of the cycle time by means of pressure was analysed on a conceptual level. The separation of the pollution from the WP during the melting cycle with filtration was tested with three different filter designs. Finally, partitioning of the end product with a tray divider was tested.<br/><b>Results</b><br/>The results on the initial melting temperature show marginal differences in material properties. In general the reprocessed material behaves in a more brittle manner, with the ultimate tensile strength, Young's modulus and Shore D hardness increasing and the strain at break decreasing with amount of WP recyclate used compared to virgin material. Pollution seemed to decrease the strain at even further while also decreasing the ultimate tensile strength. The results for the washing and disinfection showed minimal material changes. <br/>The results on the tested filtration prototypes showed that filtration can be used to separate pollution during the melting cycle. Furthermore, IR temperature measurements and flow measurements, with clean and polluted WP waste, show the importance of heat flow characteristics for an efficient filter design. The combination of a filter with proper heat flow characteristics and a conceptual pressure system showed a weight reduction of 40%. The tray divider partitioned the end product, making the end product directly implementable in a granulator.<br/><b>Discussion</b><br/>The changes in material properties when using 50% virgin material and 50% recyclate (50%R) indicated minimal changes when compared with 100% virgin. Moreover, this does not imply a lesser product, rather a different product. Different applications require different material properties, as such the mixing ratio can be adapted according to the applications needs. <br/>When designing a full-scale filter it is recommended to use spikes to keep the bulk of the pollution from reaching the permeable surface of the filter. The use of a coating on a filter could reduce the time needed to clean the filter. <br/><b>Conclusion</b><br/>This thesis project showed that it possible to make high-quality products with the granulate obtained from blue wrapping paper waste. Also, adding; a pressure system, a filtration system and a tray divider can reduce the process time for obtaining 99% pure granulate from WP waste.","Medical waste; Blue wrapping paper; Recycling PP; Polypropylene recycling; Process Analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In order to optimise these low level parameters and high level behaviors, grammatical evolution was applied to behavior trees. Grammatical evolution provided a significant improvement in the wall-following behavior of a drone, creating a more robust behavior. There was no improvement for the navigation behavior however, with the success rate of navigating deteriorating in some cases. The evolved wallfollowing behavior was compared and tested against another wall-following controller from literature, and shown to be superior. A real-life experiment was also conducted for the wall-following behavior, which led to positive results after correcting for the reality gap. For the wall-following behavior, the grammatical evolution promoted a continuous scanning behavior, which greatly increased it’s awareness of obstacles. Significant recommendations were given to improve the results of the grammatical evolution for both behaviors.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Through the integration of digital media in architecture and its interactive aspects, information can become more accessible to users. Beirut is historically known for being the intellectual center of the middle east. Hosting high quality schools and possessing a cosmopolitan character, Beirut truly put its mark on the map. Despite this reputation, Lebanon now finds itself struggling with urgent crises surrounding education and knowledge. The most important factor in the crises is the socioeconomic disparities in the access to knowledge and education. Currently there is a lack in public learning spaces and buildings in Beirut. Due the absence of a public library or learning space in the city, Beirutians have little access to knowledge and this access is determined by their social class. By satisfying the need for a public library there is a potential to address the social fragmentation of Beirut and minimize this fragmentation. This learning space should not only respond to the current needs of the city, but also to the future of Beirut.<br/><br/>Economically, there is a national shift from service sector to IT sector. It is expected that Lebanon will grow further in the IT sector due to its national and regional competitive advantage. The same trend is seen in globally, where digitalization is becoming more and more apparent in our daily lives. This new way of living influences the library typology, where printed and non-printed information can be found. The way we learn is evolving due to this fast paced growth of technology. Conventional learning is teacher- centered. This type of learning typically refers to learning situations where the teacher is the main source for learning. This is also visible in conventional libraries, where the buildings are book centered. With the rise of technology however, there is new trend of learning which shifts from teacher-centered to student-centered learning. This means that the subject learns through different sources of knowledge, due to the accessibility of it through technology. In contemporary library buildings, this shift is visible where the building’s main element is not only books. In other words, typology is becoming less book centered and more user-centered. The library is not only a collection but an experience where multiple types of information come together. How can these different media be interwoven and work together to create an optimal library experience? In most contemporary buildings, these two types of information are quite segregated in the building. But how can these two ways of information be interwoven and work together to create an optimal library experience?<br/><br/>The research question for this project is: What role can a public learning space play in the reconstruction of Beirut and how can it spatially facilitate the local and global digitalization of information?<br","library; Beirut; Complex projects; Public building; architecture; urban design; Complexity; history","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","33.903244, 35.517928"

Especially in those countries that are in rapid development, the migration to the city is extreme. This is the case for Addis Ababa, the capital city of Ethiopia. Its population growth exceeds the number of newly built housing, and the housing that exists is unfit for a majority of the urban population. People create their own solution and move to informal neighbourhoods: neighbourhoods where they build their own houses and earn their money on the streets.<br/><br/>While the conditions in the informal settlements are far from optimal, people can live their life and create their own opportunities. Somehow, they make a living that they cannot make in formal housing units: either due to the rent they cannot afford to pay, or due to the inability to earn an income in the way they do in the informal neighbourhood. In this way of living the life in the informal neighbourhoods, temporality plays an important role. People are versitale, can adapt to different situations, different circumstances. They can build up a process, starting something from scratch with the resilience to improve it, one step at the time. The streets are vital: pedestrian flows are economic opportunities. Converting any moment, any place into an opportunity that fits the situation the best: from a kitchen to a shop through the window, from a outdoor stall to an outdoor cooking spot, from a place of moving and travelling, to a place for gathering and meeting. Spaces can transform, dwellings can transform, adapt to circumstances, adapt to serve the opportunity that seems most succesful. It is this temporal element that makes them resilient.<br/><br/>But these people are also vulnerable. With the current neighbourhood conditions, a lack of good quality housing, a lack of a well patterned street-network, a lack of services and hygiene, a lack of legal ownership, the dangers are clearly visible: fire, flooding, eviction and disease are potential enemies, created by their living situation. These people, of which there are so many in a city like Addis Ababa, deserve a home that caters their needs, actively engages them to use their abilities to improve their neighbourhood with the right acces to services, streets, economic opportunties. How can we use the theme of temporality to create such dwellings?<br/><br/>In this project, a built environment is envisioned that combines the informal way of living (earning an income, having social relations), with a good quality of dwelling. It provides a framework in which people can built their dwellings tehmselves, keeping them affodable, and being able to constantly adapt the home to what they need most. It generates outside space as well as people flows on lower as well as higher levels to increase the economic opportunities for all of the people living in the area.","Informality; Temporality; Global Housing; High-density urban living","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Global Housing","Addis Ababa Living Lab","9.0179323,38.7416373"

To this end, a novel biocrystallization process in an Upflow Anaerobic Sludge Bed (UASB) reactor has been developed to recover phosphorus by retaining it in the sludge bed of the reactor, while producing biogas as a valuable by-product. Previous research has proven that this process is effective at recovering phosphorus at a lab level, but the economic feasibility and environmental performance of the process are still unknown. The present study analyses how this technology would perform from an environmental and economic perspective, to identify bottlenecks that could be addressed from the early stages of development. <br/><br/>The process was assessed using a conceptual design which consisted of an industrial facility treating the excreted manure of 11 farms in the region of Friesland, the Netherlands. The manure which was mechanically separated on-farm was later digested in the UASB reactor. The P-rich sludge obtained was dried to obtain a 2% P wt CaP fertilizer, while the effluent was stripped to later recover the ammonia as diammonium sulfate with a 7% wt N content. <br/>The environmental assessment suggests that the P biocrystallization process could retain up to 41% of the initial P, while reducing the Global Warming Potential (GWP) associated with a conventional manure treatment by 36%. On the other hand, the techno-economic assessment, suggests that the P biocrystallization process could lead to a treatment cost of 26 € per ton of manure, which is nearly twice the value expected for a conventional manure treatment under the studied conditions. The elevated costs can be mainly linked to the high capital costs caused by the elevated energy requirement triggered by the drying unit needed to reduce the water content of the CaP fertilizer and by the high temperatures needed for the thermophilic digestion.<br/><br/>The analysis concluded that the P biocrystallization process is likely to present relevant environmental benefits when compared to conventional manure management systems, however, the economic constraints might impose a drawback for its implementation. Further research is suggested at a lab level to find methods to reduce the water content in the sludge and to study the effects of reducing the temperature of the anaerobic digestion (e.g., working at mesophilic conditions). <br","Phosphorus; Manure Management; ex-ante LCA; UASB; Anaerobic Digestion","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2027-01-10","","","","Industrial Ecology","",""

This growth has increased after the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic as it imposed home-based work on a large scale.

Stories of myths, folklore and legends, used to connect us with our physical environment, their objects, events and processes. Nowadays we mostly use scientific stories to explore our landscape.<br/> <br/>In landscape architecture we also use scientific stories to justify our designs. But even though these stories prove an urgency and credibility for our interventions in the landscape, they sometimes have difficulty connecting with people. Kagan, et al. (2019) argues that a more imaginary approach to narrative, instead of purely scientific, would help people connect to these stories.<br/>In this graduation project this question is explored in the city of Delft in the Netherlands through the narrative approach of myths. The three most important spatial stories in Delft are dissected using the narrative realms as posed by Potteiger and Purinton (1998). These stories are then transformed into the imaginary narrative of myths. These stories are: The story of Delft and the water. The industrial story of Delft and the royal Yeast factory. The ecological story of the urban forests and nature in Delft. These myths formed the basis for an exploration into the landscape and their design.<br/><br/>I found that narrative realms allowed for an approachable method of reading and writing stories in the landscape. Understanding how the story and its parts are interacting in the landscape is crucial for us as designers, because this allows us to know exactly where and what we can change of the stories in the landscape.<br/>The imaginary narrative of myths simplifies and abstracts the elements of the story to their most essential form while still respecting the technical depth behind them.

However, it can be beneficial for project developers and other initatiors of projects in urban development and can potentially lead to economic gain for the developer. To research if there is any economic gain in the eventual results of a project, and to what extent public participation has an impact on this, costs and value are the focus points of this research. Economic gain does not mean more profit, but decreased costs as well. More specific, one of the largest cost factors in project development are the costs that come with delay. Often, this delay is caused by opposition and litigation in the permit-application phase of a development. To research this, the following main question will be used: ‘’To what extent can project developers benefit economically from engaging public participation in complex urban development projects?’’ This research will take several financial factors into account: (1) primary costs of public participation, (2) secondary costs of public participation, (3) primary costs of legal processes and (4) secondary costs of legal procdures. The primary costs are the costs that are directly coming from an activity and the secondary costs are the costs that originate indirectly from these activities. To research this, two phases of case studies are used. The first phase of case studies is done to gain insight in the direct and indirect costs of public participation and legal processes, afore determining in the second round of case studies if public participation decreased the chances of (non)participants starting legal procedures or caused any other forms of delay. The first round of case studies is done through a financial analysis of multiple cases, the second round is one in-depth casestudy complimented by interviews with developers, legal advisors, and (non)participants themselves. A cross-analysis is done of the results to determine to what extent public participation helps to smoothen the process and decrease the chances of legal processes, and if so, how it financially contributed to the financial result of the project. The research is rounded off with practical recommendations for developers on how to include public participation in their development process to maximize the potential of public participation initatiated by developers.","Public participation; Urban Development; Legal costs; Economic gain; Process Management","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Management in the Built Environment","",""

Furthermore, natural habitat loss has resulted in a biodiversity crisis affecting the entire ecosystem.<br/><br/>This research project, Rotterdam as Urban Tidescape, explores the potential of exploiting the unique tidal characteristics of the Nieuwe Maas within an urban design for Westblaak-Blaak, Rotterdam, with the goal of transforming it into a resilient and dynamic public space for people and animals alike, whilst contributing to the mobility transition and restoring biodiversity.<br/><br/>Through the design process, researching an integral solution to the aforementioned challenges, it was found that incorporating tidal nature within the urban area would benefit people in a variety of ways (e.g. providing healthier public space, creating unique experiences, and reducing heat stress). Natural gradients as a result of tidal cycles provide an array of animals with more and unique (tidal) habitats, which contributes to countering the biodiversity crisis. By adding to the mobility transition of Rotterdam through a significant reduction of (the surface for) car traffic, the resulting freed up space can be transformed into a healthier urban environment - from rooftop to underwater.<br/><br/>With the unique tidal habitats, the migration of animals, and the increasing salinity of the river water over time, Westblaak-Blaak has the potential to become a resilient and dynamic hotspot which evolves along the day, throughout the seasons, and over the years. Key findings have been collected into an Urban Tidescape Toolkit for reference within similar urban landscape design assignments, and an overview of essentially endangered red-listed and icon species along with their respective habitats has been enclosed.","Urban Ecology; Eco-Cities; Rotterdam; Tidescapes; Tidal Parks; Public Space; Mobility Transition; Biodiversity","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Landscape Architecture","","51.9181999,4.4830978"

Signs that can indicate future project failure, such as cost overruns and time delays, in early project phases are Early Warning (EW) signs. EW signs are defined as indicators for potential future problems. This research investigates mechanisms that influence the response to EW signs in construction projects. Directions for solutions to mitigate the obstructions for responding to EW signs found in this research are also provided. This research provides a new perspective compared to current literature, by conducting research from the perspective of a contractor, including the interaction with subcontractors. Previous studies focused on the client’s perspective instead.<br/><br/>This qualitative research uses a combination of research methods including an in-depth case study on the EW response of three constructions projects, expert interviews and an expert meeting. Data analysis in this research uses grounded theory methodology, and combines organisational behaviour theory with the topic of EW signs.<br/><br/>Two main mechanisms influencing the EW response were found: (1) the lack of information flow in projects seems to prevent EW signs from being identified, and (2) group culture and team interaction were found to hinder the response to EW signs in projects. A third mechanism was found as a recurring theme impacting three out of four analysed EW responses: interpretations of agreements and contracts, and trust in the work carried out by other parties seem to reduce the activity of identifying and responding to EW signs.<br/><br/>To mitigate the obstructions for identifying and responding to EW signs found in this research, the following directions for solutions are concluded to show potential: attention for individual characteristics in team composition, equipping the information system in projects with accessible options to store, and keep track of potential EW signs during projects, increasing the attention to EW signs during the tender phase, and creating awareness of the importance of responding to EW signs in project teams.<br","Early Warning signs; EW signs; Project Control; Project Management; Risk Management; Construction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

In order to offset these variations, gas can be used as an auxiliary source of energy for power production, but extra power can also be used to produce hydrogen or methane for storage. As a consequence, gas and power networks are growing more and more interdependent and thus need to be modelled together in order to make meaningful predictions. A growing body of literature deals with the modelling and simulation of such coupled networks, but the main focus of most sources is accuracy. On the other hand, Gasunie and TenneT’s Infrastructure Outlook report aimed to study hourly snapshots of a coupled network over one year, in a variety of different scenarios. Therefore, a simplified and computationally inexpensive model was needed. Literature dealing with such models is lacking, so a linear model consisting of transport load minimization was constructed for this purpose. It was used for both gas and power simulations, but it is inadequate for the latter.<br/>In this thesis, the transport load model is combined with the standard DC model of power flow in order to obtain more accurate results. The resulting combined linear model is tested on small sample networks, showing that it is functional given a set of modelling assumptions. In addition, the transport load model is compared to the DC model in a sample set of Dutch power networks. A large difference is observed between the two, confirming that there is no reason to use transport load as a model for electricity. Further research is needed to evaluate the accuracy of the transport load model for gas.","Energy network modelling; Linear optimization; Combined energy network; DC power flow; Sector coupling; Transport load","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics | Computational Science and Engineering","",""

These designs are developed to a level sufficient for an adequate comparison of the bridges.<br/>The basis on which the bridges are compared are laid out, followed by the conditions the bridges are subjected to. These are based on typical conditions found in an urban Dutch environment.<br/>Analytic equations are automated, by way of python scripts, for the analysis and optimization of the steel bridge longitudinal dimensions under simplified ULS loading. After the optimization is complete, these initial bridge dimensions are verified with a 2D plate element model in SCIA engineer. The full loading for the bridge during utilization, save for accidental loading, is then modelled and the bridge dimensions are adapted in order to meet ULS, SLS, and fatigue conditions.<br/>Several potential versions of a bridge with timber members are considered. Following this, a bridge with a mostly timber superstructure, supported by a self-anchored cable system is further worked out. For this, a SCIA model, with 1D elements and subjected to the same loads as its steel counterpart, is produced. The incompatible combination of 1D elements, thick cross sections, and surface loads is addressed by the use of connector elements (“dummy members”) and individual load panels per member.<br/>After the global optimization of the bridge dimensions with regards to ULS and SLS, the connections are designed with a combination of detail 2D element FE models and analytic equations. The forces and support conditions of the connections follow from the global bridge design. A fatigue check is then run on the timber members of the bridge.<br/>Subsequently, the durability and eco- costs of the bridges are computed. The data for the durability estimation of the steel bridge is based on experience within IV- Infra and the durability of the timber bridge is estimated using the RISE factor method. The eco- costs of the bridges are computed using the IDEMAT database.<br/>The results from the analyses are discussed based on this.<br/>Finally, aspects of relevance in the design of timber bridges are synthesized and recommendations for the application of bridges and further research are given.","Heavy Traffic; Bridge; Wood; Glulam","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","There seems to be a mismatch between the enormous potential of Industry 4.0 (I4.0) and the extent to which it is adopted in the construction and development industry C&amp;DI. According to the literature, the growing interest in I4.0 and its potential benefits are not stimulating companies to adopt it. There is little to no research covering adopting I4.0 technologies in the Dutch C&amp;DI. Usually, the<br/>focus is on different industries. When research focuses on the C&amp;DI, it often investigates the construction or the maintenance phase. In addition, these researches mainly focus on the barriers of adopting Industry 4.0, and not on what interventions could be taken to increase the adoption in practice. This has resulted in the following main research question:<br/>Are barriers withholding adopting Industry 4.0 (I4.0) technologies (e.g. artificial intelligence (AI), internet of things (IoT) and Digital Twins (DT)) within the Dutch construction and development industry, and if so, can these barriers be overcome? Due to the topic’s nascent character, mainly qualitative research is conducted. Literature is reviewed in combination with exploratory interviews and a focus group. In addition, a quantitative study was set up to support the qualitative research through a survey. A selection of twelve barriers to withholding adopting I4.0 technologies has been identified from the literature review. As a result of the survey, the lack of clarity on economic benefit and the challenge in the value chain integration emerged as the two most significant barriers. The most frequently adopted I4.0 technologies in the Netherlands are sensors and big data &amp; analytics. The interviews and focus group made it possible to look in-depth at the previously found results, revealing several significant barriers. In addition, potential interventions have been identified to overcome the barriers. In conclusion, these interventions have been discussed in more detail, followed by recommendations. For example, municipalities should participate more often in a Joint venture, which is a public-private partnership. Unfortunately, specific numbers of Dutch adoption are missing in the research. However, the recent experience and adoption of I4.0 technologies in the Dutch <br/> C&amp;DI generate well-founded valuable insights. Lastly, the research stresses the importance of future research on the topic.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Management in the Built Environment","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Despite the severity and high frequency of cost overruns in construction projects, it is considered a rule rather than an exception. This phenomenon occurs when the initially estimated budget does not suffice the actual costs needed to realise the project. Uncertainty and bias challenge the ability to make cost estimates. Incorrect estimates of indirect costs, including risks, reservations and project organisational costs, are acknowledged as a frequent cause for cost overruns. Regardless of the risk and cost contingency management tools in literature and their application in practice, project uncertainties are still underestimated and insufficiently managed.<br/><br/>During the execution phase projects are monitored with performance indicators, which provide information about past events or activities. This means these indicators are lagging, hence it limits proactive project management. On the contrary, leading indicators could function as early warning signs as they present themselves before potential issues arise, or risks materialize.<br/><br/>The objective of this research is to improve the cost contingency process by implementing early warning signs, in order to proactively manage projects and minimise cost overruns and materialized risks. In order to achieve this objective the following main research question is formulated: “How can early warning signs be used in large construction projects to improve accuracy of cost contingency estimates and management in order to minimize cost overruns?”<br/><br/>Concluding from the empirical study, early warning signs can be implemented in the cost contingency process by shifting the focus of risk management from mitigating and managing the effects of risks towards the causes of risks. Subsequently, risk strategies and mitigation measures can be more effective when aimed at the origin of the issue, instead of the direct issue leading to the risk. It is valuable to examine the risks as a system or network, instead of single problems, because it provides a better representation of reality and the links between risks or other events reveal information about correlation or side effects. Consequently, mitigation measures can increase in efficiency, when one cause, leading to multiple risks, is targeted. Furthermore, materialization of a risk is detected as an early warning sign which contains information about causes or circumstances that trigger other risks as well. Additionally, the increase of a RISMAN score indicates a change in project circumstances and therefore can be used as an early warning for materialization of risks. The justification for an increase in RISMAN score is diverse, and should thus be analysed to reveal the specific information needed to prevent materialization of risks. <br/><br/>A common database contributes to the early warning sign approach as well, because it overcomes the in the case study identified ‘surveillance filter’, by improving collection and transfer of information. Tracking the cost contingency increases the accuracy of this estimate in general, because it provides insight into the development during project phases and the actual spending pattern. And when this info is stored in a database it allows referencing from previous projects, hence including an ‘outside view’.<br","Risk management; Early warning signs; Cost contingency; Contingency; Project management; Risk analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

(graduation committee); Koppen, L (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Since the European Commission concluded that green hydrogen is a key priority in the achievement of Europe’s energy transition, hydrogen is included in transition strategies of many parties. The Netherlands has the ambition to become the European leader of hydrogen deployment within their strategy. The oversea import of hydrogen is highly needed in the future, as it is expected that NW-Europe does not have sufficient renewable energy sources to locally produce the entire hydrogen demand. Due to the extensive gas network and distribution infrastructure, the strategic location of Rotterdam has the potential to become the new hydrogen energy import hub of Europe. As Vopak, world’s leading independent tank storage company, sees opportunities in the large scale import and storage of hydrogen, an evaluation of the entire green liquid hydrogen supply chain is done. In this paper, an evaluation of the green liquid hydrogen supply chain is presented. The literature review of the individual elements led to the construction of the supply chain existing of the consecutive elements: renewable energy generation, electrolyser technology, liquefaction plant, onshore storage, oversea shipping, onshore storage, distribution of hydrogen and consumption by end-users. Within this supply chain, liquid<br/>hydrogen is taken into account due to its favorable volumetric density of 70.8kg/m3. This results in the handling and storage of hydrogen at cryogenic conditions: 20K at a pressure of 1.1 bar. The scope of the project is determined to be from the liquefaction plant to the distribution of the hydrogen into the different transportation modes on the importing terminal. A technical and economic model is created in order to analyse different throughput scenarios. These scenarios transport the hydrogen from a country X in which abundant renewable feedstocks are expected to be produced to the importing location of Rotterdam. By creating and merging a technical and economic model, an in-depth research is conducted. The model determines optimized configurations and their sensitivity for certain throughput scenarios. The technical research led to the following findings: 1. The storage tank has an expected maximal spherical capacity of 40 000m3 with an according BOR of 0.043%/day. If higher capacities are required, the shape<br/>of the tank shifts towards cylindrical structures, due to the vacuum insulation technique. Whenever this capacity is increased, the currently used technology of vacuum MLI is expected to shift towards membrane technology. This is due to that vacuum insulation is not applicable to flat surfaces unless a very thick inner wall is constructed. The exact technology and according BOR of membrane technology is highly proprietary. 2. The liquefaction plant is a mature technology of which the capacity can be easily increased. The current largest plant capacities can be increased from 50tpd to 500tpd, due to easily transportable cold boxes. The current energy consumption of 8kWh/kg can presumably decreased to around 6kWh/kg. Although the minimum capacity of a plant is 20%, the energy consumption is heavily affected. 3. The first oversea LH2 vessel, with a capacity of 1250m3, is currently in its sea trials. Concept designs and interviews led to the perspective that a LH2 vessel of 100 000m3 can be expected in the year 2030. 4. The BOP systems do not exist on industrial scale. Although the handling systems do not exist, the transfer loss during a transfer of a parcel is estimated to be 1.5%. 5. The energy consumption throughout the supply chain shows that the liquefaction plant plays a dominant role. The second most energy intensive process is the oversea shipping. The economic simulations led to the following findings: 1. The LCOH in Rotterdam can decrease to 2.78USD/ kg when a throughput scenario of 3.5Mt/year from the location of Saudi Arabia is realised. 2. The competitiveness tipping point (3.15USD/kg) from the location of Morocco and Saudi Arabia is around 0.35Mt/year. 3. Australia does not reach an economically attractive liquid hydrogen oversea supply chain to Europe, unless the demand highly increases. 4. In small throughput scenarios the storage tank has the most dominant impact on the LCOH. This is due to that the liquefaction plant and ship are scalable to a single unit, while the storage tank has a minimum of three tanks per terminal. The combination of the technical and economic results led to an overall conclusion that a green liquid hydrogen supply chain is economically competitive at a throughput scenario of 0.31Mt/year from Morocco. Although the technical elements within this scenario are currently still in concept phase, expectations look very promising and can be deployed by 2030. Further BOP and handling systems are not yet commercially available, similar expectations are set for the year 2030. Whenever the hydrogen demand in NW-Europe increases, an acceleration of the oversea hydrogen deployment is established. Therefore further research needs to keep a close eye on the technical development of the supply chain.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2027-01-05","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

Plastic is literally everywhere and our modern way of life would not even be possible without it. However, when not managed and treated correctly plastic can affect modern day life significantly posing environmental risks and possible human health issues. Awareness and the demand for solutions is growing but trailed by solid regulations and legislation. Moreover, standardization and general tools for organisational deployment are scarce. This disproportion offers few motivating handles to organisations that might want to contribute solving plastic pollution issues. This study finds its origin in that disproportion and aims to create a framework that assist organisations willing to contribute.<br/><br/>The majority of plastic pollution found in oceans is originally from land. The predominant manners of transport used by pollution are: rivers. Plastic pollution and riverine plastic emission are most dominant in developing countries, particularly in Asia. Opposed to this, the awareness in these countries is generally low compared to that in developed nations. Despite the fact that the plastic pollution is particularly serious in developing countries in Asia, most of the organisations willing to contribute to solving the problem are located elsewhere. This study focuses on Indonesian riverine plastic pollution prevention, with the main research question formulated as follows: What makes a go-to-market strategy viable for deployment of novel river plastic recovery systems in Indonesia? <br/><br/>This thesis gathered data from an extensive literature review, a case study and multiple interviews. The literature review is categorised in riverine plastics, riverine<br/>plastic recovery technology, market theory and sustainable business model innovation and implementation. Within the literature data is sought on technological<br/>aspects that define a riverine recovery system are categorised, benefits and cost of launched systems, general market patterns and sustainable innovation factors. A<br/>case study has been set up to monitor assumptions following the literature review. Within this case study, a specific organisation actively recovering plastic from Indonesia<br/>rivers is analysed in detail. This is done by using the Triple Layered Business Model Canvass.<br/><br/>Parallel to the case study, insights initiate the makings of a framework. The first versions of the framework posted several implications, which have been discussed<br/>with several experts. These interviews provide in-depth insights in the Indonesian business world as a whole and as associated with sustainability. The expert’s view on<br/>riverine recovery have been discussed as well as the validity of the created framework. The interviews lead to extension of the framework as well.<br/><br/>The answer to what viability is in riverine plastic recovery in Indonesia rises from the combination of the case study and the interviews. The first method is an economic<br/>approach where an organisation aims to maximise income, resulting in target customer creativity and often western involvement. The second method is a communal<br/>approach combining environmental with social value. Local involvement is maximised, resulting in a minimisation of cost, both offering views from a different<br/>angle. Ideally, a combination of the two approaches is applied, but practically this is not yet viable. These results are analysed and quantitatively formulated in the<br/>framework.<br/><br/>The results of this report include both theoretical and practical contributions to the search of solving plastic pollution. Theoretically, the framework closes the gap<br/>between available technical literature and the lack of organisational guidance. The practical contribution resides within the easy-to-use design of the framework. It is<br/>designed as a quantitative checklist which managers and organisational leaders can use to assess a project for riverine plastic recovery.<br/><br/>In conclusion, riverine plastic pollution poses a serious risk to the environment and to human health. Finding ways to successfully battle this issue proves to be a<br/>complex endeavour because of the significant differences in respect of economical and social development stages globally. This prevents organisations, who are in<br/>principle willing to contribute, from actually doing so. There are no handles to the decision process, there is no guide.

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Container ships are becoming larger and larger, but also more numerous. As a result, these large ships are pushing their smaller counterparts down the line, until these smaller ships are no longer efficient for trade routes. The focus area of this thesis is on the North Sea and Baltic Sea area, in particular the area between the West coast of Norway to the Russian part of the Gulf of Finland, with most countries in between with feeder activities between them and North European gateway hubs. This area is seeing an increase in port development. As a result, routes that container ships take are being changed. Either larger ships are coming into the region and stopping at more ports, or they are utilised as feeder ships in the region. This thesis aims to investigate the cascading effect of container ships, regarding the choice of feeder ships between German North Sea ports and feeder destinations in Scandinavian countries and countries on the Baltic Sea. To achieve this, an optimisation model is created that calculates differing total costs for container ships with capacities ranging between 200 and 5000 Twenty-foot Equivalent Units (TEU) in the region. This is done by assigning ships to container flows from German North Sea ports to feeder ports in the region, and allowing the model to choose which arcs are used to fulfil the container inflow of the destination ports. To analyse the impact of each ship type regarding the total cost of their routes taken, ship types are tested separately. Experiments have been run for increasing bunker costs based on existing data, for increasing amounts of container inflows, and decreasing the number of ports based on an increase of minimum container inflow.<br/>The results of the experiments varying bunker costs show the total cost to fulfil all container inflows for each feeder ship type is highly dependent on its utilisation of the Kiel Canal. The Kiel Canal restricts the choice of ships with capacities larger than 1250 TEU. The extra time spent for sailing around the Northern tip of Denmark has a negative effect on the largest ships chosen for this thesis. For an increasing bunker cost, a 1500 TEU capacity ship is hindered more negatively than a 5000 TEU ship due to the Kiel Canal. For variations in volume of container flows, the same impact of the Kiel Canal is also seen. However, total costs start to favour the largest ships chosen, with the largest capacity ship (5000 TEU) having the lowest total costs calculated for a 300\% of the original chosen container flows. For decreasing the number of ports from the set based on their container inflow, the largest capacity ships have the lowest total costs from a minimum container inflow of around 400 TEU per week. From this, with current flows and within the near future, it is estimated that the current fleet of around 1000 - 1250 TEU capacity container ships will maintain their position within the North Sea and Baltic Sea region. However, for routes with a substantial container flow volume, larger capacity ships are estimated to be more cost competitive than their smaller counterparts. <br/>This conclusion is based on experiments with only one ship size available for all container flows, with the assumption that all chosen ships are not restricted by berth sizes in ports. Furthermore, all flows originate from German North Sea ports. Recommendations for future research should take all chosen ship types into consideration for arc-flow pairing, and have more origins for container flows. If all ship types are taken into consideration, size restrictions of ports and transshipment between ship types should also be implemented. Origins included should include other major hubs in the region, as well as from outside the region, as an incoming flow. This would allow for an investigation into large container ships sailing between the current chosen origin hub and large ports, and the consequence on the region as a whole.<br","Feeder Vessel; Container shipping; Baltic Sea; North Sea; Network design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Marine Technology","",""

During a storm that took place in September 2019, over 300 mil- limetres of rain fell in just five hours. Throughout the 2019 flooding event, the Rambla de la Carrasquilla has overflowed its banks and the adjacent agricultural lands flooded and large amounts of water ac- cumulated in the streets of Los Nietos. Since the 2019 flood, improvements to the river system of the Rambla de la Carrasquilla have been made. For instance: a relatively small culvert was replaced with a bigger one in 2021, to increase the discharge capacity. Due to global warming, the probability of occurrence of the heavy storms will increase and thus the probability of flooding. However, the lack of historical data makes it hard to assess the influence of different storms and the replacement of the cul- vert on future floods. Numerical models can be used to make predictions of floodings and gain insight in storm impacts. The aim of this report is summarized by the question: How can the flood areas and peak water levels of the Rambla de la Carrasquilla and its catchment be obtained by simulating three different scenarios based on peak discharges using HEC-RAS models?. At first a spatial analysis of the river system was done using QGIS. Hereafter a 1D and 2D model were constructed with the help of a Digital Terrain Model (DTM). QGIS and RiverGIS were used to define the geometry of the system for the 1D model, where the 2D model geometry was constructed in HEC-RAS itself. The dimensions of the structures in the river were measured using photogrammetry, due to which dimensions could be obtained with an absolute error of around 2 cm. Fieldwork was carried out to estimate the surface roughness of the main channel and parts of the flood plains.<br/>The results consist of different floodmaps that were made using 1D and 2D HEC-RAS models with different settings and boundary conditions. For the 1D model, one run was done using a single reach for the whole river and another including a bifurcation for the downstream part of the river. It can be concluded that the 1D model approach is not very suitable for our research as it is unable to accurately construct the flooded areas. The 2D model performed better and thus was used to further investigate the influence of different model parameters and inputs. Important take-away points are that the time step is of large influence for finding a stable solution, which is found around Δ&#x1d461; = 1 [second] in this report. The influence of the surface roughness of the river bed and floodplains was investigated by using Manning’s n. These results showed clearly that a higher value for Manning’s n leads to a larger flooded area. When investigating the influence of structures (two bridges, a pipeline and a culvert) on the flooded area, it is found that the structures do not have a great influence. The reason for this is that at critical points, the river already overflows its banks when the flow is not hindered by these structures. Adding the structures makes this only slightly worse. Furthermore, the 2021 culvert only showed a slight improvement in flooded area with respect to the 2019 culvert.<br/>In order to further calibrate the HEC-RAS models, a comparison was made with floodmaps that were constructed by the Spanish government. Both studies show similar results, although the government used a Digital Terrain Model with a higher resolution, which can have a large impact on the outcome. However, this government study cannot be used for validation of the models in this research, as the results are based on hypothetical situations instead of empirical data as well.<br/>For further research it is recommended to investigate more accurate hydrological boundary conditions, based on empirical rainfall data. For both boundary conditions a constant value was taken, but the behaviour over time could change the output of the results. Besides that, it could be interesting to study the exact effect of using a Digital Terrain Model with a higher resolution for the Rambla de la Carrasquilla. As this can have a direct influence on the size of the flooded area. Furthermore, the approaches used in this research can be used for investigating different flood mitigation solutions. These solutions, for example heightening of the river banks or widening of the bed, can be implemented in the 2D model before applying them in real life.","MDP; Modelling; HEC-RAS","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","Multidiscipinary Project",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Numerical solving a full order model can be computationally and time expensive. For real time control problems, it may be infeasible to solve full order models. Reduced order models can be used in order to reduce the time and computational cost while maintaining a high enough accuracy. In this thesis, it will be researched if a convolutional autoencoder based reduced order model is a feasible reduced order modelling method. Reduced order models will be constructed and applied for three different steady state neutron diffusion problems. Every autoencoder receives full order model solutions at its input. Convolutional layers are employed to process the high dimensional input to lower layers. The encoder will map the input data to the low dimensional latent space. The decoder will subsequently reconstruct the high dimensional input at its output from the low dimensional latent space. The latent space between the encoder and decoder forces the autoencoder to capture all necessary information in the few latent variables in such a way that the decoder can reconstruct the full order solution as good as possible. In order to find the optimal values for the model parameters, the autoencoder is trained on a set of full order solutions via gradient descent. After the training, the decoder can be used separately to map from the latent variables to the full order solutions. By joining the decoder with a regression model from the full order model parameters to the latent variables, one can find the full order solution without having to use a full order model solution method, like the finite element approach. In this thesis, a multivariate polynomial regression model is used for the regression from the full order model parameters to the latent variables. The convolutional autoencoder based reduced order model which incorporates residual blocks and parallel residual blocks in its structure, managed to outperform its proper orthogonal decomposition based counterpart by having an approx. 2.5 smaller mean squared error and a 1.4 times smaller mean absolute error. This shows that the proposed method is feasible in terms of prediction performance. Research should be done on the feasibility in terms of the computational costs and time costs. Additional recommendations are the extension of the proposed method to time dependent problems and the application to problems which are harder to capture with proper orthogonal decomposition based models.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Physics","",""

There are various techniques to remove arsenic from drinking water like membrane filtration, electro-coagulation, filtration, adsorption and ion exchange. Among these the iron electro-coagulation technique of arsenic removal is one such technique which can be done by electrochemically generating oxidizing compounds like<br/>hydrogen peroxide, H2O2. Instead of dosing H2O2 anaerobically, it can be generated before the aeration step and can improve the As(III) oxidation with the groundwater native Fe(II).<br/><br/>The in-situ electrochemical generation of H2O2 was done by means of an air-cathode reactor setup, which reduces atmospheric oxygen O2 to H2O2, under anoxic water. This H2O2 then reacts with ferrous iron, Fe(II) to produce ferric iron Fe(III) and reactive oxidizing species(ROS)/intermediate products/fenton products. These ROS mainly form poorly ordered solids, which have higher adsorption capacities than the products of aeration. The oxidation of<br/>As(III) is 4 times more by H2O2, than the oxidation by O2.<br/><br/>By varying the applied charge dosage (CD) and the rate of dosage (Charge Dosage Rate, CDR),the faradaic efficiencies of both Fe and H2O2 were analyzed. It was found that as the CDR increased, the overall faradaic efficiency of H2O2 generation also increased from 76.32% to 92.07%. However, there might have been discrepancies in the faradaic efficiencies of Fe due to acid &amp; base dilutions, human errors or the difference in the operational values of the current. In theory, 1 mole of H2O2 oxidizes 2 moles of Fe(II), and in the absence of O2 the main Fe(II)-oxidant is the generated H2O2.","","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Environmental Engineering","",""

However, it depends on the interpretation, the actions the creators take, if this potential is utilised. The goal of this project is to create a toolkit that supports the green pioneers of Rotterdam in their actions to improve their contribution in addressing their local climate challenges.<br/><br/>I research the green pioneers of Rotterdam, to figure out how they approach their projects, why they are involved, and what they do exactly. Moreover, I investigate their current contribution to the local climate challenges and how this can be improved. Therefore, I conduct different explorations, including three case studies in which I meet three initiators who are involved in a green initiative in the city. This resulted in the following main insights. 1) the most promising challenge for green pioneers to improve their contribution in, is the mitigation of biodiversity decline. This challenge is therefore chosen as a focus for this project. 2) Most green pioneers want to contribute to biodiversity where they can, but are not always aware when they are able to do so and how. 3) Green pioneers can improve the contribution to biodiversity with their green initiative, by adopting an ecological gardening behaviours. <br/><br/>By analysing the difference between ecological gardening and current behaviours, I arrived at four options in which the design can help improve the contribution of the green pioneers of Rotterdam:<br/><br/>1) By providing green pioneers and the citizens they influence inspiration on possible actions and their ecological effect<br/>2) By stimulating green pioneers to make decisions with a focus on the effects on animals and plants.<br/>3) By broadening the perspective of green pioneers and the citizens they influence by including unfamiliar/unattractive animal- and plant species.<br/>4) By encouraging an interplay-experience between the actions of green pioneers and the input of natural processes.<br/><br/>These four solution spaces lead to the development of a toolkit concept.

In cities across the world, strategies are put in place to improve existing cycling infrastructure. This raises the question of how cyclists move through a city and what part of the road network attracts the most cyclists. Prior studies on cycling behaviour have revealed that cyclists prefer routes that require less turns, over separated bicycle paths, smoother street surface materials like asphalt or concrete. Furthermore, dense and mixed-use neighbourhoods seem to attract more active travel. This research will analyse correlations between spatial characteristics and cycling route choices in Amsterdam. <br/>Space Syntax is an analysis method that studies the urban morphology of a city. Until recently, the implementation of Space Syntax has mainly focused on the analysis of pedestrian flows, with a limited number of studies applying the methodology to cyclist behaviour. This master thesis presents exploratory research into the application of Space Syntax – in combination with other built environment characteristics – to study cyclist route choice. GPS data from the 2016 Bicycle Counting Week shows the cycling counts of every street segment. <br/>A linear regression analysis found that “through-movement potential” represented by Normalised Angular Choice (NACH) explained more than 22% of variance in cycling activity. The results indicate that Space Syntax is an interesting indicator to locate which street segments could potentially see large numbers of cyclists. More research encompassing multiple cities in a variety of different contexts is recommended, as Amsterdam is a city with a rich cycling culture that spans multiple decades, making it difficult to generalize any conclusions. <br","Cycling route choices; Linear regression; Space Syntax; Revealed preference data","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Metropolitan Analysis, Design and Engineering (MADE)","",""

In this thesis it is argued that the current monitoring techniques come with limitations and subsequently solutions are presented to come to a more complete picture of water access.<br/><br/>Monitoring safe water access happens primarily through household health surveys. These surveys are often incomplete, not covering entire nations, focus on only the primary water source and are often spatially aggregated for privacy reasons. Besides, health surveys almost never include questions on consumed water volumes while that is an important indicator for proper hygiene (WELL, 1998), and something that, at the same time, should be in balance with the natural available water resources. Next to this survey based monitoring, there is the Water Point Data Exchange (WPDx) that monitors safe access by providing a platform at which the exact location and type of water access points (such as boreholes, springs, etc.) are registered. This does give more insight into the presence and usage of a variety of sources, but also the WPDx is often incomplete: not covering entire nations.<br/><br/>In this thesis we present a dual methodology that gap-fills the incompleteness of the WPDx database through modeling and in parallel, researches the complex local dynamics of water access, the variety of water sources used by households and the relationships between access and water consumption by means of a household survey.<br/><br/>By improving a machine learning biological species modeling technique (called MaxEnt), successful predictions on the number of presences of eight different water access types across Uganda were made, also into areas that have little presence in the WPDx data. It was found that population density, precipitation, elevation, poverty and groundwater storage are important indicators for the (non)presence of water access points. <br/><br/>Next to modeling, a survey campaign was executed in Bushenyi-Ishaka municipality, a mid-sized town in the South West of Uganda comprising a mixture of both urban and rural areas. This was done in collaboration with Makerere University (Kampala). The survey results showed that water consumption increases with education and wealth, but also with higher number of water point presences predicted by the model. It was also found that households in Bushenyi make use of an average of two different water sources on a regular basis and often express preference for sources off premises compared to on premises (piped) for both cost and perceived quality reasons.<br/><br/>Lastly, modi operandi were suggested for the results to improve water access such as prioritising areas with poor(est) water access and investing in rainwater harvesting, infrastructure and education.","Water; water access; water consumption; Uganda; Bushenyi; African Water Corridor; Machine learning; presence only; survey; MaxEnt; Neural Networks; Modeling; Makerere University","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-09-03","","","","Civil Engineering","African Water Corridor (AWC) project","-0.5408687736206675, 30.159213434825606"

With a large share of its population centers located below sea level, in so-called polders, the need for flood protection systems quickly becomes apparent. This need is even more pressing with the rise of sea levels and the increase in river discharge variability due to the onset of climate change. To future proof themselves, the Netherlands needs to maintain and strengthen their flood defences. Especially precar- ious is the situation for polders, which are low-laying areas protected by one or more dikes. From a technical perspective, the feasibility of the polder system has been proven to withstand the expected water level rise as result of climate change for at least 2 to 3 meters sea level rise, shown by Kok et al. (2008). However, research into the economic perspective on the feasibility of the polder concept has been less extensive.<br/><br/>To more accurately determine the economic viability of the Dutch polder concept, additions to the research of Eijgenraam are proposed that fill in the current knowledge gaps. The result of this research is a mathematical framework for the optimization of dike reinforcements in two dimensions, the lifetime of the structure and the crest height increase of the dike. The framework consist of a discounted Cost-Benefit Analysis with a financial constraint and a constraint on the maximum allowable time before reinforcement is needed. This framework contains stochastic elements in it’s parameters and a stochastic model for the discount rate. The derived framework was subsequently used to analyse two case studies based on regions in the Netherlands. The two case studies were based on the dikering of IJsselmonde (dikering 17) and the dikering of Walcheren (dikering 29). The results were determined for the two climate scenario’s posed by the IPCC and KNMI by means of a Monte Carlo simulation.<br/><br/>This research has opened up the possibility to compare alternatives over different time periods and re- inforcement measures with different constraints and stochastic parameters, adding to the work done by Eijgenraam. As such, a more risk-informed discussion on the general viability of the polderconcept can be had, ultimately resulting in a more informed decision on the future of the polders in the Netherlands.","Cost-Benefit Analysis; Monte Carlo simulation; Flood Risk; Optimization; Feasibility assessment","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering | Hydraulic Structures and Flood Risk","",""

Nevertheless, these systems suffer from additional noise sources, such as movement artifacts (MA).<br/>Several adaptive (AF) algorithms have been proposed in the literature to suppress movement artifacts from ECG without consistent results. Adaptive algorithms for signal enhancement require a reference signal correlated with the noise and not correlated with the signal of interest. This correlation can change significantly depending on the absolute and relative location of the electrodes and the location of the reference sensor (i.e., accelerometer, gyroscope); objectively measuring the correlation is not a trivial problem.<br/>For this reason, first, we used an algorithm to obtain a rough estimate of the movement artifacts from the recorded ECG to calculate the correlation between them and the available reference signals (three-axis accelerometer and three-axis gyroscope) and selected the one with the highest correlation. Then, we compare three adaptive filter algorithms using the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) coefficient as the evaluation parameter.<br/>Methods: For testing the implemented adaptive filters, first, we used a simulated signal, then data from an openonline database, and last, a single lead ECG wearable device called AFi® (Praxa Sense™, The Netherlands) with an embedded IMU. To induce the movement artifacts in a controlled setting, participants performed a set of predefined movements within three intensities; high (running, jumping), moderate (torso rotations, pushups), and low (walking). Then we analyzed the recorded data offline as follows:<br/>1. Test the correlation between noise and the IMU components, and select the component with the highest correlation to be used as a reference input for the adaptive filters.<br/>2. Compare three adaptive filters in terms of SNR improvement; the Least means squares (LMS), the Normalized least means squares (NLMS), and the Recursive least squares RLS.<br/>3. Filter the selected reference input with wavelet decomposition, and test if there is a filter performance improvement in SNR.<br/>Results: The implemented adaptive filters performed as expected with the simulated signals, but they showed very poor results once we used them on real data.<br/>The RLS filter showed superior performance than the least mean squares-based filters in terms of convergence speed and the root mean squared error minimization. Nevertheless, it requires a high correlation (ρ) above ρ&gt;0.8 between the reference input and the undesired signal or noise to provide a proper signal enhancement and morphology recovery.<br/>The low correlation between the movement artifacts and the components of the IMU used as a reference input for the adaptive filters affected the filter performance heavily. Filtering the reference input with the wavelet decomposition did not improve the correlation or the filter performance.<br/>Conclusions The correlation between ECG motion artifacts and movement recorded with inertial sensors appeared to be low and inconsistent. Given this, adaptive filters using inertial sensors as reference input are unsuitable for removing ECG movement artifacts.","Adaptive Filtering; Signal Processing; LMS","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Access to healthcare is a requirement for human well-being that is partly dependent upon safe infrastructure. One of the UN Sustainable Development Goals regarding healthcare is to achieve universal healthcare coverage, which includes access to qual- ity essential health-care services. In many developing nations, roads are often vulner- able to floods. Floods can cause roads (especially roads with a dirt or gravel surface type) to become inaccessible for a long period of time. This inaccessibility can cause many inhabitants to lose access to a healthcare facility within a crucial traveling time span. Upgrading flood prone roads on which many households are dependent in or- der to access a healthcare facility, could reduce this threat to healthcare accessibility for many inhabitants. This research aims to use optimization techniques to reduce the impact floods can have on healthcare accessibility, and apply a case study to the country Timor-Leste. We formulate an optimization model that maximises the num- ber of households that can access a healthcare facility within a 5 kilometer traveling distance via a flood resilient route, given a specific budget. Alongside this formula- tion, we provide a (simple) flood and costs model for the road as well as di↵erent heuristics to find (near-)optimal solutions. Our research includes multiple tests to de- termine which heuristic works best and which parameters and other settings increase the computational performance of these heuristics for Timor-Leste. The heuristic that performs the best is a dynamic greedy heuristic. This algorithm is able to generate an optimal solution for all possible budgets within 4 hours.","Optimization; Healthcare; floods; healthcare accessibility; road; network; road network; timor-leste; east-timor","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics","Analytics for a Better World","-8.874200, 125.727500"

I explain how VCs perform fair value estimations of software start-ups with the emerging comparable analysis technique. Furthermore, this study examines the relative importance of start-up characteristics in determining the multiple and how these factors influence the VC’s valuation behaviour. Additionally, I explore whether this behaviour and the multiples paid can be explained by differences in VC firm experience at a time of historically low interest rates and record-breaking fund inflows. Based on 36 interviews with European VCs, primarily from the Benelux region, I find that all start-up characteristics matter in the determination of the multiple, but the management team a little more. As a result, software VCs are willing to pay higher multiples for stellar management teams than for exceptional business characteristics. In contrast with the other characteristics, poor traction does not necessarily kill the deal, but VCs might rather use it to enforce a lower valuation. Overall, VC firm experience is not a strong predictor of the valuation behaviour and ARR multiples paid for deals. However, I do find that more experienced VCs are willing to pay higher premiums for benchmark-exceeding traction than their less experienced counterparts.","Venture Capial; Start-up; software; Valuation; Comparable analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

Among other properties, graphene has excellent tensile strength, electrical and thermal conductivity and can be used as catalyst. Graphene has no shortage of applications, but large scale production methods are yet to be developed. LPE is a promising method, in which the layers that make up graphite are separated to produce graphene in a liquid medium. However, the flakes that are produced are polydispersed in size and thickness, which leads to the need for size selection. Current studies have achieved size selection with centrifugation. However, centrifugation has thus far been a trial and-error procedure, without understanding the underlying physics and statistics. This research focuses on creating a rational basis by combining experiments with simulations based on fluid dynamics and statistics. By combining results from simulations and experiments we are able to arrive at the size distributions of initial stock dispersion of graphene that was made from LPE. The simulations entail plate particle settling in a tube, where randomly generated polydisperse particles are randomly distributed in a tube. Stokes settling velocity is assumed for each particle. In parallel to this, we perform sedimentation experiments of stock dispersion at fixed relative centrifugal force (RCF) for different times. From the experiments we know the mass transfer from the supernatant to the sediment and the average thickness of the plates in the supernatant. Both these experimental results allow us to narrow the initial particle size distributions we assumed in the simulations. Thus we have developed a technique based on simple experiments and simulations that gives great insight into particle size distribution without having to perform tedious characterization such as AFM or TEM. Once the particle size distribution is known for a specific LPE protocol, it will allow the likes of both industry and academia to standardize graphene quality.<br","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Bioreceptivity is when materials are being colonized by one or more species of living organisms without necessarily going under biodeterioration. (Guillitte, 1995) Based on the literature, bioreceptivity depends on three main factors: on climatic conditions, the topology of the colonized element and the material. <br/>By considering these variables, this research focuses on engineering a workflow capable of supporting bioreceptivity-oriented design. More specifically, it investigates how computational performance analysis and optimization can support the integration of bioreceptive materials in customizable building elements, which could be produced by digital fabrication. <br/>For research purposes, the research is split in two main parts which run in parallel. This research takes as a case study mosses, which generally cannot withstand high solar radiation and are dependent on water for their survival and reproduction. <br/>The first part, investigates on a digital model, how surface topology modifications could improve bioreceptivity by reducing the solar radiation of a surface while directing water over them. This is approached by a script which examines through a case study, to what extent the solar radiation of a surface topology could be reduced through topological modifications and which factors influence it. Even if the average solar radiation of the case study was significantly reduced through an optimization process, it is not clear to what degree topology can contribute to the improvement of bioreceptivity because this fact can only be validated physically. <br/>The second part, focuses on lime-based mortars and examines how their composition can affect bioreceptivity. Based on the literature, material properties like high water capacity, high water retention, permeability and high total porosity can benefit bioreceptivity. Four different lime-based mortars were tested, through laboratory experiments, seeking the relation between their water transport behavior and bioreceptivity. Grain size distribution in combination with binder to aggregate ratio are the main factors which influence mortars’ transport behavior. In order to observe the relation between their water transport behavior and bioreceptivity, a moss growth experiment was conducted in a controlled environment. The short timeframe of the experiment makes it difficult to draw definitive conclusions.<br/>The methodology that was developed in these two parts, is finally attempted to be combined in a bioreceptivity-oriented design approach in order to express a new architectural vocabulary. Through a research-by-design approach, three design approaches are conceptualized, compared and prototyped, raising the potential of bioreceptive applications.","Bioreceptive; Bioreceptivity; Sustainability; Digital Fabrication; Mortar; lime-based mortars; Moss; Biophilic Design; Data-driven Approach; additive manufacturing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Building Technology","",""

However, storing sensitive data remotely poses privacy threats for the data owners. Searchable encryption (SE) is a technique that allows performing search queries over encrypted data. The majority of SE solutions model the server as an honest-but-curious entity. If this is not the case, the results of the queries might not be reliable. The issue can be mitigated by implementing SE within blockchain technology. This paper proposes a searchable encryption scheme that uses smart contracts in Hyperledger Fabric. For storing a set of documents securely, the data owner chooses an identifying keyword for each document. The identifying keywords and documents ids are stored in a matrix that facilitates keyword search; consequently, the matrix is appended to the ledger. For retrieving a document, the data owner builds an encrypted query (trapdoor) using the identifying keyword; the trapdoor is passed to the smart contract. Thus, the data owner delegates the smart contract to perform the query on their behalf. The data owner receives the document id, which can then be used to retrieve the respective content. The proposed protocol achieves faster data pre-processing, i.e., matrix computation, when the number of documents is smaller. The file size does not affect the time efficiency of the scheme. Nonetheless, the execution time for pre-processing increases with regard to the number of documents. As a result, the system is Input/Output (I/O) Bound.","searchable encryption; Hyperledger Fabric; smart contract; trapdoor; data search","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science and Engineering","CSE3000 Research Project",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","The International Red Cross Red Crescent Movement, ‘The Movement’, is the world’s largest humanitarian network. More than 50% of the 14 million active volunteers are youth volunteers. These youth volunteers play vital roles in humanitarian action and development around the world by addressing needs in their communities. To develop the potential of these youth volunteers and enhance their collective impact, The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) launched an IFRC Youth Innovation Academy: Limitless. Limitless offers youth volunteers a theoretical introduction to the design process and financial support for the development of their ideas. Applying for the programme starts with the introduction of a COVID-19 related problem, followed by a number of workshops to guide projects of the youth volunteers. <br/><br/>This thesis examines whether the design of the Limitless program matched its aim of fostering humanitarian innovation, and based on the research conducted it presents a new human-centered curriculum design to foster innovation through a strong focus on problem framing. This bridges the gap between the (currently unanswered) human perspective and the incentive to facilitate innovation from within the IFRC.<br/><br/>From extensive literature and empirical research it can be concluded that the current programme lacks multiple components necessary for successful facilitation of innovation. Foremost, the initial challenges presented by the youth volunteers were often found to be too broad and ill-defined, therefore making it difficult to come up with a solution within the scope of the programme. Resulting from these initial findings, thorough research on how to facilitate innovation was carried out. Based on this a set of design guidelines and barriers for innovation was formulated. These guidelines formed the starting point of the concept design.<br/><br/>The design phase explored how a strategically designed solution can complement the currently missing components of the Limitless programme. An overarching platform is proposed, which aims to stimulate interaction between multiple stakeholders and creates more growth potential for the youth volunteers’ projects. The first module within the action-oriented curriculum presented via the platform emphasizes <br/>problem framing. A deeper dive into theory and practice around this resulted in a novel workshop format for which a back-end flowchart and a front-end digital prototype were developed. The concept was iterated upon multiple times, in order to create a format that best meets the needs of the youth volunteers. Validation with youth volunteers suggests that the novel workshop does indeed improve the ability to create a well-framed problem statement. <br/><br/>This research contributes to the IFRC’s ambition to support young innovators in their innovation journey. It also highlights more generally how humanitarian innovation can be improved and how growth potential can be designed. For future implementation and further development of the curriculum, a selection of recommendations is presented.","Human Centred Design; Problem framing; Humanitarian innovation; Youth volunteers; Design curriculum","en","master thesis","","","","","","Here you can find the link to the digital prototype: https://xd.adobe.com/view/d4beec6d-99a2-4fe9-910d-fcfab5ba068f-81ed/?fullscreen&hints=off","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

This is the clitoris, which is by no means just a little (apparently difficult to find) knob above the vaginal opening, but is a large and complex organ located beneath the skin‘s surface. A more or less fun fact, for example, is that it was not until 1998 that the complete anatomy of the clitoris was revealed in a study by the Australian urologist Helen O‘Connell (Fyfe, 2018). In fact, most anatomical books don‘t even show the clitoris and therefore not depicting the vulva correctly. Let that sink in.<br/>Conversations about sexuality, well-being or pleasure find no place and lead to misconceptions, rumours and often leave people wondering „Am I normal?“. <br/>This thesis aims to answer the question “How might a concept car look like for Yoni” as means of process and deliverable exploration for The Young.<br/>In essence this thesis is about the world and future of vulvas and which role Yoni could play to ultimately facilitate positive change in people’s lives. <br/>To explore this notion the method of developing a “concept car” was used to deliver a tangible representation of this future brand scenario. <br/>And because the social climate is changing and brands are increasingly acting as amplifiers of cultural trends and the introduction of questions and topics into the mainstream of society. At this point Yoni joins the conversation. Yoni has been offering organic 100% cotton period products since 2015 after the founder found that the products recommended to her by her gynaecologist were not only unavailable to the majority of consumers but regular period products did not list their ingredients and were full of synthetic fibres. <br/>That‘s why Yoni made it its mission to offer better products, products one would trust to touch their most intimate body part. Yoni wanted to change the market for more transparency and a higher standard of menstrual products and has achieved this, especially in recent years. Big brands are now also offering organic alternatives, explaining the ingredients of their products on the packaging or at least online and other brands have followed Yoni‘s lead. But with the constant fulfilment of the initial mission, it is time to find a new drive, a new vision.<br/>And the time is ripe to do so, people are excited and ready to overcome their inhibitions and have meaningful conversations about their vulvas, and are eager for opportunities to learn. And the market is not yet oversaturated with offerings.<br/>To answer the question of what exactly happens in the world of the vulva, this work started with in-depth research both in an interview study and in extensive literature and media research. It was about exploring the behaviour, feelings, culture, history and economy regarding vulvas and menstruation.<br/>The market, consumer and context research resulted in four distinct directions Yoni could follow in the future to have a positive impact on their users‘ lives. These directions were about pushing the menstruation conversation in society further, for more social justice, to build strong communities of people with vulvas to overcome gaps of knowledge and wisdom, to unlock knowledge about hormonal cycles beyond the binary view of period on-period off and finally to discover how to bring vulva care to the forefront of people’s attention to share knowledge, facilitate experiences and overcome bodily shame.<br/>In close collaboration with Yoni one direction was chosen as the means for Yoni to facilitate meaningful positive impact in the lives of their users and subsequently use this direction as a vehicle for organisational transformation and future vision.<br/>This direction is called “vulva care” and targets the redefinition of what true vulva care might mean on a time axis of 1 to 5 years. At the end of this axis stands the concept product of vulvovaginal microbiome testing and personalised vulvar care products which acts as a beacon for creative brand development. <br/>To make this concept product more accessible from an organisational point of view, the product was contextualised in a three step roadmap showcasing three distinct steps on how the company might develop for their current offering and structure towards a focus on vulvovaginal care using digital and care products infused with science and technology to ultimately future-proof a brand with incredible potential.<br/>At the final pages of the report you will find the translation of this concept product into a website and digital product prototype illustrating how Yoni’s brand future might look like.<br","vulva care; brand development; concept car design; femcare","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

The tool combines a high-fidelity large-eddy simulation code with an immersed boundary method, a multibody solver and a loose coupling scheme between fluid and solid. The development of the code is motivated by the need to accurately and efficiently simulate aircraft flight dynamics at off-design conditions, such as in separated flow states. The accurate simulations are necessary for the continuous optimization of current aircraft designs and the development of novel aircraft concepts. The developments presented in this thesis focus on three fields of the fluid-structure interaction problem. The modeling of solid geometries in the fluid solver through an immersed boundary method, the coupling of the fluid and solid domain through a loose coupling scheme, and the development of a multi-body solver for the simulation of aircrafts and their components. An extensive literature review is presented on these three fields of the fluid-structure interaction problem. The literature review is conducted to select appropriate methods for the final solver. Based on this review, a ghost-cell approach is selected for the immersed boundary method of the solver. A loosely coupled serial staggered procedure is selected to couple the fluid and solid domains in the solver. The floating frame of reference approach is selected for the derivation of the multi-body solver and a Newmark time integration method is selected for the integration of the equations of motion. The mathematical formulation of the selected methods is presented. Novel approaches are derived for the immersed boundary method and multi-body solver. A hybrid-cell treatment is derived to reduce spurious numerical oscillations in flow fields with moving geometries. Further, the integration of wall-modeling approaches into the ghost-cell immersed boundary method is presented. A controller approach based on the time integration scheme of the multi-body solver is derived. The controller allows user-prescribed dynamic positions and orientations of constraints and bodies. The developed fluid-structure interaction solver has been rigorously verified and validated for multiple test cases. Simulations of an oscillating cylinder and moving airfoil are presented for the verification of the hybrid-cell treatment. Results with hybrid-cell treatment enabled and disabled demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed approach v vi Summary in the suppression of spurious oscillations in the flow field. Simulations of a single and double pendulum are presented to verify the implementation of the multi-body equations of motion and constraints. The validation of the developed solver is performed with reference numerical and experimental results. Results of the laminar flow around an in-line oscillating cylinder are in excellent agreement with available numerical and experimental reference results. Simulations of the dynamic stall problem of helicopter blade sections are presented. The results show that the solver accurately predicts the flow features of the dynamic stall problem. Discrepancies between the present code and the available numerical and experimental results are attributed to an insufficient modeling and resolution of the near-wall flow field. Last but not least, flutter of a two degree of freedom NACA0012 airfoil is simulated. The developed solver accurately predicts the presence of stable, limit cycle and flutter regions. Discrepancies were found in the response frequencies between the results of the present code and available numerical and experimental results. The discrepancies are caused by insufficient resolution of the near-wall flow field. The verification and validation simulations proof the effectiveness of the derived methods and the correct implementation. The validation results further show that the solver accurately and efficiently predicts the flow field of complex flows and fluid-structure interaction problems.","high-fidelity; aero-servo-elasticity; Fluid-structure interaction; fluid-solid coupling; large-eddy simulation; ghost-cell; Immersed boundary method; wall modelled large eddy simulation; Rigid Body; multi body; oscillating cylinder; dynamic stall; Transitional Reynolds number; Low Reynolds number; high Reynolds number; limit cycle oscillations; Flutter","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-03-18","","","","Aerospace Engineering | Aerodynamics","",""

Nowadays, haptic shared control systems are often tuned heuristically and there is little knowledge on how to set the design parameters. In this research a novel driver model was used to generate human-compatible references for the haptic controller with a moderate amount of curve-cutting. In a driving simulator study with different levels of haptic support (LoHS) it is found that driver acceptance increases with higher LoHS values up to 1. In this implementation a higher LoHS equates to stronger steering angle feedforward. Objective driver acceptance is measured by analyzing the torque conflict data and the total conflict is found to decrease by 70% for the highest LoHS condition compared to the lowest setting. This result is verified with higher subjective ratings of the haptic support as the LoHS is increased. The required driver steering effort decreases significantly for higher LoHS values with a reduction of 81% for the highest LoHS condition compared to manual driving. Likewise a small decrease in the steering wheel reversal rate is found as the haptic support is increased. Under high LoHS values the remaining torque conflict is found in the curve entry and exit phases. The addition of individualised prepositioning into the reference has the potential to reduce the remaining conflict. The findings suggest that choosing the right LoHS is of great importance in achieving high acceptance and should thus be the first parameter to be tuned for a haptic controller of the four design choices architecture type.","Haptic Shared Control; Acceptance; Steering support; Design choices","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-07-12","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

The world is always changing, therefore the Netherlands, together with many countries, has to adapt constantly to the climate. This constant change means that in particular the coastline of the Netherlands requires extra attention because of the uncertainty of sea level rise. The Dutch coastline is protected by means of a static approach. However the intention for the future is to apply an adaptable design to better handle sea level rise. This report focuses on a method that uses a dynamic approach with the aim of keeping the Netherlands protected against rising sea levels that are uncertain. This dynamic approach consist of several pathways that each consist of different actions. With the help of evaluation-criteria, the pathways in the dynamic approach are evaluated. The outcome of this evaluation is described and recommendations for future research are given.<br/><br/>The report focuses on keeping the coastline of the south-west of the Netherlands protected against the uncertainty of the rising sea. This will be done with the help of a dynamic approach. First, an area analysis was carried out to find out what aspects should be given the most attention. After that, the method of DAPP is used to function as a dynamic approach. This Dynamic Adaptive Pathway Policy is then used to implement the different pathways in a structured way. These pathways are made up of different actions. These actions are existing plans presented by Deltares and they form a big list. Not all plans do function properly in order to function as a flood protection and so a selection method is used to extract the right plans out of this list. The requirements that are used to select the right plans have its main focus on protecting the hinterland against sea level rise, storm surge and wave load. The extracted plans that function as an action are implemented in the different pathways of the DAPP. To evaluate these pathways, evaluation-criteria are used in a Multi Criteria Analysis. These criteria are extracted from sources like a stakeholder analysis, old and new watermasters and a brainstorm session with the group members who act through their own accumulated expertise. The extracted criteria in combination with determined weighting factors are placed in a Multi Criteria Analysis after which the pathways have been assessed individually. This evaluation process led to some pathways being iterated to a different shape for the final design of the DAPP.<br/><br/>From the project can be concluded that the DAPP approach works well to combine different static plans into a comprehensive mitigation strategy. Secondly the evaluation criteria can be successfully derived from the old and new watermasters. The old watermasters already have one or more of their plans implemented. The new watermasters, are working on flood protection plans for the future in their daily life and have a lot of experience in the current engineering field. From the stakeholder analyses, the criteria can also be derived but than from the perspective of a variety of stakeholders. Thirdly, organizing criteria using a PESTLE (Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Environmental) and objectives tree has significant benefits for determining weighting factors. At last, it can be concluded that the main requirements used in this project are a good starting point, but they are only focused on reducing the flood risk (only technology). To select plans on a wider perspective(also Political, Economic, Social, Legal and Environmental), it is recommended to take a closer look to requirements from that perspectives. Advised is to consult experts in those fields to help with that.","","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Structures","",""
