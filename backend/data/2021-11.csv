(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Moisture absorbed by the hygroscopic polymers like molding compound and die-attach vaporizes during reflow lead to a high vapor pressure inside the electrical components lead to failure in the electrical device, named as popcorn failure. Popcorn failure in plastic encapsulated microcircuits has been a critical issue for electronic device reliability. Researches have been conducted on investigating the failure mechanism. Among all the factors that contributed to the failure, vapor pressure is one of the primary sources of stress that causes crack of the molding compound and delamination between critical interfaces. Numerous publications demonstrate the vapor pressure evolution and contributing factors with mathematical models, simulations, and tests. However, direct measurement of vapor pressure is not yet reported. This thesis presents the design and fabrication verification of a pressure sensor to measure the vapor pressure evolution in moisture-containing polymers at reflow temperatures. The specifications and requirements are extracted from the failure mechanism reported in the literature. A touch-mode capacitive pressure sensor with in-situ doped poly-SiC is designed to measure vapor pressure from atmospheric pressure to 8 MPa under reflow temperature up to 300 °C. Simulation on touch mode capacitive readout is performed to verify the design parameters and provide an estimation of device performance. The fabrication process is designed and conducted with several methods for crucial steps along with different structure dimensions to investigate an optimal solution. A complete fabricated device is achieved with measured initial capacitance from 12.3 to 26.7 pF for different sizes of diaphragms. The deviation between the measured results and simulation results due to fabrication problems is analyzed. Possible causes and solutions of problems that occurred in fabrication and measurement, such as unexpected upward bending of the diaphragm, leakage current between the capacitor electrode plate, and uniformity of SiC layer fabrication, are discussed. Problem correction, device optimization, complete characterization, and experiments for vapor pressure measurement in molding compound remain as future work.","Vapor pressure sensor; MEMS; popcorn failure analysis; touch-mode capacititive sensor; high-temperature; high-pressure sensing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering","",""

MIMO array exploits the spatial diversity of transmitters and receivers to achieve high cross-range resolution with fewer antennas than array-based imaging.<br/> Generally, to make full use of the sparsity, at least the transmit array or the receive array does not satisfy the Nyquist sampling criterion. Therefore, the grating lobes may occur, which would produce ghost targets and submerge the weak targets. For far-field imaging, the grating lobes can be eliminated with various array design methods. In contrast, it cannot be completely eliminated for near-field imaging applications. Besides, the high sidelobes would also mask the weak targets and reduce the image's dynamic range. The traditional weighting method can effectively suppress the sidelobes, but the mainlobe resolution would be reduced.<br/> In this thesis, we propose a method based on the spatially variant apodization method to enhance the image quality of near-field 1-D and 2-D MIMO array imaging. According to the generalized matched filtering imaging method, we can individually analyze the wavenumber spectrum in the cross-range and range directions of the transmit array and the receive array. Then the method can be easily implemented in the space domain to suppress the sidelobes and grating lobes without sacrificing the cross-range and range resolution. Moreover, three acceleration approaches are proposed to reduce the computation burden.<br/> Both numerical simulation and experimental validation indicate that the proposed method can effectively suppress the sidelobes and grating lobes without spreading the mainlobe. Moreover, the acceleration methods can suppress the sidelobe and grating lobe level meanwhile decrease the processing time remarkably under some conditions.","MIMO array imaging; spatially variant apodization (SVA); sidelobe suppression; grating lobe suppression","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(mentor); Cremer, Jochen (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Distribution System Operators (DSOs) are responsible preventing grid congestion, while accounting for growing demand and the intermittent nature of renewable energy resources. Incentive-based demand response programs promise real-time flexibility to relieve grid congestion. To include residential consumers in these programs, aggregators can financially incentivize participants to reduce their energy demand and make aggregated energy reduction available to DSOs. A key challenge for aggregators is to coordinate heterogeneous preferences from multiple participants while preserving their privacy. This thesis proposes MARL-iDR: a decentralized Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning approach to an incentive-based demand response program. The approach respects participants' privacy and preferences and makes decisions in real-time when deployed. The aggregator and each participant are controlled by Deep Reinforcement Learning agents that learn to maximize their reward. The aggregator agent learns a policy that dispatches suitable incentives to participants based on total energy demand and a target reduction, while minimizing financial costs. The participant agent learns to respond to these incentives by reducing consumption to a fraction of the original demand. The participant agents curtail or shift requested household appliances based on the selected consumption reduction using a novel Disjunctively Constrained Knapsack Problem optimization, while minimizing residents' dissatisfaction. A case study with real-world electricity data from 25 households demonstrates the capability to induce demand-side flexibility. The approach is compared to the case without demand response and to a centralized myopic baseline approach. A 9% reduction of the Peak-to-Average ratio (PAR) was achieved compared to the original PAR (no demand response).","Reinforcement Learning (RL); Demand Response; Multi-Agent systems","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A cross-case analysis is performed on 4 cases and key learnings from the cases are presented. These cases are examples of systems where DRT operates as a part of the public transport system. From the cross-case analysis, this research proposes an organisational structure that allows the dissolution of the boundaries between the two transport systems. First, a bundling of different types of DRT systems into a single system is proposed. Next, a mobility agency that brings the stakeholders from municipalities and the province into a single body is proposed. The mobility agency will be responsible for developing, planning, contracting, and monitoring the bundled DRT and the public transport systems. Since all these responsibilities will be concentrated in a single body, this structure can lead to alignment between the policies, budgets, and powers of the stakeholders. When an organisational structure is established this way, it is expected that an alignment between the operations of the two systems will follow. However, establishing such a structure is challenging. The challenges are finding the right cooperation model that can be followed by the stakeholders and finding the optimal scale for the structure to work.","Demand Responsive Transport; Organisational integration; Mobility agency; Public transport","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Transport and Planning","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","During the last years, large improvements in the efficiency on the CIGS technology have been achieved, making them excellent candidates as bottom cells for double junction tandem devices. This improvement is a result of the implementation of post deposition treatments (PDT) using alkali-metal fluorides. These alkalies prove to enhance the performance of the solar cells by passivating defects in the bulk of the CIGS, and also allow to use of thinner buffer layers. Therefore, understanding the role of the different variables of the PDT, and finding the optimal combination of them is essential to improve the performance of the device. <br/><br/>In this work, the identification of the optimum combination of the most relevant variables of RbF PDT on 3-stage co-evaporation low band-gap (1.00-1.01 eV) CIGS absorbers is performed by carefully examining the impact of the preselected variables such as substrate temperature, material flux, and stage duration on the performance of the solar cell. Similarly, an optimization of the buffer layer is conducted to enable proper deposition and enhanced absorption in the NIR. To interpret the impact of the PDT variables, the different sets of samples are evaluated electronically and compositionally with multiple characterization techniques. <br/><br/>It was determined that the concentration of Cu present in the surface of the absorber prior starting the PDT, together with the substrate temperature plays the most important role in the effectiveness of the PDT. This is mainly due to facilitating optimally Rb absorption and diffusion. Next to this, appropriate rinsing of the excess of alkali present on the surface of the absorber must be performed before the deposition of the buffer layer, in order to prevent the formation of a detrimental photoactive barrier at the CdS/CIGS interface.","Photovoltaic; Perovskite; CIGS solar cells; CIGS; perovskite/CIGS tandem; Tandem solar cells; Post deposition treatment; PDT; Solar Cells","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

Subsequently, in an attempt to proof ourselves from this death induced anxiety and fear, we have adapted to denying or avoiding our mortality to us, thus living in a death-buffer system. (Cave, 2013)However, emerging experimental evidence suggests that if we relate to our mortality such that we do not deny or avoid it, but are aware of it, it can result in human enhancement in many possible ways. It can lead to substantial benefits such as bolstered important positive components of the self, greater well-being, and stronger, personally valued self that is conceived with clarity and that has inner meaning and purpose. Besides that, it can also lead to positive existential growth, enhanced meaning in life and can generate a recalibration and prioritization of life goals (Cozzolino et al., 2013). Hence, it was inferred that even if we as individuals have been living well up till now within the death-buffer system, being able to tweak our relationship with mortality in the possible &amp; appropriate directions can help us leverage its benefits and further the enhancement of our life quality we are living presently. Thereby, it was deemed as a relevant topic to explore, and a promising upcoming opportunity to design for in this project.As mentioned above, there are many possible enhancement opportunities that come forth with mortality awareness. However the one that was identified and finalized for this project (through field exploration) was ‘to evoke reflection on life regarding recalibration of life goals’. Hence, the concept and the final design is an attempt to create such reflection on life in the light of mortality awareness.","Reflection, Life, Mortality Awareness","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

The behaviour of the model was evaluated at each step by means of a set of experiments, showing how the addition of the cost estimation influences the optimization results.<br/>The most promising results from the experiments are validated with Autodesk Fusion 360, with which the designs were programmed to be machined on a CNC mill. The machining times from this software were used to calculate the actual machining costs and these were compared to the machining costs estimated by the optimizer.<br/>Two formulations of the method were found to be useful for estimating the machining cost of designs. A simple formulation that uses the shape factor and the differentiation between internal and external pockets to estimate the cost resulted in a cost saving of 13% at the expensive of a compliance increase of 9%. The more complex formulation uses multiple pocket domains to evaluate pocket-specific properties. This allowed a more accurate estimation of the costs, but did not result in a better performing optimization. The cost saving was comparable at 12%, but the compliance increased by 16%.<br/>It was concluded that there is a use for both methods. The simple formulation allows to find cheaper designs, but does not allow much control in the cost estimation.

On analyzing the main sources which were able to satisfy this overwhelming demand it was found that the majority was still from non-renewable sources or fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas. The aftermath of the continued use of these fossil fuels are already well known, one can argue that there has still not been a serious attempt to phase out these non-renewable sources even though the concerns regarding the harmful emissions being released with their continued use are subject of numerous discussions and studies. It is paramount that the share of renewable energy technologies in the overall energy mix needs to be increased,various options must be explored such that it is possible to substitute these renewable energy sources in place of fossil fuels particularly in energy and emission intensive industries without a comprise in meeting their energy demand. Refuse derived fuel (RDF), which is the combustible fraction that has been separated from municipal solid waste (MSW) has gained attention due to it being seen as an alternative to convectional fossil fuels as well as a method of sustainable waste management and disposal. The reason for their use as an alternative fuel is mainly attributed to their physical and chemical characteristic such as their low moisture content, high grindability and calorific value. However, the challenges faced in their application as a substitute fuel or feedstock is attributed mainly to the high variability in the properties of the RDF material that is being supplied to the relevant industries. Therefore a standardization in its properties needs to be carried out particularly with regards to their moisture content and calorific value in order to promote their application. Torrefaction, also referred to as mild pyrolysis is a thermal treatment method that usually is carried out in temperature ranges of 200-300°C and residence times of 30-60 min in the absence of oxygen. The material that is being subject to this treatment method partly decomposes to release volatiles,and the left over solid product has been reported to undergone a modification its physical and chemical characteristics when compared to the initial solid material. From a chemical point of view the final solid product is reported to have an increase in the carbon content and decrease in the hydrogen and oxygen content which leads to a higher calorific value than the original material. Several experimental studies have been conducted for the torrefaction of RDF with aim of improving and standardizing the calorific value and have yielded promising results. However there has not yet been a work that has focused on the torrefaction of RDF on large scale, that takes into account the process design and economics associated with their production. The aim of this thesis was to carry out a techno-economic evaluation into the torrefaction of refuse derived fuel. An initial composition of raw RDF was selected from literature which has a high moisture content and low calorific value. The raw material is then subject to several process such as drying, torrefaction, grinding and pellitization with the aim producing torrefied RDF pellets. These process were simulated and optimized through Aspen Plus in order to obtain a better understanding of the influence of process parameters such as moisture content, drying temperature, torrefaction temperature and residence time on the final product as well as to select the optimum route for their production. Economic evaluation was also carried out to determine if the implementation of such a project is feasible. This was done on the basis of certain economic or profitability indicators. Results from simulations show that the optimum torrefaction conditions were 250°C and residence time of 30 min, which resulted in the final torrefied RDF having an increased calorific value. The economic analysis provides positive results particularly when moving towards a higher processing capacity of initial raw RDF. Finally, the effect of substitution of the torrefied RDF in a cement plant was also evaluated and has shown that significant savings can be achieved through the reduction in fossil fuel consumption and carbon dioxide emissions.","Torrefaction; Refuse Derived Fuel; Aspen Plus Modelling; Economics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

Stalling conditions are caused in these applications when there is blade-wake interaction, and also in the presence of strong gusts. The change in the local flow physics in both these cases is caused by a local variation in the angle of attack, which can affect the aerodynamic performance from entire blades. <br/><br/>Although there have been studies in the past that have involved various hybrid SGS models and turbulence models to investigate the effect of them for this flow case, the shear-layer adapted SGS (SLA-SGS) model has not found precedence for the purpose of aerodynamic investigation in this flow case.

It intends to develop a platform where the end-users can learn bird knowledge while contributing to building the explainability of machine learning models. Among all the methods that equips machine learning models with explainability, this project adopts a framework called SECA (Semantic Concept Extraction and Analysis). In this framework, we require human-made-annotations to be made to the saliency maps of training photos to provide semantically understandable explanations to the end-users. On the other hand, we hope that the process of making annotations will also benefit the human annotators’ skills in bird species identification, in order to motivate their participation. Two main goals of the user research were: to understand the users’ needs for learning and to know their capability in making the annotations needed by the project owners. The user research started with qualitative and quantitative research to understand the current practices of the bird hobbyists, to define the target user groups, which were the birders with zero or little expertise. Then, in order to link their learning needs to the capability of machine learning explanations, three prototypes were built to collect their feedback. It was found out that they didn’t care much about the justification or transparency of bird ID apps, compared to learning knowledge in distinguishing birds. Then came the annotation test when we found the participants were able to finish the annotation task with high correctness (&gt;93% on average). And the most popular annotations of each task were 100% correct. Finally, we built a functional, high-fidelity prototype with experiential interfaces and interactions, and tested it among 3 of the target users. They had positive feedback on the prototype’s usability and the overall workflow, which proved the feasibility of our concepts. Recommendations on usability were drawn at the end of this test. Throughout the research and design phases in this project, we have developed an approach to involve end-users in the annotation process of an explainable bird species identification model for their own benefit of fun and learning, which could potentially be applied to broader deployments","computer vision; citizen science; explainable artificial intelligence; human-in-the-loop","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

They include choices and decisions on what to eat when to eat, how much to eat, and where to eat. Taste preferences, food diversity, frequency of meal consumption, portion sizes, snacking behavior, and meal skipping all have an impact on this. According to research, not only physiological but also psychological elements such as emotions, stress, and personality differences influence our dietary choices. Many studies have been conducted to determine how to alter problematic eating choices by regulating emotions. Understanding one’s personality type, on the other hand, can help someone to become more aware of the foods liked and disliked. This is the first study to look at the combined effect of emotion regulation strategies and, in particular, Type-D personality type on eating choices. This thesis focused on women from various ethnic origins. The study looked at which emotion control strategies, such as cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression, were employed. Individuals were also assessed on the extent to which they were in the possession of a Type-D personality type by scoring on the two variables in this model, which are negative affectivity and social inhibition. This study hypothesized that people with Type-D personality, or those who score high in Negative Affectivity and Social Inhibition, employ less emotion regulation strategies and make poor dietary choices. The main findings confirm the hypothesis. As per the findings, reappraisal strategies outperform suppression methods. It was discovered that when reappraisal methods were used, women preferred more healthy food items like vegetables. However, when suppression strategies were used, unhealthy food items such as snacks were favored. Furthermore, the study looked at how age, a control variable, affected the use of emotion regulation strategies in food choices.

For current printers, paper scheduling often follows the first-in-first-out principle, so it is often not optimal. The printer system is a type of semi-cyclic discrete-event system with synchronization but no concurrency. The system contains a set of operations that vary over a limited sequence of operations, which can be further modelled as a Switching Max-Plus-Linear (SMPL) system through max-plus-linear algebra, and can be switched between different modes of operation. Since max-plus algebra has a significant analogy with conventional algebra, some properties in conventional algebra can be applied to such kind of system, making the system easier to achieve optimal control.<br/> <br/>In this report, a printing scheduler modelled by the max-plus algebra is presented. We review and summarize the basic knowledge of the Max-Plus-Linear (MPL) system from the existing literature in the first half of the report. We first introduce the basic properties of max-plus algebra and SMPL systems. Then we turn to the stochastic case, and consider the two types of stochastic uncertainty that may be included in the SMPL system, namely stochastic parametric uncertainty and stochastic mode switching uncertainty. Next, we review a Model Predictive Control (MPC) approach that can achieve optimal scheduling of systems containing two random uncertainties.<br/> <br/>In the second half of the report, based on the content summarized in the first half, we make a further derivation of the printer scheduling system modelled by SMPL approach. We first present the modelling framework of the printer. Three working modes, namely duplex mode, idle mode and simplex mode, are modelled separately and merged into a compact form. Then a scheduler that takes the feeding and processing time of each sheet of paper as design variables is introduced. It can find the global optimal schedule of different types of paper by solving the Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) problem. After that, we discuss cases involving switching, and consider switching between two sizes of paper and two working modes. Three possible intermediate switching modes are designed. Finally, we take noise/interference into consideration, discuss the impact of noise on scheduling, and the changes that the previously proposed methods may require to achieve optimal scheduling in the presence of noise.","Max Plus Algebra; Mixed Integer Linear Programming; Stochastic Analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

In the near future to meet the burgeoning demand, the future electrical power system would be a mix of both AC and DC systems coexisting with each other. With the fast paced development of smart grids, decentralised system and micro grids, there is an increasing interest in the LVDC (Low Voltage Direct Current) distribution. Also there is increase in the loads in the residential and commercial sector side that require DC supply inherently. To tap in and realise the potential of the LVDC distribution systems, it requires the appropriate infrastructures to be developed that supports its assimilation faster. This thesis “The Design and development of LVDC cable” is a step forward in realising the potential that DC has in the LV distribution side. This research is done in collaboration between TU Delft and the Prysmian Group. <br/> <br/>To begin with, two LVDC statespace based dynamic distribution system model namely: a neighbourhood distribution system and a ship distribution system are formed. The LVDC cables are incorporated as lines into these models. The sensitivity and stability analyses are performed by varying each of the active parameters individually, the influence that each of the active parameter has on node voltages, line currents and the stability of the system are studied and the trend is absorbed through this analysis. This analysis is set to be performed in both distribution systems under monopolar and bipolar configuration.<br/><br/>Subsequently, the short circuit analysis i.e the pole to pole and pole to neutral fault analysis is also performed on both the neighbourhood and ship distribution system. Here the cable’s active parameters that are expected to have an influence on the system performance and the line current during short circuit are taken into consideration. These active parameters are varied throughout this analysis and the resulting plots are further analysed to study their influence. These active parameters are cable resistance, cable inductance, cable capacitance, and cable length. The observations are tabulated for each of the active parameters individually. The generated results from this study would support in better assessment of cable’s active parameters influence on the short circuit current and designing the LVDC cables. <br/><br/> The accuracy of the dynamic model are validated by breaking the distribution system model into smaller sections and forthcoming results are compared to get the model accuracy.

(mentor); Talmon, A.M. (graduation committee); Kirichek, Alex (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Recently, deep-sea mining has acquired renewed interest from commercial companies due to a rise in the demand of minerals and metals. Deep-sea mining is focussed on different minerals and rare earth elements found in the oceans that are increasingly used in the manufacturing of goods and products related to renewable energy. In order to collect these minerals, a mining operation at several kilometres depth has to be undertaken. Apart from the technical challenges that mining at several kilometres depth poses, also the environmental consequences receive a lot of attention and criticism from environmental agencies. Deep-sea mining operations are believed to cause damage to the environment by the sediment plume, as well as by producing light and noise which are absent under normal conditions at the deep ocean floor. The sediment plume is generated by the movement of the miner, but more importantly by the discharging of the picked up and unwanted sediment. This happens at the back of the miner using a set of diffusers. In order to acquire a better understanding of the effect that the initial concentration of the slurry has on the spatial spread of the sediment plume and turbidity current caused by the deep sea mining vehicle, experiments have been performed in which the initial concentration has been altered so that the characteristics of the ensuing current can be compared. The main objective of this research is to determine how changing the initial volumetric concentration of the discharge mixture influences the flow parameters after impingement and sediment flux inside the turbidity current for a constant sediment flux and discharge velocity.<br/>One of the most important assumptions for investigating the influence of initial concentration of the slurries has to do with the different phases of the discharged flow. During the initial phase, the density difference between the slurry and ambient mixture is thought to be dominant for the settling process, as the mixture behaves as one coherent fluid. After impingement on the bottom, the mixture spreads downstream as a turbidity current. During this phase it is the weight of the solids inside the slurry that causes it to settle. Because there are a lot of solids present in these slurries this process of settling is controlled by both hindered settling and flocculation. Flocculation is the aggregation of cohesive particles, forming a larger, heavier particle. Clay, which is cohesive, is expected to be present at most mining sites, resulting in flocculation to be an important factor in the process.<br/>The research has been performed by conducting a total of three different experiments. These experiments consist of pumping a pre-mixed slurry of water and spherical glass particles into a large modular tank, where is it discharged through a diffuser. For each experiment a mixture is prepared with a different concentration, which is discharged into the modular tank with three different flow rates in order to keep the sediment flux constant between each experiment. A total of three diffusers are used, one for each concentration. The diffusers differ in cross section in order to achieve a constant discharge velocity for all experiments. Experiments have been performed using both spherical glass particles and clay. The sediment flux is kept constant between different experiments as it is assumed that the sediment flux of real deep sea mining operations will be mainly determined by the width, cutting depth and velocity of the mainly vehicle. For performing measurements during the experiments, an ADV was used. This device is capable of measuring the velocity in three directions over a profile of 30 mm with 1 mm intervals. The ADV also measures the signal-to-noise ratio, which after performing a calibration can be used for calculating the concentration inside the turbidity current. Together this data can be used for determining the spatial spread of the turbidity current.<br/>Based on the findings of this research, it is believed that a higher concentration than the 1% volumetric concentration that is currently being assumed by deep sea mining companies could prove to be beneficial in preventing the spatial spread of the sediment plume and subsequent turbidity current. It is believed that in general, increasing the initial concentration of the discharged slurry, and thereby decreasing the momentum/buoyancy ratio of the buoyant jet, directly leads to both the velocity and concentration of the turbidity current to decrease over a shorter distance after impingement, while the impingement distance itself is also decreased for a higher initial concentration. As such, the total reach of the turbidity current resulting from the slurry discharge from a deep sea mining vehicle can be decreased by using a higher initial concentration of said slurry. It is believed that mainly the higher density difference with the ambient water plays a vital role in decreasing the spatial spread of the sediment plumes produced by deep sea mining operations. The higher density achieved by a high concentration results in the plume to deflect towards to bottom over a shorter distance and a decrease in turbidity current height. This decrease in height is beneficial for the later stage of the turbidity current in which the dying out is dominated by the settling velocity of individual particles.","Deep sea mining; Sediment plumes; Turbidity currents; Negatively buoyant jets; Sediment-laden horizontal jets; ADV","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

The T-junction thermal mixing and fatigue phenomenon is a major area of study for the purposes of safety, maintenance and operational life in the nuclear industry, in which fluid mixing occurs in cooling circuits for the nuclear reactor. The existing body of work on T-junctions mainly comprises of experimental references performed at high values of Reynolds numbers. However, these available experimental databases are not <br/>sufficient to describe the involved physics in adequate detail, and, due to experimental limitations, accurate data on velocity and temperature fluctuations in regions close to the wall are not accessible. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) can play an important role in predicting such complex flow features. However, predicting complex thermal fatigue phenomena is a challenge for the available momentum and heat flux turbulence models, which also require extensive validation.<br/>It was realised that a comprehensive Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) of a T-junction was required as a benchmark for validation purposes, but also to better understand the underlying physical phenomena of thermal mixing in the fluid and thermal fatigue in the solid walls. The aim of the thesis is to thus design such a reference DNS experiment of a thermal fatigue scenario calibrated using Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulations. The feasibility of scaling down the Reynolds number from experimental cases to a computationally-feasible range is investigated. The junction corner shape is also modified to a slightly rounded corner, ensuring that the underlying fundamental physical phenomena of turbulence and thermal mixing flow features were preserved. The pipe lengths of the model were calibrated to ensure there would be no interference of the upstream developing region on the thermal mixing at the junction, and the outlet boundary conditions. A sample proof-of-concept under-resolved DNS (UDNS) case, with high- and low-Prandtl number passive temperature scalars, with iso-temperature, iso-flux and mixed (Robin) wall boundary conditions, is simulated and presented. This proof-of-concept simulation contributes to the finalization of the fully-resolved DNS in computational grid size selection, transient characteristics, computational costs, and additionally, the implementation of the Robin boundary condition in the fully-resolved DNS.","T-junction; Thermal mixing; DNS; RANS","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-11-30","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Zero Emission Fuels (ZEF) is a leading startup company that focuses on developing a sustainable methanol micro-plant that is powered by solar energy. CO2 and H2O are absorbed from the air (DAC system) and the extracted H2O is split into H2 (AEC system) in order to produce a methanol-water mixture where the mixture is then separated using a Distillation System (DS system). Each micro-plant operates for 7 hours per day and produces 600 g of methanol. with a distillate methanol purity of 99.8% (AA grade methanol) and in the future ZEF is planning to develop a ‘methanol farm’ with 13500 micro-plants. <br/>Based on a previous study at ZEF, fractional distillation was seen as a potential system for separating methanol and water mixture with desired purity. On the other hand, it was also suspected that implementing multiple decentralized separation units could be expensive with higher energy consumption and therefore alternative methods of implementing the DS system were analyzed. For this purpose, 3 different schemes namely Decentralized (1 DS per micro-plant), semi-centralized (1DS per 1000 micro-plant) and centralized (1 DS per 13500 micro-plant) were analyzed. Furthermore, heat integrations were introduced as various literature pointed out that a significant improvement in the total cost and energy consumption was observed and hence they were adapted to ZEF requirements. Therefore, six different systems namely conventional distillation (base case), Feed pre-heating, Vapour recompression, Bottom flashing, External heat integrated distillation and Vapour compression systems were suggested. The primary focus of this research will be to analyze these different distillation designs for all the three schemes and recommend a feasible design for the DS sub-system that is both energy-efficient and economically viable along with analyzing the impact of varying ambient conditions on the DS system. <br/>For this purpose, each of these systems was modelled in COCO and the modelling results obtained were used in analyzing the overall energy consumption and the total cost of each design. Different scenarios were analyzed, preliminary equipment designs were estimated. Each system was compared and evaluated in terms of energy and cost-saving and a quantitative and qualitative analysis was performed. Based on this analysis a centralized VRC and base case systems powered by solar PV operating for 7 hours were recommended. In order to understand the impact of fluctuating solar radiation and ambient temperature on the DS system, a MATLAB model was developed. From the results, it was evident that the fluctuating ambient conditions affected the product purities and the startup and shutdown of the DS system. A feed mass flow-temperature control was implemented for Centralized base case system, where the feed mass flow rate into the DS system was adjusted depending on the fluctuating power input. The control structure was able to effectively control the distillate and bottom purities by varying the feed mass flow rate.","Methanol-water mixture; Distillation System; Process modelling; energy and economic analysis; Dynamic analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-11-30","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

The city of Amsterdam is currently tackling the problem and have published a plan of action. This plan includes the renovation of hundreds of kilometres of quay walls. Given this enormous amount, it is necessary to prioritize certain quay walls over others based on the severity of their damage. Some quay walls have reached total collapse, of which the most recent case involves the ""Grimburgwal"" quay. The municipality has no accurate view of the current condition of quay walls in Amsterdam. On top of that, the vast majority of quay walls have not been assessed on their safety. It is known that the most vulnerable quay walls types consist of masonry walls, supported by wooden foundation structures. Given that the quay wall renovation project requires prioritisation, it is necessary to gain more information on how the most vulnerable walls are recognised. Preferably, a method should be developed in which only visual cues given by the masonry wall are required, as it is quick and relatively cheap. To gain information on what these visual cues might be, a three-dimensional finite element model is made to run simulations on possible behaviours of quay walls. In this thesis, it is attempted to model a quay wall as realistically as possible. Several different deterioration conditions will be applied to see how the masonry responds. The 3D model is built using a parametric model coded in Python. This code can be used to run simulations in the finite element software DIANA FEA. Many behavioural aspects have been incorporated into the model, with the purpose to make the model more realistic. The model consists of a masonry wall, planks on which the wall rests, and supporting piles. The behaviour of each component has been applied in the code and have been obtained through other literature and European norms. The model is loaded by simulating the weight of the soil and its effect on the quay wall structure. The masonry is simulated using a smeared cracking model (macro-model). Long-term deterioration of quay walls is simulated by changing the material properties of each respective component. This thesis focuses on three deterioration conditions: 1. Non-uniform pile degradation: application of broken piles, simulated by removal of those piles from the model. This is subdivided into two categories: removal of entire rows (a row consisting of a front, middle and end pile) and removal of front piles only. 2. Non-uniform soil removal: formation of soil pits at the foundation level, which result in decreased bedding around the foundation piles. 3. Uniform degradation: application of uniform deterioration along a stretch of quay walls. The simulations yield fairly consistent cracking patterns, in which the same crack fields appear in each simulation depending on the chosen case mentioned before. Displacement patterns are also documented and presented in all cases. The quay wall model is able to display in-plane and out-of-plane movement simultaneously. The effect of each parameter on the crack/displacement patterns are analysed as well. This includes masonry and wood quality. The results show that the largest in-plane settlements are reached by damaged piles, while the largest out-of-plane displacements are caused by a loss of soil bedding around the piles. The results can be used to provide better insight on how quay walls with poor quality present themselves in real life and what their cause might be. This research contributes to the possibility of improving recognition of quay walls which find themselves in critical condition, which can then be prioritized for renovations. For future research, it is recommended to see whether time-dependent simulations can be run, to see if it makes a difference in the outcome of displacement/cracking patterns. Another important recommendation is to look into deterioration rates of materials, which could be used as another indicator for critically damaged quay walls.","Quay walls; Finite Element Analysis; crack; Macro-model; DIANA FEA; amsterdam","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(mentor); Kavoura, F. (mentor); Overend, M. (mentor); Janssen, Joey (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","The motivation of the thesis relates to designing grid shells over existing buildings. Grid shell roofs are a way to enclose an existing space structurally efficiently and have minimal interference with the surroundings from an architectural and environmental perspective. The solution results in less material usage than shell structures, and transparency, allowing for more daylight.<br/>Joints play a significant role in the design of grid shells, including structural and economic efficiency. It is common practice in engineering to design rectangular patterned grid shells with rigid joints. A rectangular shape is easy to deform by applying load; hence, it needs stiffness and rigidity. On the other hand, triangular patterned grid shells are designed with pinned joints as the triangular shape is stiff enough and does not need additional stiffness in the joints. Considering these points, the following research question arises:<br/>How can connection stiffness in the parametric design of grid shell roof structures lead to more efficiency for existing buildings?<br/>To answer this research question, the thesis procedure is divided into five steps. First, a literature study provides a clear understanding of grid shell design principles and their joints. Based on the out-of-plane rotational stiffness, a classification system for joints in grid shells is suggested. The Matrix Method is used to find the boundary for rigid stiffness. The boundary for pinned stiffness is found by studying the influence of the stiffness decreasing in a logarithmic scale over the bending moment distribution.<br/>Furthermore, to explore the influence of the stiffness over the design of the grid shell, a parametric model is created. The study investigates the structural behavior of a triangular and rectangular grid pattern. Therefore, a comparison of the influence of the joint between a rigid and non-rigid shape will be made. The design criteria include the Ultimate Limit State (ULS) and Serviceability Limit State (SLS). To quantify the results, a case study is applied. The C30 Shell project, now designed and completed by Octatube, will be used as a reference to apply the theory of this thesis.<br/>Based on the Eurocode checks, conclusions are drawn related to the effect of the stiffness. The grid shell with rectangular pattern is significantly affected in both Ultimate and Serviceability Limit State with alternation of stiffness in logarithmic scale. However, the stiffness decrease was proved to have no significant effect over the maximum displacements (SLS) but only over the stress distribution for the triangular pattern. Therefore, to find the optimal solution for a grid shell with a triangular pattern, only the ULS unity checks need to be compared. On the contrary, for grid shells with a rectangular pattern, a balance needs to be found between ULS and SLS unity checks.<br/>Following this conclusion, the study is focused on the grid shell with a rectangular pattern. Joints are designed for different stiffness to visualize the difference on how to achieve these stiffness in real-life engineering practice. The FEM software IDEA StatiCa is used to design the joints. The joints follow a similar concept with a rectangular hollow section box in the middle where all the joints are connected. While the required stiffness is decreased approaching semi-rigid and pinned, the dimensions of the joint components are also decreased. The reduction of material used also makes the structure more lightweight and less expensive in terms of material.<br/>Finally, to answer the research question, an optimization procedure has been conducted. Octopus, an optimization algorithm within Grasshopper, is used. The optimization procedure is divided into four steps. The first step was to find an optimal cross-section for each of the stiffness studied. This step focuses on where the solution with the smallest cross-section and lower stiffness can be found. By finding the smallest cross-section, the material used is optimized on a global scale, being one step closer to the smaller self-weight of the roof structure. The second step aims to find the lowest stiffness possible for the cross-section obtained in step 1. This objective is related to design considerations. By lowering the required stiffness, also the dimensions of the components in the joint can be reduced. Thus the material used is decreased on the local scale. In step three, two smaller cross-sections are iterated for different stiffness to verify that the solution obtained is optimal. The last step consisted in giving an optimal design solution for the connections. Other aspects are considered, such as fabrication practicality and transport limitations.<br/>Two types of connections are designed for the grid shell roof. The first connection is designed using only welding and the second connection uses a combination of bolts and welding. The aim is to avoid welding in situ and prefabricate parts of the roof in the factory within the transportation limitations. The fully welded connections allow the prefabrication of roof components off-site. The bolted ones allow connecting these smaller parts in situ.<br/>Based on this investigation, it can be concluded:<br/>The final solution results in a reduction of the total weight of the joints by approximately 50% from fully rigid to optimal stiffness design. Furthermore, an 8% reduction of the self-weight of the structure is achieved by optimizing joint stiffness. Consequently, it results in reduced imposed loading over the existing building and foundation. This reduction is also beneficial for economic and environmental purposes by being more sustainable in terms of material footprint.","grid shell; joint stiffness; existing building; parametric design; optimization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Building Engineering","",""

Part of the collective effort is to research solar energy as new ways to produce cleaner, cheaper and more efficient electricity. Among all the current solar cell technologies, a thriving and promising one is perovskite as an absorber material. In the last ten years, the power conversion efficiency evolved with a steep rhythm. In 2019, a maximum of 25.2% in a single junction configuration was reported, while more actual research proves that using them as a tandem can reach up to 30%. Perovskites have the advantage of changing their bandgap by ion-­mixing, from as low as 1.2 eV to even higher than 2.5 eV. Besides, it is flexible, translucent and has similar efficiencies to c­-Si; while being cheaper and easier to produce. It is expected that it will replace c­-Si-­based solar cells in the long run and significantly reduce the price of solar energy.<br/><br/>This project is developed under the Photovoltaic Materials and Devices (PVMD) section of TU Delft, in conjunction with HyET Solar and Flamingo PV. The software ASA and GenPro4 were used to validate single-­junction solar cells and optimize tandem devices. The goal of this thesis is aligned to HyET’s ob­jective: improve its flexible thin-­film solar cell by increasing the power conversion efficiency above 12%.<br/><br/>To carry out the validation and calibration of the single­-junction references, first, a study of all the possible perovskite­-based solar cells was performed. The chosen perovskites have a Methylamonium and Formamidinium combination. The first one has a bandgap of 1.55 eV and works as a high bandgap<br/>absorber material (K0.05(FA0.85MA0.15)0.95Pb(I0.85Br0.15)3), while the low bandgap corresponds to 1.25 eV ((FASnI3)0.6(MAPbI3)0.4) [20]. By adjusting some of the absorber layers’ electrical parame­ters, the references’ electrical properties were matched.<br/><br/>Once validated, the respective p­i­n junctions of the perovskite solar cells were introduced into HyET’s solar cell architecture. By doing this, it is already possible to see the advantages of using per­ovskites as absorber materials: the power conversion efficiency grew from 7.71% to 18% and 19.45% for the high and low bandgap cells. Besides, there is also a better use of the light spectrum. Cali­brating a tandem solar cell is much more complicated. That is why it is done first on the individual single-­junction solar cells, and afterwards, both are stacked together.<br/><br/>The first step to optimize a tandem device is to do an optical simulation (GenPro4). By analyzing the absorptance of the tandem device and the optical current of the top and bottom absorber materials, it is possible to obtain the best combination for the current matching of the tandem solar cell. By modifying<br/>both of the absorber materials’ thicknesses, the optical current mismatch can be reduced. As a result: 300 nm and 600 nm thickness for the a­-Si / LBG perovskite tandem, and 120 nm and 1700 nm for the HBG perovskite / nc-­Si; achieving a mismatch below 0.04 mA/cm2 and 0.2 mA/cm2 correspondingly.<br/><br/>The second step in optimizing a tandem device involves an electrical simulation (ASA). The optimization is related to facilitating tunneling recombination at the n­-p junction by adjusting the doping of these layers. The optimized tandem solar cells have the following electrical properties: 1.56 V, 14.54 mA/cm2, 0.85 and 19.69% for fill factor and PCE for the HBG perovskite / nc-­Si tandem solar cell; while 1.55 V, 11.13 mA/cm2, 0.72 and 12.36% for fill factor and PCE of the other. With these results, it is plausible to confirm that HyET’s objective of having thin-­film flexible solar cells with a PCE above 12% can be met by using perovskite technology in their production line.","Perovskite; Perovskite solar cells; perovskite/nc-Si tandem solar cells; a-Si/perovskite tandem solar cell; simulation models; ASA; GenPro4; High bandgap Perovskite; Low bandgap Perovskite; Wide bandgap Perovskite; Narrow bandgap Perovskite","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","Flamingo PV",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Emission of fine and ultrafine particles from wood fired cook stoves are a major concern worldwide especially in the many countries where biomass cookstove are used on daily basis. Due to their small size these particles can reach deep within the lungs and cause various health issues. The effect of insertion of a turbulent agglomerator in the cookstove chimney on the number of small particles emitted has been investigated. This device consists of a number of properly designed obstacles in the flow increasing the turbulence level and enhancing collisions and agglomeration of particles. The device is suitable because it requires little extra investment and does not require an external energy source.<br/>First an analytical model of the flow through a Plancha type cookstove was made in MATLAB, in order to obtain estimates for the flow properties at the chimney inlet. Next, CFD simulations were performed using Ansys Fluent R3 and the grid generator program CFMesh+ software. Eulerian-Lagrangian (EL) simulations of dispersed multiphase flow were made to determine the particle dynamics within the flow domain. Particle agglomeration was studied using Eulerian-Eulerian (EE) simulations in combination with the population balance equation (PBE) for particle size. Appropriate agglomeration kernels were implemented via user-defined functions. A key feature taken into account is that agglomeration of particles for particles smaller than the Kolmogorov scale is determined by Brownian motion whereas turbulence takes over as driver for agglomeration for particles larger than the Kolmogorov<br/>scale. The turbulence properties were obtained using the standard k-ϵ model with standard wall functions.<br/>To check the operation of the CFD model, a first application of the EE approach was made to a turbulent agglomerator with extra air injection via a jet in the side wall. This was studied in a simplified 2D geometry. In the investigated case it was observed that the turbulence caused by the jet has larger effect than the turbulence of the obstacles.<br/>Next, the EL and EE CFD models were applied to a agglomerator type for which experimental data are available. These simulations concern a 3D domain representing chimney with obstacles creating turbulence. To be relevant for the cookstove chimney case operation at a lower flow rate than the experiment had to be studied. Wakes behind obstacles play an important role. Large particles have higher probability to bypass the wakes. The wakes provide zones with larger mean residence time where the agglomeration process can have more effect. The simulations using the PBE provided quantitative results for the evolution of the volume fraction of different size classes of particles. It was found that for the considered chimney (lower velocity, hence lower turbulence level) the turbulent agglomeration effect is too weak to obtain a sufficient removal efficiency of submicron particles (under 1%). In case of higher particle load higher removal efficiency can be achieved.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Energy and Process Technology","",""

The methods rely on observing changes in the lateral offset between the GPS trajectories and the road geometry. The resulting identification accuracy of the best performing algorithm was achieved using the GoPro Max with an overall F1 score (harmonic mean of precision and recall) of 0.9 on the validation data using the signal of filtered projected lateral distance.

The model's decarbonisation pathways are constructed with assumptions about the country's socio-economic conditions, energy efficiency, fuel share, and technology share. The modelling focuses on decarbonising thermal energy use by substituting fossil fuel use with low carbon fuels such as biomass, hydrogen, and electricity. Depending on the assumptions in scenarios, fossil fuel use gets phased out rapidly or slowly. It is also assumed that electricity used for the cement industry gets decarbonised over the years with an increase of renewables. Results show that the role of different energy carriers in different mitigation pathways depends on the assumptions taken for decarbonisation. In the short term, fossil fuels have an important role in the transition to alternative fuels. In the medium to long term, the role of alternative fuels is high as fossil fuels begin to phase out. The role of electricity and hydrogen is moderate as electric, and hydrogen kilns are introduced later and do not take a high share in clinker production. Furthermore, alternative fuels and CCS technologies are crucial for countries to pursue low carbon pathways.<br","Decarbonisation; Cement industry; Net-zero; Energy transition","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Industrial Ecology","",""

The introduction of automated vehicles (AVs) in mixed-traffic environment, where human drivers will interact with AVs, will affect the nature of these communicative interactions. AVs and human-driven vehicles (HDVs) use different communication forms (e.g., vehicle-to-vehicle communication between AVs vs eye-contact between humans). This raises road safety concerns. AVs might need a communication system that conveys intent to HDVs, clearly. This research investigates the potential of external human machine interfaces (eHMIs) in AV-HDV interactions at T-intersections to improve communicative interactions. Traditional traffic signals were used as inspiration to develop two eHMIs concepts, one placed on vehicle while the other on infrastructure. eHMI on vehicle might require less visual scanning from the interacting human to know AV intent and speed, but on the other hand, the AV might not be in driver field-of-vision compared to an eHMI on the infrastructure. The effects of eHMIs were investigated using a driving simulator with forty-six participants. The results show that both eHMIs had a significant and positive effect on driver trust, acceptance, and emotions. Drivers were calmer with eHMI placed on the infrastructure than on the vehicle. Both eHMIs reduced the time to maximum braking of human drivers and increased their compliance with AVs. The eHMI on vehicle reduced critical interactions, measured by the Post Encroachment Time, between AVs and HDVs. It is concluded that eHMIs can improve AV-HDV communicative interactions at T-intersections. No significant differences were observed between the eHMI conditions in participants’ preference and efficiency of the AV-HDV interactions, measured by human driver compliance. Hence, this research recommends further investigation of eHMIs in different on-road interactions.","Automated vehicles; External human machine interfaces; Driving behaviour; Human perception; Mixed traffic; Driving simulator","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Transport and Planning","SAMEN",""

While there are several factors that contribute to greenhouse gases, adversely affecting the planet, CO2 emission is one of them. It is said that 8% of total carbon dioxide emission is caused due to the production of Ordinary portland cement used for concrete in construction. The construction industry highly relies upon concrete as a major and widely used construction material. Solutions to reduce the production of Portland cement without having to entirely remove concrete as a building material has been an important discussion. A possible solution is to replace the Portland cement in concrete with industrial by-products further activating the binder with alkali activators producing a green concrete called ‘Geopolymer concrete’ (GPC) which would reduce CO2 emission.  The biggest challenge yet is that, designing any structure, a standard validated code/regulation is required and GPC doesn’t have a standard code of practice. All the concretecodes till now are formulated taking the parameters for Ordinary Portland cement concrete. This lack of design models specifically formulated for GPC restricts contractorsand engineers to use GPC in structures. This is why GPC has not gained much acceptance in practice.  This research was done in collaboration with Boskalis. A bridge (KW15-N69) has beenconstructed using geopolymer concrete in North Brabant province of the Netherlands.To make the bridge sustainable and circular, the GPC used contained no cement andaggregates were fully replaced by thermally recycled asphalt aggregates. For design ofthe bridge, Eurocode 2 for concrete structures was used and additionally regulations by Dutch ministry of transport and infrastructure was followed.This research will act asone of the pioneer studies to investigate the overall structural behaviour of geopolymerconcrete beams with respect to standard codes which should help design engineers upto some extent to execute and design structures using GPC in future.   ","Geopolymer concrete; Eurocode for concrete structures; Sustainable construction; green concrete","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering | Concrete Structures","",""

Our designed structures depend upon many resources during the construction or operational phase.

The lack of understanding of actual removal potential and different mechanisms occurring in the filter bed has limited the development of new filter design and operation. This research aims at assessing the bacteria and viruses removal capability of filter material in different depths from the top 40 cm of full-scale slow sand filter (SSF) operated for 436 days. In addition, the focus is to identify the key removal mechanisms that aid bacteria and viruses removal in the schmutzdecke.<br/>The results show that three depths: 0-5, 5-20 and 20-35 cm contribute to E. coli removal of 0.55, 1.3 and 1.04 logs, PhiX174 removal of 0, 0.30 and 0.14 logs. The log reduction value of E. coli and PhiX174 is rather similar in different layers, even though the schmutzdecke is considered to be the critical component for E. coli removal. It indicated that the deeper layers are also important in a well-established SSF. No removal of PhiX174 was observed in 0-5 cm with a thick biofilm, which indicates that the thickness of a certain level would impact the performance of virus removal.<br/>To determine mechanisms, filter material from 0-5 cm was operated under three conditions: active, inactive, and ignited condition. The results show E. coli removal of 0.68, 0.74, and 0.43 logs, PhiX174 removal of 0, 0, and 0.28 logs for active, inhibited, and ignited sand, respectively. Contrary to previous studies, no function of microbial mechanisms is observed for E. coli removal. That key mechanism might change with the different maturity levels of SSFs might be a possible reason. In addition, this may ascribe to incomplete microbial active inhibition. On the other hand, despite evidence that virus removal enhances with filter maturation, schmutzdecke did not improve PhiX174 removal. Poor virus removal may be attributed to higher interstitial velocity along with higher shearing forces caused by abundant biofilm within the schmutzdecke. <br","Slow Sand Filter; Bacteria and Virus Removal; Schmutzdecke; Mechanisms","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Environmental Engineering","",""

This study applies data-driven methods, mainly demand pattern analysis, to facilitate the development of operational strategies in a cost-effective and operator-friendly way. Demand pattern is analysed in an innovative spatial analytical unit, overlapping circle, which is proven to achieve more beneficial effects than the traditional units (i.e., the administrative units), and hourly clustering is conducted to derive the reallocation strategies by mitigations of imbalance in supply and demand in recurrent hourly clusters. Additionally, this work constructs several indicators to evaluate the strategies in a real-life context, taking both the operator and the users into account. The proposed methodology is applied in a case study, bondi’s e-bike sharing in The Hague with a 4-month time frame from 19-06-2021. There are 5 hourly clusters emerging via agglomerative hierarchical clustering: 1) the first peak hour (16:00-16:59); 2) the second peak hour (17:00-17:59); 3) the first transition hour (18:00-18:59); 4) the second transition hour (19:00-19:59); 5) the off peak (20:00-15:59). The corresponding reallocation strategies are then proposed to alleviate the imbalance in different periods. Additionally, adjustment in the operational areas is suggested by the supply efficiency and trip duration/distance analyses. The results prove that the operational strategies obtained from demand patterns indeed improve the service, with almost 1.5 times ridership, circa 20% decrease in vehicle idle time, compared to the baseline. and a decent monthly net retention rate at around 60%.","e-bike sharing; temporal clustering; demand pattern; operational strategies; evaluation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-11-01","","","","Transport, Infrastructure and Logistics","",""

In these applications, composites encounter high thermal gradients service condition, and composites exhibit material discontinuous gradient field. It is essential to study how high thermal gradients and material discontinuities influence on the composites’ behavior. Composites are usually modelled with the standard finite element method (FEM), but mesh refinement is required near material interfaces and regions with high thermal gradients to obtain accurate solutions. Enriched finite element procedures are able to solve this issue. The Generalized Finite Element Method (GFEM) can approximate high thermal gradients by adding enriched degrees of freedom (DOFs) to original mesh nodes. In addition, the Interface-enriched Generalized Finite Element Method (IGFEM) can cope with material discontinuities by creating nodes at the intersection between discontinuities and edges of elements in the mesh. Yet, GFEM and IGFEM have their own limitations when implemented: while GFEM needs extra enrichments to resolve the material interfaces in composites, and IGFEM requires mesh refinement if thermal gradients are too high in cut elements. Then we can combine the best of both methods.<br/><br/>In this thesis, a new Generalized Finite Element Method with spread and discrete enrichments (GFEM^sd) is developed to simulate heat transfer problems with high thermal gradients in composites. By combining GFEM and IGFEM formulations, GFEM^sd is capable of dealing with high thermal gradients and material discontinuities simultaneously in an effective manner. We show that GFEM^sd obtains accurate results when compared with analytical solutions in numerical examples. A convergence study illustrates that fewer DOFs are required in GFEM^sd for achieving the same level of accuracy comparable to that of IGFEM. We then apply GFEM^sd to simulate a twill pattern composite and derive effective heat conductivity values. Lastly, based on the composite’s minimum effective heat conductivity, fiber shape optimization is conducted to obtain the best design for a fixed fiber volume fraction.","high thermal gradients; weak discontinuities; GFEM; IGFEM; GFEM^sd","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-11-29","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

With the rise of intermittent renewable energy, a need for energy storage is also inevitable. Carbon dioxide electrolysis is a potential solution as CO<sub>2 </sub>emissions can be recycled and subsequently converted for energy storage. However, the technology is rather new and research has yet to be conducted in this field. An important aspect is the temperature within an electrochemical cell, especially when scaling up. An increase in temperature can benefit the performance of the cell, but it also has downsides. Hot-spot formation with non-uniform reaction kinetics and thermal sensible components can have a great influence on the life-time of the cell.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>For that reason, a modeling study on the heat generation within carbon dioxide electrolysis systems is done. Different volumetric gas flow rates of carbon dioxide have been considered for two geometries: the membrane electrode assembly (MEA) and the gas diffusion electrode (GDE). The model considers three separate models: a mass model, electrochemical model and thermal model, and operates at a fixed current. The finite difference method is applied using Python 3.0 to solve the relevant conservation equations. Furthermore, the model includes different material layers, where the materials and dimensions are based on recently done experiments.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>The model showed that irreversible losses caused by the activation overpotentials are the biggest contributor to the total heat generation. Reversible heat also contributes to the heat generation, where heat is required in the anode and heat is generated in the cathode. Furthermore, within the cathodic catalyst layer most heat is generated. Joule heating caused by ohmic losses has proven to have negligibly impact on the total heat generation. As a result, the hot-spot is located within the cathodic catalyst layer for both geometries. Due to the additional electrolyte in the GDE, the hot-spot does not reach the membrane, in contrast to the MEA. Besides, different results in the y-direction are observed for the volumetric flow rates. For both geometries, the hot-spot is located at the inlet for 10 ml/min and in the middle for 100 ml/min. From the analysis, the GDE is more favorable as less heat is expected and the hot-spot does not reach the membrane. The sensitivity analysis showed that the thermal conductivity is of great importance.","Electrolysis; Carbon Dioxide; Heat generation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","This work presents a highly linear quadrature down-converter topology intended for the linearization of digital Transmitters(DTX). By integrating it with a DTX, a fully integrated on-chip output-signal correction loop comes closer to its realization. The proposed down conversion architecture can measure the errors introduced by the non-linearity of the transmitter, rather than the transmitter output itself. These errors are determined by comparing the downconverted transmitter output signals with its analog ideal baseband I and Q reference signals. The reference signals are provided by low-power digital-to-analog converters(DACs), using the same IQ data input as the power DTX. This approach reduces the resolution/dynamic range requirements on the trans-impedance-amplifier (TIA) and analog-to-digital converters(ADCs) since the error signals have a reduced dynamic range compared to the transmitter’s output signal itself. These lower requirements on the ADCs and elimination of off-chip couplers and filter sease the integration of a complete digital pre-distortion (DPD) correction loop in future DTX implementations. As the core of this thesis work, a linear harmonic rejection mixer was designed. It uses resistors inits mixer branches to implement the proper currenct scaling needed for harmonic rejection (HR). The resulting HR mixer avoids the unwanted down-conversion of the higher harmonics of the DTX to the base band frequencies of interest. Also, atrans-impedance amplifier was designed with the proposed passive mixer. These TIAs are based on an inverter topology for maximum tranconductance and were biased for optimal linearity and offered a bandwidth over 1.8GHz. The proposed DTX error-detection architectureis implemented in the current domain. Performing the subtraction before the TIA drastically reduces the voltage swing at the input of the TIA, benefiting the linearity of the mixer and reference DAC. The overall HR-mixer configuration is simulated for its linearity, yielding an IIP3 of 49dBm, which to the best of the author’s knowledge, is the best-reported linearity for high bandwidth down-converting applications.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-11-29","","","","Electrical Engineering","",""

To increase the efficiency of the PV module, the produced charge carriers in the semiconductor materials should be transferred to the PV module terminals with minimum conduction losses. As an alternative to the conventional cells and modules interconnections, in this thesis project, efficient ways to incorporate Wireless Power Transfer (WPT) techniques into PV cell and module architecture are being sought. <br/><br/>The main objectives of this research are to understand how WPT techniques can be efficiently incorporated into PV devices, such as PV cells and modules, find out whether these techniques in theory and in practice are efficient enough and suggest the best design approach as a guideline for near future prototyping.<br/>Many different WPT methods were studied in theoretical level, such as the Capacitive Power Transfer (CPT), the Inductive Power Transfer (IPT) and the Magnetic Resonant Coupling (MRC). Based on the main advantages and disadvantages of these methods, the most efficient seems to be the MRC, which eventually was used as the main method of transferring power wirelessly in the systems of this thesis project. <br/><br/>The systems that were developed and studied consist of a PV generator made of a single IBC solar cell or a PV generator that consists of 16 connected in series IBC solar cells, an inverter that converts the direct current (DC) of the generators into alternating current (AC) and two resonant circuits, the primary and the secondary one. Between these circuits, the power is transferred wirelessly from the primary to the secondary one, through the magnetic field that is created. <br/><br/>During this project, the main mathematical models were developed and were used for simulations in both Matlab and Simulink. The main goals of these simulations were to find out which type of coils, as far as the shape, the cross section and the values of turn width, turn spacing, distance between the coils and number of turns are concerned, and which compensation topology would help the systems to develop higher efficiencies.<br/><br/>According to the results, when ideal DC to AC conversion at the primary side of the system is assumed, the most ideal option seems to be the Series-Series compensation topology with planar coils of circular shape and rectangular cross-section, for which the systems developed efficiencies higher than 85% when the circuits were connected with one solar cell and above 98% when the circuits were connected with one module of 16 solar cells.<br","Contactless; Magnetic Resonant Coupling; Solar Cells; Photovoltaic; Wireless Power Transfer; Results; Efficiency","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-11-29","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

However, accelerating sea-level rise threatens the mudflats and associated ecosystems, where the mudflat accretion lag behind sea level rise. A reliable forecast on the morphological developments of the mudflat under sea-level rise scenarios is of vital importance to assess sea level rise impact on the estuarine system.<br/><br/>Different tools exist that can predict the long-term evolution of the mudflats, viz. Delft3D, ASMITA and the hybrid model (Delft3D-ASMITA). Since the hybrid model is newly developed, the comparison among the various approaches has not yet been available. However, it is significant to know if they can produce the same results.<br/><br/>The research aims to compare the three modeling approaches (Delft3D, ASMITA, and the hybrid model) based on a case study in South San Francisco Bay. This comparison will reveal the strengths and weaknesses of the three approaches as well as indications where the approaches may strengthen each other.<br/><br/>The research is conducted in three main phases. Phase 1 consists of the sensitivity analyses in Delft3D for the case of South San Francisco Bay; Phase 2 contains the calibration of one-element and multi-element ASMITA models to reproduce the Delft3D model; Phase 3 focuses on the potential to improve the simulation efficiency of Delft3D in the hybrid model.<br/><br/>Model result comparison shows that, after the calibration, the ASMITA and hybrid model can efficiently simulate the same cases as in Delft3D. However, the upper part (landwards end) of the mudflat is more sensitive to the water level changes in the hybrid model due to the different sediment transport computation modules. The power indicating the relation between the equilibrium and actual morphology as well as the reference level is the important calibration coefficient to adjust the steepness of a mudflat. It can be concluded that the Delft3D model is used as the foundation to calibrate ASMITA and the hybrid model, both of which can improve the simulation efficiency with simplifications, especially in the long-term morphological development.<br/><br/>The study provides clear insights into the comparisons among different modeling approaches in the case of the long-term morphological developments of mudflats by the impacts of sea-level rise. It is recommended to do further research on the configuration of a 2D model and the conduction of the combination of different modeling approaches in other similar cases to confirm the validation.","Intertidal flats; South San Francisco Bay; DELFT3D; ASMITA; Hybrid modelling; Comparison; Sea level rise; Long-term morphological developments","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Such a large natural area is ofgreat importance to bothhuman beings and ecosystems. Over 10,000 species of flora and fauna are found in theWadden Sea being a perfect habitat due to the relatively calm environment and high food availability. However, accelerating sea-level rise and human interventions, such as gas extraction, may induce an unwanted morphological change in theWadden Sea posing a threat to the natural habitats. This study investigates the morphological response of the Wadden Sea to SLR and subsidence induced by gas mining. A new hybridmodel whose aggregation level is between a process-based model<br/>(Delft3D) and a aggregatedmodel (ASMITA) is applied in this thesis. The two-dimensional hybrid model applies depth integrated shallow water formulations and the advection diffusion equation for the transport ofsediments like Delft3D, but calculates the exchange ofsediment betweenbed andwater columnbymeans ofan equilibriumbathymetry concept under scenarios disturbing these equilibrium conditions. The Ameland inlet is chosen as the research area because it is a relatively autonomous<br/>and undisturbed basin. The high robustness of the hybrid model makes it possible to apply a high morphological scale factor and a coarser grid compared to the processbased model, which shortens the computation time by orders of magnitude. However, the equilibrium concept also fixes the shoal-channel structure and suppresses channel migrations. Three different scenarios of sea-level rise rate (4, 6, 8 mm/year) are applied over a simulation period of 100 years. The general morphological response simulated by the hybrid model shows that the channels and the ebb-tidal delta erode acting as the main source ofsediment for accretion of the intertidal flats. The erosion/sedimentation is more pronounced with a higher sea-level rise rate. Sensitivity analysis shows a significant influence of the sediment diameter on the<br/>channel erosion and sediment supply to the intertidal flats. Diffusivity plays an important role in the horizontal sediment exchange between the channel and the flat but only slightly influences the sediment import. Global equilibrium concentration and power n are similar to diffusivity in affecting morphological activity. The adaptation time scale is inversely proportional to both of these two parameters. The possibility of using more than one sediment fraction is proved and it can reproduce a more realistic sediment distribution as the observation. The hybrid model is also applied to simulate the morphological response to local<br/>subsidence and the restoration after subsidence stops. The center of the subsidence circle dosen’t lower as much as the subsidence rate, which indicates that sediment is transported to the center. Sediment is supplied to the area ofsubsidence by the adjacent main channel. The result proves the sediment transport principle underlying the hybrid model that sediment is always transported along the gradient of the sediment demand.","Sea-level rise; Tidal basin; Subsidence; Numerical model; Sensitivity Analysis; Morphodynamic equilibrium","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","52.0126341,4.3555860"

Perovskite (PVK) absorbers show great versatility thanks to compositional and bandgap engineering. In this MSc Thesis Project, multications mixed-halides PVK thin-films of composition CsxFA1-xPbI3-xBrx are developed. Multiple-source layer-by-layer thermal evaporation and sequential thermal evaporation/spin coating hybrid synthesis techniques are investigated because of their compatibility with non-flat substrates. As they would enable the conformal growth of PVK on the microsized pyramidal textured surface of a c-Si- based solar cell, the long-term goal is the application in a monolithic (2-T) PVK/Si tandem. PVK engineering is carried out through tuning the main processing parameters with the aim of obtaining high-quality absorber layers. The optimisation of the PVK thin-films is based on criteria such as composition, phase, bandgap, crystallinity, homogeneity, uniformity and charge carrier transport properties. After optimising the annealing thermal treatment, the homogeneous and uniform thin-films resulting from the thermal evaporation of CsBr, PbI2 and FAI show a highly crystalline photoactive α phase of PVK, as well as a sharp-edge absorption onset corresponding to a bandgap (Eg) of Eg=1.60 eV and high absorption coefficient (α) in the order of α=10^4-10^5 cm^-1. Then, the two-step spin coating technique is explored as a preliminary study to develop the hybrid method, with the aim of analysing the surface wettability and reactivity of an inorganic layer of PVK inorganic precursors (CsBr and PbI2) when an organic solution (FAI in IPA) is spun on it. In spite of the optimisation of the FAI solution spun volume and concentration and the annealing parameters, the spin-coated thin-films present a mixture of photoactive and non-photoactive phases, i.e. PbI2-xBrx and α-, γ- and δ-PVK phases. The ineffective interdiffusion reaction leading to inhomogeneous and non-uniform PVK thin-films shows that the processing parameters need further fine-tuning. However, as spin coating does not allow to deposit PVK on top of non-flat substrates, the thermal evaporation/spin coating hybrid method is developed. The solution of FAI in IPA has been spun on a thermally evaporated inorganic bilayer of CsBr/PbI2. Albeit incomplete conversion to PVK is under suspicion, the resulting α-PVK thin-film shows good crystallinity and homogeneity and acceptable uniformity. It also presents high absorption (A=70%) for λ&lt;500 nm (blue light) and low absorption for λ&gt;500 nm (from green to red light), although the bandgap of Eg=1.53 eV needs to be further optimised by adjusting the content of Cs+ and most importantly Br–. On top of that, for all the synthesis techniques under research some unsuccessfully deposited PVK thin-films show signs of thermal and atmospheric degradation, leading to the decomposition of the α phase of PVK and formation of PbI2 and other non-photoactive phases, along with poor optical properties. Such degradation phenomena, which might be ascribed to the ineffective incorporation of Cs+ leading to structural instabilities, highlights the difficulties and limitations of PVK engineering.","Solar Energy; Perovskite; Thermal evaporation; Hybrid Method; Texture","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Materials Science and Engineering","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","The ongoing Covid-19 pandemic has led to an unprecedented public health crisis worldwide starting from the early days of 2020. Alongside the medical concerns, a set of measures called non-pharmacological interventions (NPIs) affected daily lives of people drastically, in turn having a negative impact on subjective well-being (Berg, 2021; Wang et al., 2020a, b).<br/>One of the evident reasons for this is the obstruction of daily activities and disrupted routines of people. From a humanistic perspective routines and habits are built towards positive experiences as our behaviors are motivated by need fulfillment, and hence they are reliable sources contributing to one’s subjective well-being. Research by Desmet and Fokkinga (2020) states that there are 13 universal psychological human needs that are the basic requirements for the functioning of an organism. Supported by a body of research, these needs are ‘built-in’ to the human nature that fulfillment of them is subject to enhance a person’s feelings of well-being (Ryff &amp; Keyes, 1995; Ryan &amp; Deci, 2000). This project focuses on contributing to the subjective well-being of young adults in daily life in the context of Covid-19, and for this theory of 13 Fundamental Needs is chosen to be operationalized.<br/>The dynamics of 13 Fundamental Needs were explored for future possibilities to operationalize the theory and to understand the daily manifestations of need fulfillment by collecting daily moments. Through this intervention research, how the theory can be operationalized was explored. The observations of the intervention using this need-based theory showed an opportunity to lead people towards new and fulfilling engagements in daily life within the limits of the current NPIs.<br/>Based on this understanding a constructive framework, influenced by experiential learning model, was built on sustaining enjoyable engagements. According to this framework people would be motivated to repeat engagements either when they find or they think they will find joy through these engagements. <br/>Generative interviews were conducted with 11 young adults to understand the effect of Covid-19 on their daily lives and routines, and in terms of need fulfillment. These interviews showed five main influential factors within the context, leading to languishing: not feeling in control and not motivated to take action, accompanied by a limited perception of behavior space.<br/>Personas were developed in order to understand and address each of their needs better. The framework was detailed further as the findings were implemented. This new layer added to the framework defined the point of intervention using a need-based tool as well as the moment. The scope of the project was narrowed down to converting daily activities into pursuits of joy. Design criteria was refined and design vision was set as: encouraging young adults who are languishing to pursue joy in daily life by facilitating an experiential understanding and exploration of 13 sources of joy. Towards this goal a concept was created and refined through an iterative design process. Cue cards under 13 categories were created that lead to authentic and fulfilling experiences that makes the user focus on each of the 13 Fundamental Needs individually through the same activity. The concept was tested as a card set through the final test with 6 users over the course of 10 days, and the framework was validated as the need-based intervention led to sustained enjoyable experiences. A last set of iterations were made to design the user journey of the concept better to accompany long term use. Unravel_cooking kit was created as the design implementation of the final concept: an explorative journey that aims to show how a mundane activity that has been overlooked can bear so many enjoyments.","Well-being; Humanistic approach; Covid-19; Languishing; 13 Fundamental Needs; Experiential learning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

The outcome of LCA analysis is measured in terms of Global Warming Potential (GWP), Primary Energy Demand (PED) and Energy Pay Back Time (EPBT). Ecoinvent 3.5 is used as the primary database for these analyses to select the inventory. GWP is assessed using the CML-IA baseline method while PED is assessed using Cumulative energy demand v1.11 method. Sensitivity analysis is done by changing the location of production and up-scaling capacity. <br/><br/>The installation stage is observed to contribute the highest GWP and also has the highest PED on account of BoS components. The LCA analysis has demonstrated similar trends of GWP, PED for all three product lines. EPBT on the other hand, is longer for 10% tandem cell on account of relatively larger module area as compared to 12% tandem cell and also the relatively higher energy consumption as compared to the single junction cell. The choice of substrate material is seen to impact the assessment indicators significantly. Flexible glass is observed to be the optimal choice for large-scale production. The choice of encapsulant material also affects the indicators demonstrably. Sensitivity analysis shows a positive impact on the indicators through up-scaling, while the location is not established as a significant factor sufficiently under considered assumptions.","LCA,; film Silicon-based HyET solar cells; GWP; thin film solar cells; EPBT; PED","en","master thesis","","","","","","This project describes about the Life Cycle Assessment analysis of thin film Silicon-based HyET solar cells and their comparison to different substrate technologies","","2023-11-29","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

The power-based side-channel attacks are powerful among several side-channel attacks. This attack methods use the relationship between the leakage model and power traces to reveal the secret key.

Based on the property of the neural network, the linear relationship can be easily broken. Furthermore, the spiking neural network is more hardware-friendly than a conventional neural network.

The help of the FPGA attack platform demonstrates that the proposed design can resist DPA, CPA, Template Attacks, and Deep Learning-based attacks.The developed model is focused on the design phase of the New Sluices and it showed the impact of scope change on the project progress. The simulations resulted in 19 months of delay compared to the initial duration of the project. Moreover, it was shown that the impact of the second order effect contributed within 10 months of that delay. Finally, two further investigations were conducted regarding staff morale and optimism bias. The results showed that uncertainties and poor risk management can impact the staff morale through rework, lack of transparency, and bad leadership. To overcome the loss of morale the presence of a skilled manager and implementing an effective risk management system, where all the different types of project risks are incorporated is essential. Regarding the optimism bias research, it was shown that optimism bias influenced the decision-making process in the project. It was hypothesized that it resulted from the ‘Accumulation of Planning Fallacy’ that was happening during the iterations of the planning process. The proposed solution for overcoming optimism bias was the usage of the ‘outside view’, when forecasting the costs, durations, and benefits of the projects. ‘Outside view’ would bypass optimism bias and produce more accurate predictions.","spiking neural networks; Hardware Security; AES; Artifical neural networks","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Circuits and Systems","",""

The primary aim of this thesis project was to determine the suitable dimensions of a micro cantilever iEAP, specifically Ionic polymer metal composite (IPMC) to generate appropriate flow rate for the projected diaphragm micropump. In addition to that, dynamics of the IPMC cantilever actuator was examined in dry environment. To achieve this the actuator tip - force, tip-displacement and longevity tests were performed. The results at macroscopic scale were tentatively explained with molecular characteristics of the material. As a result, it was shown that an IPMC cantilever actuator of millimetric size possesses viscoelastic properties and classical mechanical theories cannot be used to validate the experimental results. Secondly, the actuation results for 0.1 and 1 Hz align with the input driving frequency.

These devices are used for determining the chemical concentrations (pH, glucose, protein, nitrite, etc.) of the body fluids (blood, urine, sweat, saliva, etc.) to monitor organ functionality and ensure early diagnosis of potential diseases. The test paper strips can be analyzed by comparing the colour changes on the test strip to the existing colour chart either by the operator’s visual interpretation or by a smartphone-based automated system which is a fairly new technology from the past decade. Apart from being time consuming, the manual (naked eye) interpretation of results is subject to the robustness of the clinicians’ eyesight and ambient lighting conditions that may potentially introduce an error while obtaining results. This presented the need to automate this process of colour detection. Despite the faster computation speed of smartphone-based systems, they may introduce image acquisition related errors owing to the varying camera resolutions in different smartphone models. Smartphones also face the issue of poor battery backup and software (in)compatibility. There exists a research gap in terms of an automated technology that is ASSURED: A = Affordable, S = Sensitive, S =Specific, U = User-friendly, R = Rapid &amp; Robust, E = Equipment-free, D = Deliverable. These are the requirements proposed by the World Health Organization (WHO) for commercial medical sensors. In this study, we try to overcome the shortcomings of smartphone-based technology while adhering to the ASSURED criteria. We present a fully functioning prototype of a 3D printed Raspberry-Pi microcontroller based paper strip reader with a rechargeable battery and consistent illumination. The device is paired with a backend Python program and a user-friendly GUI to display the results. The device also has a feature to export the results with one click to your clinician via email. APSR algorithm is 88.7% accurate and the speed of operation is≈5s which is faster than the best speed reported in the literature yet. The future scope involves making use of Machine Learning and Deep Learning to further improve the algorithm.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Biomedical Engineering | Bioelectronics","",""

At certain conditions, acid injection results in a formation of highly conductive channels, e.g. wormholes. The associated rock matrix dissolution is highly nonlinear and may influence the fluid flow as well as rock properties. Wormhole patterns and breakthrough time are mainly controlled by acid strength and injection rate. Due to high complexity and, therefore, high computational cost, existing conventional simulators usually do not include complex chemical reactions or use weak (sequential) coupling of flow with reactive transport. Although the sequential approach is good for various applications, it is limited by the CFL condition and might suffer from poor convergence. In this project, we investigate the wormhole phenomenon to provide a stable fully implicit method (FIM) to numerically solve the reactive flow and transport problem coupled with equilibrium and kinetic reactions associated with the acid injection. The developed framework is aimed to predict a pattern of dissolution as well as wormhole breakthrough time. For an accurate description of species interactions, we directly connect PHREEQC equilibrium computation with FIM framework for kinetic dissolution using the Element Balance approach. This coupling was achieved with an application of a recently introduced Operator-Based Linearization scheme utilized within a Delft Advanced Research Terra Simulator (DARTS).","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In order to reach this goal, the second generation of photovoltaic technology has been based on thin films.<br/>This thesis study, as a part of Flamingo PV project in collaboration with HyET company, focuses on development of a-Si:H/nc-Si:H/nc-Si:H triple-junction solar cell on aluminium substrate. The objective is to achieve a stabilised efficiency higher than 14% and an open-circuit voltage in the range of 1.7 and 1.9 V. The implementation of a performing solar device will ultimately move to Roll-to-Roll fabrication on large scale and provide a new competitive product in terms of flexibility, light-weight and cost-effectiveness.<br/>The investigation has been largely built on optical modelling implemented with GENPRO4 soft- ware. Initially, the light model and the applied texturing have been validated for the triple junc- tion architecture. An algorithm has been developed to find the thickness of active layers in current matching condition and enhance the spectral utilisation. The design of the solar cell has been anal- ysed by changing layers thickness or materials towards an optimised optical performance.<br/>By conducting a sensitivity analysis on the intrinsic layers thickness, it was found that an al- teration of ±5% affects more the photo-generation in the middle sub-cell. Moreover, the analysis carried out on back reflector has shown the silver metal to be more favourable than aluminium. It enhances the reflectivity properties, especially for the bottom sub-cell which is the current limiting junction. Further improvements have been found through the inclusion of an encapsulant at the front side. The embedding of the triple-junction solar cell with a stack of anti-reflective coatings increases the light trapping above 4% on average, improving the photo-generated current density by 0.5 mA/cm2 in each of the intrinsic layers.<br/>Several thicknesses combinations have been modelled for current matched active layers, but only some of them resulted to be feasible. This has emerged that the spectral utilisation may achieve 27.3 mA/cm2 and 28.5 mA/cm2 with the encapsulant integration. The FTO is currently deposited as front reflector in thin films on Al substrate due to its good opto-electrical properties. However, the front reflector performance may be improved by developing a series of different transparent conductive materials. Alternatively, the FTO material may be replaced by IOH with better transparency property and still high conductivity in the near infra-red region of the solar spectrum.<br/>The optical modelling has been an essential tool to forecast the multi-junction operation in ex- perimental section of this work. The fabrication of thin-film solar cells has been divided into two main research areas: Si-based triple-junction devices on Al substrate and GeSn:H thin-films. For the former, two deposition series have been processed to analyse the enhancement of electrical parameters when the absorber layers are current matched. Furthermore, other elements of IV group besides silicon have been examined to achieve a low energy bandgap alloy and increase the light absorption at long wavelength of light spectrum. The first attempts have been investigated for amorphous and nanocrystalline materials based on germanium and tin with an achievable bandgap energy of 0.9 eV.<br/>To conclude, a comprehensive optical modelling has been developed for Si-based triple-junction device on Al substrate. This aims to provide a potential pathway towards the fabrication of a new and efficient flexible and lightweight solar cell technology.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

Consequently, the industry of fraud detection has seen a significant growth in scale, but moves slowly in comparison to the ever-changing nature of fraudulent behavior. As the monetary losses associated with financial fraud continue to grow, so does the need for efficient automated decision making systems. Simple decision making rules are often still the industry standard and only show decent results in the short-term, as reverse-engineering such rules is an easy task for smart fraudsters. Supervised learning systems as automated fraud detectors have shown promising results across the field, but are plagued by challenges uniquely prevalent in the field. Disproportional class imbalance in fraudulent transactions, as well as fraudsters continually adopting new schemes make training robust and generally applicable machine learning models an arduous task. This work introduces a novel machine learning pipeline, which makes use of carefully selected synthetic samples of this minority class to augment the training dataset of the supervised model. Synthetic samples representing fraudulent transactions are filtered based on a novel technique to quantify their expected performance as an adversarial example, using both data-driven and human-expert-driven techniques. By providing the supervised model with high-quality synthetic adversarial examples, we aim to improve its generalizability to never-seen-before fraudulent behavior and, in turn, improve its robustness to the volatile nature of financial fraud. Our results show that weakly-supervised models trained on our augmented datasets are able to detect 7% more fraudulent transactions compared to a baseline model trained on the standard dataset, at the cost of a 1% increase in false positives. Our calculations further show that applying this system could lead to a decrease of 1/6 in monetary losses incurred by financial fraud.","Supervised Learning; Synthetic Data Generation; Adversarial Examples; Transaction Monitoring","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this industry suction cups are used to temporarily attach a product to a case packing robot. The detachment of products from the suction cup gripper threatens throughput. In, some cases, the industry notes robots to operate at only 40 picks per minute. This is 30 % of their maximum throughput. <br/>This study aims to gain a better understanding of the dynamic grasping strength<br/>of suction cups. This was done by reviewing the state-of-the-art from industry and state-of-the-practice from literature. It was found that suction cups are the best overall gripper class, and that actuation time poses the main limiting factor for other grippers to perform well in this industry.<br/>Secondly, a six-axis force moment sensor that passes airflow for gripper actuation and without limiting the pull-out load measurement performance was designed, fabricated, and validated. With the current sensor technology, the vacuum hose must be placed over the sensor, leading to the generation of parasitic loads. Passing the airflow through the senor structure is essential to eliminate loads otherwise induced by the stiff vacuum hose. The sensor was designed using strain gauges and a Maltese cross sensor structure. Finite Element Modeling and optimization using sequential quadratic programming was used to determine the dimensions of the sensor. The sensor validation showed a maximum measurement error of 8% in the z direction.<br/>Lastly, with the validated sensor, the dynamic grasping strength of compliant and stiff suction cups was measured using motion paths and products that are typically seen in the packaged food industry. For both the stiff and compliant suction cups, the moment around the axis perpendicular to the plane of motion showed to be a leading factor in detachment of a product from a suction cup gripper. The failure of stiff suction cups is explained by impulse loading, this results in peaks in the load in the force in horizontal direction and the moment perpendicular to the plane of motion. For the compliant suction cups, the detachment was found to be caused by accelerating downwards while the product was not in the center of the gripper. These results have led to the recommendation of two gripper designs. The first, is a suction cup-underactuated hybrid gripper. The second design intently provides rotation freedom to reduce the moment loading on the suction cup. The second design<br/>requires input-shaping to reduce the vibrations at the end of the motion cycle.<br","Suction cups; high-speed case packing; packaged food industry; six-axis force moment sensor; Maltese cross sensor; strain gauges; airflow integration; Finite Element Modeling; optimization; experimental measurements; dynamic grasping strength; robotization; grippers","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-11-26","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Mechatronic System Design (MSD)","FlexCRAFT",""

Each generation behaves differently at the workplace and requires different sets of strategies for effective management. Generation-Z or Gen-Z are individuals born in 1995 and after. They are called the 'digital natives since they grew up in a fast-moving, highly-connected environment influenced by social media. Research indicates they are a unique generation with a different mindset compared to previous generations. Employees from previous generations are ageing and soon, Gen-Z individuals would be joining the workforce. This brings us to the question: Are HR professionals (and organisations) ready for the new generation of employees? <br/>This research is an attempt to question the relevance of current HR practices and then bridge the gap on how HR professionals could update their HR policy-making strategies in accordance with the preferences, priorities and characteristics of Gen-Z individuals. This could help HR professionals attract the right talent and retain them longer. <br/>A theoretical framework of the relationship between HRM practices and individual behaviour mediated by HRM perceptions is developed. These perceptions are influenced positively when practices are developed based on common characteristics of employees. And in this case, Gen-Z samples are chosen to investigate these characteristics to passively influence HRM perceptions which would lead to effective management of Gen-Z employees. Three HR managers, two-line managers from multinational corporations and three Gen-Z individuals with work experience, three Gen-Z individuals without work experience and one Gen-Z individual with entrepreneurship background are selected to conduct semi-structured interviews to answer the above exploitative research question qualitatively. All the Gen-Z individuals and managers are from the Netherlands and have worked/worked in multinational companies with structured HR departments in them. <br/>Research results firstly indicate a mismatch in understanding Gen-Z between line managers and HR managers. Then a list of work-life priorities of Gen-Z recognised are: flexibility, diversity &amp; inclusion, human connect, transparency and environmental/sustainability involvement; common preferences are: work-life balance, technology interaction, contribute towards society, travel, flat hierarchy, instant feedback from managers, purpose/goal to work towards and finally characteristics are: tech-savvy, adaptable, open to change, highly connected and negative characteristics are: short span of focus, easily distracted, easily influenced by social media &amp; pop-culture. This information is used to chart recommendations for HR professionals and provide a simple framework to assist them to navigate Gen-Z employee negotiations. <br/>In conclusion, this research explores an upcoming, vastly unexplored field of HRM combined with Generational diversity focused on Gen-Z.

Whilst the initial costs can be higher, this method of construction claims to have cost benefits over conventional construction. These are the benefits of construction speed and residual value at the end of lifespan amongst others. Modular buildings are also often advertised as sustainable, because the credentials gained from lean manufacturing coincide with a selection of sustainability objectives [1]. Healthcare projects have higher requirements and process hurdles, which make construction in healthcare much more complex than in the residential sector. However, in the UK, a study of offsite manufacture and modular volumetric construction methods concluded it to be the cost efficient solution necessary for the NHS, which led to 40 modular hospitals planned to be built until the year 2030 [2]. This means that the benefits and drawbacks of a modular approach must be weighed, and this is done in the Dutch context. A life cycle costing is proposed as the fitting tool of assessment.<br/><br/>Interviews were held with Dutch modular contractors to reveal the capabilities and specifics of building in a modular way and find proof for each cost factor. Experts in healthcare construction were interviewed to determine healthcare project priorities and find out whether these are catered for by modular construction. A live construction project of a hotfloor department was then studied. Several options competed in the tender project and were compared in the case study. By collecting the cost quotes and arguing for the monetary value of the identified cost factors, a life cycle cost calculation was done. Additionally, sustainability was considered by calculating the novel carbon tax. To expand the application of results to other projects, sensitivity studies were carried out for each life cycle cost parameter.<br/><br/>The study found that there is application for modular construction in healthcare in the Netherlands. Facilities, which do not host medical installations, do not differ to the construction used in residential modules. As for facilities such as the studied hotfloor department, larger modules and a lesser degree of finish offsite decreases the competitiveness of this construction approach. However, several evident cost factors were proposed to be considered within a life cycle costing. These were earlier income due to faster construction, a gain due to less interest and the residual value. It was found that these considerations allow for a 49,0% increase on the initial cost of a modular option in comparison to a conventional option. A hypothesis was further proposed, stating that the competitiveness of the modular option depends on three criteria. These include the initial modular option costs being up to 49,0% more expensive; the saving in construction time having a monetary value to the client; and life cycle costing results being used in total cost comparison.","Life Cycle Costing; Modular Construction; Healthcare; Sensitivity Study; Offsite Construction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Building Engineering - Structural Design","",""

Team diversity could bring different perspectives and thus diverse teams could reap the benefits such as better performance, innovation, and problem-solving abilities. Teams face challenge of deciding between alignment activities focused on organizational goals vs adaptability activities helping organizations adapt to changing external environments. Teams that balance both types of activities are known as ambidextrous teams. Through literature review, it was found that there is knowledge gap in understanding the link between team diversity, performance, and ambidexterity. This thesis tries exploring various diversity factors and its relation to team performance and ambidexterity. Further the thesis investigates if there are any differences in the link between team diversity, performance and ambidexterity based on firm types, that is product vs service-based firms.<br/>To find the solution to the link, semi-structured case interviews was conducted. 6 team managers from product-based firms and 4 managers from service-based firms participated in the research. Data from these 10 semi-structured case interviews was analyzed using AtlasTi software and results of qualitative research is presented in the thesis. Various ways in which one can conceptualize diversity, advantages &amp; disadvantages of diversity and its effect on team performance &amp; ambidexterity is presented in this thesis based on the qualitative analysis of semi-structured case interviews.<br/>The exploratory study indicates that semi-conductor team mangers conceptualize diversity from both social and information/decision making perspectives. Common surface level diversities such as function, experience, gender etc. were reported. At the same surface level diversities such as working style, task motivation, etc. were reported. The results indicate that teams various diversity factors can lead to divergent thinking and elaboration of task-relevant information thus improving team performance. Some of the reported benefits of diversity include increased knowledge base, better service to customers, better decision making, etc. Realization of diversity benefits is not straightforward; it comes with challenges. Some of these challenges due to diversity include complex team management, increased conflicts, increased time and effort. Thus, it is important for organizations to provide necessary support and environment for reaping the benefits from diversity. Such organizational control is more in terms of structures of teams in case of product-based firms; structural decisions drive ambidexterity and division could take place based on diversity types such as functional diversity, experience diversity etc. However, decentralized structures and informalization of non-routine activities in firms can enable better exploration. And diversity types such as experience, function or skills act as deciding factors in determining extent of structural decentralization and informalization of non-routine activities. Decentralization of non-routine activities can thus enable ambidexterity. Contrary to product-based firm, all the service-based firms reported that employees need to have skills and abilities to capture customer needs and deliver them on time. Therefore, it is evident that all the employees in service-based firms could be involved in exploration. Thus, naturally the employees in service organizations are involved in both the types of activities. Diversities such as skill and working style can thus enable contextual ambidexterity in service-based firms by enabling employees to serve customers better.","Team Diversity; Team Ambidexterity; Team Performance; Exploration; Exploitation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

(mentor); van Rooij, Michel (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Evaluation of aircraft performance for design, certification, and maintenance purposes requires aerodynamic knowledge for the entire flight envelope of an aircraft. Simplified models that relate geometric properties and flight conditions of an aircraft to its aerodynamic properties are simply not sufficient anymore, as non-linear aerodynamic phenomena, e.g., vortex development and flow separation, can drastically influence the performance of an aircraft. Therefore, high-fidelity simulations and wind tunnel experiments are necessary to assess the performance of an aircraft sufficiently. Although the development of new technologies in the last centuries allowed the computational time of the high-fidelity simulations to be decreased significantly, the computational expense still remains large. New techniques that are used to simulate the load cases of an<br/>aircraft and evaluate its aerodynamic properties are therefore aimed to provide an accurate representation of the high-fidelity simulations while the numerical complexity and hence the computational cost of the model is reduced. These techniques can be referred to as Reduced-OrderModels (ROM).<br/><br/>Previous studies, conducted at the Royal Netherlands Aerospace Centre (NLR) as part of a collaborative research task group within the Science and Technology Organization (STO) of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO), investigated the development of different ROMs that should be able to accurately predict the surface pressure distribution of the MULti-DIsciplinary CONfiguration (MULDICON) Unmanned Combat Air Vehicle (UCAV). In particular, a ROM based on the neural network approach shows promising results but suffers from drawbacks such as inaccurate prediction of the surface pressure near the wing tip region and the exclusion of time-history effects. This thesis report will serve as a continuation of previous research done on the reduced-order modeling approach for the prediction of the surface pressure coefficients of the UCAV configuration and will provide a baseline for future research. The research objective for this thesis report is therefore to develop a CFD data-driven Reduced-Order Model (ROM) based on the neural network approach that is able to predict the surface pressure and integral aerodynamic load coefficients of the UCAV MULDICON design and is able to capture the transient effects of the flow field for different flight maneuvers with the capability to reach the same level of accuracy as high-fidelity tools. <br/><br/>In this thesis, a ROM is developed that makes use of a reduced-order basis that is constructed using Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD). The POD method decomposes the high-fidelity samples used to train the ROM into spatial POD modes that will be used for the reduced-order basis, that are ranked in order of contribution towards the total kinetic energy (TKE). A reduced-order basis with only 10 spatial POD modes already captures 99 % of the TKE, which includes the most dominant flow properties and can be used to project the full-order solution with an accuracy that is in the same orders of magnitude while the data that is used is minimized. A Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architecture is used as a surrogate model to determine the input-output relationship of the model. For this thesis, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture is used, which is widely used for the prediction of time-sequential data. The ROM that is constructed in this thesis is a combination between the POD method and the LSTM architecture, which can be referred to as the<br/>POD-LSTM model.<br/><br/>The performance of the POD-LSTM model has been evaluated and is split up into two different phases: the offline and online stages. The offline stage of the ROM is the stage where the reduced-order basis is constructed and the high-fidelity samples that are used for training are evaluated. From the offline stage, it can<br/>be concluded that the high-fidelity samples provide good coverage of the regressor space and most of the test samples have the same projection error as the high-fidelity training samples that are used for the construction of the reduced-order basis. The POD-LSTM model has been trained for varying model parameters and it was shown that the number of LSTM units has the largest influence on the computational training time. In the online stage, the performance of the prediction of the surface pressure coefficients using test samples that are gathered from steady and unsteady harmonic pitch and plunge oscillations are evaluated. The results for the steady simulations show that the POD-LSTM model is able to accurately predict the axial and normal force coefficient, while inaccuracy is shown for the pitching moment coefficient. The main reason for the inaccurate prediction of the pitching moment coefficient is the inaccurate prediction of the surface pressure coefficient near the wing tip region. Both the harmonic pitch and plunge oscillations show similar results,<br/>whereas the normal and axial force coefficients are predicted with good accuracy but the pitching moment coefficient is inaccurate due to an error in the surface pressure prediction near the wing tip region. The performance of the POD-LSTM model in terms of computational cost has been evaluated and was proven to be<br/>faster than previous studies, whereas the number of LSTM layers and LSTM units has the largest influence on the computational performance.<br/><br/>Overall, the POD-LSTM model has provided solutions to improve on previous studies for the surface pressure coefficient prediction of the UCAV configuration. However, it must be noted that this thesis report serves as a baseline for future research and the full capabilities of the POD-LSTM model still need to be exploited to provide a fair comparison with previous studies. Different training maneuvers, increase in training time and different model architectures could influence the performance of the POD-LSTM model and therefore should<br/>be incorporated in future studies to provide improvements to the proposed ROM.","CFD; Neural Network; Reduced-order model; POD; LSTM","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

(mentor); Steele-Dunne, S.C. (mentor); Lhermitte, S.L.M. (mentor); van der Vliet, Nils (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Dikes hold back water and protect the land behind it from flooding. Due to rising sea levels, land subsidence and more extreme weather patterns, the function of dikes become increasingly important. To ensure dike safety, dikes are regularly inspected. With about 22,500 kilometers of dikes in the Netherlands, this is a very slow, costly and time consuming process. Remote sensing could contribute to dike inspections as it can screen large areas in a short time period and more continuously monitor inspection parameters. Several studies have already assessed the use of remote sensing for different inspections parameters such as deformation, grass cover quality and seepage detection. An important parameter that affects dike stability is soil moisture, as effective stress and shear strength are directly related to soil moisture content. Intense periods of drought can lead to low soil moisture values which consequently decreases dike stability. On the other hand, excessive soil moisture can lead to excess pore water pressure and to a decrease in shear strength. Remote sensing would be an ideal way to monitor soil moisture within grass-covered dikes on large scale. In this study, it was assessed if remote sensing data can give a proxy for soil moisture for grass-covered dikes. This was investigated by using open- access optical and SAR remote sensing data, as this would be an ideal data source since it is freely available. Remote sensing data was obtained from satellite missions Landsat 7/8 and Sentinel 1/2. The majority of the research was conducted for two grass-covered regional dikes. First of all, it was assessed if a lagged relationship could be found between the average soil moisture value of a pixel, extracted from in-situ soil moisture sensors at 20 cm depth, and retrieved vegetation indices (GRR, MSR, NDVI, RVI and NDII) of a pixel. Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated for the harmonized Landsat 7 and 8 data set as the number of data from the single satellite missions was limited. Results show that (1) at lo- cation Bermweg a weak correlation was found (R=0.32-0.40) for the MSR, NDVI, RVI and NDII when the optimal lag of around 30 days was applied. A negligible correlation was found for the GRR (R=0.19); (2) at location Geer- weg, for one pixel, a negligible (R=0.12-0.16) correlation was found for all vegetation indices, except the NDII, when the optimal lag of 23 days was taken into account. A negative correlation was found for the other pixel. For the NDII a negligible correlation (R=0.13-0.28) was found for the two pixels when the optimal lag of 31 day was applied. The grass-cover at location Bermweg was maintained by grazing whereas at location Geerweg the grass was maintained by both grazing and mowing. Secondly, it was investigated if a (lagged) relationship could be found between SAR backscatter and in-situ soil moisture measurements at 20 cm depth. An increase in soil moisture results in an increase in backscatter. Since SAR measures only the top few centimeters of the soil, a lag was taken into account. In addition, it is known that there is a lagged correlation between root-zone soil moisture and LAI, which is also sensitive to backscatter (Jamalinia et al., 2019). A Pearson correlation analysis was performed to assess if there was a (lagged) relationship between soil moisture and retrieved backscatter. Only negative and negligible positive correlations were found, showing that SAR backscatter cannot give a proxy for soil moisture, as a positive correlation was expected. Lastly, a relationship was examined between cumulative precipitation deficit, which can give a proxy for soil moisture, and vegetation indices. The sample size of Landsat 8 and the harmonized Landsat 7 and 8 data set were large enough to demonstrate statistical significance (N &gt; 31). Results show that (1) at location Bermweg the optimal correlation was found for both data sets when a cumulative precipitation deficit period of around 15 days was taken into account. The correlation was negligible (R=0.24-0.36) for the harmonized Landsat 7 and 8 data set (statistically significant, with the exception of the NDVI and NDII) and moderate (statistically significant) for Landsat 8 (R=0.38-0.56); (2) at location Geerweg the cumulative period resulting in the optimal correlation was different for each satellite mission. A statistically significant weak correlation (R=0.47-0.57) was found for the harmonized Landsat 7 and 8 data set when a cumulative period of 20 days was taken into account. For Landsat 8 a statistically significant moderate correlation (R=0.49-0.62) was found for a cumulative period of 90 days. The overall pattern of the calculated correlation coefficients, when different cumulative periods were taken into account, vary largely for each satellite mission. All in all, no universal relationship could be found. The study has shown that vegetation indices and SAR backscatter cannot give an indication of soil moisture within dikes. No strong relationship was found between soil moisture and vegetation indices which can be assigned to noise introduced by various factors like management practices (i.e. mowing, grazing), other key fac- tors influencing vegetation state (i.e. nutrient availability, radiation), low spatial resolution, and scene-to-scene variability. These factors also influence the vegetation index and overrule the true soil moisture conditions. Moreover, the results show that cloud contamination hinders the use of optical remote sensing data for dike inspections as satellite imagery might not be available for extended periods of time, disabling to gain insight into the dynamics of vegetation indices over time. The insensitivity of SAR backscatter to soil moisture can be assigned to the fact that several parameters (i.e. surface roughness, vegetation, dike slope) can affect backscatter as much, or more than, soil moisture. Furthermore, the backscatter signal was extracted from a relatively small area and thus contains a large amount of noise. This also explains why backscatter was unable to give an indirect proxy of soil moisture by estimating the LAI.","SAR; Remote sensing; Vegetation Indices; Soil moisture; Satellite imagery; Sentinel; Landsat","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

They are the outer skin of a structure and are responsible for improving energy efficiency, while being both innovative and attractive. At the same time, façades need to accommodate requirements to withstand the outdoor environmental conditions. <br/>To meet all of these requirements, there is need for designers to either have knowledge on the different subjects, such as human comfort, sustainability, stability, among others; or work together with different specialist to achieve an ideal design.<br/><br/>Following a traditional design process, once the conceptual design is defined it goes through an iteration process between designing and detailing before reaching the manufacturing stage. This process, even though is already considered within the planning of a building, is highly time consuming. <br/><br/>Considering this process, the idea of bringing the manufacturing knowledge into the early design stages to speed up the design process was taken into consideration. The idea of bringing the manufacturing knowledge upwards in the design process would help designers, focus only on designing, while the considerations for product availability and manufacturing possibilities are already taken into account. <br/><br/>On the other hand, the increasing use of parametric modeling to improve building solutions, has been a growing field. In regards to façade design, the inclusion of free form architecture in the building industry has pushed the need for innovative solutions. It has been proved in these projects that the use of parametric modeling highly increases the speed in which designs are developed. However, the need to adapt existing products and manufacturing techniques to these complex geometries, generates more iteration times and increases the costs of the final product.<br/><br/>Now, imagine that not only the available products are adapted to the conceptual designs proposed, but that these designs include from their conceptual stages knowledge acquired from previous experience. This would help avoid the iterations between designers and manufacturers, plus would improve the possibilities of generating a bigger amount of modularity in the design process. <br/><br/>With these considerations, the proposal for this project aimed to develop a proof of concept tool that would be capable of encoding a manufacturers knowledge in a digital model, and use it to design a façade that is almost ready to manufacture. <br/>For this purpose, the knowledge and information from the façades manufacturer Vianen Kozijnen was used as base for the development of this tool. <br/><br/>Once this was established, the modelling phase for the façade design tool begun. Initially the input parameters were set, the knowledge is gathered from the company's input, allowing the designer to set up a model within the possibilities of the manufacturer. In the back end of the tool, the build-up of the main modular panel is generated. Four main variables were defined to generate the geometry of the panel and these are determined by the input parameters.<br/><br/>Next, with a finalized panel design, the testing phase is set in place. This phase was divided into two processes. First, the replication of the panel throughout an entire façade. This process begins with a conceptual shape that will be filled with the already designed panel. The results from this process determine the total amount of modular panels and the percentage and amount of customized panels needed. <br/><br/>Secondly, the panel is tested for Building Physics aspects relevant in early design stages, which for this case were daylight and sound proofing. The tool then with the geometrical parameters given, includes simulations for both daylight and sound proofing. The results obtained, give information on the performance of the design. For daylight simulations, the results given are for daylight autonomy and daylight factor; and for sound proofing the results obtained give information on the insulation value of the façade, sound proofing of the structure and typical sound proofing. Both results, are information that is useful during early design stages, and can help shape the final project. <br/><br/>To test the functionality of the tool, the Sluishuis building was taken as a case study and the tool was applied to design and test one of the façade surfaces of the building.<br/><br/>The results obtained through this case study led to conclude the feasibility of encoding manufacturing knowledge. It was determined that as a proof of concept approach the tool generates almost immediate results that include the knowledge needed for manufacturing. However, to be applied into a real project further improvements need to be made; with more focus on, first, being able to apply the tool to a completed building and secondly, include more manufacturers knowledge to generate a library of possibilities; making it useful in real life projects.","Façades; Automation; Design Process","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Building Engineering","",""

(mentor); Stikkelman, R.M. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","In this thesis the potential of demand response among households in The Netherlands is studied. The methodology is based on the conceptual design of an Agent-Based Model for the adoption of domestic demand response by households. From this model the subsequent flexibility in the electricity system will be brought forward.<br/><br/>A review of the current literature has made apparent that the total potential of the flexibility in households is not clear. Previous research has studied the potential in some appliances to perform demand response actions and this has led to some insight in appliance performance as flexibility providers. Moreover, top-down system studies have looked at households consumption and have derived flexibility potential through this method. However, a bottom-up analysis of household potential for demand response has not been performed; let alone for the Dutch electricity system. <br/><br/>Moreover, the willingness of households to adopt domestic demand response has not been researched. This is an important factor in determining the total flexibility that can become available to the system. <br/><br/>The analysis provided some key findings. Firstly, there are at least 7 types of highly prevalent appliances in Dutch households that are suitable for providing flexibility to the grid. High consumption and continuously operating appliances offer the greatest potential in terms of all-time flexibility, but other appliances can still be very useful for peak mitigation. Especially with the low investment costs for ""unlocking"" the flexibility in these devices over time, a large set of appliances can provide useful flexibility.<br/><br/>Moreover, household analysis showed that most clusters of households already have high importance for energy efficient behaviour and the spread of the number of appliances in households is low.<br/><br/>Finally, the policy analysis provided insight in the types of policy measures that can be encountered in the future. Regulatory change that will make it easier for aggregators and utilities to provide ancillary services with aggregated loads will benefit the system, but are difficult to incorporate in the conceptual design of the model. Providing more insight for consumers into their own consumption and capacity subscriptions are other measures that could motivate households in one way or another to perform domestic demand response. Moreover, some form of mandatory offerings of 'smart' appliances could make sure households have demand response ready appliances in their homes. <br/><br/>By reviewing the technology, policy and consumer behavior, the research has analysed the state of development of domestic demand response. The Diffusion of Innovations theory together with the archetype identification shows which archetypes are more likely to adopt and which archetypes are more likely to be considered opinion leaders. <br/>The influence of different policy measures is seen both in households themselves and their willingness to adopt as with the technologies that will enable providing flexibility.","Diffusion of Innovations; Demand Response; Residential","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

Sun has been a source of energy for human civilization since agrarian times. With the recent developments in science and technology, Solar energy has evolved as the front runner to power the future energy needs. The plentiful, eco-friendly, and abundant solar energy resource has been evolved from the first generation solar comprising of crystalline silicon based solar panels to second generation photovoltaic cells.<br/><br/>This work is based on the scope of the FlamingoPV project which is the collaboration between TU Delft and HyET Solar, Netherlands, to realize large scale commercialization of second generation thin film flexible solar cells. The second generation solar cells offer flexibility, economic viability, and ease of manufacturing. To reach the desired goals of roll-to-roll production of a-Si:H/nc-Si:H and a-Si:H/nc-Si:H/nc-Si:H with stabilized efficiencies of 13\% and 14\% respectively, various production processes need to be optimized.<br/><br/>The current production line at HyET Solar faces losses in performance due to high open circuit resistance and low parallel (shunt) resistance. Moreover, the lab processing route needs to be optimized to improve the yield of the samples produced. The sputtering process of depositing the back contact is considered as one of the potential causes of low shunt resistances in the lab samples. Hence, the sputtering process is optimized for electrical and optical properties. The effect of sputtering pressure and RF power is understood to develop dense and compact films for the Aluminium doped Zinc Oxide (AZO) films used in the back contact of the solar cell stack. It is found that a lower sputtering pressure provides better optical and electrical properties. Furthermore, optical simulation from GenPro4 suggest an increase in intrinsic layer absorption under specific conditions of AZO deposition.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the monolithic series interconnection process at HyET Solar is a bottleneck in the lab processing route. Additionally, the laser power used for scribing is not optimized for tandem and triple junction solar cells. To ensure faster learning cycles for understanding the quality of the silicon layers deposited a novel way of processing solar cells is developed. This approach helps to distinguish various losses generated in the solar cell and ensures quality control in the production line. Finally, a series of triple junction solar cells deposited on the aluminum substrate is processed without laser scribing to demonstrate the possibilities of the process. <br/><br/>The PECVD tool at HyET Solar needs to be optimized to deposit good quality bottom cell for the micromorph solar cells. The continuous variable thickness series have been used to understand Lambert Beer relation for short circuit current density and deposition thickness. The ASA software is used to simulate case studies for troubleshooting deposition of the bottom cell. The results from the electrical simulation are used to understand the problems with the silane dilution ratios in the previous PECVD runs. Furthermore, the results of the simulation suggest the sensitivity of the process to ensure good quality nanocrystalline silicon deposition. It is observed that the first layer of growth is very critical for the nanocrystalline silicon deposition while after a certain thickness of nanocrystalline silicon inclusion of amorphous material does not affect the properties of the absorber layer. <br/><br/>Overall, the production process has been optimized from the lab scale to the industrial scale. One of the causes of low performance in solar cells has been addressed. The bottleneck in the production of lab samples has been addressed ensuring good quality material for faster learning cycles. The deposition conditions for the growth of nanocrystalline silicon have been analyzed. This can help in troubleshooting the production process and maintaining a high-quality deposition process.","thin film solar cells; Flexible solar cells; PECVD","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-11-01","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","Flamingo PV",""

Fs/ps CARS thermometry can greatly benefit from an investigation of the spectrochronographic properties of the ps pulses, removing the filter.

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution); Universiteit Leiden (degree granting institution)","2021","In May 2019, the Dutch Council of State rejected the national approach for reducing nitrogen emissions in Dutch nature. Farmers were targeted by the policy change: all licenses for agricultural expansion were revoked, affecting the financial livelihoods of farmers. Farmers did not take this well and, using social media platforms, started organising large-scale demonstrations. Twitter flushed with posts about the demonstrations, and pictures and videos of the event went viral. Demonstrations result from social unrest, and social unrest starts with public dissatisfaction. The Nitrogen Crisis showed it is in the interest of decision-makers to monitor what negative feelings the public holds towards policies and act on these, before these feelings grow into social unrest. Twitter is a social media platform many users come to for expressing their opinions. Because of this, this study looks at what insights can be derived from Twitter about events, like demonstrations, that took place during the Nitrogen Crisis. For this, this study applies two Natural Language Processing methods: sentiment analysis and topic modelling (LDA). These methods are combined in order to create more insightful and interpretable results than the methods individually could provide. Two interviews are held with an expert on the Nitrogen Crisis to provide context on the crisis and to identify major events that received a lot of media attention. The events are plotted with- and compared to the results of sentiment analysis and topic modelling. In doing so, the following research question is answered:<br/>How can sentiment analysis and topic modelling be applied to Twitter data to provide insights for decision-makers retrospectively about major events during the Dutch Nitrogen Crisis?<br/>For sentiment analysis, two Dutch sentiment analysis tools are implemented and compared to the sentiment scores of 100 tweets by three annotators to select the best performing one. For topic modelling, a grid search is performed to choose the combination of timeframe and number of topics that result in the set of topic models that have the highest mean topic coherence. Also, a method is proposed for using topic models to represent changes in the topics discussed on Twitter over time. This is used not only to compare subsequent topic models per sentiment that are one week apart, but also topic models that are 4 weeks apart. <br/>This research develops a fully functioning pipeline for collecting and processing tweets, applying sentiment analysis and topic modelling and plotting the outcomes. This pipeline has been validated at various points, leading to a scientifically viable methodology. <br/>Unexpectedly, it is not sentiment analysis or topic modelling results that have the most obvious connection with the events identified: it is an increase in tweets during events. Therefore, while lacking better tools, decision-makers are recommended to monitor pre-determined topics on Twitter and implement a way to be notified when a significant change in volume of tweets takes place. The combination of sentiment analysis and topic modelling as implemented in this research is either not advanced enough to provide useful information to decision-makers, or sentiment analysis and topic modelling simply cannot provide insightful results on the Dutch Nitrogen Crisis. However, because there is an extensive amount of research applying these methods to social media data around various political events with valuable results, it is recommended to perform more experiments with this approach, and the quality of each research step needs to be further improved in order to draw final conclusions on the usefulness of the combination of sentiment analysis and topic modelling for decision-makers during policy crises. Various improvements for each step in this research are suggested to gain more precise, insightful and interpretable results. In summary, this study and the pipeline it proposes can serve as a solid basis for further development into a process that provides ready-to-use information to decision-makers. <br","Nitrogen Crisis; Sentiment Analysis; Topic Modelling; Twitter analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Industrial Ecology","",""

(mentor); Ross, Robert (graduation committee); Cremer, Jochen (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Since the introduction of SF6 in the 1950s, gas-insulated high voltage circuit breakers and Gas-insulated switchgear (GIS) have improved considerably, in particular concerning required drive energy for operation, compactness, and reliability. Nevertheless, high voltage insulation design has become increasingly challenging in recent years. Customer demands for reducing the physical footprint of HV equipment has led to an increase in operational field stress and therefore, much higher pressure on tolerances and increased susceptibility to defects. Dielectric design is based on how electrostatic fields are distributed and how much stress they can generate. In the course of conducting the intensive theoretical and experimental investigations on the dielectric design of insulation systems applied to high voltage power and pulsed power applications, it is becoming necessary to consider the influence of phenomena that have not been considered before. On top of that, as SF6 is one of the greenhouse gases listed in the Kyoto Protocol, SF6 usage regulations have been implemented in many industries. In Europe, SF6 is regulated under the F-Gas directive, which bans<br/>or restricts its use for several purposes. Several studies have indicated that CO2 is a viable alternative to SF6 for the transmission and distribution of electricity.<br/><br/>In this context, this project aims to investigate a potential new phenomenon, the<br/>occurrence of secondary discharges caused by propagating streamer or leader discharges in HV gas insulation. Learning more about such phenomena can help us improve the dielectric design or perhaps explain the occurrence of breakdowns reported in high voltage equipment for which no obvious cause could be found. Specifically, CO2/O2 mixtures will be studied, and its results compared to SF6. Breakdown in gaseous insulation is caused by propagating discharges that are external in ambient air, e.g. on a bushing, or inside high-pressure insulation, e.g. across the surface of a GIS insulator. During the propagation of such discharges and flashovers (streamer or leader), transient electric field enhancement may occur, leading the local fields to exceed the inception fields at other locations. This can result in secondary discharges.<br/><br/>Dielectric experiments using Image Intensifier and Photomultiplier tubes (PMT)<br/>have been conducted at three different pressure ranges; SF6 and CO2/O2 were selected as the insulation mediums. A negative polarity electric field is expected to trigger the secondary discharge. An analysis of images obtained from optical investigations and time lag records obtained from PMT signals suggested that secondary discharges can occur at low pressures (0.2MPa) in both SF6 and CO2/O2. At higher pressures (0.4 to 0.6MPa), no secondary discharges were detected. The reason for this is that, at higher pressures, the breakdown field is higher leading to a faster propagation of discharge across that gap. Hence, the formative time lag of the discharge is very short (some 100푛푠 or less) and this short time is not sufficient for secondary discharge inception.<br/><br/><br","High voltage; Gas insulated system; CO2; SF6; Electrical breakdown; Electrical discharge mechanism","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-11-26","","","","Electrical Engineering | Electrical Power Engineering","",""

A powerful tool for the designs and fabrication of biomimetic composites is voxel-based multi-material 3D printing. Earlier researches mainly focused on using this technique in the creation of gradients based on morphology. While this is a great way to create a gradient, the outcome material properties are often unknown. In this research, we attempted to create a gradient based on the desired outcome material properties rather than morphology. We created a linear gradient in density using a voxel-based 3D printing technique and tested it through nanoindentation. Furthermore, we created a Finite Element Model based on this sample. Out of the nanoindentation and Finite Element Model results, we extracted the b-value for a power-law function in the form of E(x)= E_h 〖ρ(x)〗^b+E_s. With the inverse of this power-law function, we designed three different gradients based on the desired material properties: a linear, stepwise, and sigmoid gradient. Nanoindentation experiments and Finite Element analyses showed that we achieved the desired outcome in material properties with our newly created approach of designing gradients. However, the nanoindentation experiments showed that using a machine suitable for the wide range of Young’s moduli present in these kinds of composites is crucial. To display the possible applications of our new approach, we designed a knee model with graded ligaments and tested it with a tensile test and digital image correlation. Results of these tests showed an energy before failure that was twice as high as its non-graded counterpart. Furthermore, with the introduction of the gradient, we achieved to change to loading condition on the ligaments. Overall, our results show that our new approach can create gradients based on material properties rather than morphology and opens many new doors in creating biomimetic composites.","Functional gradients; Property-based; Biomimetics; Composites; hard-soft interfaces; Voxel-based additive manufacturing; 3D Printing; Finite Element Analysis; Finite Element Method; Bitmap; Multi-Material Additive Manufacturing; Gradient by design; Nanoindentation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-11-26","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

(graduation committee); Zhang, S. (mentor); Binnekamp, R. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Currently, Ordinary Portland cement (OPC) concrete accounts for the world's 8-10% anthropogenic carbon/ greenhouse (GHG) emissions, where 90-95% of the emissions are due to the production of OPC. A 200% increase in OPC demand is projected by 2050 from 2010 levels. Therefore, it is urgent to reduce these emissions arising from its production. Alkali-activated concrete (AAC) has gained significant attention from researchers worldwide for being a sustainable alternative to OPC concrete. AAC completely substitutes Portland cement with industrial by-products, such as BFS (blast furnace slag) and FA (fly ash). An alkaline activator is used to activate the BFS or FA to form a hardened binder. Despite comparable or even better technical performance than OPC concrete, worldwide usage of AAC is not yet observed. The challenges for the commercial scalability of AAC have rather increased with the onset of coal phase-out law in many parts of the world. This limits the availability of FA and thus forcing researchers to find alternative binders to make AAC, such as using BFS as the sole binder. Therefore, while other technologies develop and blast furnaces are phased-out, it is essential to effectively use the available BFS from the steel industries to produce alkali-activated slag concrete (AASC). Although various studies proved that AASC has significantly higher compressive strength than OPC concrete, numerous researchers have reported poor workability and rapid-setting. AASC also has higher drying &amp; autogenous shrinkage. However, despite having a higher autogenous shrinkage, AASC shows moderate-low cracking potential compared to OPC concrete. A self-compacting AASC is expected to follow the same behaviour. However, very few studies have focused on the self-compacting behaviour of AASC, which, therefore, limits AASC for various structural applications where an SCC is required. In order to upscale the commercialization, a comprehensive study is needed that provides detailed insights on the development of a SCAASC (without FA) with an appropriate mixture-design and optimization procedure, desirable fresh properties, hardened properties, sustainability analysis and commercial viability. Hence, the main research question is: Is it possible to develop a self-compacting alkali-activated concrete made from 100% BFS as a binder and currently available raw materials without using any FA? If so, What is the optimal mixture design that results in desirable fresh and hardened properties suitable for real structural applications? Is the developed concrete sustainable and ready for commercialization? And if not, what are the commercial barriers? Attempts are made to answer these questions through various laboratory experiments and stakeholder interviews. The final mixture design is developed in a 5 step optimization process. It involves studying the effect of a particle packing based mixture design method, curing temperature, silica modulus (Ms) content and different admixtures on the workability and compressive strength (1, 7 and 28 days) development of the SCAASC. In this process, an optimal mixture design with desired workability and strength properties is developed and an optimal curing and mixing regime is also suggested. This developed SCAASC is further tested for all the SCC like fresh properties. Various hardened properties such as compressive and splitting tensile strength, elastic modulus, Poisson’s ratio, bond strength to reinforcement, free drying and autogenous shrinkage are also investigated at different ages for different curing regimes. The cracking potential is also investigated for the first time using a TSTM (Temperature stress testing machine). Furthermore, the environmental footprint and material costs are evaluated through an LCA (life-cycle analysis). Lastly, stakeholder interviews were conducted with an international and local construction company to validate the developed SCAASC and exploit its commercial viability. From the experiment results and conclusions drawn from the interviews, the developed SCAASC is commercially scalable for its desirable fresh and hardened properties. It can be used in various industrial applications where an SCC is used. The 80% less CO2 emissions from a reference OPC concrete further bolster its market acceptance. However, high market costs and lack of available standards are still the major challenges.","alkali-activated concrete; Alkali-activated slag concrete; Self-compacting concrete; Self-compacting Alkali-activated concrete; Self-compacting Alkali-activated slag concrete; SCC; Life cycle assessment (LCA); Sustainabilty; Market Acceptance; shrinkage; workability; Mechanical properties; Volume stability; Cracking potential; Setting time","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2026-12-01","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

The system consists of a pipeline connecting an offshore borrow location to a nearshore area, where the mined sediment is discharged. The equipment is powered by wind turbines. As long as the wind blows sufficiently, sediment is pumped through the system, leading to a near-continuous nourishment. After the sediment has left the pipes, natural forces should distribute the material. Despite the considerable environmental benefit, one substantial challenge is the financial competitiveness with the traditional hoppers. This research aims to provide insights that can enable the system to be also financially competitive to the hoppers. In the first part, an integral analysis of the Sandwindmill is carried out. The second part of this thesis focuses on the optimization of the dispersion of the nourished sediment.<br/><br/>In the first part, all sub-systems of the Sandwindmill concept are treated separately. Wind data, theoretical formulations, and an exploration of the mining options are used to identify optimization opportunities. From the assessment, it becomes apparent that the interdependency of these sub-systems complicates the cost-optimization. Hence, a competitive system design requires an accurate harmonization of these sub-systems. Three main conclusions are drawn. First of all, the costs per cubic meter decrease with an increasing nourishment volume. Finding the marginal costs is essential in determining the feasibility of the system for certain volumes. Secondly, it is concluded that - given an annual nourishment volume - the pump capacity and windmill size should be attuned. Their cost-optimum is found at a set-up that leads to a yearly operational time of approximately 70%. Lastly, the analysis shows that the application of batteries to support the system in case of lower wind velocities can contribute to a more economical system. This is mainly the case if the system has wave-induced limited operational times.<br/><br/>Due to the costs of the displacement of the pipe outlet and the financial benefits of nourishing large volumes, the second part of the research aims at generating guidelines to designing a dispersive nourishment. Both wave- and tide-dominated systems are a potential field of application for the Sandwindmill. North-Holland is selected as an appropriate case study, containing the Marsdiep tidal inlet and a wave-dominated closed coastal section. A process-based coastal area model is set up to determine the sensitivity of different nourishment strategies on the dispersion at a one-year timescale. A tidal channel wall nourishment at the Marsdiep and a shoreface nourishment at Callantsoog are assessed.<br/><br/>One of the key findings of the second part is that the strong tidal velocities at the Marsdiep inlet are more capable of transporting the nourishment than the conditions at the wave-dominated coast. After one year, the distance travelled by a significant part of the nourished sediment is a factor four higher for the Marsdiep nourishment. Secondly, the research shows that the grain size plays a vital role in the local and regional dispersion. Therefore, the borrowed grain size should be part of the system design. Under the evaluated scenarios, the nourishment application under forcing conditions with a higher transporting potential has a smaller effect in the longer term. This implies that the optimal operational time could be determined solely based on the cost-optimization and should hence be around 70%.<br","D-Flow FM; Morphodynamics; Nourishment strategies; Coastal dynamics; Tidal inlet system; Sediment transport","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","","52.9727, 4.7426"

Moreover, for use in portable electronic devices such as smartphones, tablets, and hearing aids, these ADCs must also achieve high energy efficiency. This requirement of high linearity and high energy efficiency can be fulfilled by zoom ADCs, which combine a successive approximation register (SAR) ADC and a delta-sigma modulator (∆ΣM) in a single architecture. Previous discrete-time zoom ADCs achieved these specifications with state-of-the-art energy efficiency, but their switched-capacitor front-ends necessitated power-hungry off-chip input drivers. A continuous-time (CT) zoom ADC solved this problem and achieved high energy efficiency, but its first integrator dominated the power consumption to meet the linearity requirements. Moreover, quantization noise leakage from the coarse SAR ADC (also referred to as “fuzz”) and distortion caused by parasitic resistance in the reference path limited its linearity. This work addresses these limitations of the CT zoom ADC and attempts to improve its energy efficiency and SNDR performance.<br/><br/>Combining the merits of previous state-of-the-art zoom ADC designs, this work features an energy-efficient CT zoom ADC with a 24 kHz bandwidth. Compared to the prior art, this work uses a highly linear OTA in the first integrator to meet the linearity requirements with lower power consumption.

The objective of this study is to determine whether thermal energy storage can be effectively and efficiently achieved by ways of electromagnetic (EM) radiation. To serve this purpose, an experimental setup was designed in order to subject core flooding experiments to EM heating using a MW source. Temperature data is obtained and used to construct temperature profiles as well as energy absorption and storage profiles. The experiments vary from EM radiation under no flow conditions to experiments inducing flow in order to determine the effect of flow on energy absorption and storage amounts. The results obtained show that a significant amount of energy is absorbed by the core and that the introduction of flow at the chosen flowrates during EM heating does not diminish the energy absorption ability of water inside the core. Flow does however increase the rate of energy decline within the core when EM heating is stopped thus reducing the amount of energy stored. Nevertheless, around 40% of the energy absorbed after 150 seconds of EM heating is stored in the core after a cooling period of 60 minutes. This amount declines significantly when flow in implemented throughout heating and cooling. Even though the experimental setup performed accordingly, the large amounts of energy losses are an area that should be subject to improvement. When this technology is implemented in reservoirs or aquifers, the MW antenna is placed in the pay zone. This results in lower energy losses due to the over- and underlying formations functioning as insulation. Subject to improvements, this study concludes that EM stimulated core flooding is a legitimate and viable technology with significant potential for thermal energy storage purposes.""","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Earth Sciences","",""

They are typified by a dynamic morphology that interacts with the adjacent coastlines and sponsors a unique ecological habitat. Under increasing socio-economic, ecological and climate-induced constraints, it becomes imperative to obtain a better understanding of the evolution of ebb-tidal deltas in order to maintain and preserve these morphological features in the near-future time horizon. An increased interest has therefore been raised to understand, quantify and predict the development of ebb-tidal deltas. <br/><br/>In the context of developing a future-proof coastal management and maintenance strategy, the efficiency of ebb-tidal delta nourishments has been further investigated in research programmes such as Coastal Genesis 2.0. For the Ameland inlet, this entailed the construction of a 5 million m3 pilot nourishment over the course of March 2018 to February 2019 and subsequent monitoring in the years following. This research investigates the impact of this pilot nourishment on the natural behaviour of the Ameland ebb-tidal delta. The second goal is to build further knowledge on the modelling capabilities of present state-of-the-art models for the Ameland ebb-tidal delta.<br/><br/>To this end, a process-based Delft3D model is applied to hindcast the morphological development of the ebb-tidal delta with a particular interest in the evolution of ebb-shields and -chutes over the course of 2005 to 2020. It is identified that the representation of the wave-induced processes is key for capturing the development of ebb-shields and -chutes in the model predictions. Therefore, we applied and experimented with an updated nonlinear wave orbital velocity parameterisation and assessed its contribution to the modelling performance. <br/>This thesis demonstrates that the evolution of ebb-shields and chutes on the outer delta is contingent on its initial presence in the initial bathymetry. Hence, the initiation of ebb-shield development is not inherited in the model response. These insights have been integrated and synthesised to assess the application of the present state-of-the-art model as a forecasting tool for the morphological development of ebb-tidal delta nourishments.<br/><br/>Ultimately, it is shown that a model using schematised boundary conditions and an efficient morphological updating scheme is able the predict the yearly-averaged development of the pilot nourishment on the ebb-tidal delta. It is demonstrated that the 2019 pilot nourishment only locally influences the behaviour of the Ameland ebb-tidal delta. Nourished sediment is likely to be redistributed along the ebb-shields, contributing on the long-term to the sediment exchange process with the downdrift coast of Ameland. The location of the ebb-tidal delta nourishment is thereby important for the sediment exchange process and the development of local features. Placing ebb-tidal delta nourishments to the south of the Westgat invokes a primary sediment exchange between the coast of Terschelling and surrounding morphological features. A secondary readjustment of the Westgat thereby influences the development of the ebb-shields and -chutes. Constructing an ebb-tidal delta nourishment north of the Westgat results in a sediment exchange between the local ebb-shields and the downdrift coast of Ameland. Our results also demonstrate that an increase in the pilot nourishment construction height enhances the redistribution of sediment along the ebb-shields.<br/><br/>Lastly, this study identifies further opportunities for improving medium-term morphodynamic models for the Ameland inlet by incorporating time-dependent boundary conditions including new transport formulations such as SANTOSS.","Morphodynamic modelling; Tidal Inlet Systems; Ameland Inlet; Ebb-Tidal Delta; Nourishment strategies; Pilot Nourishment; Kustgenese 2.0; Delft 3D","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","","53.444568, 5.590163"

This type of learning may be preferable with respect to reinforcement learning techniques when dealing with real-world problems. This fact is especially true in the case of robotic applications where reinforcement learning may be unfeasible as there are long training times and reward functions can be hard to shape/compute.<br/><br/>The present thesis focuses on interactive learning with corrective feedback and, in particular, in the framework Deep Corrective Advice Communicated by Humans (D-COACH), which has successfully shown to be advantageous in terms of training time and data efficiency. D-COACH, a supervised learning method whose policy is represented by an artificial neural network, incorporates a replay buffer where samples of states and corresponding labels gathered by the agent's policy from human feedback are stored and replayed. However, this causes conflicts between the data in the buffer because samples collected by older versions of the policy may be contradictory and could deteriorate the performance of the current policy. In order to reduce this issue, the current implementation of D-COACH uses a first-in-first-out buffer with limited size, as the older the sample is, the more likely it is to deteriorate the performance of the learner. Nonetheless, this limitation propitiates catastrophic forgetting, an inherent tendency of neural networks to forget what they have already learnt, and that can be mitigated by replaying information gathered during all the stages of the problem. Therefore, D-COACH suffers from a trade-off between reducing conflicting data and avoiding catastrophic forgetting. The fact that D-COACH limits the size of its buffer automatically restricts the types of problems that it can solve, given that, if the problem is too complex (i.e. it requires large amounts of data), it simply will not be able to remember everything.<br/><br/>If we want to utilise a buffer to train data intensive tasks with corrective feedback, a new method is needed to solve the problem of using information gathered by older versions of the policy. We propose an improved version of D-COACH, which we call Batch Deep COACH (BD-COACH, pronounced “be the coach”). BD-COACH incorporates a human model module that learns the feedback from the teacher and that can be employed to make corrections gathered by older versions of the policy still useful for batch updating the current version of the policy.<br/><br/>To compare the performance of BD-COACH with respect to D-COACH, three simulated experiments were done using the open-source Meta-World benchmark, which is based on MuJoCo and OpenAI gym. Moreover, to validate the proposed method in a real setup, two planar manipulation tasks were solved using a seven degrees of freedom KUKA robot arm.<br/><br/>Furthermore, we present an analysis between on-policy and off-policy methods both in the fields of reinforcement learning and in imitation learning. We believe there is an interesting simile between this classification and the problem of correctly implementing a replay buffer when learning from corrective feedback.<br","Machine Learning; Interactive Imitation Learning; Corrective Imitation Learning; Robotics; Neural Networks","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Biomechanical Design - BioRobotics","",""

Port development is typically guided by a master plan that includes information about the port layout, the dimensions of water areas (approach channel, turning and manoeuvring basin and berthing pocket) and the allocation of cargo types and terminals to the available port area. The actual realisation of a new port or terminal typically follows steps like pre-feasibility, feasibility, construction, operation and maintenance. The feasibility phase is vital since this is the phase where critical design choices are made and evaluated. To ensure sheltered water in the harbour basin, breakwaters are built to reduce wave impact and longshore currents. Therefore, breakwater layout is an essential aspect of port design. A typical breakwater layout consists of several elements: one or two breakwater(s), an approach channel, berthing pocket, manoeuvring basin, turning basin and quay wall and terminal. The breakwater design goes through several phases, in which the first layouts are elaborated in the conceptual design phase. These layouts are customised according to the design criteria and site conditions. Since any choice made during breakwater design will affect the dimensions or orientation of the water areas and terminal, making the design process iterative rather than sequential. This is time-consuming when done by hand and limits engineers from working out every possible design as a conceptual design has to be made in only two or three months, meaning that time is limited. Not all alternatives within the design space can be investigated, so designs are likely chosen based on expertise and a reasonable layout rather than that the optimal solution is chosen.<br/><br/>Translating the breakwater layout design process into an automation tool that searches for breakwater layouts and evaluates them can support the engineer and increase the solution space. A valuable model, useful for engineers, should be widely applicable, verified, validated, and high in performance. Performance refers to the ease of use of the model and the efficient use of computing power. First, as breakwater is site-dependent, a tool should convert site-specific conditions into breakwater layouts to be widely applicable. Second, to increase confidence among engineers, a model should be internally validated. This ensures that the breakwater layouts are only the result of the input data and not the results of design flaws of the model. In addition, the generalisability of the model should be validated to show the applicability of such a model. Third, a model creates attractiveness if it is verified. Therefore, it should not suddenly crash or behave unexpectedly, meaning it must be free of bugs. Fourth, the model should be user-friendly and produce results in an acceptable time, effectively using the computer power, to be useful in the conceptual design phase.<br/><br/>Teeling (2020) researched the further development of a genetic algorithm-based breakwater layout model that searches for economically optimal solutions for a certain set of breakwater design criteria and site data. Teeling (2020) added more accurate site data with the implementation of a detailed bathymetry and wave model. The wave conditions are generated by REFRAC, a refraction model that applies the geometrical optics approximation (directional change when waves moving from deep to shallow water). The generated alternatives will be compared on aspects like capital expenditure, operational expenditure and downtime costs. Finally, the cheapest alternatives will be presented. Thereby the model can speed up the design process and explore a larger solution space quickly. However, improvements on the applicability of the model are still possible. Furthermore, no systematical analysis has yet been conducted for internal and external validation and verification of the model and into the model’s performance. This means that the confidence level of the use of the model is insufficient. This research investigated the increase of value for complex design software when confidence in the model is lacking by focusing on verification, validation and improvement of its performance and applicability. <br/><br/>Test-driven development was used to verify, validate and assess improvements in the model’s value. To test the software requirements, test cases were developed to verify, validate, and improve performance and applicability. Executing those tests will answer how the model generates breakwater layouts and assist by increasing the model’s value. If the model fails, the code was rewritten until the model passed.<br/><br/>During the research into the Teeling (2020) model, it appeared that it is possible to define a specific bathymetry and wave environment. Still, applicability could be further increased by the addition of the alongshore positioning of the primary breakwater. The alongshore position was in the Teeling (2020) model fixed at x0 = 0. Creating a variable x0 creates the opportunity for the model to search for the optimal position alongshore. With the implementation of the alongshore position, the solution space of the model increased.<br/><br/>The model was verified to ensure that the model generates breakwaters without containing any bugs; following the development and execution of a verification test case, various script and execution errors were found in the original program, which caused the program to fail in approximately one out of three runs. Eliminating these bugs resulted in 100% successful execution for the executed test cases.<br/><br/>The validation of the model could be split into internal and external validity. A base case was developed and executed for internal validation to check whether the input was translated into the model’s output. This showed that the model solely produced results based on the design criteria and site data. In addition, external validation was carried out. Therefore, the applicability of the model on different cases was tested. Several tests that focus on varying bathymetry and wave conditions had to trigger the model to generate the breakwater at a location with a certain configuration where site conditions are economically optimal. The results showed that the model blocked the waves with the primary breakwater for the test cases focusing on a single wave direction. In addition, the model was able to recognise differences in bathymetry and searches for the optimal location. Furthermore, the external validation test cases revealed an error in the downtime estimation. All test cases erroneously showed zero downtime, which was resolved by rewriting the downtime equation.<br/><br/>Finally, the performance of the model was examined. The performance focuses on the efficiency of the model itself and its user-friendliness. For example, a clear user manual was missing, which made it almost impossible to install and run the model. A manual has been designed where the genetic algorithm and the design criteria of the model are explained, as well as the installation of the model and how to run the model. Test-driven development has led to a decrease in the computation time of the model. First, Dask was added to the model, enabling parallel processing using multiple cores from a computer processor. Second, the optimisation parameters were tuned, leading to more efficient use of computing power. These interventions resulted in a total reduction of 81.25% in computing time, decreasing from 160 to 30 minutes on average per run.<br/><br/>In conclusion, the model was improved significantly with test-driven development by verification, internal and external validation, and increased applicability and performance. The breakwater layout model can accelerate the conceptual design phase, and alternatives can be investigated within a larger solution space. Therefore, this model can contribute to the design of breakwaters in the conceptual design phase.<br/><br/>Although the value of the model increased, there is still room for improvement. To further increase the model’s applicability, it is recommended to add a percentage of occurrence to the wave data and have the outcome data checked by an expert. This will increase the accuracy and value of the model.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Within the electricity driven conversion methods, electrocatalysis has been assessed to be the closest to commercialisation. This can only be realised, if the system efficiency is increased in terms of the reaction rate, onset potential and/or selectivity. Current research has shown that, apart from the more widely investigated routes to improve these factors (GDEs, catalyst, etc.), cascade electrode systems and high pressure reactors could prove to be effective for increasing the system efficiency. By splitting the CO2 reduction into two separate steps, CO2 reduction to CO and the sequential reduction to C2+ products, both steps can be optimised in terms of operating conditions. Applying a cascade system has, therefore, shown to increase the selectivity and reaction rates in the system. Additionally, the advantage of the high pressure reactor originates from the fact that increasing the pressure, will result in an increase in the solubility of the reactant. By increasing the solubility, the mass transport to the electrode surface will subsequently be enhanced. The low solubility of reactants is often identified as a main limiting factor in system efficiency, therefore, increasing solubility has proven to increase reactant transport (current density) and selectivity in high pressure systems. Even though both of these advancements have shown promising results, technoeconomic studies indicate that their feasibility is still too low to become commercially attractive at this point. Therefore, this research proposes to combine both technologies to increase the overall system efficiency in terms of: increasing the current density, increasing the Faradaic efficiency and decreasing the overpotential losses for the production of C2+ products. Since this combination has not been investigated before, and both technologies are still rather new, there will be a lot to investigate in order to demonstrate the potential of this new combination. Therefore, in addition to an extensive literature study to uncover the relevant unanswered research questions regarding this field of research, a mathematical model was developed. A model is a valuable resource in determining the potential for a novel system, as it enables instantaneous control over system parameters and, therefore, can provide a lot of insight into its relations and limitations. However, as the accuracy of a model strongly depends on the quality of its input data, this research will also provide a design approach leading to a novel high pressure cascade reactor design. Eventually, the model can, therefore, provide the insight required for extensive experimental research, while the design can simultaneously aid in the improvement of the model. The results evaluated by the model demonstrate both sequential reduction steps are positively affected by increasing the pressure. In addition, the otherwise poor CO solubility, can be dramatically increased by applying the combined system. The reaction rates are also evaluated to increase with the higher reactant concentration of CO and CO2. In addition, since the hydrogen evolution reaction is not affected by the pressure, as it does not present mass transfer limitations, the selectivity has been shown to also increase with increasing the system pressures. Additionally, the presence of the high CO concentration in the reduction towards C2+ products affects the selectivity of the system as well. The CO reduction reactions possess different behaviour from the CO2 reduction reactions. Therefore, by indicating the share of both separate reduction reactions in the generated products, operating conditions for the maximum C2+ selectivity can be identified. This way, the combination of high pressure on a cascade system, has been demonstrated to possess a lot of potential for increasing the system efficiency towards C2+ products.","CO2 reduction; CO2 electrocatalysis; Electrochemistry; cascade system; high pressure; mathematical model; Reactor design; Silver; copper; CO reduction; CO electrocatalysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Online behavioural advertisement refers to the practice of serving targeted ads to online users based on their potential interests. In order to infer these interests, online advertisers aggregate and process vast amounts of behavioural data collected from the browsing activities of Internet users. Until recently, online advertisers have been using a device-centric approach to studying user behaviour and delivering targeted ads. With the development and widespread adoption of smart devices, it has become commonplace for a person to own and browse the Web from multiple devices, and online advertisers have been quick to adapt.<br/><br/>Cross-device tracking (CDT) constitutes the practice of identifying and tracking the user of a device rather than the device itself. This is usually achieved by grouping devices based on the likelihood that they belong to the same user. By employing CDT, advertisers are able to build more comprehensive user profiles based on a user's overall online behaviour, and serve advertisement tailored to a user's interests on all of their devices.<br/><br/>While these online advertising practices greatly benefit both advertisers and their clients, the privacy of online users is compromised by the amount and nature of the data collected in the process. Various solutions have been proposed over the years for performing online behavioural advertisement in a privacy-preserving manner, while no such privacy-conscious technological alternatives have been designed to address CDT practices, even though the data collected for the purpose of CDT has considerable overlap with the data collected for serving targeted ads.<br/><br/>In this thesis, we aim to offer a technological solution to the privacy-issues posed by the collection and processing of customer data for the purpose of cross-device tracking. To this end we design PCDT, a protocol that uses fully-homomorphic encryption and keyed hash functions to implement both deterministic and probabilistic CDT techniques that operate on encrypted data.<br/><br/>PCDT operates in a two server setting, where both servers engage in privacy-preserving computations to perform CDT, while simultaneously concealing the secret device data from each other through cryptographic means. The security of PCDT is based on the semi-honest security model, where parties attempt to learn as much as possible from the information presented to them, but do not deviate from the protocol. PCDT performs deterministic CDT in a privacy-preserving manner by concealing the relevant device data using a keyed hash function. The deterministic hashes allow for the fast association of devices through deterministic CDT, while the secrecy of the hashing key ensures the secrecy of the plaintext data. To perform privacy-preserving probabilistic CDT, PCDT uses fully-homomorphic encryption to train and evaluate gradient boosting decision tree models on encrypted device data. To the best of our knowledge, PCDT is the first protocol designed to perform privacy-preserving CDT.","cross-device tracking; homomorphic encryption; privacy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science | Software Technology","",""

Commercial grippers are already suitable for handling various food products at high speed and acceleration when combined with a parallel manipulator, but use a standard grasping approach. The gripper is positioned over the object and moves down to grasp it requiring (in most cases vision based) 2D positioning. Contact-reactive grasping can overcome the need for costly high accuracy vision systems and reduce stationary time taken up by vertical movement.<br/>Methods: The working principles and design aspects of a variety of soft grippers were analysed. Requirements were set up from the analysed soft grippers, defining the boundaries of the concepts. Concepts have emerged from these requirements, and the most promising concept has been developed towards a final design. From the final design a working prototype emerged, the FinFix gripper. The FinFix gripper consists of two fixed fingers and two movable fingers. The fixed fingers are equipped with flex sensors to detect contact with the object while approaching the object horizontally. The two movable fingers are individually actuated by pneumatic pistons. 3D-printing was mostly used to manufacture the FinFix gripper. Static as well as dynamic grasping and holding tests were conducted to verify if the functional requirements were met.<br/>Results: The FinFix gripper has soft contact with the object to prevent bruising or denting. The test results show that the gripper can hold an apple, a tomato and an egg at 10 G of lateral acceleration. The gripper is also able to hold an object with a size of at least 70mm and has a total weight 537 grams. A full grasping cycle only takes 1.01 seconds from the start of movement until the object is released when the distance between pick and place location is around 400 mm. This gripper uses already existing contact-reactive grasping to detect contact with the object and reduces the positioning requirements to one dimensional. The way contact-reactive grasping is used makes this design stand out from other contact-reactive grasping implementations.<br/>Conclusion: By developing the FinFix gripper, new knowledge was acquired on how contactreactive grasping can be used in fast pick-and-place operations for deformable or delicate objects. Future research is recommended to increase food contact safety, holding performance and sensing performance. The gripper’s performance showed excellent potential to be further developed into a possible commercial product.","Pick-and-Place; high-speed; Gripper; Deformable; Delicate; Contact-reactive","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-11-25","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

(graduation committee); Jansen, K.M.B. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Heart Failure (HF) is a disease of high mortality and morbidity with huge impact on health care systems worldwide. HF is a result of decreased contraction of the heart muscle. Current treatments focus on symptoms,and only a minor portion of HF patients is eligible for surgery. Assistance devices for cardiac contractionare currently only available as bridging therapy towards heart transplantation. In this thesis, an innovativecardiac assistance device based on light-responsive Liquid Crystalline Elastomers (LCEs) is proposed. Thisbio-compatible polymer can generate a contractile force in response to a light stimulus. Theoretically, an LCEsheet wrapped around the heart could assist cardiac contraction. Light stimuli could be administered by an implanted LED panel to achieve the first fully implanted cardiac assistance device available. Therefore, parametersregarding light-LCE interaction were investigated. Among state-of-the art light sources, the best candidates foran implantable LCE device were selected. The physical mechanisms underlying LCE behaviour were explored,and LCEs in previous research were compared. Lastly, light irradiance patterns were mathematically modelledto find the optimal configuration for LCE stimulation. It was found that LCE ’MM10’ is a good candidatefor our device as it is bio-compatible, tweakable in wavelength response, has fast response times and producesa large stress. The most promising light source is µLEDs, as they are small, provide high light intensity atgood efficiency, and are relatively biocompatible. Modeling shows that the optimal formation of µLEDs is ahexagonal pattern, which provides the most homogeneous at the highest efficiency at very-nearby irradiance(tens of µms.After this literature review, experiments were performed. Optical, mechanical and thermal properties ofMM10 were tested. The optical experiments proved that MM10 acts as birefringent half-wave plate, meaningit rotates the direction of linearly polarized light. This finding could be used to visually determine the nematicdirector of MM10, with birefringence the strongest in an angle of 45◦ with the nematic director. Birefringenceis low in the wavelength spectrum of the stimulating light source (400-500nm) and highest in the 700-800nmrange. Reflection and transmission of MM10 within the 400-500nm range are resp. 5.5±0.2%and10.6±4.6%.This indicates that most of the LED light is absorbed, and thus can be converted in mechanical energy to producestress. The order parameter was found to be 0.5. The absorption coefficient was found to be 0.081±0.006.Mechanical analysis was divided in passive properties (without light stimulus) and active properties (withlight stimulus). Young’s moduli are heavily influenced by environmental temperature, where MM10 shows a&gt;10x higher Young’s modulus in the 0.1-2% strain range and a &gt;4x higher modulus in the 4-6% strain rangeat 25◦C compared to 37◦C (body temperature). A calibrated the main-chain LCE model showed to be a goodpredictor of this behavior.Dynamical analysis (DMA) showed that storage modulus decreases and tan δ increases heavily upon lightstimulus. This can be explained by stiffening of MM10 upon illumination due to contraction. MM10 stressgeneration is optimal in the 35-40mW/cm2irradiance range, producing a stress of up to 80mN/mm2 at 25◦C.At higher temperatures, elasticity will rapidly increase, leading to higher irradiance tolerance before break, butlower stress generation at the same irradiance compared to 25◦C. A mathematical model was built and testedon these findings for predicting maximum stress generation when sample thickness, irradiance and environmenttemperature are known.Thermal infrared analysis showed that MM10 surface temperature rises upon illumination, as an indirectresult of the incorporated azobenzene molecules, which act as micro-heaters. Surface temperature reaches themaximum after ±5s of illumination. Stress generation coincides with this temperature rise, until it reaches aplateau. While it is possible to pace MM10 at a rate of 1-3Hz without excessive heat build-up, MM10 has a tooslow response to act as an effective contractile unit at these frequencies.A demonstrator was built for homogeneous illumination of MM10 material wrapped around a balloon. Thisplatform allows live measurement of pressure, temperature, humidity and ECG signals. Also, light stimuli canbe triggered by real-time heart beat detection. Concentric pressure measurements showed a 20µm-thick MM10band could produce up to 170 Pa pressure when wrapped around a balloon and irradiated homogeneously with60mW/cm2 green light. As such, the (very thin) MM10 band generates a substantial force of 1.29N.We conclude that MM10 is a bio-compatible, versatile material able to produce large stresses in responseto LED light. Cardiac assistance by MM10 might be too complex because of the relatively slow response timeof MM10 compared to the heart rate, the large mechanical forces in the heart and the variability of the heartrate. We see multiple other potential uses for MM10 as an implant as well as outside the (human) body.","LCE; Liquid Crystalline Elastomer; Contractile; Cardiac Assistance; Light-stimulated; LED","en","master thesis","","","","","","https://delftao.wixsite.com/lces Supplementary Movies referenced to in thesis","","","","","","Biomedical Engineering","EU HEART REPAIR Project",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","As the world population is increasing and cities grow faster than before, food scarcity becomes a bigger issue. To depend less on import and decrease CO2 footprint, food should be produced nearby its consumers. A good solution for food production is a greenhouse which provides a steady high yield throughout the year. Some of the world's fastest growing cities are in Subtropical climates. Subtropical climates are characterized by high temperatures, abundance of sun and high humidity. Due to the high temperatures, cooling in greenhouses in subtropical climates is necessary, but evaporative cooling is not sufficient due to the high humidity. Outside air can be dehumidified by a liquid desiccant to cool the air further with an extra evaporative cooling step. After dehumidifying the air, the absorbed moisture from the air in the desiccant must be removed from the desiccant solution for re-use. This requires a lot of energy, which makes this cooling technique for greenhouses in subtropical climates not economically feasible. The proposed solution is to remove moisture from the desiccant by making use of the hot air that can be collected in the top of the greenhouse. The potential of this solution is assessed in this study. To predict the transfer of mass and heat between air and a calcium chloride solution as desiccant, a mathematical model of the process of mass and heat transfer over a structured cardboard pad is made. An experiment is conducted to validate the mass and heat transfer coefficients of the model. The model is used to evaluate the workings of the proposed system of regeneration. Results show that dehumidification can significantly lower the inlet temperature of the air in the greenhouse, provided that the inlet temperature of the desiccant is low. Regeneration of the desiccant solution with hot air is also possible, provided that the air in the greenhouse is significantly heated by the sun and pre-heating of the desiccant before regeneration is beneficial. The direct coupling of these two systems is not sufficient due to the big difference in temperature of the desiccant that is required at the inlet of the dehumidifier and regenerator. In future work attention should be paid to this temperature difference which is currently limiting the performance of the system. Then it's possible for the concentration of the desiccant to be brought back to the starting conditions for the dehumidifier.<br","Desiccant Cooling; Heat and Mass Transfer; Greenhouse; Regeneration","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Process and Energy Technology","",""

However, the movements of the platform are expected to cause unsteady aerodynamics effects, including different wake dynamics, a variation of the induction field at the rotor and blade-vortex interactions. Consequently, there is no general consensus on whether Blade-Element Momentum (BEM) codes could be employed to model the aerodynamics of floating wind turbines. This poses a serious issue as BEM models are widely used in industry practice.<br/>This project proposes to analyze the impact of surge motion on the induction field of a horizontal-axis wind turbine. A suitable actuator disc model is developed, followed by an actuator line model that allows to study the effect of the finite number of blades. Both models are implemented in OpenFOAM, an open-source CFD software. The simulations are run for a range of case studies with imposed baseline thrust, amplitude of the thrust variations, surge frequency and surge amplitude and the resulting induction factors are compared to those obtained with a dynamic inflow model, to assess whether a momentum method could lead to accurate predictions. Particular attention is given to the identification of the wake states of the streamtube, since both turbulent wake state and vortex ring state imply a breakdown of momentum theory.<br/>The results of the actuator disc simulations show that in all cases there is a good agreement with the induction factors obtained with the examined dynamic inflow model. Turbulent wake state is only entered when a high thrust coefficient is reached at low frequencies, while propeller state is only entered when a negative thrust coefficient is reached at low frequencies. Furthermore, no signs of vortex ring state were detected.<br/>Some of the cases considered during the first part of the project were also run with the actuator line model, to examine the finite blade effect. A rotor with three blades was modelled. The resulting disc average induction factors are in excellent agreement with those obtained with the actuator disc model, while the induction at the disc center is lower. The contour plots show that the conclusions on the wake states entered by the streamtube remain valid. It is advised to test this model at different tip speed ratios and for rotors with different numbers of blades.<br/>Overall, this project contributes to a better understanding of the aerodynamics of floating wind turbines and gives confidence in the possibility of using momentum methods during their design phase. Furthermore, the CFD models developed are a flexible tool that may be used for future research on related topics.<br","Floating Wind Energy; actuator disc; FOWT; OpenFOAM; actuator line model; dynamic inflow; vortex ring state; CFD","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

In recent years, a new and promising cloud paradigm emerged: serverless computing. Serverless computing promises a pay-as-you-go model and offers features such as autoscaling and high availability. Nevertheless, developing scalable cloud applications remains a painstaking task. Currently, programming models for the cloud mix operational code and business logic causing developers to spend a significant amount of time on other tasks rather than implementing the intended functionality. Moreover, the developer must consider distributed systems concerns such as consistency, communication, and persistence. Modern dataflow systems, such as Apache Flink and Google Dataflow, address these concerns but suffer from the same problem: they lack an intuitive programming interface for general-purpose applications. It remains an open problem to design a developer-friendly programming interface for implementing scalable cloud applications with strong guarantees. <br/><br/>In this thesis, we solve this problem by presenting an intuitive programming interface for scalable cloud applications in which developers primarily focus on business logic. Given a set of easy-to-follow code conventions, programmers author <i>stateful entities</i> a programming abstraction embedded in Python. We present a compiler pipeline named StateFlow, to analyze the abstract syntax tree of a Python application and rewrite it into an intermediate representation based on stateful dataflow graphs. In addition, we present a set of building blocks that allow the execution of this intermediate representation on a target runtime system or cloud provider without a tight integration. Supported runtime systems include Apache Flink and Beam, AWS Lambda, Flink's Statefun, and Cloudburst, each providing a different set of guarantees. Finally, we introduce a client-side programming interface and HTTP server integration to interact with the deployed application.<br/><br/>We demonstrate that the execution with StateFlow typically incurs less than 1\% overhead. Furthermore, we identify limitations of current dataflow systems in executing cloud applications at scale in a performance benchmark. Finally, we compare the expressiveness of StateFlow's programming abstraction to native runtime implementations. We show that StateFlow lets a developer write universal code that does not mix business with operational logic or the runtime's API and prevents vendor lock-in by allowing them to switch between runtimes in less than ten lines of code.","cloud computing; domain specific languages; stream processing; stateful functions; dataflow systems; serverless; apache flink; aws lambda","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science | Software Technology","",""

Existing solutions for storing and computing data can no longer give the required processing performance, and technical advancements in I/O operations and networking have further increased the distance between the requirements and the provided solutions. A number of changes, such as the introduction of new memory representations, have been proposed to reduce the overhead of existing data analytics frameworks, but they still have not been fully integrated with such frameworks for a lack of market traction.Apache Spark is among the most widely used frameworks for big data analytics, as it provides, among other functionalities, an extensive and easy-to-use API that allows to perform computations on amultitude of processing workloads.At the core of Spark sits the Resilient Distributed Dataset, an abstraction upon which other abstraction or workload-specific libraries have been built over the years. While the general development effortsfocused on creating new abstractions on top of the core library, not enough attention has been put into solving intrinsic issues of the RDD’s.Thereby, this work proposes an integration between Apache Spark and the Apache Arrowin-memory data format, that can be leveraged to solve memory- and computational bottlenecks. Such integration is beneficial for a number of reasons, such as the reduction of serialization and storage overheads, thanks to an efficient columnar-oriented data format shared among several machines in a cluster. This work proves the feasibility of such approach, introducing a number of changes in Spark and Arrow that result in a proof of concept implementation. Furthermore, it proves that such integration can be performed without the need for expensive and disruptive changes to the existing API’s, thus allowing existing workloads to be fully compatible withnew, Arrow-based techniques. The performance advantages have been evaluated, resulting in an execution time speedup of approximately 14%, with the biggest improvement being 50% reduction in execution time for wide transformations. In addition, it allows for functionalities typically executed within Spark to be offloaded to Arrow, introducing further performance improvements, with a 20% reduction in execution timefor offloaded functionalities, compared to pure Spark.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, there is a gap within the curriculum regarding actively teaching students what it means to be an empathic designer, and it has not been completely clear what it actually means to be an empathic designer. Based on my research, I came up with the following design goal: to help students use empathy consciously throughout their design projects. Within this context, I came up with the following design focus: Offering structure and clarity within the development of empathic abilities.Based on literary research, field research and designing by doing, I came up with my final concept: the Empathic Habits program. The Empathic Habits program clarifies the meaning of professional empathy in design, helps students reflect upon their own abilities, and helps them increase their abilities in an easy way At the start of the second year, CMD-students who join the program participate in their first Empathic Habits workshop. At this point, most students are not aware of what they have yet to learn; they are unconsciously incompetent. Before the workshop, students do an empathic abilities-test in which they are rated on 5 empathic sub-abilities. Together, these abilities make up what it means to be an empathic designer. At the start of the workshop they analyse their results: what are their strengths and weaknesses? In this introspection process, students move from unconscious incompetence to conscious incompetence. During the next part of the workshop, students get to practise their weakest empathic ability by interviewing each other. They are to use at least 3 mini-activity-cards corresponding with the empathic ability they are going to practise. These cards contain short, simple assignments which students can use in any user research setting. At the end of the first workshop, the students reflect upon what they have learned and how they want to further develop their empathic abilities. For students who join the follow-up program, it continues over the next 6-8 weeks with weekly or bi-weekly reflection sessions with fellow students and a teacher. Every week, they are to try new activities and reflect upon what works for them and why. By adding mini-activities to their repertoire one by one, they develop empathic habits, making them more empathic designers. They move from being consciously incompetent to consciously competent. Assuming students keep using the mini-activities, through the years that follow, the mini-activities will become second nature: they will become unconscious habits. In this process, students and/or graduates move from being consciously competent to unconsciously competent.","empathy; empathic design; design education; communication & multimedia design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

As a result of the competitive nature of the energy sector it is important to keep the cost of energy low in order to keep an edge over the competition. Therefore, to keep wind energy economically viable in the future the cost of producing energy should be lowered. One way this can be done is by lowering the initial costs of installation, as this is relatively high. In this thesis an installation method of monopile foundations will be introduced, which has potential to reduce costs of the installation of wind farms. More specifically, this thesis will focus on lowering of monopiles to the seabed. Problems arise when the monopile hanging on the crane wire is excited by waves hitting the submerged part of the monopile. This can cause excessivemotion of the monopile. Particularly if resonance occurs, which is the case when the wave frequencies and the natural frequencies of the monopile coincide. This could lead to catastrophic failure if no mitigating measures are taken. The most common method to counteract this phenomenon is to wait until weather conditions allow for further continuation of operations, which can consume lots of valuable time and thus increasing costs. Therefore, this thesis will focus on optimizing the workability of offshore installations of monopiles by using gyroscopicmotion actuators. These actuators, called controlmoment gyroscopes (CMG), will reducemotion of the monopile by applying a moment counteracting the moment created by the waves. This system is modelled in MATLAB. The model consists of the monopile suspended on the crane wire, a gripper and the CMG. The equations of motion are determined using the Lagrangian method and linearized around their equilibrium position. The equations of motion are then written in state space representation in order to study the behaviour of the system and to tune the PD controller. The PD controller was tuned using the loop shaping method. The MATLAB model is used to tune the controller. However, the results will be examined using OrcaFlex. Therefore, the same system is also modelled in OrcaFlex, a commercial time domain simulations package, in which an external function is built using Python to represent the CMG and the corresponding PD controller of the CMG moment. The whole system is then subjected to a sea state with a significant wave height of 2 meters and a wave period range from 5-8 seconds. The 3 hour simulations are run for each period step of 0.5 seconds from 5 to 8 seconds. From each simulation the most probable maximum is calculated.

Architectured materials with microstructures of metastable austenite/martensite phases exhibit advanced mechanical properties, such as a better combination of strength and ductility. In addition, the presence of laser-reverted austenite in martensitic microstructure improves the pitting corrosion behavior due to the better corrosion resistance of austenite over the martensite phase. However, the combined microstructure of different phases might lead to the emergence of galvanic corrosion, which deteriorates the general corrosion behavior of the laser-treated materials. These findings suggest that the laser surface treatment affects the general and the localized corrosion behavior differently, which is an interesting prospect that requires further investigation.<br/>Fe-25Ni-0.2C, the material in this study, has the starting martensite formation temperature (Ms) below room temperature due to its high nickel percentage, which is thermodynamically possible to form reverted austenite and remain austenite phases during laser treatment. In this study, a high-power Nd:YAG laser system is utilized to locally create an austenitic region in a cryogenically-formed martensitic Fe-25Ni-0.2C alloy. Optical microscope (OM) and scanning electron microscope (SEM) are used to assess the microstructure prior to and after laser treatment. The observed microstructure is related to the high spatial gradients in peak temperature and the heating rate of localized laser treatment, which governs the formation mechanisms. Moreover, the effect of laser processing parameters, such as laser power (P) and scanning speed (v), on the laser-affected zone (LAZ) is also investigated. <br/>The corrosion behavior is characterized by potentiodynamic polarization tests in a 3.5% NaCl solution.

However, the results of using this approach on a geotechnical structure have not been mentioned in the past literature. Hence, in the current work, Bayes' approach is used to predict the soil property parameters and further these parameters are used in slope stability analysis of a basic slope. It is aimed to investigate if the uncertainties in such analysis can be quantified. For this, a simple Bayes' model is developed to predict the input parameters of the soil properties. This model is developed using the PyMC3 package in python which is specially developed to solve Bayes' problems. Along with Bayes' statistics, normal/frequentist statistics is also used to derive the soil properties from two different data sets (3000 data points and 24 data points). To conduct the reliability studies of a slope, a Finite element model developed at TU Delft is used. The results of slope stability analysis obtained using both approaches are further compared. Results clearly show that when uncertainty is involved Bayes' approach encapsulates its effect on calculated FOS whereas the frequentist approach doesn't. This difference in both approaches is observed due to consideration of all the possible values of input parameters by Bayes' approach. With the frequentist approach, a single input parameter is predicted neglecting all the other possible inputs. Hence, it is concluded that using the Bayes' approach better and more reliable results over the frequentist approach by providing more insight about the uncertainties involved in the analysis.","Slope Stability; Reliability analysis; Bayesian Inference","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Its manifestations, the seizures, are due to a group of neurons' abnormal and synchronous activity. The unpredictable nature of these events hinders the quality of life of those affected. In particular, focal seizures show a localized onset of the abnormal activity and are the most common ones. Correct detection of the episodes can help clinicians to give the best medical treatments. This research project arises from the need to have automatic algorithms for seizure detection with a high number of correctly detected seizures for low false alarm rates. Recent studies have shown disorganization in how brain areas interact with each other before and during a seizure. We decided to model this change in connectivity patterns by inferring graphs from EEG recordings of epileptic patients. We work with seventeen subjects suffering from focal epilepsy, and we build, for each of them, a graph of the activity preceding (preictal) and during (ictal) a seizure. After that, we exploit techniques from graph signal processing to build a detector for seizures. Last, we analyze the density of connections of the inferred graphs to indicate the seizure onsets. The obtained results are unsuitable for real-life applications, but they are a starting point for further research. Furthermore, we find that most the proposed ictal or preictal graphs show less connections in the nodes involved with the seizure onset.","focal epilepsy; graph; Graph Fourier Transform; Detection","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Signals and Systems","",""

The ρ­-VEX processor, a runtime reconfigurable VLIW processor developed at the Computer and Quantum Engineering department at the TU Delft was identified to possibly allow for special countermeasure implementations against Cache Attacks, because of its unique Cache architecture, hardware context switching and timing behaviour. In this thesis, the possibility to use the runtime reconfigurability against Cache based Side­Channel Attacks of the ρ-­VEX processor is investigated. The ability for the ρ­-VEX to alter its execution time based on configuration size, interfere with its own Cache state based on configuration and dynamically switch contexts between Caches are explored. Simple variants of the attacks Prime+Probe, Evict+Time and Final Round Collision Attack are implemented and ran on two setups that simulate practical scenarios of the ρ­-VEX. These are a standalone setup and a setup with a second context sharing the processor with an arbitrary workload based on the PowerStone benchmarks, which causes noise by itself and can amplify countermeasures. The ρ-­VEX was instanced on the Genesys2 FPGA development board. We have shown an implementation of timing noise through configuration size variations called nLane increased the amount of samples required for the timing Attacks Evict+Time and Final Round Collision to around 800x more traces. An implementation of access noise through swapping contexts called CacheSwap achieved 800x more traces for Evict+Time and 225x more traces for Final Round Collision when executed in a shared processor. The effect on Prime+Probe was only strong for higher chances to swap, but the overhead for these percentages was considered too high. An implementation of isolating lookups over private Caches, called ScatterRound, had additional benefits aside from preventing collisions. It made our Evict+Time Attack take 160x, Prime+Probe Attack 175x and Final Round Collision Attack 225x as many samples to be successful. We have shown that the overhead associated with 10% n­Lane and 10% CacheSwap was reasonable, but ScatterRound was concluded to require a specific execution setup to achieve performance costs that are acceptable.","Side-Channel Attacks; Cache Attacks; Cache Attack Countermeasures; Hardware Security; ρ-­VEX; FPGA; AES","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Engineering","",""

(mentor); Mahon, T.R. (mentor); Masania, K. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Piezoelectric materials have the ability to convert mechanical to electrical energy (direct effect) and vice versa. They are readily used in the aerospace, automobile, telecommunication industry etc. as both sensors and actuators. For this work the focus is on the sensor application, which utilizes the direct piezoelectric effect. With the rapidly growing technological demands, sensors should be flexible enough to adapt to different applications while also having adequate sensing capabilities. Currently, lead- and lead-based piezoelectrics are used in the industry due to their excellent piezoelectric properties. However, due to their toxic nature, research has been ongoing into more lead-free systems which are capable of replicating the performance of these lead-based systems. In this work, we aim to improve the sensing capabilities of lead-free piezoelectric composites. To further improve their performance, reducing the dielectric constant (ε) of the composite is the main strategy of this work. The reduction is achieved by fabricating a porous composite structure. The reduction in permittivity leads to an increase in the piezoelectric voltage constant (g), which defines the sensitivity of the piezoelectric composite. <br/><br/>The main focus of this work is to optimize a polymer and polymer foaming technique to obtain a high level of porosity, while also retaining adequate mechanical properties. The next step is to achieve a high poling efficiency for the composite in order to obtain good piezoelectric properties. For the polymer system, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) is selected as the matrix due to its excellent film forming ability as well as its relatively high dielectric properties (compared to polymers). The direct foaming technique is used for this work, due to its simplicity and its reproducibility. For the lead-free ceramic system, Barium Titanate (BaTiO3) and Sodium Potassium Niobate doped with Lithium (KNLN3) is selected as they have good piezoelectric properties, and have been used in piezoelectric composites extensively. As a porous piezoelectric composite is used in this work, the contact poling is replaced by the corona poling method to prevent localized dielectric breakdowns and non-uniform poling. <br/><br/>With the direct foaming technique, foams with porosites in the range of 90-95 % are obtained, resulting in a drastic reduction in the permittivity of the composite. Such a high porosity level also results in a much softer composite. The optimization of the corona poling process is done by selecting the adequate poling temperature and the grid voltage, which is found to be 110 °C and 6 kV respectively. The effective piezoelectric charge coefficient is measured using Al plates as electrodes, to prevent the soft composites from compressing locally. The foam composites exhibit remarkably high g33 values exceeding the 1000 mV.m/N mark, almost double the best sensor used in the industry currently (PVDF). This is attributed to the high poling efficiency and the reduced dielectric permittivity of the composite. This opens up the vast number of possibilities for future systems based on porous structures to be used as sensors which can showcase good piezoelectric properties as well as being more flexible/conformable.","Piezoelectric; porous material; corona poling; piezoelectric composite","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

This means that neighbourhoods throughout the Netherlands will have to be overhauled for the construction of heat networks. In addition, we are increasingly faced with the effects of climate change, such as flooding and increasing heat. Both tasks require physical changes in the built environment and demand space in the built environment. An integrated approach to both the heat transition and climate adaptation has many benefits, but despite this tasks are often still tackled individually. The problem of not being able to integrate mitigation and climate adaptation measures appears to be not technical but organizational in nature. New governance approaches will be needed that can realize integration of the heat transition and climate adaptation. However, there is little knowledge of how different governance approaches perform to realise this goal. This research tries to fill that gap. The research question is: “How do hybrid governance approaches perform in realising integration between the implementation of heat transition and climate adaptation measures?” For answering this research question, cases are studied in which existing neighbourhoods undergo a transition to a natural gas-free heating system and consider climate adaptation to a greater or lesser extent. Their current governance approach is mapped and evaluated. All studied cases appeared to consist of different governance mixes and have a different dominant governance mode. Integration in projects is now often initiated by someone who sees the opportunity and acts on it, instead of considering it by default and assignments are not integrally defined. This makes it harder to integrate different sustainable transitions during the project. At the start of a project for the construction of a heat network, the project is under a certain time pressure. If climate adaptation measures were to be linked to this project, a plan would already have to be in place and a budget would have to be made available. Taking climate adaptation actions has to be seen as urgent and must be found worthwhile by the parties. There are different hybrid governance approaches that lead to integration of transition. However, it does seem that a Network approach with some elements of Hierarchy works well for integrated projects. Network and hierarchical actions could be taken to realize integration, like sharing knowledge and creating awareness for integrated projects and the municipality could take control over the subsoil by coordinating it more. A network structure needs to be created, combined with hierarchical forms of regulation. Consciously looking at the performance of current governance approaches can be helpful in adapting them appropriately to address complex societal issues. It will help to make deliberate choices for altering the current governance approach to realise integration of heat transition and climate adaptation tasks.","Governance; Climate Adaptation; Heat Transition; meta-governance; Sustainable transition","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

(mentor); Hoogreef, M.F.M. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","The past 70 years has shown an incredible growth in air transport. The increase in flights has resulted in an increased strain on the environment. Climate change is a fact. Designers have been working on improving the aircraft, and in particular, the engine efficiency. By improving the internal components through better materials, new design methods and new fabrication techniques, the engine specific fuel consumption has decreased. A major factor however is the engine bypass ratio. By increasing the bypass ratio the engine specific fuel consumption (SFC) can be drastically reduced. As a consequence the engine weight and size increased with subsequent ramifications. <br/><br/>Evaluating the installation penalty is not a new topic. In existing literature, studies on the various aerodynamic effects have been published. The largest contributor to the drag is the friction drag from the nacelle. Interference drag due to wing-pylon-nacelle flow interaction can be reduced with proper engine placement. The increase in drag due to a larger engine can also be minimised by the engine location and the shape of the nacelle. All studies show a change in drag when engine size or location are varied. Consequently all studies have been done using finite volume Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) solvers. Friction drag is relatively easy to predict, but if complex flows and separation areas are present, high fidelity tools are required.<br/><br/>An answer to the main research question: For narrow wing/body aircraft, can the installation penalties from an increase in bypass ratio outweigh the gain in specific fuel consumption? is found when a full aircraft redesign is allowed. Using the Initiator toolbox it was found that the lower fuel burn, due to a SFC improvement, results is a lighter aircraft for a given mission. The reduction in fuel burn negates the increase in engine weight, drag, and possible interference. <br/><br/>The stability analysis is done for an engine retro-fit scenario, like the 737 MAX. The method used requires several assumptions or estimations based on empirical relations. In order to improve the accuracy the vorticity solver FlightStream was used. It was not possible to validate the A320 design by using both FlightStream and the empirical methods, however the trends observed can be used to evaluate the effect on the c.g. margin and the required tail size. The c.g. margin decreased by max 7.1%, which would nullify a typical stability margin of 5%. The calculated maximum increase in tail size is 18%. Compared to the A320 tail size, it is only a 2% increase, and in most cases the tail becomes smaller. This can be explained because the A320 uses an oversized tail, originally designed for the smaller A318.","Engine installation; stability analysis; retro-fit; aircraft redesign; SFC; tail design; Initiator; FlightStream","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-08-01","","","","Aerospace Engineering | Flight Performance and Propulsion","",""

One of the crucial points to understand is the complex interaction between rotor, inflow, and wake systems. If we can demonstrate its effectiveness in the complex flow/inflow conditions, will be of great importance. To investigate the wake/wind aerodynamics validate state-of-the-art VAWT wake models, a high ¬fidelity experimental measurement in the domain of VAWT wakes is needed. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models for complex wind interactions are far from being feasible. These models are highly time-devouring and computationally expensive, and their cost prohibits the simulation of complex flow configurations. This is usually overcome through the implementation of simple and computationally inexpensive analytical wake models, where the flow conditions are solved through simple analytic expressions and only over specific points of interest. The work aims to realize and validate a simple and efficient analytical wake model (Abkar, 2019 [2]), (Bastankhah &amp; Porté¬Agel, 2014 [7]) for prediction of the wind velocity profile downwind of a VAWT turbine: The best by comparing the modeling results with a set of particle image velocimetry (PIV) measurements of the wakes of an in-house designed VAWT are used as a high-fidelity reference. The present work evaluates and quantifies the influence of the wake deflection produced by the pitch angles of the blades on the scaled VAWT turbine. It reproduces the main phenomena involved in the flow pattern and identifies the general structure of the resulting wake that occurs: under the influence of pitching the blades on the upstream turbine. The configuration consists of a VAWT aligned in the direction of the incoming flow: With a class of cases for different configurations of the turbine are studied for example ¬ deflection of wake through zero pitch, positive 10 degrees pitch, Negative 10 degrees pitch angles (Mendoza et al, 2019 [32]). The available power distribution over other hypothetical downwind turbines due to the influence of wake deflection by the upstream turbine is studied and reported. These interactions are measured with the help of large ¬scale PIV experiments in OJF, TU Delft. Also, an efficacious force balance system for the VAWT rotor is studied, designed, and fabricated (in-house) to calculate the accurate lift and drag forces on the VAWT structure. The stereo particle image velocimetry results are compared with two theoretical works Jensen wake model, [21] and Gaussian-based wake model Abkar [2] and CFD simulations by Huang et al [18]. The study shows a wake shift towards the windward side (cross-flow width), Negative¬ Y direction. For all the pitch cases, maximum for the positive pitch angle and least for a negative pitch angle. The wake shift in the negative ¬Y direction can be caused by the blade rotation, with the clockwise rotation of the VAWT rotor, and the rear blade turning into the incoming flow of wind. The theoretical models especially the Gaussian-based wake model represent the wake deficit in close agreement to the experimental results but fails to account for wake shift and change in wake structure. The CFD simulations reproduce the 3D wake structures consistent with the experiment results but show an early recovery in the wake. The wake recovery with downwind available power is found higher with a positive pitch angle and least with the negative pitch. A study of in-plane velocity vectors indicates crosswind force introducing crosswind momentum to the flow and as a result would give rise to the CVPs, also according to a study by Rolin F, Porte-Agel [38]. The theoretical models do not account for any of these structural changes in wake and the deflections in them. Furthermore, the suitability of these experimental references are used to verify the CFD simulations and analytical models’ range of the fidelity","VAWT Wake; PIV (particle image velocimetry); Analytical Wake Models; Force Balance Concept; Wind Energy; CFD Simulation; Wake Modelling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

These processes can entail a variety of problems such as disease spreading, opinion spreading in social networks or even airport congestion in airline networks. One of the key tasks in this area of research and also of this work is the prediction of the final epidemic size of an outbreak in a network, given that a contagion process has been initiated by a seed node. More specifically, the objective is to predict to which extent a seed node is able to activate the rest of the nodes in a network using a supervised learning model. In this work, this task is termed: “The node influence prediction problem”. Being able to predict the epidemic footprint of a node allows the design of robust networks and the application of efficient intervention strategies.<br/><br/>Recently, a limited number of studies have proposed methods on how to utilize classical network topology based features to predict the nodal influence. However, two main challenges still persist: (1) individual topology based features do not fully capture the information of a node and (2) it is tedious to obtain these features for nodes in large scale networks. As an alternative solution, this work aims to utilize network embedding based features instead, where feature vectors of the nodes are learned from the network topology. In this research we assume that the network topology and the nodal influence of a small subset of the nodes are known. We then proceed to show how to build and optimize a machine learning framework where only 10\% of the nodes are used as training data and which could even be applicable on large scale networks. Additionally, we also demonstrate why network embedding based features are applicable in the node influence prediction task. <br/><br/>The findings show that node pairs which are closer in proximity in the network, are also embedded closer in the embedding space (exhibiting a higher similarity). The performance evaluation of the predictive models illustrate that network embedding based features can compete with classical topological metrics, despite the disadvantage of their higher dimensionality. This is achieved by combining the embedding features with individual low cost topology features such as the degree.","Network embedding; Machine Learning; Feature extraction; Epidemiology; Graph","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science","",""

The accuracy of streamflow predictions of hydrologic models increases with the availability of and the access to streamflow observations. Therefore, one of the key challenges in the field of hydrology is to produce Predictions in Ungauged Basins (PUB), where observations are lacking. Recent research has shown the potential of deep learning neural networks as an alternative approach to conceptual and process-based hydrologic models for this purpose. <br/>In this study, the existing Multi-Timescale LSTM (MTS-LSTM) architecture is used to investigate if such a deep learning network is able to learn universal hydrologic behaviour. Therefore, a MTS-LSTM is trained on a large variety of &gt;500 US catchments and subsequently tested outside the US, in the European Meuse river basin. The model is not retrained or finetuned to simulate an ungauged situation and to asses whether the streamflow predictions can compete with those from the uncalibrated distributed model wflow_sbm. <br/>Results indicate that the MTS-LSTM trained on US data cannot compete with wflow_sbm in the Meuse catchments. The simulated streamflow time series can be unrealistically shifted and scaled compared to the time series of observed streamflow due to sensitivity regarding static model input. This means, the values for catchment characteristics cannot be extremer in the testing data than in the training data. Therefore, it is recommended to select catchments for the model training such that the most extreme conditions are covered. In the case that the MTS-LSTM is trained for a specific region, results clearly compete with or outperform the distributed model. For the Meuse test catchments, the neural network achieves Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) values&gt;0.46 where the application of wflow_sbm is problematic and yields negative NSE values. To exploit the potential of an LSTM, the model should be trained on all available data of the entire Meuse basin instead of on the subset of catchments used here. For some water management applications it is important to accurately predict high flow events. Training the MTS-LSTM with the Mean Quadrupled Error (M4SE) loss function showed that the peak flow representation can improve for catchments where the use of a NSE loss already leads to good predicting performance. Thus – for and ungauged catchments – an implementation of a combined loss function appears a valuable follow-up research. <br/>For ungauged catchments, these results imply that the global neural network model as tested in this study should be supplemented with finetuning. Thereby, the global model could not yet be applied everywhere, however, in regions where only few years of streamflow records are available. Alternatively, a regional neural network model trained on nearby catchments could be applied for PUB, if streamflow observations are accessible in the surrounding area. Finally, it is of high importance to maintain and extend the network of streamflow gauging stations globally, and to ensure easy access to the data.","Rainfall-runoff relationship; Hydrological modeling; Deep Learning; LSTM; Ungauged basins","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Dynamic capabilities theory is an explanatory framework that has gained academic and management attention for its ambition to explain sources of competitive advantage and profits in highly competitive environments. For this reason, I conducted an extensive literature review exploring where the dynamic capabilities theory and digital transformation phenomenon intersect. The review resulted in the notion that digital transformation is a source of constant change that necessitates dynamic capabilities. However, the dynamic capabilities of the firm are not well understood. A stream of research has been flourishing to illuminate the origins of dynamic capabilities, known as the microfoundations of capabilities. <br/><br/>Reviewing research in dynamic capabilities revealed a framework that allows firms to respond to digital disruption through constant evolution in capabilities. My desk research uncovered the management research community’s ongoing investigation of dynamic capabilities’ underlying mechanisms known as microfoundations of dynamic capabilities. Examining these capability sub-dimensions showed that aggregated actions of individuals form routines that evolve into the firm’s capabilities. Developing capabilities of any kind starts from the learning and collaboration of individuals with different skill sets, beliefs, and values that make up the organization. <br/><br/>I approached three legacy firms in the low-tech sector of fashion and retail as a case study that exemplifies the problem of digital transformation. They were chosen based on profiles typical of a digitally-transforming firm, such as investments in digital technologies, the appointment of chief digital/information officers, size, and age. In addition to content, the firm’s headquarter operations reside in the Netherlands, and their digital transformation initiatives occurred in the last five years. I consulted annual reports, financial filings, and company press releases to trace their digital transformation journey and validated through individual interviews from digital actors, people involved in the company’s digitalization. <br/><br/>The empirical observations confirmed that the microfoundations perspective fits the research question due to the digital transformation’s multi-pronged approach. However, I did not observe all sub-dimensions of the dynamic capability in the case study companies. Nevertheless, I found at least one of each factor relating to individuals, processes, and structures. For example, the individual dimension emerged in the study due to the central roles of leadership and the workforce’s digital savviness in the transformation process. Furthermore, digital intensity (processual dimension) is a must in digital transformation since substantial digital technology investments are a core requirement. Their interaction and collaboration across different levels of the organization through proximity help build capabilities for digital transformation. The structural dimension also shows that a centrally organized digital initiative can move slower than a decentralized one. <br/><br/>The framework suggests that dynamic building capabilities are rooted in individuals learning and collaborating. Additionally, proximity and the concepts of multi-dimensional relationships (geography, cognition, social, and organizational) facilitate the learning process. My study also suggests that individuals working at different levels of the organizations build firm-level capabilities, hinting at the multi-level characteristics of capabilities of the firm.

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Perovskite materials gain a huge interest in the photovoltaic (PV) community due to its unique characteristics, including long carrier diffusion length, widely tunable bandgap, light absorption potential, and low processing cost. Nowadays, most perovskite fabrication methods employ a solution-based process due to its simplicity and production speed. However, this deposition method provides a non-uniform structure and uses highly toxic solvents, posing the risk of contamination and adverse effects on the environment. On the other hand, a solvent-free method like thermal evaporation can produce a uniform and conformal layer. This method can be used to produce not only the perovskite absorber layer but also the contact layers and transport layers. Depending on the deposition parameters, the resulting morphological properties also change. Therefore, it becomes interesting to understand the detailed knowledge of the film growth and the effects of the deposition parameters on the exact kinetics and the optical properties. Hence, the first objective of this study focuses on developing C60 electron transport layers (ETL) for application in all-evaporated perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The C60 thin film was deposited with different thicknesses of 20, 30, 40 nm and deposition rates 0.3, 0.5, and 1 Å/s on top of the silicon wafer substrate. The resulting surface morphology is obtained from scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). It indicates that C60 with 40 nm thickness and 0.3 Å/s deposition rate shows a pinhole-free layer with an average surface roughness of 1.05 nm and thickness uniformity of more than 94%. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurement shows that decrease of peak intensity as the thickness is reduced from 40 to 20 nm. Moreover, with different deposition rates, 1 Å/s of deposition rate exhibits an asymmetric broadening peak which attributes to the small grain size and the presence of a planar defect in the structure of C60. <br/>The optical analysis has also been performed to get the complex refractive index C60 and identify the effect of deposition rates and layer thicknesses on optical constants. A procedure to extract optical constant for the perovskite absorber layer has been developed during this thesis project using a combination approach of b-spline and Tauc-Lorentz dispersion model. The obtained results were found to be in excellent agreement with experimental work and literature data. <br/>Furthermore, the complete solar cells with p-i-n configuration and semi-transparent perovskite solar cells (ST-PSCs) were optically simulated using GenPro4 software. This simulation aims to identify both the photocurrent density of the perovskite absorber layer and the optical losses caused by parasitic absorption in the supporting layers. In the p-i-n structure, ITO and MoOx layer located on the illuminated side contribute to the main portion of optical loss. Simulations suggest that 40-nm-thick ITO and 10-nm-thick MoOx is an ideal layer stack to deliver high implied photocurrent (22.14 mA/cm2). On the other hand, the optical loss in semi-transparent perovskite solar cells is investigated in two different wavelength regions (i) 300 – 800 nm and (ii) 800 – 1200 nm. In this investigation, the metal back contact is replaced with ITO and cells illuminated from the ETL side. The results show that, in the first wavelength range, the main optical losses are due to reflection, parasitic absorption in the C60 and top ITO layer. These losses are reduced by applying 120-nm-thick anti-reflective coating MgF2 and decreasing the thickness of C60 to 10 nm. Moreover, in the wavelength region of 800 – 1200 nm, the optical losses are mainly affected by the top and bottom ITO, MoOx layer, and reflected light. After optimizing top ITO and MgF2 thickness to 50 and 120 nm, respectively, a 17.07 mA/cm2 of photocurrent transmitted through the cells can be achieved. The light transmittance is ~88%, indicating the potential of semi-transparent perovskite solar cells to be applied in perovskite/silicon tandem devices. <br/><br","C60; Perovskite; Thermal evaporation; Thin-film; Transport layers","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Materials Science and Engineering","",""

(mentor); Herder, J.L. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Compliant mechanisms and decoupled parallel mechanisms are topics of high interest. The combination has been manifested for lower-mobility mechanisms, yet not attempted for higher degrees of freedom. The scarcity is countered by designing a decoupled compliant spherical parallel mechanism (DCSPM), having three independent rotational degrees of freedom. Reasoning, that the spherical parallel mechanism has been studied extensively and is used for various applications, however not benefiting from the advantages that compliant- and decoupled mechanisms offer.<br/>Extensive background knowledge is provided, which explains the common principles, applications, state- of-the-art and benefits of the decoupled compliant parallel mechanisms and forms the foundation for the design towards a decoupled compliant spherical parallel mechanism. Literature has revealed the type synthesis and optimization methods used for generating these intricate mechanisms and different methods are summarized for synthesizing compliant mechanisms. Besides, various grading criteria are introduced, such as parasitic error, range of motion and manufacturability. All possible kinematic architectures, which are able to produce a decoupled motion with three independent rotational degrees of freedom, are synthesized by using Screw Theory. This entails the number, sort, orientation and placement of joints present in each leg of the parallel mechanism. Moreover, strict decoupling criteria must be satisfied, resulting in the enumeration of several kinematic structures. Upon comparison and grading, a final structure (3-3R) is chosen, which via the use of rigid-body replacement techniques, is extended to a compliant variant of the mechanism.<br/>An inevitable drawback of compliant mechanisms is their inability to produce continuous motion. As a result, parasitic errors are present during actuation. Because the final mechanism consists of revolute joints only, a remote center of motion mechanism based on curved flexures is developed, which is optimised to have minimal parasitic error. The latter is achieved by implementing a sequential quadratic optimisation algorithm in conjunction with surrogate models of the proposed compliant RCM mechanism. The latter results in design variables which have been optimised for minimal parasitic error, while adhering to the yield stress, minimum rotation and manufacturability constraints. The final RCM mechanism, containing flexures which are laser cut from 0.2 mm spring steel, is experimentally validated to have an axis drift of ±13.3 μm in x- direction and ±47.1 μm in y-direction for a rotation up to 18.3 deg. Upon comparison with existing compliant RCM mechanisms and several compliant revolute joints, the proposed compliant RCM mechanism shows satisfactory behaviour and complies with the conducted nonlinear FEA in Ansys.<br/>During the experimental validation of the parasitic error present in the proposed RCM mechanism, existing measuring techniques showed several imperfections. As a result, a novel quantitative assessment method is proposed for identifying the parasitic error for planar rotary mechanisms, which aims to find the remote center-of-motion with the least amount of drift for various angles of rotation. By means of an arbitrary example, the latter is verified and the proposed method is compared with existing methods. Moreover, via a nonlinear finite element analysis on an existing compliant revolute joint, the applications, benefits, ease of use and results of the proposed method are exhibited.<br/>The final DCSPM, 3-3R mechanism, is built up gradually; as one revolute joint, which is the proposed RCM mechanism based on curved flexures, is extended to a 2R, 2-2R, 3R and 3-3R mechanism. All individual sub parts have been experimentally investigated and exhaustive nonlinear FEA is carried out. Two versions of the final 3-3R mechanism are developed, one of which is assembled with spring steel flexures and a monotonically printed PLA variant.","Compliant mechanism; Parasitic error; Axis Drift; RCM mechanism; remote-center-of-motion; Curved flexures","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-11-15","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Mechatronic System Design (MSD)","",""

The ship keel clearance influences the maneuverability of the sailing ship.<br/><br/>In this thesis project, the link between the fluid mud rheology and its density is first investigated. The exponential relation reformulated between the density and yield stress necessitates the direct measurement of rheology for navigability. It was confirmed true that the yield strength grows exponentially with the density of the fluid mud. However, at higher densities of mud, more thixotropy is observed in the flow curves. Besides, the Power-law relations were found for the relation with volumetric concentration, for yield stress in agreement with fractal dimension theory.<br/><br/>Second, quantification of the thixotropy effect of fluid mud is conducted to justify the importance of the time-dependency effect in the rheological modeling. We found that an unremolded fluid mud has high thixotropy even at high shear rates. However, diluted and remolded fluid mud at high shear rates found a negligible thixotropy effect. We also observed that Houska's modeling curve coincides perfectly with the flow curve of fluid mud at high shear rates, and also it integrates the thixotropy into the modeling.<br/><br/>Third, the total resistance of a plate moving through fluid mud is measured and compared to the frictional forces calculated using the available analytical formulas of a plate moving in Bingham fluids and Power-law fluids. The moving plate is an abstraction of a vessel's keel sailing through the fluid mud. We found that the total resistance of the plate moved in fluid mud at low velocity agrees with the frictional force of a plate moved in Bingham fluids. As the velocity increases, the stagnation pressure becomes significant, and the deviation of the total resistance of plate and frictional force of a plate increases. Thus, to estimate the total resistance of a plate moved in mud, normal forces (stagnation pressure) and vortices at edges should be investigated because these need to be subtracted.<br/><br/>The experimental data in this thesis are made resourceful to help researchers validate their Computational fluid dynamics(CFD) models in the application of sailing through the mud.<br","Fluid mud; Rheology; Flat plate resistance; Rheometry; Houska Thixotropy modelling; Beerkanaal, Calandkanaal, 8e Petroleumhaven fluid mud; Resistance meausrements; Thixotrpy quantification; Thixotropy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-11-22","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

We can reduce this incidence, if quality medical care is accessible in remote areas. With the current advancements in imaging technologies, fundus examination can be carried out on a handheld device. We need to improve such devices to deliver high quality services through auto detecting DR based on convolutional neural networks(CNNs) in an offline setting. Addressing these challenges, we aim to develop an integrated solution which delivers high compute at ultra-low power consumption. Firstly, we have created 3 datasets of different sizes merging multiple public datasets to create a vigilant model training process. This is to make the CNN model robust to real-world noise. CNNs trained on smaller datasets have shown a 15% accuracy drop on evaluation datasets where as CNNs trained on large datasets showed consistent performance. Secondly, we have proposed a new binary labelling scheme using multi-class output to maximize the utility of its softmax probabilities. We have achieved 90.26% accuracy on evaluation dataset with the new scheme. These high performing models along with compression techniques are implemented on resistive random access memory (RRAM) based computational in memory (CIM) architecture.

Offshore wind farms have caught the interest of many developed countries since they are an essential source of green energy. The interest of this thesis lays in the design of the foundation used for offshore wind farms, in particular the interaction between the monopiles and the scour protection layer. An optimised one-stage installation process for the scour protection is investigated, which consists of first placing the rock armour and then driving the monopile through the entire scour protection layer. This is an efficient method to reduce the installation time and the operational cost.<br/>The purpose of this research is to identify the limitations which are related to the penetration of the monopile through the stone armour. The scour protection material is composed of large diameter rocks, which can hinder the penetration of the pile, or even damage the tip of the pile. A restricting ratio of the mean size of the rock (d50) to the thickness of the monopile wall (w) is explored, as well as an investigation of the effect of penetration resistance on different material and geometry characteristics. The first research method employed is a literature study, which proves that the analytical formulation of the axial capacity provided by the available standards is inappropriate for the application of this thesis. Thus, two other research methods are identified, which include designing an experimental small-scale test and a Discrete Element Model (DEM) of a penetration test.","scour protection; monopile; Discrete Element Method; small-scale experiments; calibration; Design of Experiment; penetration resistance; particle shape; validation and verification; rock armour","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-11-22","","","","","",""

With its unique location came unique problems, most of which were related to the interplay between Venice and its lagoon. By severe measures in the past it has continued to withstand the test of time. <br/>In the decades to come, Venice, once again, has found itself in a difficult situation. Like has been done in the past, drastic measures are required to deal with the current and upcoming difficulties threatening the survival of Venice. These difficulties range from over-tourism to sea-level rise and the subsiding of the city. Acting like the Magistrato alle Acque acted in the past, extreme visions where laid out as possible solutions to these threats.<br/>A workshop week with focus on interdisciplinary design formed the basis for two extreme visions which are laid out in this report. With the aim of answering the main research question: How do flood defense systems influence the spatial aspects of the territory in the context of a high dynamic landscape in the Anthropocene?<br/>The plan for the Perfect Lagoon is one of these, which has focuses on tackling all of the current and upcoming problems were the emphasis lies on preserving and perfecting the lagoon using the building with nature philosophy, while also saving the city from drowning. Preservation is done by solving the sediment budget problems. Due to the constantly eroding system, salt marshes and land is slowly disappearing.<br/>In this plan, drastic actions will be taken to counteract the constant erosion as well as the effect that sea level rise will have on this unique estuary. Drastic measures like redirecting rivers and re-purposing the MOSE contribute towards this goal. <br/>After preservation comes restoration as one of the goals is to restore and increase ecological value, restoration of salt marshes and removal of negative influences like pollution.<br/>As a second vision, the plan of the Symbiotic System deals with the same problems but here the emphasis lies on interconnectedness of Veneto. More attention is paid to mass tourism. The plan aims to turn Venice into a modern interconnected metropolitan area. The city and the lagoon will be treated as two separated system where the focus lies completely on the city of Venice. The lagoon will be left to its own devices in order to find a new, still unknown, equilibrium.<br/>These visions are then further worked out and explained, and for both visions, technical design are made to, step-by-step, bring these visions closer to reality. From these visions along with their technical design we can conclude that flood defence systems have a major influence in the spacial aspects of the territory. Not only in its primary function, but more importantly in the secondary functions. Both primary and secondary functions can be used to create a paradigm shift for the territory. Using the multidisciplinary approach, an integral design can be made for the flood defence, in which the opportunities in a territory can be maximized.","climate change; Venice; sea level rise; multidisciplinary project; MDP; architecture; civil engineering; hydraulic engineering; interdisciplinary approach; coastal engineering; hydraulic structures; river engineering; Construction Management & Engineering; landscape architecture","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","Multidisciplinary Project",""

In this redesign, one seeks to find the optimal checkpoint configuration; however, this remains non-trivial. The checkpoint configuration problem requires a bottom-up simulation approach to realistically evaluate checkpoint performance and an efficient optimisation approach to optimise computationally intensive simulation models. This research aims to address the checkpoint configuration problem by developing and evaluating a novel simulation optimisation (SO) method for optimal configuration of airport security checkpoints. This is achieved by combining an agent-based simulation model with an improved Tabu Search (ITS) optimisation technique. The ITS is extended from the conventional TS through three stages. Firstly, a neighbourhood decomposition strategy (NDS) limits the number of neighbours that require simulation, suppressing the computational effort. Moreover, local optima and the repetition of solutions are prevented with Frequency Memory (FM) and a Reactive Tabu list (RTL). Finally, aspiration criteria prevent significant deteriorating moves in the search process. It was shown that agent-based simulation models can realistically represent security checkpoints. The main conclusions show that the ITS converges faster than the classical TS and that it can find a better solution within the iterative domain. The NDS is crucial for reducing the computational time of agent-based, computationally intensive simulation models. Furthermore, this research shows that FM and RTL prevent solutions from repeating in the search; however, FM and RTL have no impact on the search procedure of this specific problem as the probabilistic properties of the NDS counteracted the mechanisms.","Airports; Security checkpoints; Simulation optimisation; Agent-based modelling; Meta-heuristics; Tabu search","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2026-11-19","","","","Aerospace Engineering | Air Transport and Operations","",""

One of the main challenges currently faced by the wind energy industry is to improve the reliability and availability of wind turbine in order to keep the industry financially attractive. Optimising operations and maintenance (O\&amp;M) strategy through the adoption of cost-effective and reliable detection and prognosis techniques is a clear target for competitive offshore wind development. If the health of components can be accurately monitored then faults can be detected in the early stages and an accurate maintenance plan can be made. This thesis will contribute to this domain of wind energy with original work. This thesis aims to devise multiple AI techniques capable of performing wind turbine fault detection. These techniques are validated and assessed using experimental data from the wind turbine drive train condition monitoring test rig developed at Durham University which focuses on the most critical wind turbine component, i.e. gearbox. Seeded-fault conditions on the gearbox have been induced/removed from the test rig drive train as required, enabling gearbox tooth damage fault to be implemented repeatedly on demand and under controlled stationary and variable driving conditions. The raw data from test rig is subjected to data pre-processing tasks such as data cleaning, feature selection and feature extraction. One baseline model (Decision tree), two tree-based models (Random forest and eXtreme Gradient Boosting) and one neural networks model (Multi-layer perceptron) are developed, tuned and compared to achieve the aim of this thesis. The performance of relatively unexplored (in CMS literature) tree-based models is compared to the performance of widely used neural networks model. Developed models are evaluated based on various performance criteria such as prediction of healthy stage, early stage fault detection, most severe stage fault detection, overall accuracy, overall precision, fault detection rate, false alarm rate, training time, testing time, complexity and fault detection (binary classifiers) performance. Three main models (Random forest, eXtreme Gradient Boosting and Multi-layer perceptron) outperformed the baseline model (Decision tree) in all important evaluation criteria. It is found that eXtreme Gradient Boosting (i.e, a tree-based model) produces the best overall results when compared to other developed models. Hence, it is recommended for the CMS industry to make use of the eXtreme Gradient Boosting machine learning model for the task of wind turbine gearbox fault detection.","cms; Wind; gearbox; machine learning; Neural network; Tree-based; XGBoost","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It formalises the maximum likelihood formulation using a pose graph, where poses are represented as nodes, and measurements are represented as edges. Each measurement is paired with a measurement model that maps the related poses to an expected measurement value. PGO tries to find the set of poses that minimises the difference between the expected measurement values and the true measurement values. An accurate solution requires accurate measurement models. Models can be dependent on knowledge of specific robot parameters, or may fail to account for unknown systematic measurement deviations. By identifying the dependency of the unknown parameter within the measurement model, the parameter can be added as a graph node, thereby creating a pose-parameter graph and the accompanying Pose-Parameter Graph Optimisation problem.<br/>In this thesis, a generalised approach to PPGO is proposed that is based on the implementation of two generally applicable parameters (a bias and scaling factor). Each parameter implementation defines modified measurement models that relate the newly defined parameter-nodes. Connectivity strategies are proposed that connect the set of parameter-nodes within the pose-parameter graph based on the nature of the parameter fluctuation.<br/>For this thesis, a framework was developed in python that uses g2o to solve the PPGO problem. A GUI was designed to intuitively visualise graph components and evaluate performance metrics. The estimation of the bias parameter is found to be reliable over all measurement components, whereas the scaling factor only allows for reliable estimation over measurement components that exhibit consistent non-zero values. The static connectivity strategy can be reliably utilised to estimate an unknown constant parameter value. The sliding window and timely batch strategies are able to reconstruct a sinusoidal parameter with time, with the former offering an accurate instantaneous estimate with a slight delay, and the latter offering higher accuracy when applied as a post-processing step. The spatial batch strategy is able to reconstruct a sinusoidal parameter with space by creating a matching parameter heat map.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

The exploitation of additional polarimetric information is a very promising concept to improve the performance of automotive target classification. In this thesis work, we aim to identify target features that can be used for the classification and definition of sub-classes of moving automotive vehicles driving on a highway. This analysis is based on a multi-dimensional polarimetric feature database, created from real observations from a fully polarimetric-Doppler S-band FMCW radar (PARSAX). The polarimetric information of the vehicles is extracted while tracking the targets in a multi-target environment in the range-Doppler domain. Therefore, a multi-target tracking algorithm, based on an OS-CFAR detector, polarimetric data fusion algorithm, and a classical Kalman filter, is used. In order to cope with Doppler ambiguity, a novel MHT-based approach has been introduced.<br/><br/>The feature extraction analysis shows that the polarimetric features of the observed targets provide well-defined reliable statistical relations between physically related features, but that blind classification based on our target feature database does not provide new insights that are useful for classification. Reliable clusters that are useful to describe the polarimetric signatures of the targets have not been found, except the polarimetric correlation coefficients, which, unfortunately, despite their physical clear sense, were not supported by the other analyzed features. Nevertheless, from similar feature analysis, it has been shown that the features originating from the incoherent polarimetric H/A/α-decomposition form compact and well-separated clusters corresponding to target scattering and clutter scattering. Therefore, it can be concluded that these features can be used to accurately distinguish moving vehicles from static clutter.","Radar polarimetry; Multi-target tracking; Feature extraction; Radar signatures","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Furthermore, the combination of ice-induced vibrations and ice jamming had not been studied yet. </p> <p class=""MsoNormal"">Secondly, a model is made based on a phenomenological ice crushing model using COMSOL Multiphysics and MATLAB to simulate the structural response. The sub-structure is based on the jacket design for the NREL 5-MW reference turbine. Different situations from the literature study are used to make several design scenarios for which the structural response is calculated. In total, there are five situations: a base case, an angled base case, an internal jam, a frontal jam and an angled frontal ice jam. The base case does not have an ice jam, and the angled frontal jam has an increased thickness of the jam to twice the incoming ice. For the other jams, the thickness is equal to the incoming ice.</p> <p class=""MsoNormal"">The different scenarios are simulated for a range of ice drift velocities to capture the different ice-induced vibration regimes and see how the structural response changes due to the presence of an ice jam. First, a baseline was established of the jacket's structural response for the base case. Afterwards, the three different ice jams were simulated. Results show that the base case is excited in all three ice-induced vibration regimes. At lower ice drift speeds, intermittent crushing is observed. Then at around 0.05 ms<sup>-1</sup>, it transitions into the frequency lock-in regime. Here the structure is excited at its second natural frequency. For higher ice drift velocities (&gt;0.2 ms<sup>-1</sup>), continuous brittle crushing is seen. For the angled base case, the transition between intermittent crushing and frequency lock-in happens at around 0.1 ms<sup>-1</sup>, and it stays longer in the frequency lock-in regime. The internal stresses around the contact area between ice and leg for the internal and frontal jam did significantly exceed the ice strength. Thus these jams would have failed on crushing at the contact area. The stresses inside the angled frontal jam exceed the ice strength but by a small margin. With all the assumptions made taken into account, the jam might hold. The structural response shows an increase in period for intermittent crushing and a lower amplitude in structural displacement than the base case. </p> <p class=""MsoNormal"">The main conclusion is that an ice jam that would significantly impact the ice-induced vibrations cannot be sustained. The internal stresses exceed the ice strength which would cause the jam to fail. The ice jam that can be sustained acts as additional stiffness for the system and decreases the structure's displacement amplitude for the intermittent crushing regime. In the frequency lock-in regime the structure's displacement frequency increases a bit. But the amplitude is similar in all scenarios because the maximum velocity of the structure will roughly be the same as the incoming ice floe because that is what excites the structure, and this doesn't change.","ice-induced vibrations; ice jams; multi-legged sub-structures","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

This requires a rapid electrification of the current public transport infrastructure. A feasibility study is performed to determine if a overnight charging system, opportunity charging system or flash charging system can be implemented in the city of Arnhem. First the energy consumption is estimated by taking into account route and temperature variations. This is used to estimate the number of buses overnight charging system would need. Next the system is expanded to a opportunity charging system where the location of chargers, the number of chargers and the charge power are evaluated. Also, strategies for extreme weather conditions are evaluated. Next the system is further expanded into a flash charging system to evaluate charge power with the addition of more chargers. Finally a preliminary cost analysis is performed. A overnight charging system would require quadruple the amount of regular buses. A opportunity charging system with two charger is sufficient to service the route without extra vehicles. A flash charging system offers no real benefit beyond opportunity, marginally better battery capacity against more chargers. The cost analysis shows the 2 and 3 charger opportunity charging systems as the most cost efficient.","Charging Infrastructure; Electric buses; Opportunity charging","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(mentor); Uijlenhoet, R. (mentor); van Leijen, F.J. (mentor); Stuurman, Roelof (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","For hundreds of years, ditch water levels in Dutch agricultural peatlands have been lowered to increase the loading capacity of farming parcels. This lowering results in groundwater levels in the middle of the parcels that fall a few decimeters under the ditch levels. When the groundwater level in a peat soil is lowered, newly uncovered peat is exposed to oxygen and begins to oxidise. This process emits greenhouse gasses (GHG), releases nutrients; like nitrogen and phosphorus that stimulate eutrophication, dries out the top subsurface layer and causes the land to subside. This study focuses on an island polder in Warmond, the Zwanburgerpolder, with a clay - peat subsurface. Half of the Zwanburgerpolder belongs to the Eenzaamheid, a biological cheese farm with the ambition to transition to a regenerative cheese farm. One of the key objectives to achieve this regenerative goal is to limit the GHG emitted from the farm. An analysis of the current (ground)water system of the Zwanburgerpolder was done which focused on limiting land subsidence by raising the groundwater level and thereby reducing the emission of GHG, improving (ground)water quality and stimulating biodiversity. First, four research components were examined through field experiments and literature studies: 1) water quantity, 2) water quality, 3) GHG emissions and 4) land surface displacements. The obtained results were used to understand how the Zwanburgerpolder works and identify the relationships between the four components. Then, two groundwater models were developed to represent the current groundwater level and flows in the Zwanburgerpolder: one in iMOD and one in FlexPDE. The iMOD model was used to get a visual representation of the groundwater level variations across the island and to see the groundwater response to precipitation and evaporation. The FlexPDE model was used to get an overview of the phreatic groundwater level drop between two ditches over the summer. To find the most suitable way to limit land subsidence in the Zwanburgerpolder, the models were adjusted to represent possible future situations. Instead of using the collected climate data of 2021 as input parameter, the projected climate data of 2065 was used. The future models consisted of a base scenario, in which no changes were made to the polder compared to the current situation and adapted scenarios, in which the following five water management measures were tested: 1. Adding ditches, 2. Installing horizontal drains, 3. Temporarily inundating parcels, 4. Installing vertical drains and 5. Raising the summer ditch water level. Temporarily inundating parcels performed the best quantitatively and qualitatively during the comparison of the measures. However, this measure is agriculturally unfavourable because as a consequence, parcels cannot be used for grazing during a significantly long period of time. For the Eenzaamheid, where regenerative practices and agricultural capacity take center stage, the recommendation for limiting land subsidence is to combine and adjust two measures: temporarily inundating parcels and adding ditches. Gutters that currently run down the center of the parcels should be enlarged and inundated during the summer period, by siphoning water from the boezem. Inundation can take place during the whole summer, since grazing is still possible alongside the gutters. It is recommended to start off by only applying the measures in the most critical parcels in order to use it as a testing ground to check the possibly negative effects of the measures besides the desired positive effects of limiting land subsidence, reducing GHG emissions and improving the (ground)water quality. Further, the results discussed in this report provide an interesting addition to peatland subsidence studies. They were obtained through field experiments done on a much smaller budget than other studies done so far with expensive measurement setups. The recommendation towards such peatland subsidence studies is therefore to apply a large network of lower cost measurement setups, instead of a few costly ones, in order to get an extensive representation of the behaviour of different Dutch peatlands. The main limitations in this study are the uncertainties linked to the parameters used to build the iMOD and FlexPDE models and the time constraint on the field experiments. The parameter uncertainties mean that the final model outputs fall within a certain error range. To minimize the error range, a model sensitivity and uncertainty analysis should be done. Without the field work time constraint, it would have been possible to identify the seasonal patterns in the groundwater level fluctuations compared to the other water bodies and in the land surface displacements.","Land subsidence; Peatlands; iMOD","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Water Management","",""

The residential sector represents a large part of the total energy consumption, and European governments are investing in distributed PV to increase the renewable share in this sector.

This issue can be solved by incorporating energy storage, that has many technical and economic benefits for the prosumer, especially if a long-term seasonal storage technology is used. Among all the available storage types, after an extensive literature study, some developing technologies proved to be suitable for this purpose: redox flow batteries (all-vanadium, hydrogen-bromide, zinc-bromide) and hydrogen systems.<br/><br/>For this work, a model was built in MATLAB Simulink to study and reproduce the behaviour of these storage systems in a grid-connected residential environment, and an optimization was set up to find the optimal sizing of the components and investigate the economic feasibility of the whole system. The models results proved that in the present scenario, storage integration is still too expensive with these technologies. However, future projections with different incentive scenarios demonstrate the potential of vanadium and zinc-bromine batteries, and highlight a dramatic cost reduction for hydrogen systems.","Energy Storage; Hydrogen; Photovoltaic Systems; Batteries; Optimization; Residential; Storage; Renewable Energy Integration","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Energy and Process Technology","",""

(graduation committee); de Schipper, M.A. (graduation committee); van Prooijen, Bram (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","The coastline near Domburg, in the southwest delta of the Netherlands, has been preserved with sand for three decades. Maintenance was conducted on the beach between the low water line and the dune foot every 4 years. To extent this interval, a shoreface nourishment was implemented in 2017 and was supplemented with a beach nourishment in 2019. Such a parallel shoreface bar is not a naturally occurring morphological feature, as the Domburg coast only features transverse bars. <br/>This research investigates the hydrodynamic and morphological effects of different nourishment strategies at the Domburg coast. The study focusses on the application of the shoreface nourishment, as this strategy has not been previously applied at a coast without shore-parallel bars. The study aims at gaining more insight and knowledge on important mechanisms responsible for the spreading of nourished sediment, because this is not fully understood. Additionally, the performance of a numerical model to hindcast erosion and sedimentation in coastal zones is evaluated. <br/>To this end, a morphological analysis based on measurements and a model analysis are conducted for three nourishment scenarios. The morphological analysis uses an extensive dataset of bathymetric surveys to compute volume changes, sediment fluxes, bar migration rates, momentary coastline (MKL) positions and nourishment longevities (defined as the period that the volume in between the dune foot and mean low water level is greater than before nourishment). The numerical model analysis is based on the output of a morphostatic XBeach model with simplified boundary conditions which computes the hydrodynamics and sediment transports. <br/>The longevity of beach nourishments was found to be on average 3.3 years and the MKL regressed 3.9m/yr on average two years after construction. The eroded sediment did not accrete on the shoreface but was likely transported in the direction of the net sediment transport. The model output indicates that a beach nourishment only has a significant local effect on the hydrodynamics and transport rates. <br/>The shoreface nourishment transforms from a landward skewed triangular shape into a more rounded body without the formation of a trough. The bar migrates onshore but not alongshore and the bar volume remains constant. The model shows a contraction of the tidal flow due to the shoreface bar, increasing the seaward velocity and causing a sheltered zone at the leeside and downdrift of the bar. Consequently, the alongshore transport gradients are increased. This causes extra erosion on the shoreface seaward of the bar while accretion is seen at the downdrift shoreface. The shoreface bar contributes little to the offshore dissipation of wave energy. No evidence for a wave-driven salient effect was found at Domburg from the model output. <br/>The longevity of the 2019 beach nourishment is not prolonged by the presence of a shoreface bar, as this was found to be 3.1 years. Likewise, the MKL measured a regression of 4.3m/yr, similar to previous beach nourishments. Positively, the shoreface bar captures eroding beach sediment because accretion was found in the surf zone, as opposed to the 2014 beach nourishment. Therefore, a shoreface nourishment is moderately beneficial on maintaining the MKL but contributes to the sediment balance of the coastal cell. <br/>Additionally, an alternative nourishment strategy was evaluated through the numerical model. A mega nourishment to the west of Domburg is a viable option as it is likely to feed the updrift and downdrift coastlines which have a sediment demand. It is recommended to further evaluate this nourishment strategy with different numerical models.<br","Shoreface Nourishment; Beach Nourishment Longevity; XBeach Surfbeat; JarKus; Breaker bars","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","","51.567755, 3.485238"

The research is composed of two parts. First, we develop an agent-based model capable of simulating an airport security checkpoint. Second, we introduce learning agents into the model, whose goal is to allocate operators to a security team during operations, to improve operational efficiency of the security checkpoint. We propose two learning activities of these agents. Activity 1 allocates operators to the recheck process, where operators are responsible for reexamining luggages that have been rejected and decide if they are safe or not. Activity 2 allocates operators to the CT process, where operators are responsible for examining CT images of luggages and decide if a luggage should be rechecked or not. We demonstrate that introducing a learning agent with either activity increases the throughput of the security checkpoint. Furthermore, activity 1 and activity 2 decrease the time spent in critical operations for the recheck process and CT process, respectively. The behavioural strategies learned by the agents were to add an operator when there is excess luggage waiting and remove an operator when there are excess operators available. Policy evolution between two different learning agents was compared by determining the similarity in their state transition networks per episode. The similarity was computed using the DeltaCon method and proved to be a promising technique for identifying differences in agent behaviour. This study appears to be the first to dynamically-schedule security operator shifts using a reinforcement learning approach. Insights gained from this study demonstrate that dynamically allocating operators to a security lane improves its operational efficiency, which opens the possibility of dynamic-scheduling security operators for entire terminals. Furthermore, it may aid airport managers in creating more resilient security checkpoints.","Airport; Security Checkpoint; Agent-Based Modelling; Reinforcement Learning; Q-Learning; Operator Allocation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-11-19","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

It has profound effects on the development of human social behaviors. The underlying social network structure may change when individuals change their connection with other individuals in response to the epidemic. The classic susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) model is used to model the spread of an epidemic on a network, where all individuals are defined as nodes and the connections between the individuals are regarded as links. Besides the typical static network, the structure of the network can be related to the state of nodes (infected or susceptible) by link breaking and link creation processes. So the extended network, adaptive susceptible-infected-susceptible model (ASIS model) can be derived.<br/><br/>To study the spreading process on static networks and adaptive networks, we use stochas- tic simulations and mean field approximations. We assume that the spreading process over the network is a continuous-time discrete-state Markov process. But most recent works use the discrete-time simulator, which is actually an approximation of the process. In this report, we extend a existing continuous-time simulator towards adaptive networks. This existing simulator is based on the Gillespie algorithm. We perform the simulations using both discrete-time Markov chain and continuous-time Markov process. And based on the simulation results, we demonstrate that the continuous-time simulator has a better performance than the discrete-time simulator on modeling both static SIS network and ASIS network with high accuracy.<br/><br/>The second part of this work aims to study the characteristics of the ASIS network in the metastable state. We observe three possible states of the ASIS network: the endemic state, disease-free state and bistable state. The degree distribution of the graph follows a binomial distribution in some cases.

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Elastically neutrally stable structures are compelling within the field of compliant mechanisms, since no force is required to deform them. Several examples of this state of elastic neutral stability exist, which often use equal but opposing structures to balance internal forces. This thesis is on the design of an active neutrally stable structure by embedding responsive materials. Responsive materials can undergo a significant change in properties in response to stimuli, such as humidity, temperature, light, pH or electric or magnetic fields. These materials create many novel opportunities in a wide range of disciplines: from medical devices that open in the body to release drugs, to architecture which adapts to the environment. These materials do not add much, if any, mass or volume to a structure. <br/>With the goal of creating an active neutrally stable structure, a novel actuation concept for shape mor­phing of neutrally stable compliant shells is presented. The concept is based on locally changing the stiffness in order to eliminate neutral stability and deform the structure. This concept allows for the actuation of complex deformation with a relatively simple and universally applicable actuation design. This is achieved practically by embedding Ni-­Ti wires, which undergo a significant change in stiffness upon being heated beyond their Austenite transition temperature. The wires are locally heated by ex­ternal forced convection. With that, the structure can change its shape and can exert force and work. In contrast to existing shape morphing structures, the presented structure is capable of fully reversible shape morphing while also preserving its shape after removing the stimulus. This allows for positioning without continuous actuation. The actuation concept shows potential to be widely applicable on zero stiffness compliant mechanisms. <br/>To assess the effect of adding wires to a shell, which require prestress to be embedded in the shell, a modelling method is presented, in which the wires are projected on the deformed shell geometry. The simulated results not only show that a constant energetic path can be maintained in an already neutrally stable structure, but the model further predicts opportunities to create novel neutrally stable mechanisms by strategic design of the hybrid structure. The findings are supported by observations on hybrid shell prototypes. This model lays the foundation for the design of neutrally stable hybrid shells by internal static balancing with preshaped wires.","embedded actuation; shape morphing; neutral stability; compliant shells","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-11-19","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Mechatronic System Design (MSD)","Shell skeletons",""

During this project we have used a fully connected network with labelled input data of a 2D acoustic wave. On top of this we used a special loss function that calculated whether the output of the network satisfies the wave equation. Our experiment consisted of the tuning of the hyper parameters, analysing the optimal choice of activation function and the optimisation of the input data and improving the loss function. During this project the unpredictable nature of machine learning has become very clear. We have experimented with several activation functions and have found that the optimal choice of activation function depends on how long you are willing to train the network, as the development of the loss function differs immensely between activation functions. When we looked at the optimal scaling of the input values we find that a non-trivial scaling seems to work better than for example, normalisation of these values. Furthermore we have tried to improve the sampling of the points we use to calculate whether the prediction of the neural network satisfies the wave equation and got interesting results. When we implement all op- timisation techniques, we find that the neural network is extremely capable of predicting the wave’s behaviour in a high contrast media within the time frames of the input data. Prediction outside of this time frame does work but the results do deteriorate especially in the positive time direction. Predicting in the negative time direction yield slightly better results.","","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Physics","",""

When compounded, these propositions answer their relevant research question.<br/>For RQ2, propositions include Interviewee holds influence over their audience, has met a viewer in person, has audience members similar to themselves, and does not have the same amount of knowledge about the viewer as the viewer has about them. For RQ3, propositions include Interviewee interprets their audience as a group rather than as individuals, communicates with their audience members outside of their video content, feels they need to be professional in their YouTube content, creates videos as a creative outlet, creates videos because it is fun for them, and feels connected to their audience. For RQ4, propositions include Interviewee is aware of the YouTube algorithm affecting the platform, receives financial benefits or a stream of income from YouTube, feels authentic on YouTube, is exposed to tools to grow their YouTube audience, and has confronted their values when making decisions on YouTube.<br/>Interviewees’ anecdotal evidence directly support findings that YouTube content creators value at least one or more of the following: self-expression, creativity, loyalty, community, credibility, authenticity, entertainingness, education, fiscal opportunity, social justice, content quality, pride in self or work, appreciation for viewers, and filling a niche.<br/>YouTube is a socio-technical system with an immeasurable number of users every single day. YouTube should be honest with their content creators and viewers, as the YouTube platform would not exist in its current state without them.<br/>Calls for future research and explicit recommendations are given to relevant stakeholders about how to handle parasocial phenomena.","parasocial relationship; parasocial interaction; parasocial phenomena; YouTube; influencers; influencer marketing; online content creators; Values; Emotions; value sensitive design; moral responsibility; Socio-technical system; YouTube algorithm; recommender system","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

One example of implantable medical devices for which energy harvesters could be interesting, are pacemakers. With a lifespan of about 6 to 12 years, the battery must be replaced after this period of time. Using an energy harvester instead of a battery is therefore seen as an interesting alternative. However, the human heart rate is usually between 0.6-2Hz and consists of low acceleration peaks (&lt;1g). The use of resonance at low frequency is extremely difficult, especially when the motion amplitude is larger than the device itself. A solution is sought in the non-resonant bistable energy harvesters. When enough force is applied to overcome the potential energy barrier, snap through motion is induced, resulting in a significant increase in power output. However, large threshold accelerations are limiting the usability of these systems. Therefore, stiffness compensation is required. A prototype was fabricated in which buckled flexures were used to add negative stiffness to a piezoelectric cantilever, resulting in a stiffness compensated bistable energy harvester suitable for energy harvesting from low frequency and low force excitations. The dynamical behaviour and practical performance of the prototype was studied in relation to a heartbeat, sawtooth wave and sine waves. The output power of the non-resonant prototype was compared to a resonant device, which in all cases showed that the non-resonant prototype outperformed the resonant device. This shows that stiffness compensated bistable energy harvesters can be used in order to make energy harvesting for low force and low frequency excitations, such as a heartbeat, possible.","Vibration Energy Harvesting; Piezoelectricity; Compliant Mechanisms; Pacemaker","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Mechatronic System Design (MSD)","",""

These platforms enable the infrastructure for data exchange, offering the opportunity for data providers to commercialize their datasets and save time for data consumers in identifying appropriate datasets. Conceptually, data marketplaces provide data exchange services as their core activity for the business community. However, in practice, organizations may be reluctant to exchange data through intermediaries as marketplaces instead of exchanging data bilaterally. The bilateral exchange of data gives more control to providers and consumers over the exchange process. For this purpose, a decentralized architecture could represent the peer-to-peer technical solution for the bilateral exchange. Therefore, what was previously called intermediaries, in the decentralized environment, data marketplaces are communication structures facilitating the commercial exchange of data between organizations. In this thesis, a specific focus on a decentralized architecture, namely blockchain technology, is considered for data marketplaces. The research follows the firm belief that both the technical and business specifications are essential in understanding the data marketplaces with blockchain architecture. Therefore, the decentralized architecture and the business models for data marketplaces, are researched with the overarching objective to investigate the impact of a decentralized architecture on the business models of data marketplaces.

Even though startups are a growing breed of companies. From 2016 to 2018, startups created $2.8 trillion in value, which is more than the annual GDP of the United Kingdom. In the same period, growth was at 20,6% increase from the preceding periods. Even though startups are growing in popularity, and on macro-economic scale a force to be reconed with, on the individual level they are still major gains to be made. <br/> <br/>As co-founder of Lynk, the startup used as a case in this thesis, I understand the hype around becoming a startup founder and the struggle and uncertainty coming with it. At Lynk, we are developing a B2B SaaS Document-Project Management (bingo lingo) solution for the construction industry. The product is struggling with gaining traction with customers as sales conversations are long and pilots postponed or delayed. As with the other eleven out of twelve failed startups, Lynk is having difficulty with becoming successful. Or, in other words, to launch their product.<br/>The aim of this thesis is twofold;<br/>Develop and evaluate an improved product launch plan for Lynk. <br/>Create new learnings on how startups might effectively launch a B2B SaaS products by connecting theory to practice.<br/><br/>To accomplish these goals, an action research approach is taken. With two purposes, to bring theory into practice and help bridge the gap between marketing literature and practice. At the same time, an autoethnographic reflective perspective is taken to create rich data from which new learnings are created.<br/>To develop and evaluate an improved product launch plan, the project is divided into two phases, the research and design phase. Field texts are written throughout the project and transformed into autoethnographic texts by connecting the events to literature. The texts create rich data for the development of the launch plan for Lynk, as forming anecdotal learnings for other entrepreneurs. <br/>In the research phase, a literature review is carried out and synthesised into product launch criteria concerning launch strategy and B2B selling practices. Second, Lynk’s launch practices are critically assessed through empirical research. Interviews and observations are analysed to evaluate strategic launch opportunities in each segment. Furthermore, through observations and autoethnographic reflection, Lynks sales practices are assessed. Based on the critical assessment of Lynk’s launch practices, two improvement plans are proposed to improve Lynk’s product launch. First, by developing a niche launch strategy, second by improving Lynk’s discovery and learning practices to inform future strategic planning. <br/>The design phase explores both improvement plans. A niche positioning is developed for the two most opportune segments, translating deep customer insights regarding jobs, pains and competitive alternatives into a differentiative value proposition. While a founders sales approach is proposed that embeds customer-centred discovery practices in Lynk’s customer conversations to improve reliable data gathering. The niche positionings are evaluated through a second empirical study; both new customers interviews and ongoing sales conversations are used to evaluate the new positionings. The evaluation shows the customers are interested in the value proposition, but some insights regarding product improvements are gathered. For the next iteration, it is proposed that Lynk should reduce implementation complexity and invest in both early adopters and resellers.<br/>Finally, the product launch plan is delivered to Lynk in the form of a Strategic Roadmap. The niche positioning, evaluations and customer-first discovery approach are evaluated through internal sessions with the team. From which input for further launch plan development are created. The launch plan for Lynk is summarised in a <br/>Although the road of a startup is unclear, it can be said that both the strategic planning practices underlying the positioning and customer-focused discovery help Lynk to improve its product launch plan. The positioning and discovery approach proposed in this thesis might help other B2B startups analyse their launch practices and improve their launch plan by taking a customer- and competitive first approach.<br/>This thesis aimed to improve Lynk’s launch plan. The proposed launch plan and underlying practices might help Lynk launch more effectively and improve further product development and launch in less time. On a personal note, my understanding of products and startups has changed significantly because of this thesis. By bringing theory into practice and reflecting on it in relation to daily practice, I feel I now better understand what makes a launch a success and how I can guide the development towards that. That will help in this startup, but even more so in the next. By understanding product launches better, I feel it has also improved my ability to assess and evaluate startup opportunities by considering competitive and adoption criteria.<br/>For any startup founder reading this, my giveaway would be that any product competes with other solutions. Deeply understanding the customers view on that solution, their job and the concept of product advantage will help to shape product strategy and launch products effectively.","Product launch; Startup; Product Strategy; Product Advantage; Sales strategy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

Most of these wafer based cells were made of crystalline silicon. As a crystalline silicon cell must be relatively thick to absorb most of the incoming energy, the second generation (thin film solar cells) was introduced. In the third generation the focus is more on achieving high efficiencies at low production costs. A way to achieve higher efficiencies is by the use of multi-junction devices. In such devices, different sub cells are stacked onto each other and in this way a larger part of the solar spectrum can be utilized. Moreover, the fabrication costs of multi-junction devices can significantly be reduced by using a cheap processing technique, like plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD).<br/> <br/>When germanium and germanium-tin are passivated by hydrogen atoms, Ge:H has its theoretical bandgap in the 0.9-1.1eV range and GeSn:H its bandgap in the 0.6-1.0eV range. The use of such low bandgap materials facilitates absorption of photons in the infrared spectrum, what reduces the non-absorption losses. Their low bandgaps make them perfect candidates to act as the absorber material in a bottom cell in a multi-junction device. Both materials can also be processed by PECVD.<br/> <br/>In this thesis about 100 Ge(Sn):H films were PECVD processed in the CASCADE reactor located in the Else Kooi Lab. The objective was optimizing the plasma conditions to obtain device quality thin films. A device quality bottom cell material must fulfil some requirements, like having a low bandgap, being intrinsic and having a high photo response. The influence of various deposition parameters was investigated to characterize their effect on the material properties.<br/> <br/>It was found that a densification of Ge(Sn):H generally lead to lower bandgap energies. Densification of these materials can be caused by increasing the substrate temperature (in the 250-300°C range). Next to this, a decrease in hydrogen dilution (in the 100-400 range) also leads to lower bandgap energies for the amorphous Ge(Sn):H films. By combining a substrate temperature of 290°C with a hydrogen dilution of 100, promising a-Ge:H films were processed containing refractive indexes above 5.3, optical bandgap energies below 1.1eV, activation energies above 330meV and dark conductivities below 5∙10-4 Ω-1cm-1. The material properties of the processed a-GeSn:H films were even closer to a device quality bottom cell material. Nevertheless, processing device quality GeSn:H layers remains challenging. Adding relatively large amounts of tetramethyltin (TMT) into the plasma chamber led to clusters of tin and significant oxygen and carbon concentrations throughout the layer. Managing the atomic carbon, oxygen, germanium and tin fractions could be crucial in obtaining device quality bottom cell absorber layers based on GeSn:H in the future.","germanium; tin; PECVD; temperature; a-Ge:H; nanocrystalline; oxidation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

(mentor); Kernan Freire, S. (mentor); Kiss, B. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","This thesis describes the design and development of a conversational assistant (CA) for standardized issue descriptions in manufacturing. The CA was specifically targeted at the acquisition of data on standardized issue descriptions and at the same time reduce operator friction with the system. CAs can be used to handle and process repetitive data, such as gathering data at scale. For Diversey specifically, the conversational assistant can gather data on issues and in the future on root causes, solutions and best practices. At Diversey, agile manufacturing is applied to the production process. Due to the complexity of this approach, the production process has many stoppages. Context analysis at Diversey showed that operators primarily resort to their own intuition and experience to resolve stoppages. Evaluations with operators showed that the system for data acquisition on stoppages currently in place, is an inconvenience and a time sink. The data that was captured with the system was often ambiguous, incomplete and non-descriptive. However, such data can be of significant value to the company as it can be used for process improvement of the production line. A Wizard-of-Oz-like experiment was conducted with the operators where the researcher role-played a CA for acquiring issue description, which resulted in 71 issue capturing dialogues. Even though these dialogues were filled with implicit and explicit knowledge, without proper understanding of the context, the dialogues were too chaotic and unstructured for a machine learning (ML) algorithm to understand and process. For a complete issue description, that a ML algorithm can process, several key entities were identified: machine location, machine component, machine component state, product component and product component state. Furthermore, several challenges were found related to the speech patterns of the operators. Two of these were tackled in the prototype: Usage of synonyms and pronouns. With the open-source framework Rasa, a prototype was developed for a CA that would capture product related issues through a form structure into a database. The form re-quires the following entities: machine location, product component and product component state. The form is used to guide the user to capture good, structured data, while al-lowing some flexibility in the input. With the synonym and pronoun handling features, some of this flexibility is realized. <br/>A conversational flow test was conducted to test and improve the CA prototype. Although failing the accuracy requirements set for intents by 7.4% and for entities by 2%, it provided an indication that with some information on the functionality of the CA, the participants were able to correctly capture the set issue. With some training of the operators, it would be feasible to implement such a CA in a manufacturing environment. Through contextual filtering, the model can filter towards the input of the user, allowing for only context-specific issue to be captured. With a qualitative test it was concluded that this feature decreased the duration of issue capturing. The contextual filtering and issue description control provide feedback to the user whether correct information is captured. <br","Conversational Agent; Machine Learning; Manufacturing; Standardization; issue description","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

With an ageing world population, the costs for healthcare and the shortages in medical staff are continually increasing. In the Netherlands, out-of-hours general practitioner departments, or ‘huisartsenposten’, suffer from this increasing pressure in their telephone triage systems: the departments are crowded and the staff capacity is too low to adequately handle the amount of patients. This often leads to long waiting times on the phone for patients in need of potentially urgent medical care and to high pressure work environments for staff. There is no insight into when and why it is crowded, how high waiting times emerge from this, and how changes can be made in the departments internally and beyond to reduce this problem. In this thesis, research is presented that addresses the practical and scientific lack of knowledge of the factors that influence the out-of-hours departments and that identifies how waiting times can be reduced. The results of this thesis focus on the identification of the factors that influence the demand for healthcare and the service times of people at the out-of-hours departments, and they focus on the practical implications for reducing waiting times at these departments. Based on extensive data analysis of two out-of-hours departments in the Netherlands, it was found that temporal factors such as season, part of the week, day of the week and hour of the day, but also the weather conditions and the urgency of the problem of the patient have an impact on demand for healthcare and on service times at these departments. These factors determine how busy it will be and whether or not waiting times will emerge. With the knowledge of these factors, a discrete event simulation model was implemented to identify what system changes are necessary to reduce waiting times at these out-of-hours departments. It was found that there are several quick-win interventions that can help reduce waiting times: shifting of patients from peak demand, implementation of overlapping work shifts for staff and automatic retrieval of patient information when they are waiting in the queue on the phone. There are also some long term interventions, more focused on behavior change of people, that can be implemented: increased accessibility and understanding of the primary healthcare system, a small (dis)incentive for out-of-hours care, separate telephone lines for home care and implementation of working from home for staff.","healthcare; discrete event simulation; simulation model; out-of-hours care; data; python; modeling; healthcare system","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","",""

This pledge involves, among other things, emission reductions in the transportation sector, which accounts for a quarter of Europe’s greenhouse gas emissions. Transportation electrification has been identified as a critical strategy for lowering greenhouse gas emissions. Electric vehicles (EVs) are a critical component in a future of more ecologically friendly transportation. Electric vehicles, on the other hand, are not a panacea for decarbonizing the transportation sector, as they contribute only when powered by renewable energy. Their adoption may cause congestion issues on the electrical grid, but also inconvenient driving experience due to lengthy charging times and restricted driving range. These concerns can be addressed by integrating photovoltaics onto vehicles. Vehicle integrated photovoltaics (VIPV) is a photovoltaic (PV) application that has gained increasing attention in recent years due to the decrease in the cost of solar cells and their increasing efficiency. The purpose of this research is to establish a modeling methodology for estimating the photovoltaic potential of an urban vehicle fleet. The model generates a user defined number of random trajectories that simulate traffic within city limits and calculates the DC energy output of the fleet’s vehicle integrated photovoltaics by taking into account the vehicle’s trajectories, spatial irradiation data along the path and during parking periods, the roof curvature, and the effect of the vehicle’s speed on module temperature. This thesis examined city cars in Eindhoven with a VIPV of 1.34 m2. The base case study investigated a fleet of 1000 cars traveling at an average speed of 30 kilometers per hour, once per day, with VIPV module height of 1.5 m. An automobile in this scenario produces close to 128.5 kWh of DC energy annually in average. The average consumption of the car in this case is almost 131 Wh/km , which means that VIPV can increase the driving range annually by approximately 981 kilometers. The fleet’s annual DC energy output distribution is quite interesting as it is extremely close to the Weibull distribution. The effect of numerous input factors on the DC energy output of the fleet was explored. The larger the fleet size, the better the fit between the fleet’s yearly DC energy distribution and the Weibull distribution. The increased height of the VIPV module enhances DC energy generation, and the influence of car speed on DC power output is significant, owing to the cooling effect of the head-wind on the module’s temperature.","VIPV; Vehicle Integrated Photovoltaics; urban energy transition; Photovoltaics; Photovoltaic systems; Urban environment; EVs","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-11-17","","","","Electrical Engineering","",""

(mentor); Correljé, A. (graduation committee); Schröder, E. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Carbon accounting in the financial sector has experienced a rapid growth over the last years. Both private and public institutions have focused their attention on the role the financial sector can play in accelerating the transition to a low carbon economy. More than 80% of the financial institutions worldwide acknowledge the importance of GHG accounting for their loans and investment. However, less than 20% of these institutions actually measure and report on their climate impact. An often heard argument for this lacking carbon disclosure is data quality and the need for estimation models to improve this data. Less attention in academic research has been focused on the basics of carbon accounting methodologies. The larger part of capital in the world finds itself in the financial sector in public and private institutions. Accelerating the transition to a low carbon economy will require a shift of this capital to a more sustainable focus. In order to identify carbon intensive investments and to track the decarbonisation of loans and investments as a financial institution, carbon accounting plays an important role. This research aims to improve the approach that forms the basis for carbon accounting used in financial institutions. More attention in this field can possibly trigger a line of events with more attention to the climate impact of the investing world. Ideally this can lead to more sustainable investments and carbon reduction on a global scale. The question aimed to answer in this research is the following: What is the most adequate approach for financial institutions to measure financed emissions?<br/><br/>This study goes into the existing carbon accounting methodologies and metrics. The current approaches are analysed and the four most common metrics selected. The major accounting issue following from this overview and related interviews is that there is no approach combining investments in equity and debt when allocating emissions. Based on this observation three alternative accounting approaches are proposed and assessed on their contribution and sensitivity in order to come to an improved practice for carbon accounting. The three discussed approaches are the use of Enterprise Value Including Cash, Balance Sheet Total and separate allocation for equity and debt. The alternatives of using Enterprise Value Including Cash and Balance Sheet Total together with four of the existing carbon accounting metrics are evaluated on a set of 7 qualitative criteria. This evaluation brings the use of Enterprise Value Including Cash forward as the preferred metric. The second evaluation of the metrics is done through a quantitative approach using a sample investment portfolio to test the metrics in a practical situation. Here, the four remaining metrics are compared in their performance over a time-span of 5 years. With the use of experiments this performance is evaluated, where the use of Enterprise Value Including Cash and Balance Sheet Total show the most potential.<br/><br/>The research concludes that the use of Enterprise Value Including Cash is the preferred approach. This approach enables the financial institution to assess the carbon footprint of their investment portfolio for both equity and bonds investments in listed companies. The advantage of this method is that it avoids double counting and the emissions are allocated to the actual invested values. A downside of the Enterprise Value Including Cash is the dependency on market development and therefore market volatility. This can cause issues when analyzing the trend of decarbonisation of an investment portfolio. This research recognizes this problem and proposes research into corrections to mitigate the issue. This improved practice should enable the financial sector to harmonize their approach in carbon accounting to ensure higher comparability, transparency and consistency in the landscape of carbon accounting. The next step would be piloting the improved methodology in a real investment environment on real-time data.","Carbon accounting; Attributing emissions; Carbon Disclosure; Sustainable Finance; Greenhouse Gas Protocol","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

(mentor); Greidanus, A.J. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Onshore and offshore multiphase pipelines provide a safe and effective solution for the transport of fluids from wells to production plants in the oil and gas industry. For the control of the accumulated amount of liquid present in the pipeline (the so-called liquid holdup) and for the regular maintenance of the pipeline, pigs (Pipeline Inspection Gauges) are conventionally used. To reduce the pig-generated volume (which is the amount of extra liquid that is removed from the pipeline due to the pig traverse), research in the past decades showed that a bypass pig can be used as a more attractive alternative. With the bypass pig, the size of the slugcatcher (which temporarily stores the pig-generated volume at the end of the pipeline) can be reduced. To reduce the risk of stalling of the bypass pig in the pipeline and the risk of exceeding the available liquid storage volume of the slugcatcher, undersized ball pigs can be deployed prior to launching the bypass pig. The undersized ball pig will be smaller than the pipe internal diameter (e.g., 0.9 ⋅ D) and will not experience significant friction with the pipe wall. Furthermore, the pig-generated volume will be smaller than what is found with the bypass pig as the ball pig will leak some liquid volume; this means that not all liquid is driven out of the pipe by the pig, but some liquid is moved to and left behind the pig. Although ball pigging is already used in some field operations, its use can be extended if the fluid physics are better understood and reliable models for preparing such operations are available.<br/>In this Master Thesis Project, small scale experiments were carried out to investigate the undersized ball pig behaviour in a 52 mm diameter, 60 m long multiphase flow loop located in the Process &amp; Energy Laboratory at the campus of Delft University of Technology. Air and water are used as the working fluids. The performed experiments were used to get a better understanding of the parameters that determine the flow around an undersized ball pig. The pig velocity and the liquid leakage were of particular interest. Two pressure sensors, a liquid hold-up sensor, three cameras, and a weighing scale were used as the measurement system. Three buoyant pigs were created using a 3Dprinter. The three ball pigs varied in size: 42 mm, 45 mm, and 48 mm. In addition, a flexible ball pig of 50 mm was used. The pigs were released in a stratified flow through a pig launcher. The presence of (wavy) stratified flow in this flow loop maintained up to a certain upper limit for the flowrates (u<sub>SG</sub> = 4 m/s, u<sub>SL</sub> = 0.0628 m/s). Higher liquid flow velocities would rapidly create intermittent slugs. <br/>The pigging observations showed that it is recommended for industrial applications to create buoyant pigs (e.g., 3Dprinted balls) when using a diameter ratio (the ratio between the pig diameter and the inner pipe diameter) of approximately 0.9. This reduces the risk of stalling of the undersized ball pig. From the local video recordings, it can be observed that undersized ball pigs accumulate liquid while creating one or multiple liquid slugs. The created liquid slug will propagate and separate from the pig, whereafter a new liquid accumulation at the front of the pig is created. The local pig velocity is found to be oscillatory in time, due to liquid slug accumulation and liquid slug propagation. It is found that the normalized pig velocity (being the pig velocity divided by the mixture velocity) increases with increasing superficial gas velocity according to three different regions. In the first region, almost no increase in the normalized pig velocity can be observed. In the second region, the normalized pig velocity increases significantly. In the third region, the normalized pig velocity reaches a stable level. The transition from the first to the second region was found to have a local Reynolds number of about 2000-3000 for the gas. The normalized pig velocity in the second region and in the third region can be approximated with a power law correlation for the various pigs. <br/>It is found that the liquid leakage increases with increasing superficial gas velocity and decreases with increasing superficial liquid velocity. The liquid leakage versus the superficial gas velocity increases linearly from approximately u<sub>SG</sub> = 2 m/s onward. A larger diameter ratio results in a lower liquid leakage. The difference in liquid leakage between the various pigs decreases for large superficial gas velocities (u<sub>SG </sub>≈ 4 m/s). For low superficial gas velocities (u<sub>SG</sub> ≈ 0.5 m/s), a liquid leakage below zero was found. Undersized ball pigging becomes ineffective for these low velocities because the liquid flow will overtake the pig instead of leaking past the pig. The experimental leakage results have been approximated with a power law fit. At last, an analytical leakage model, provided by the OLGA commercial package for dynamic multiphase pipeline simulations, is used to compare the experimental liquid leakage. It is found that the OLGA model significantly underpredicts the values of the experimentally found liquid leakage. Improving this model is desirable so that it can be used in multiphase pipe simulations in the industry. <br/>The results in this study show that undersized ball pigging is associated with some distinct observed phenomena. These observations contribute to the understanding of the fundamental fluid flow structures around an undersized ball pig. The influence of the diameter ratio and the fluid flow velocities on the pig velocity and on the liquid leakage were determined. The measured influence of these parameters will help in the estimation of the pig velocity and the estimation of the leaked volume when industrial pipeline conditions are known. <br/>It is recommended for future research to focus on improved models to determine the pig velocity and the liquid leakage such that the use of undersized ball pigs can be reliably extended. Additional pigging experiments with local video recordings can be helpful.","Undersized ball Pig; Pipeline maintenance; Pipeline flow; Multiphase Flow","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Energy, Flow and Process Technology","",""

During high pressurized conditions there are possibilities of high thermal loads on the pressure vessel, leading to pipe ruptures. As part of breakdown measures, the emergency core cooling system is activated and the coolant is mixed with the fluid in the cold leg, giving rise to multiphase turbulent flow. These regimes can comprise of large scale interfaces, leading to stratified flows. These postulated accidents or events need to be identified and understood to improve nuclear reactor safety. Computational fluid dynamics can serve as an excellent tool to model these scenarios, contributes towards reactor safety. Coarse models which are widely used in industries such as RANS are known to over-predict turbulent producing unphysical gradients. Thus the turbulent mass and momentum are not yet fully understood. Using high resolution tools such as Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS), can potentially avoid these over-prediction and could model these large scale interfaces accurately. As a long term goal, the data sets generated from these simulations can be used to train such coarse models or simply support for validation. <br/><br/>Placing the focus on a configuration where two fluids are in a stratified scenario, this graduation thesis will show a systematic approach towards the development and modelling of air and water moving in both co-current and counter-current direction, wherein simulations are performed in RK-Basilisk. Primarily, the work starts with studying a single phase turbulent channel flow to forma basis of understanding of concepts and code. The model of (Liu et al. 2009), who use realistic properties of air-water is chosen to be implemented in RK-Basilisk. It is realized that, implementing this is in RK-Basilisk is not straightforward and thus the constraints are identified and a general mathematical framework is developed to resolve this. One of the main objectives in this thesis is to model and understand the turbulent behavior near the interface of both air and water. To do so, the physical mechanisms which govern the generation and decay of turbulence called the TKE Budgets is studied by modelling the individual terms that complete it. The budgets are modelled and validated against (Liu et al. 2009). Interesting conclusions are drawn which depict the trends of budget terms and the kinetic energy, giving a good picture of the underlying interfacial turbulent mechanisms. The same mathematical framework, along with some additional modelling lead to an extension of this study to counter-current flows, wherein another set of<br/>conclusions are drawn.","CFD; Turbulence; Multiphase Flow; Nuclear Safety; Stratified flows; DNS","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics | COSSE (Computer Simulations for Science and Engineering)","",""

The performance of these lightweight composites can be further optimized by using spread tows as a reinforcement solution. Tow spreading is a process of flattening fibre tows into thinner and wider tapes with a low aerial weight which increases resin impregnation of fibres, lowers void content in impregnated tows and produces lightweight composites with improved damage tolerance. <br/><br/>The majority of tow spreading technology however is owned by companies in the form of intellectual property and patents thus limiting the scientific understanding of the process. This aspect leaves tow spreading open as a field of research for exploration and investigation. While some previous studies have investigated the process of tow spreading, the applicability of these studies has so far been limited in their experimental apparatus. These studies identified the gap that exists between the sophisticated industrial technology and the research setups hence providing an incentive to further develop an experimental facility that generates a deeper understanding of the current industrial practices in tow spreading. <br/><br/>In this research, a mechanical tow spreader was developed that utilizes cylindrical spreader bars to facilitate the spreading of fibres. This was followed by an experimental analysis where different input parameters in the tow spreader such as tension, spreader bar orientation, heat and speed among others were investigated to understand their influence on spreading behaviour. Lastly, a microstructural investigation of spread tow was conducted where a technique to capture the spread of fibres in the tow was developed and microstructural samples were generated. These samples were then observed under a microscope to visualize the evolution of fibre distribution as the tow spreads.<br","Microstructure; Fibre spreading; Composites; Aerospace structures","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

To produce an Impulse waveform of magnitude 250 kV across a capacitive load of 10 nF with a rise time of 1.2 µs as output voltage, each Power Electronic device incorporated into each Sub-Module of the MMC has to conduct pulse currents as high as 850 Amperes. Moreover, the Impulse Waveform has a very short time duration. Hence the Power Electronic devices need to conduct such high current magnitude only for a very short duration of time. This motivates this Master thesis to find out how many multiples of its rated current a Power Electronic device is able to conduct within such short time and what factor limits the peak current capability of the Power Electronic device. However, to produce an output voltage of any other waveshape each Power Electronic device of each Sub-Module of the MMC has to conduct only a few amperes of continuous current. Employing Power Electronic devices of current rating as high as pulse currents of Impulse waveform is not only uneconomical since other waveforms do not require such high continuous currents, but also such Power Electronic devices of high current rating would make the MMC bulkier.<br/>To identify the Power Electronic device technology that is capable of conducting such high pulse currents, a literature review is conducted among IGBT, MOSFET and their types. Each device of IGBT and MOSFET is compared to one another. Finally, the most promising switching technology is chosen among MOSFET and IGBT based on three criteria namely, high peak current capability, high voltage blocking capability and high switching frequency.<br/>A prototype of Pulse Current Test circuit is built to test the peak pulse current of the chosen switching technology. Then, the factors that can be utilized to achieve the peak pulse current are identified.

In line with this agreement the European Union created the Green deal stating that by 2030 at least 55% of the greenhouse gas emissions need to be reduced (in comparison with 1990) and that in 2050 each member state needs to have a net-zero greenhouse gas economy. The mobility sector has increasingly contributed to the European GHG emissions over the past years and are currently responsible for 25% of these emissions. Therefore, a clear goal was set for the mobility sector to reduce the GHG emissions by 90% by 2050. Hydrogen could play a key role in achieving the objectives of the European Green deal within the mobility sector. However, it is imperative that production of this fuel is sustainable with low or zero emissions. In addition to hydrogen as a fuel, other means are available for the mobility sector to reduce their GHG emissions. Electricity, bio-fuels and synthetic fuels are as well able to reduce environmental pollution assuming these fuels are produced renewably. Whether each of these four fuel types is sustainable depends on the production process. For production of low carbon hydrogen, two production processes dominate in literature as well as in national policy strategies. These processes include hydrogen production through electrolysis of water powered by renewable energy sources (RES) and through reforming natural gas combined with carbon capture and storage (CCS). In addition to technical innovation of sustainable fuels, the set goals for reduction of GHG emissions require appropriate (inter)national policy. European and national policies on hydrogen fuels should cover investments, regulation, market creation, and research and innovation. The Netherlands has created a national hydrogen strategy that would aid in reducing the GHG emissions through applications in the mobility sector, the industry sector, heat production and agriculture. Because the mobility sector was responsible for 19% of the GHG emissions in the Netherlands in2019, this research focuses on the hydrogen application in that specific sector with the aim to provide an answer to the following research question: <br/>What recommendations can be provided to obtain a feasible business case for the supply chain of a hydrogen refueling station with low carbon hydrogen in the Netherlands?

A repeated-measures analysis of variance showed a significant main effect of the type of bike used (p = 0.001). EMG intensity in the power phase was different between the Racing Bike and both conditions of the motorised indoor trainer. However, it can not be concluded that road cycling muscle activity is different from indoor trainers due to the lack of differences between Spin Bike and Racing Bike. Additionally, no differences were found between the two modes of motorised indoor trainer, which suggested that muscle activity might not be affected by the crank inertial load during steady-state cycling.

However, detailed models tend to be ‘bad’ in the evaluation of uncertainty in a system. This can be problematic, as the outcomes of detailed models usually depend on numerous dubious assumptions that are too buried to be understood by hand. As simplified models can better cope with uncertainty, this study examined the combined use of a detailed model and a simplified model (this approach is also known as ‘multi-resolution modelling’) to improve the robustness of a naval force support system. In order to work with models with different levels of detail, an existing detailed model that reflects certain elements of the force support system of the Dutch Royal Navy is used to develop a new simpler model. <br/><br/>The key takeaway of this study is that multi-resolution modelling can be considered useful as the detailed model and the simplified model were found to be mutually dependent in their design, validity, and use to improve the robustness of a naval force support system.

The detailed model also remains important for the evaluation of the real-world effectiveness of promising ‘high-level’ actions discovered by the simplified model. Vice versa, by means of exploratory analysis, the simplified model revealed some potentially problematic assumptions in the detailed model which has implications for its design and validity. Also, the simplified model gave insight into (a) problematic scenarios that lead to a low sailing availability, (b) patterns in the robustness of policies across different usage profiles, and (c) potential leverage points to increase the robustness of the naval force support system.

Consciousness is a salient feature of the brain, whose neurophysiological features are difficult to be distinguished from unconsciousness. Though it can be defined as an event arising due to interactions in the nervous system, it entirely is not a reliable mechanism. Thus, tracking changes in the brain waves caused by GA is a challenging problem in neuroscience. The exact mechanism to quantify the state of the brain and to distinguish between conscious and unconscious brain is still difficult. Specific features to characterize the state of the brain from the patterns of the brain signal is challenging. Present-day depth of anesthesia monitors index values does not quantify the state of the brain.<br/><br/>An alternative approach is to use dynamical systems theory to assess the underlying dynamics of the brain with imaging technology (e.g., electroencephalographic and electrocorticographic data). Previous results from the literature suggest that stability can play a role in the characterization of unconsciousness. This thesis proposes a detailed study that focus on dynamical systems properties that go beyond stability. In particular, the proposed methodology aims to assess which regions of the brain intervene in the process of consciousness and unconsciousness, as well as quantify how often they interact with each other. Specifically, the approach seeks to leverage the eigenstructure of the underlying approximation of the neural activity captured from intracranial electrocorticographic data.<br/><br/>Our results show that it is possible to differentiate between anesthetic stages of the brain using eigendecomposition.

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","With the current urgency to become more circular, procurement presents the primary method to deliver the circular policy ambition by purchasing circular products and stimulating circularity in the market. In the building and infrastructure sector, civil engineering projects offer unique opportunities for circularity. This research presents an assessment of the implementation fidelity of the circular ambition within the tendering process. It examines for each of the methods that define the tendering process, the tendered project, and the awarding framework whether the way circularity is being implemented delivers the ambition as expected.<br/>Along with the four research phases, the research devises and uses a framework to assess the fidelity of circularity implementation through the methods to include it in the tendering of civil engineering works. The implementation fidelity framework is used to; create a holistic analysis that captures the many facets impacting the tendering process; determine areas of issues and, consequently, room for improvements; and differentiate between the methods to include the circular ambition in the process. Through three study cases, the construct of the analysis managed to capture the data between quantitative and qualitative in a consistent and interpretable manner. It creates a consistent link between the fidelity dimensions, the corresponding issue areas, and the methods to include circularity in the tendering process. <br/>The room for improvement follows the three moderating dimensions, exposure, quality of delivery, and participation. The research links the issues impacting the fidelity of circular ambition implementation in three categories: structural issues, implementation traps, and policy-related, to the three moderating dimensions. The research acknowledges that policy-related issues impact at a sector level as issues inherent to the policy itself. Nonetheless, the research finds that, on an organizational level, removing structural issues and implementation traps raises overall fidelity and reduces the effect of policy-related issues. Increasing this fidelity reflects on the efficacy of the methods to include circularity in tendering, individually and as a group of instruments intended to complement each other. <br/>In conclusion, the research recommends practical use of the implementation fidelity framework, which would feed into the body of expertise within an organization to improve future tendering processes to include, enable, and produce more circular solutions with more efficacy in the use of the methods. It will also allow aligning perceptions of the contractors and the contracting authority on one hand and the policymakers and policy implementers on the other hand. For future research, examining all five implementation fidelity dimensions for the instruments and processes at the different levels throughout the procurement cycle is most compatible with the circular ambition in the building and infrastructure sector. This could be most beneficial to establish a more vital link between policymakers and policy implementers. Moreover, it would support future efforts to update the circular ambition goals and milestones by presenting a more encompassing image of the policy implementation fidelity in real-world settings.","Circularity; Circular economy (CE); Implementation fidelity; Policy implementation; Procurement; Tendering; Civil engineering projects; The construction and infrastructure sector","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021"," Distributed surface roughness elements characterise Thermal Protection Systems (TPS) typical of supersonic and hypersonic flows. The presence of these distributed roughness elements cause an increase in drag and heat transfer.  As opposed to incompressible flow over roughness elements, there are very few experimental and numerical studies on supersonic flow over roughness. The most fundamental computational technique wherein, all scales of turbulence is resolved is Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS). The cost of performing DNS of fully resolved roughness is even higher than canonical DNS because of the refined mesh needed to solve the roughness elements.  To overcome this limitation, the current thesis aims at exploring low cost alternatives to DNS of fully resolved roughness for studying the effect of drag and heat transfer in supersonic flow over rough walls. DNS results from fully resolved full channel cube roughness for Mach 2 and Mach 4 at friction Reynolds number Re<sub>τ</sub> = 500,1000<sub> </sub> are analyzed. The results from the low cost models are compared against the fully resolved roughness simulated using full channels. Three lower-cost alternative, namely DNS of minimal channel flow of fully resolved roughness, DNS of modelled roughness and resolved RANS are considered. As for the DNS of minimal channel flow, it is found that the velocity shift ΔU<sup>+</sup> is predicted accurately and therefore the added drag. However, it cannot be used to predict the temperature field because of lack of outer layer similarity for the thermodynamic statistics. As for the modeled roughness, an extension of the model by Busse and Sandham originally developed for incompressible flows is considered. In this case the roughness geometry is substituted by the additional drag and heat transfer that it induces on the flow, which take the form of source terms in the momentum and energy equations. We perform 17 DNS simulations with modeled roughness and compare the results to the fully resolved simulation. We find that the parametric forcing method is able to predict the velocity shift with good accuracy, although recovering the equivalent roughness height from the model parameters can only be done <i>a posteriori.</i> The model is able to qualitatively reproduce the temperature field, but thermodynamic statistics are inaccurate when compared to DNS of the fully resolved geometry. The final computational technique is RANS. In real case applications, RANS require the use of wall functions, and in the case of rough walls knowledge of the equivalent roughness height k<sub>s</sub><sup>+</sup> is necessary. We attempt to see if RANS of fully resolved roughness can be used to estimate the velocity shift ΔU<sup>+</sup> and therefore  k<sub>s</sub><sup>+</sup> by limiting ourself to the  linear Spalart-Allmaras (SA) model. It is found to be inaccurate in computing the mean velocity profile at  k<sub>s</sub><sup>+</sup>≈ 40 with improvements in accuracy observed for k<sub>s</sub><sup>+</sup>≈ 80 when compared with the results from DNS for cube roughness element.

One of the biggest challenges still to be overcome is that of inadequate diagnoses. This research explores the opportunities that Hyperspectral Imaging yields in this field. The first goal is to estimate the spectral signature of Malaria parasites in non-stained or Giemsa-stained thin smear blood samples and of Schistosoma parasite eggs in urine samples. For this different endmember extraction algorithms are combined with various methods of pre-processing and dimensionallity reduction. The used endmember extraction methods are pure pixel index (PPI), NFINDR, Statistics Based and simplex identification via split augmented Lagrangian (SISAL). For denoising Savitzky Golay and 3 dimensional gaussian filtering is used and the dimensionallity reduction is done with PCA, ICA or HySime. The resulting spectral signatures of the algorithms are validated by inspecting the endmember locations, spectra and abundance maps. They have furthermore been compared by the classification performance where the spectral signatures are used in the feature derivation. This is done by deriving a detection map using OSP or CEM detection and then using the SVM or random forest classifiers to classify cells as being infected or not. These performances are furthermore compared to RGB image based classification.<br/><br/>In case of the stained Malaria sample the four endmember extraction methods are shown to be applicable to various degrees. Firstly, the PPI method is shown to be inconsistent, resulting in different spectra each run. Secondly, the statistics based method unable to separate the spectral signatures of the red blood cells and thirdly the background. Thirdly, The NFINDR method seems to work well considering the endmember locations, spectra and abundance maps, but leads to a low classification performance. The research concludes that Sisal made the most accurate estimations of the spectral signature of the parasite. The results from all the validation methods are in line with expectations. Furthermore, the use of this spectral signature in the feature derivation process results in the highest classification performance. This performance is also shown to be significantly higher compared to using either the first principal component of the full hyperspectral data or the RGB images. Applying the same methods to the Schistosoma sample it is found that some of the methods, though interestingly not Sisal, are able to to create an abundance map in which the egg is separated from the background. However, none of them are able to separate the egg and the white blood cell and detection maps using these signatures did not show the egg more clearly than the first principal component did. None of the methods are found to be able to extract the spectral signature of the unstained Malaria parasite. <br/><br/>Finally, a hypothetical multispectral microscope is proposed which images at the wavelengths where the spectral signature of the parasite in a stained sample has the biggest difference in light transmittance to the other endmembers. This setup is simulated from the available hyperspectral data and its classification performance is compared to classification performance using the full hyperspectral data and using the RGB images which are simulated from the same data. The classification using the discriminative wavelengths is found to outperform both in terms of sensitivity and specificity. This implies that the images at these specific wavelengths provide more discriminative power and such a multispectral setup could provide a significant advantage over RGB imaging.","Malaria; Schistosomiasis; Hyperspectral Imagery; Multispectral Imagery; Endmember Extraction; Classification","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

One of its leading causes is the lack of waste collection systems in developing countries. Actions need to be taken to overcome this issue, and Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) seems to be an effective solution for encountering plastic waste. Indonesia is the second-largest plastic polluter and is, therefore, a location of interest for implementing EPR systems.<br/><br/>EPR is a policy approach in which producers become responsible for the whole life cycle of their product. In Europe, this is a standard tool that makes producers (mostly financially) accountable for the end-of-life stage of their product. EPR can also stimulate design-for-environment: optimizing products to become more reusable or recyclable. EPR consists of many instruments that can be implemented in different ways. Still, little research has been done on which instruments can be effectively applied in developing countries like Indonesia. There are no EPR instruments currently used, little waste management infrastructure exists, and most recycling activities are realized through informal waste collectors. These types of local factors are of great importance when implementing waste management policies like EPR.<br/><br/>Two gaps were found in previous literature. First, the effects of individual and combinations of EPR instruments on developing waste management systems have not been researched before. Secondly, simulation studies have not analyzed EPR instruments in combination with contextual factors of the country of interest. Therefore, this thesis tries to answer the following research question.<br/>“What are the effects of 3 selected Extended Producer Responsibility instruments on the key actors in the plastic waste system of average cities in Indonesia?”<br/><br/>Research approach<br/>A design-science research approach is combined with an agent-based model to answer this question, consisting of three parts. <br/>First, the Knowledge base was established by desk research. Literature was consulted to find the state of the art of the most critical aspects of the study: plastic waste in Indonesia and EPR. Secondly, the Environment is created by integrating semi-structured interviews with literature to find important factors that make the implementation of EPR interventions in the context of Indonesia more realistic. The third part of the design science research is to design the artifact. A conceptual model was made of the plastic waste system in Indonesia. This model was put into the programming language NetLogo, which can capture agent behavior in complex adaptive systems...<br","Extended Producer Responsibility; EPR; Indonesia; Plastic; Plastic Waste; ABM; Agent-based modeling; Agent-based modelling; Interviews; Design Science Research; DSR","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Industrial Ecology","",""

Compared methods are from the NEN 9997-1 (NEN), CUR 2001-8 report (CUR) and a newly developed international standard (ISO). It is generally accepted that the NEN is overly simplistic and research shows the CUR to be generally over-predicting capacity, but the implications of these flaws are not in detail investigated. Per method, the behaviour of shaft and base resistances/capacities and total axial capacity were modelled for constant cone resistance, real CPT's and applied to case studies. Case studies, where possible, are focused on Dutch soil condition to see how the ISO would apply. The capacities were modelled over the whole domain of the CPT to get insight in general behaviour of the methods and to see where potential weaknesses lie. Also an evaluation on installation effects as residual stresses and pile ageing was done.<br/><br/>The CUR and NEN both have demonstrable flaws that negatively impact their capacity predictions, and most notable are their approach on shaft friction that translates to non-optimal shaft capacity profiles. Also, their response on increasing diameters of concern, as design methods are in enormous disagreement on capacities for piles with diameters larger than 1 m. Predictions compared to each other can vary threefold and differ with 8.5 MN.<br/><br/>The CUR generally over-predicts capacities in looser sands but under-predicts for deeper tests. The NEN generally under-predicts for denser sands but is sometimes largest of three for looser sands. General under-prediction does not necessarily mean the method is conservative. The ISO performs in most cases best, and uses a predictive plug length to influence both shaft and base capacity. The NEN is poorly suited for design, the CUR is in particular unsuited for longer piles or diameters larger than 1 m. The ISO is an improvement on current design guidelines for the Netherlands and a good step in incorporating plugging in the design of open-ended piles.<br","open-ended tubular piles; cone penetration test (CPT); foundation design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geo-Engineering","",""

India intends to improve the amount of wind energy integration into the national electricity system. Wind/solar energy's major drawback is its inherent changeability and source unpredictability, making it a challenging resource to dispatch.<br/><br/>A proposed PHS system known as Subsea Pumped Hydro Storage (SPHS) has been assessed from a techno-economic standpoint. As intermittent renewable energy sources become increasingly widespread in the electrical system, the demand for power regulation grows. Implementing energy storage in the system is one approach to balance the demand for power with the supply. This thesis looked at an idea that is a sea-based variant of the existing pumped hydro storage technique. A SPHS unit is made up of a hollow structure on the seabed that may be emptied of water using a pump during periods of low demand and high energy generation in the system, and the unit is charged at that moment. When the system requires more energy, water is permitted to flow into the tank through a turbine, creating power.<br/><br/> In India, a locality study of prospective areas where the PHS may be placed and operated effectively is carried out. Muppandal (Tamil Nadu) is used as a case study. When the PHES is used, a positive influence on the power system's behavior may be seen, with the degree of wind integration being raised and dispatched on demand. The generation of peak demand by inefficient and costly units is reduced, lowering the total generating cost.<br/><br/>The main goal of this work is to determine the Technical feasibility of a proposed SPHSP system and to evaluate Levelised cost of storage. The study will be conducted to reach out to the suitable selection of turbines and pumps and to design the concrete storage tank in such a deep-sea environment. It is observed that the maximum depth upto which the storage tank can be built is 1200m depth for 5m high wall and 1000m depth for 7m high wall. The appropriate turbine is selected based on specific speed and it comes out that Francis turbine is suitable for depth 200m to 1200m. The levelised cost of storage (LCOS) is also calculated, and it works out to be $4.53 per kilowatt hour for 1200m depth. There are different methods suggested to increase the bearing capacity of the soil and compaction grouting seems to be the most appropriate improvement method.<br","Feasibility; Pumped hydro storage; Techno-economic analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

Next-generation devices will require single-cell resolution, and bidirectional capabilities to classify and selectively stimulate different cell types in the RGC population as to produce an image closer to healthy eye operation. The classification process requires the capture of direct neural responses immediately following stimulus. A significant challenge to overcome before the next generation of devices can be realised is the stimulation artifact. Stimulation artifacts are large unwanted voltages resulting from interactions between the stimulation current and the tissue-electrode impedance that can last for tens to hundreds of milliseconds, saturating the recording electronics and obscuring the direct responses. This work aims to develop a novel stimulation artifact reduction method that can be implemented in high-resolution, high channel-count brain-machine interfaces. The algorithm requires generating a model of the tissue-electrode interface from discrete measurements in the time or frequency domain, and constructing a stimulation waveform that maximally reduces the duration of the residual artifact without the need for complex recording front-end electronics. The proposed method also includes a trimming step that corrects for small variations in the model parameters and stimulation currents. Using a custom stimulation and recording test board, the algorithm was tested for 30 µm diameter gold/polyurethane electrodes in saline solution. Anodic stimulation current pulses of -100 to -500nA and 50 to 250 µs were successfully corrected for, resulting in an average artifact recovery time of 124 µs at the stimulating electrode when measured from the end of the anodic (working) phase. This corresponds to a mean 81% improvement from the next best conventional charge-balanced stimulation waveform, and 79% improvement when compared to an active-discharge recovery method.

Nearly all the studies that are done in this field are on measuring the actual performance of the human while performing the collaborative task with the automation system rather than understanding the complete picture of how the human is understanding and interpreting the automation is his actions due to just chance or does he/she have logical the reasoning for his/her actions.<br/>This research consists of recognising the factors that affect the mental model, designing the experiment that measures the mental model as well as the factors that affect it. This work focuses on ALKS (Automated lane keep assist system) which is a subset of the SAE level 3 automation system for which the rules are laid down by UNECE(United Nation Economic Commission for Europe).<br/>The approach of this research consists of an experimental setup in which the participants are given training and then are allowed to experience the level 3 automation in the driving simulator. The training and the simulation are designed to give a different depth in the functionalities and limitations of the system. The weak training just briefly describes the limitations of the system and how to interpret the user interface based on research done by Strand [35] with the consumer of level 2 automation system, on the other hand, the stronger training explains in detail the functionality and the limitations of the system along with the video explanations of how the automation will react in the different scenarios. Both the training are available in English and Dutch depending language preference of the participant. The participants are divided into 2 groups both of them are given different training but both of them experience similar driving conditions on the driving simulator.<br/>Later the performance of the mental model, as well as the performance of the factors affecting the mental model are measured. Each participant receives the training once and is subjected to 3 trials of the driving simulation to understand the learning effect of the mental model and its related factors. The results of the mental model performance show that there is a significant gap of 5.5% between the weak and the strong mental model group just after the training, this trend then continues until the last trial where a significant gap of 6.5% in the mental model score.<br/>A positive learning curve is also observed starting from the training to the last trial, the learning curve has a positive trend but the data is statistically insignificant to show the difference in the learning rate of the two different groups. There is a significant gap observed between the automation acceptance level of the two groups, although there is no significant rise in the level of acceptance of automation from just after the training to the last trials their difference in the acceptance level is present after the training and all the trials. For the trust level, the difference between the two groups is statistically insignificant, the difference is too small and the number of participants for the experiment is too less. Analysing the pragmatic significance of the trust data, a positive trend can be seen for the strong group whereas the weak group shows a negative trend, even though at the start of the experiment the weak group had a higher trust level. For situational awareness, the weak model group shows the lower situation awareness throughout the lap as compared to the strong mental model group.<br","Mental Models; Automated lane keep assist system; Situation Awareness; Trust; Acceptance; DAVSi; Automated Vehicles; Simulation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Vehicle Engineering | Cognitive Robotics","",""

The research question answers: How can an Innovation Partnership stimulate innovation in the construction industry by dealing with uncertainties related to product innovation? The relevance of this research lies with the need for innovation in the construction industry to meet future sustainability and circularity goals and to renovate and replace existing infrastructure. However, due to the novelty of innovation, more uncertainty is introduced in a project where innovation is included. To stimulate innovation through an Innovation Partnership, the contractor and the contracting authority should manage the uncertainties related to product innovations following the level of uncertainties of the product innovation in the specific project stages. The level of uncertainty surrounding a product innovation reduces after the R&amp;D phase of the Innovation Partnership. Therefore the contractor and the contracting authority should distinguish a difference between the R&amp;D phase and the execution phase of an Innovation Partnership. It is recommended that when the contracting authority procures a project through an innovation partnership (1) they minimize the number of specifications and state the specification functionally to utilize the innovativeness of the market. (2) Stakeholders should be engaged in the project early on to overcome the resistance of stakeholders that are not ready for innovation. (3) The risks during the R&amp;D phase should be managed by a design alliance. (4) The execution phase can be governed by an UAV-GC for the general project.

Global screening techniques are needed for a more widespread use of NBS in these flood prone coastal regions. This research expands on the current assessments done by developing a quantitative global screening method that evaluates the costs and benefits for two defence approaches; 1) increasing the dike height, 2) a hybrid solution that includes increasing of the dike height in combination with restoring mangroves and/or corals. The screening method is based on Van Oord’s Climate Risk Overview tool, in which, globally, coastal hotspots are indicated that have a predefined risk of flooding in the 21st century. The steps added by my screening method include; 1) determining which<br/>NBS can be applied depending on the local physical conditions, 2) determining the costs for both NBS and conventional hard solutions, 3) determining the increase/decrease in flood risk of the different interventions for current and future conditions, 4) monetizing additional benefits that NBS provide, 5) assessing the benefits and costs to determine if NBS are the most optimal solution. The results of this global method are inherently limited by several simplifying assumptions and by the lack of high resolution local data, which influences the cost/risk estimates and corresponding site identification. For 2.6-3.3% of the coastal hotspots, NBS can reduce the investment costs in addition to being cost-beneficial. There is potential for expanding this work by adding sea grasses, salt marshes and oyster reefs as vegetated foreshore systems, and by including more thresholds to make the criterion for potential sites to apply NBS more strict.<br","nature based solutions; global screening method; global flood risk; global dike costs; mangroves; corals","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering | Coastal Engineering","",""

Soundscapes in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) might adversely affect neonates, their families, and healthcare providers. In this unit, the number of alarms and nuisance is very high, and studies show that it negatively affects both the well-being of patients and the performance of healthcare professionals (Bliefnick, Ryherd, Jackson, &amp; 2019). Additionally, elevated sound levels in the NICU may contribute to undesirable physiologic and behavioral effects in infants. Hearing impairment, heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, and sleep were all deteriously affected (Zimmerman &amp; Lahav, 2013).Sound studies within NICUs have only focused on short-term outcomes such as monitoring sound levels in decibels (dB) and reporting the results, with no further implication. Current market solutions give only feedback on high dB levels, limiting medical professionals’ complete understanding of the cacophonous environment. Additionally, they rely on counting sound in dB, discarding the effect of tone and frequency. Therefore, the problem with the dB measure is that it represents only one part of the complex sound taxonomy. Still, interpreting sound beyond dB is challenging to understand for people who are unfamiliar with the physics of sound.SOUNDscapes is a digital platform that maps and localizes sound events occurring at the NICU. It displays sound trends in real time and assesses the quality of the environment by having two main visualization pages: sound level trends and constellation map.The goal of providing real-time feedback is to make nurses aware of specific (sound) behaviours and their consequences. Additionally, they can assess and observe their collective impact on the unit. This dashboard motivates them to change their attitudes towards harmful sound events by ultimately triggering a behaviour change. The dashboard is a tool that will help nurses understand, assess and change their sound behaviour and patterns of harmful sound sources, ultimately having valuable feedback for reducing high sound levels at the unit.First, the proposed solution provides the first step for permanent sound monitoring, mapping, and visualising real-time sound-producing events. Additionally, supporting nurses and giving them the confidence to act upon harmful sound sources occurring at the NICU. Secondly, the suggested design, apart from advocating for a nurse’s sound quality, is also a tool that can go beyond their caring role. For the Neonatology department at ErasmusMC, this platform means a new source of data streams that healthcare developers can use for measuring and evaluating the care quality they are delivering. The new system provided opens new research possibilities in the future that will allow researchers to link the quality of the physical sound environment to physiological and psychological effects on listeners.","design for healthcare; future of healthcare; Neonatology; Neonatal intensive care unit; UX Design; Critical Alarms Lab; Soundscape","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design | Medisign","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Ride-pooling is a key concept for the future of human mobility and vital in the roll-out of Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS). Pooling allows individuals to travel at a reduced fare (when comparing to a private alternative) due to the reduction in operating costs as the usage of the vehicles is increased; essentially, the main intentions of pooling are to alleviate traffic congestion, reduce required operator fleet size, and to reduce vehicle hours travelled. Ride-pooling does have its drawbacks, travellers increase their in-vehicle travel times due to the detours induced by sharing. A way of minimising the time lost due to detouring is to incorporate pick-up and drop-off (PUDO) points that travellers would walk to and from when opting for ride-pooling. However, the knowledge on the extent of these benefits with respect to the service configurations used is still limited, therefore the objective of this thesis is to examine how pricing configurations and service settings affect the operator performance and level of service of ride-pooling with PUDO. We extend the utility formulation of an existing algorithm that matches trip requests to attractive shared rides where a route search algorithm assesses a PUDO configuration of a ride by computing and comparing the utility of the vehicle and the utilities of the travellers within the vehicle. The algorithm is applied to the context of Amsterdam and aims to further optimise selected pooled rides where experimentation consists of varying the door-to-door pooling discount, the PUDO discount, the service setting, and the demand level. The service setting sets weights on the utilities where we can favour the vehicle during the route search or treating the travellers and vehicle equally. Results show that increasing PUDO discount increases general attractiveness of the service allowing for more travellers to opt for ride-pooling with PUDO, however the largest differences in system-wide performance occurred when PUDO discount was significantly larger than door-to-door discount. Total vehicle hours could be reduced up to 2.2%, improve passenger utility by 2.8% but can suffer a loss of revenue up to 11.4%. The service setting was also able to control these performance indicators as favouring the vehicle provided the largest reductions in vehicle hours and lowest loss in revenue while treating the traveller and vehicle equally was able to provide the largest improvement in traveller utility. The former service setting induces longer walking times on travellers which is the cause of the greater reductions in vehicle travel time while the latter service setting is the opposite and the reason to why travellers find it more attractive. In essence, ride-pooling with PUDO is able to further reduce vehicle hours and improve traveller utility; pricing configurations and service settings can be helpful with scenarios where supply exceeds demand and vice versa. The use of the service setting showed that ride-pooling with PUDO can be made much more attractive to travellers by setting fair PUDO points to walk to by sacrificing vehicle travel time savings. Such a traveller orientated service setting could be useful when supply exceeds demand. A service provider such as Uber could utilise the insights obtained from this thesis when rolling out such a service in Amsterdam and plan for certain scenarios.","Ride-pooling; Ride-sharing; Pick-up and drop-off points; Ride-hailing; Walking","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Transport and Planning","","52.3676,4.9041"

From composite repairs on existing structures from concrete or structural steel, to composite decks in bridges or even structures made solely out of fibre reinforced composites, the structural industry is following the already existing trend in automotive and aerospace industry where composite solutions present a great potential that traces back to 1960’s. Within this framework the Wrapped Composite Joints project, under Dr. M. Pavlovic, attempts to bring the composites technology to jacket designs of offshore wind turbines and replace the traditional welding technology that is used for connecting the steel tubular members of the jacket frame. Higher stiffness, more sustainable and lightweight design due to reduced steel weight and most importantly higher fatigue resistance are just some of the benefits that the developing technology brings in the structure. Developing a new technology especially when a novel material solution is used, requires robust knowledge of the inherent material as well as bond properties.

Goal of such experimental series is to investigate the capabilities of the material as well as the assembled components up to total failure.<br/>In the current Additional graduation work a coupon testing series comprising of different standard test methods, part of the Wrapped Composite joints project is presented.

Still, the adoption process is slow. One of the crucial steps during the building designing is a justification of design according to previously defined requirements. That process is still manual to a large extent, therefore unnecessarily time-consuming and prone to errors. The need for automation of requirements compliance checking has been rising in recent years, and the science community presented various approaches for automation. Still, most of the proposed methods has similar problems: using a black-box approach, require that the designer is highly skilled in programming, focusing on only geometric requirements and not covering whole process of compliance checking. Therefore, there is a need for a new approach that can solve all these problems. The rise in popularity of parametric design and tools like Grasshopper opens the possibility to overcome some of the current limitations. Also, the possibility of using requirements management software to have the process fully organized supports the belief in automating compliance checking. The fundamental objective of this project is to explore the possibilities of automating the requirements verification for a building design by using requirements management software to systematically structure the requirements and Grasshopper to generate the rules, which afterwards can be verified. To achieve this objective, the project was divided into three main parts. First, the conceptual framework for automated code checking is developed. Afterwards, the system architecture of the prototype tool was explored, and instructions for scripting the tool were given. Finally, after the tool was scripted, it was tested on a real building model. <br/><br/>From the literature review the two main types of requirements are found, the functional and performance requirement. Since the functional requirements are qualitative and cannot be quantified, that category is not suitable for checking with the approach proposed in this project.

Burkina Faso has built a hydropower dam near the border with Ghana which has a large impact on the discharge extremes of the White Volta River. As a result of poor water management of this dam, water is spilled during the wet season, causing more floods in northern Ghana. Several communities, living near the White Volta River, depend on the river water for their drinking water demand and use the sand in the river bed as construction material. This puts them in a vulnerable position when changes in the natural flow regime of the river occur.<br/><br/>This thesis studies the impact of constructing multiple small dams in the White Volta river in order to decrease the flood risk in villages located close to the river and create an opportunity for controlled sand mining as a result of sedimentation.<br/><br/>Tamale is, with 672.000 inhabitants, the largest city in this area and struggles with the consequences of the floods as well. The drinking water company has trouble meeting the drinking water demand during both the wet and the dry season. When the area is flooded, the water intake point shuts down, and during low water levels, the pumps can get clogged. This clogging occurs even more often as a result of increased illegal sand mining from the river banks by the local communities. This has broadened the river, resulting in lower water levels and a higher turbidity. <br/><br/>A possible solution to ensure the water intake in Tamale and reduce the flood risk in northern Ghana is the construction of multiple small dams in the river bed to flatten the discharge peaks and slow down the water in the White Volta River. At the same time, these dams can create an additional advantage by causing upstream sedimentation that provides a possibility for controlled sand mining in the river bed. To research the effectiveness of this solution, the impact of the dams on flood risk and sedimentation, near seven villages in northern Ghana, was modelled. <br/><br/>A base case of the flood of 2003 was compared to a scenario in which seven dams were implemented at locations close to villages that are often exposed to floods. This was done by building a hydromorphological model of the White Volta River, using the D-HYDRO 1D2D software. <br/>The results of the morphological simulation show that in total, the sedimentation upstream of the dams can fill 81 trucks with sand per day. However, extracting the sediment at the most upstream dams decreases the possibilities for sedimentation near the downstream dams. The results of the 1D2D hydraulic model show that the proposed dams are not able to reduce the flood extent in villages and can even increase inundation depths, resulting in more flood damage. <br/><br/>It is recommended to increase the 2D grid of the hydraulic model in order to receive more realistic backwater curves.","Flood Risk; Hydraulic Modeling; Dam; Sand mining; D-Hydro; Ghana; Water storage; Retention; Volta","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Water Management","","9.661615, -1.054057"

In collaboration with local experts Boyan Savov and Traian Marin, a team of 8 students guided by Mark Voorendt was sent to investigate the local conditions at Asparuhovo beach in Varna, Bulgaria, for purely educational purposes. Before 2019, Asparuhovo beach used to have a stable coastline with some seasonal variations. However in 2019, the Karantinata port was constructed and disturbed the equilibrium state of the beach. Rapid sedimentation occurred near the port and the port entrance. Due to this excessive sedimentation near the port entrance, the fishing port has lost almost all of its intended functionality, as minimum water depths in the port entrance approach 0.3m. The port was originally designed for larger fishing boats, which are currently not able to enter and making the port lose functionality. It is yet unknown how this sedimentation trend is formed with the construction of the fishing port. The main objective of the research was to examine the current sedimentation near Karantinata port by executing a measuring campaign during the Hydraulic Fieldwork and by setting up a 5 year monitoring program for the marine environment. By doing so, the processes which lead to sedimentation can be understood and a model can be made. With this model, adjustments to the port layout can be examined which are potentially needed for the port to operate at full functionality. To tackle these problems, the students performed the fieldwork. With 2 days of beach and foreshore measurements the research question was assessed. With the acquired data of the system, supported by additional lab sieving analysis, data processing and modelling in Delft, the students formed theories on the origin of the sedimentation problem. With these insights, recommendations for the area can be suggested. The measurements are performed on multiple locations and at each location multiple variables were researched. For Asparuhovo beach and foreshore these are the bathymetry, waterline position, wave climate, beach profile, sediment characteristics and ecology. At the fishing port Karantinata these are the port characteristics such as functions, planning and infrastructure, port entrance, bathymetry and breakwater design. At the Asparuhovo breakwater it is the top protection layer, damage assessment and measures of improvement. At Veteran beach this is the soil samples for grain size distribution. At Martsiana quarry the length to thickness ratio, blockiness were researched, as well as the diameter to check if potentially suitable for breakwater material. With this information, a preliminary model in Delft3D has been set up with the land boundaries, grid and bathymetry file. With knowledge of the coastal processes and the processed data, potential causes of sedimentation are speculated on. It is unlikely that such large amounts of sediment are coming from outside of Asparuhovo beach system, as there are no sediment rich rivers nearby, the sedimentation occurred in a very short period of two years and the sediment would mostly not be able to cross the deep navigation channel as it would settle due to lower flow velocities. It is expected that large parts of the settled sediment near the port entrance is from the beach itself. This is also more likely due to the two closed boundaries of the beach, the Asparuhovo breakwater and the Karantinata port. This was checked by analyzing the grain size diameter compared to other locations at the beach and looking at the waterline developments. It was found that the grain size at the middle of the beach was 1.8 mm and at the port entrance between 0.2 and 0.3 mm. It was suspected that the fine sediments of the middle of the beach are eroded and deposited at the port entrance as the sediment can settle at the Southeastern part behind the port breakwater due to sheltered conditions. The mechanisms that could have induced this are: rip currents, longshore currents and the different wave patterns. To examine and validate these findings, a monitoring plan for the coming 5 years is proposed. This is very important to create an understanding of the systems parameters and behaviour. Without monitoring, adjustments to the port cannot be tested in a correctly calibrated model. The parameters which need continuous measurement are the wave parameters, sea level measurements and visual beach observations. Biannual measurements are needed for currents, hydrographic works, visual observations with a drone, bathymetry and sediment parameters. Before the port is fully operational again, the port entrance needs dredging. This can be done in this time span of 5 years to ensure the passage of fishing boats. After dredging a short survey of the area needs to be performed to incorporate the changes into the model. These are the bathymetric survey, visual observations and sediment samples all around the dredging area. There are three potential solutions incorporated in the report, which can be modelled with the findings of the monitoring plan. The first potential solution to make the port fully operational again is relocating the port entrance with a curved breakwater stretching into the sea. The second solution is a combination of the entrance relocation and water flow through the port. The third is a blocking groyne stretching from Asparuhovo beach into the sea, blocking the sedimentation going into the port entrance. For all these potential solutions, dredging works are needed to reensure the required water depth for the vessel draught. The least costly and most promising is the relocation of the port entrance design. It can be noted that continuous dredging is not a sustainable solution as the sedimentation keeps occurring near the port entrance as the hydrodynamic conditions will not change. It is recommended to first find the source of the settled sediment by comparing control volumes of sediment on the beach over the years. Then a model should be set up of the Asparuhovo beach and foreshore and Karantinata port to give insights in the processes. This model needs to be validated and calibrated with input from a monitoring campaign.

However, rocker also has a negative impact on ice friction. As there is currently no scientific theory for selecting optimal rocker profiles, skaters have to rely on personal experience. There is a lack of experimental data available in literature to validate current hypotheses for ice friction. A setup was designed to measure ice friction of an upright skate with varying rocker profiles and normal loads. The experiment was conducted on the artificial ice rink at Thialf, Heerenveen. A sled fitted with two parallel blades was towed at a constant speed of approximately 1.5 ms-1. A force transducer was used to measure friction forces on the sled. Short-track and long-track blades with representative rocker radii were tested. A strong correlation was found between rocker radius and ice friction. Friction forces were found to be on average greater by a factor of 1.868(±0.050) for blades with rocker radius of 10 m compared to 21 m. The results further show high repeatability between tests. This study demonstrates the impact of rocker on ice friction in speed skating. Further research is needed to establish a valid theory for optimal rocker selection. This test method can be used in the future to include different variables, such as ice temperature, sliding speed or blade inclination angle. The method is not limited to short-track speed skating, but can be applied to other disciplines.","Ice Friction; Speed Skating; Rocker; Short Track","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | BioMechanical Design","",""

These cells represent promising cellular targets for therapeutic intervention, therefore a detailed cellular biological knowledge of microglia is of paramount importance. Current microglia in vitro cell culture models are limited in their ability to recapitulate in vivo microglia in terms of gene expression and cell morphology. There is growing evidence that mimicking the cellular environment of microglia in the central nervous system will contribute to a more physiologically accurate culture model. Three-dimensional geometries, and physical and biochemical cues similar to the brain’s extracellular matrix, are necessary to create a 3D biomimetic in vitro environment, as microglia cells can sense these environmental cues through mechanosensing. In this thesis, the effect of two-photon polymerized 2.5D and 3D microstructures on microglia morphology and phenotype was studied through quantitative and qualitative cell analysis. Also, an attempt was made to create in vitro ramified microglia that resemble in vivo microglia from a morphological point of view, by con-trolling the effective shear modulus through dimensional optimization of compliant micro-and nanopillars. It was found that culturing microglia especially on nanopillars enabled an increase of the ramified pheno-type and a more complex (i.e. more ramifications) cell morphology as compared to microglia cultured onflat fused silica substrates.

The experience should be made accessible to children from disadvantaged neighbourhoods. <br/><br/>The project consists of 2 phases, a research phase and design phase. <br/><br/>Research phase<br/><br/>During the research phase, two user research has been done. The first a context mapping session is done to understand how preteenagers perceive sustainability. It was discovered that their focus is mostly on nature, and they know the basic principles if a behaviour is good or bad for the environment. Often when asked for reasoning it is missing or wrong. The second were expert interviews, with the goal to learn more about how to design for children in the museum setting. Museum educators at Museon were interviewed. Information transfer is important when designing for children, they should enjoy the experience and therefor the experience should be designed to fit their identity needs. A design framework consisting of design principles, personas, design goal, interaction vision, and creative vision has been made using the information of the user research. <br/><br/>Literature research has been conducted to understand how to educate children about sustainability. According to Janssen et al. (2019) an approach to educate children about wicked problems is providing them with the perspectives of different stakeholders which should improve their systematic thinking and is necessary to solve complex issues. Literature research also has been done to better understand how to design for museum experiences. According to Bär and Boshouwers (2018) it is essential to design a story which the visitors can go through. The 9 experience journey steps have been adopted as blueprints for the final design to create a good story.<br/><br/>Design phase<br/><br/>The second phase is the design phase, creative sessions has been done to design a theme, exhibits, camper layout, and thematic objects. The final concept is a campervan experience in which the visitors make a journey along the Rijn. The camper is relevant to preteenagers as it reminds them of holiday and adventure. The experience consists of introductions using iconic objects of traveling to immerse the visitor, exhibits designed to fit the identity needs of the different personas to make the experience enjoyable, and an educational message with the educational approach of Janssen et al. (2019) where the children make sustainable choices after every exhibit and revealing how this affected their environment in the end of the experience.<br/><br/>The design phase ends with an evaluation done with preteenagers visiting Museon. A paper prototype has been used to walk the visitors through the exhibition and using the PrEmo tool (2007) as a discussion tool to understand how they feel about the exhibits. The exhibits were rated positive, and the educational message was seen as insightful for the children.

Current solutions tackle the issue by either requiring silicon manufacturing for every prototype, which is expensive, or simulating faults using a model of the device under test and of the possible faults being injected, which takes a considerable amount of time. Some hybrid solutions have been developed to improve this aspect (namely, by using FPGAs to implement the device and injecting faults on it instead), but they still require some form of specialized hardware to operate.<br/>Moreover, a gap still remains between the results from these tools and the work necessary to update the design and mitigate the vulnerabiliies found.

In terms of fault identification, the framework described can reduce the number of faults to be simulated down to 2% of the number necessary to exhaustively check a design for possible vulnerabilities, greatly speeding up existing simulation-based approaches.","Fault Injection; Formal Verification; Hardware Attacks","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Compliant mechanisms have found their way in more and more applications in recent years, particularly in the aerospace and microsystems sectors. The benefits of compliant mechanisms stretch far, and can be exploited for large scale applications as well. Little research has been performed on the use of compliant mechanisms in large scale structures, where large deflections are in play. This while the interest in foldable structures is increasing, take for example the foldable container concept and origami inspired structures. The required hinges can be made compliant, such a hinge is called a flexure. The aim of this research is to give insight in the design of flexures for large scale applications and large deflections, to aid researchers when designing large foldable structures. The research question that is answered in this report is: how can flexure design be optimized for foldable structures? To answer the research question a PseudoRigid Body Model (PRBM) is made in Python, along with a multiobjective optimization. Compliant mechanisms can offer increased performance, however, the design of compliant mechanisms is more complicated than rigid body mechanisms. Therefore, an intuitive method for designing compliant mechanisms is required. The FiniteElement Method is considered for this purpose, but is too complex and not suited for initial design stages. Therefore, a PRBM is selected for the design analysis, as it is less complex and well suited for large deflection members and ideal for initial design stages. A PRBM with two revolute joints is used, because it provides a higher accuracy than a model with one revolute joint and it simplifies the iterative process of a model with three revolute joints, while maintaining a similar level of accuracy. The load case that is evaluated in this research is a moment end load. A sensitivity analysis is performed for the flexure behaviour regarding the flexure’s Young’s modulus, length, width, thickness and end moment load. This analysis shows that the flexure length and moment load, linearly influence the flexure deflection, i.e. twice the length, gives twice the deflection. Furthermore, the flexure deflection is reverse linearly dependant on the Young’s modulus and width, i.e. twice the width, gives a twice as small deflection. The flexure is most sensitive to a change in thickness. For a thickness increase of factor &#x1d45b;, the deflection decreases by a factor &#x1d45b;3. Furthermore, the design of the flexure is evaluated for three material types, being aluminium, rubber and a Nickel–Titanium Shape Memory Alloy (SMA). The material changes the behaviour of the flexure because of the material’s Young’s modulus and yield strength, which prescribes the allowed load. Therefore, it is shown that the measure of flexibility, &#x1d439; = &#x1d70e;&#x1d466; &#x1d438; , is a good indicator for suitable flexure materials. When taking the results from the sensitivity analysis and implementing the importance of the flexure material’s yield strength, a design constant can be deduced for viable and intuitive flexure design. This constant considers all the variables influencing the flexure design and assumes maximum allowable load on the flexure. With this constant researchers can quickly identify feasible flexure designs and the result of parameter changes are made more intuitive. The multiobjective optimization for the flexure design is performed with Nondominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II. The optimization can find the Paretooptimal solutions for the objectives of shape error, stress and volume, while varying the flexure thickness. The evaluated configurations are for a single flexure and for flexures implemented in a large scale compliant mechanism. For the single flexure target shape, a clear Paretofront is found, depicting the required tradeoff between the objective functions. Furthermore, the optimization visualizes the super elastic properties of the SMA and its effect on the deflection when actuated optimally. The results for the use of SMA flexures in a compliant mechanisms are shown as well. It shows that with the right boundary conditions the superelasticity properties of the SMA can be exploited for optimal compliant structure design. From this it can be concluded that this optimization can be used for design of complicated foldable structures, while taking into account the accuracy of the compliant mechanism’s motion. For future research it is proposed to visualize the behaviour of a flexure with a different crosssection than a rectangular beamlike crosssection. Furthermore, more research is required into the practicality of flexures for large scale applications, since the out of plane stiffness can become too low, risking the planar motion of flexures. Other directions that require more research, are the influence of micro slip and unloading effects on the flexure behaviour.   ","Flexures; Pseudo-Rigid Body Model; Design Optimization; Multi Objective Optimisation; Foldable Structures","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Marine Technology | Transport Engineering and Logistics","",""

Radiotherapy is considered to be one of the fundamentals of glioblastoma therapy and is given after maximum safe tumour resection or biopsy. Delineation of the gross tumour volume (GTV) and the clinical target volume (CTV) required for radiotherapy planning is performed on a combination of computed tomography and conventional, <br/>structural magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, which only visualize macroscopic features of the tumour. Due to the infiltrative nature of glioblastomas, the conventional CTV is typically defined as the GTV with an expansion of 1.5 cm. In this project, the aim was to introduce advanced MR imaging in order to visualize microscopic tumour infiltration and construct a personalized approach for CTV delineation to integrate the information provided by the advanced MR imaging. With this biological CTV, the 1.5 cm margin could be omitted and potentially lead to reduced radiation toxicity or improved local tumour control. The advanced MR biomarkers APT, VSI and rCBV correlate to cell proliferation, vasodilatation and microvascular density, respectively. Brain maps of these biomarkers from four treated glioblastoma patients were introduced in MIM Maestro®, the software package used at the Department of Radiotherapy of the Erasmus MC Cancer Institute for target delineation. In addition, imaging used for radiotherapy, the corresponding delineations, i.e. GTV, CTV and organs at risk, and follow-up imaging that showed first progression according to the response assessment in neuro-oncology criteria were uploaded to MIM Maestro®. To generate a biological CTV, a semi-automatic workflow was created that incorporates a region growing algorithm to delineate high-risk regions on the biomarker maps. Comparison of <br/>biological CTVs with the conventional CTVs showed a major reduction (ranging from 56.7% to 87.6%) in target size. Pattern of failure analysis revealed adequate coverage of the recurrence volume by the biological CTV. In three of the four patients, the biological CTV covered more than 95% of the recurrence volume. In the other patient, the coverage by the biological CTV was poor. This was partially due to the large spread of the recurrence volume. In this master’s thesis, a semi-automatic workflow is presented to take an initial step towards personalized radiotherapy for patients with glioblastoma. The introduction of advanced MR<br/>techniques was shown highly promising; future research should focus on <br/>optimization of the biological CTV generation and validation of the biomarkers in a larger cohort.","Glioblastoma; Radiotherapy; Biomarker; MRI","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Technical Medicine","",""

Anaerobically, PAOs take up volatile fatty acids (VFA) and store them as poly-ẞ-hydroxyalkanoates (PHA). The energy (mainly ATP) necessary for the transport and storage of VFA (and general maintenance) is obtained through the cleavage of polyphosphate. While the reducing equivalents (e.g. NADH) for VFA storage are obtained through the cleavage of glycogen and/or from the anaerobic operation of the TCA cycle. Aerobically, PAOs replenish their reserves of polyphosphate and glycogen, resulting in P uptake, whilst degrading PHA to obtain a carbon and energy supply for growth.<br/>PAOs have the metabolic flexibility to adapt the synthesis of each polymer according to the resources available in the environment, and thus affecting the growth of the organism. Hence, within a PAOs metabolism, there is a trade-off between the use of glycogen and polyphosphate. This trade-off is dependent on the cell's requirements to obtain ATP and NADH for PHA storage. In turn, ATP and NADH amounts can be obtained in different ratios depending on the active metabolic routes. This thesis aims to determine what is the mechanism controlling this trade-off and if there are limits to this relationship.<br/>To investigate this trade-off, a metabolic model for PAOs was created and simulated through a conditional flux balance analysis (cFBA) approach. The resulting amounts of the metabolites simulated with this approach were comparable to those obtained experimentally (figure 6). Additionally, this model was simulated to different sets of starting amounts of glycogen and polyphosphate at a constant acetate feed of 3.84 mCmol/gdw, and the resulting growth was compared between each simulation. This led to an optimal range of initial polyphosphate amounts [2.1-23.5 mPmol/gdw] and initial glycogen amounts [0.3-1 mCmol/gdw]. In reality, these glycogen amounts were never observed experimentally and to the extent of our knowledge never have been reported in PAOs literature. This suggests a glycogen minimal limit amount (e.g. 1 mCmol/gdw), that might reveal a robustness mechanism employed by PAOs to guarantee survivability in uncertain environments. In parallel, a thermodynamic analysis was performed on the malate dehydrogenase reaction, which led to the conclusion that this reaction is not feasible in an anaerobic environment, potentially highlighting a control mechanism.","Phosphate accumulating organisms (PAOs); metabolic modelling; conditional flux balance analysis (cFBA); Polyphosphate","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Life Science and Technology (LST)","",""

Quantum annealers solve binary quadratic models, which are a specific type of NP-Hard problem. The hybrid solver uses quantum annealers together with classical computers to solve optimisation problems. Two binary quadratic models were developed for the purpose of residual statics estimation, one based on the one-hot encoding and the other on standard binary encoding. These two models were theoretically analysed and subsequently implemented and tested. Tests with synthetic data were done using the quantum annealer. The solutions found with quantum annealing were often only a few bit-flips away from the global optimum. Therefore, the results were further improved by post-processing of the data with the steepest descent method. It was found that the one-hot encoding with steepest descent performed superior to the other methods.

Widening the policy approach to better represent the ecological side of the nitrogen crisis provides alternative ecological solution avenues to resolve the crisis. To this end, a System Dynamics model is constructed that encompasses the nutrient cycles of N and P, as well as a level of ecological complexity. To investigate the model’s behaviour under circumstances of deep uncertainty an Exploratory Modelling and Analysis (EMA) approach is used. The results indicate a large potential for cost reduction and increase of ecological performance by aiming policy at ecological compensation instead of emission reduction.

In order to achieve this goal, Rijkswaterstaat is planning to renew as sustainable and cost-effective as possible. Most of the navigation lock gates that have been renewed in the last decades are made in steel, especially mitre gates. However, timber is a more sustainable material than steel to replace the navigation lock gates. The goal of this thesis is to find out why timber is scarcely used for the renewal of mitre gates with a navigation lock chamber wider than 12 metres and to extend the application of timber in an innovative way for the renewal of existing mitre gates to replace steel mitre gates.<br/><br/>First, the structural layout of the mitre gates was analysed. Further research has shown that the steel design of mitre gates is more profitable than the current timber design for lock chambers above 12 metres width, because all the existing timber mitre gates are made by solid timber beams, which have limited availability due to the required dimensions. Further, the mortise and tenon joint of the main girders and posts is one of the challenges and critical parts of timber structures. Recent innovations, such as timber lamination, crossed or not, increases the strength and stiffness characteristics and creates more freedom in the design of the cross section size and shape, which makes timber a construction material that could be more competitive with other often used construction materials, steel for example. Since the mitre gates need to withstand the loads in both vertical and horizontal directions, cross laminated timber can be efficient. In building engineering, laminated timber is usually glued, however, for hydraulic engineering, this is not possible yet as no adhesive is appropriate in a wet environment. It is therefore chosen to further investigate the possibility of applying mechanically jointed cross laminated timber in a mitre gate.<br/><br/>The eastern navigation lock of Sambeek is considered as a suitable case study location to investigate. This lock chamber has a width of 16 metres, a water retaining height of 8.44 metres and a maximum differential head of 4.2 metres. The results of the preliminary design for this mitre gate consists of a dowel cross laminated skin plate, semi-ellipse web plates and three layered laminated curved girders. The skin plate in the renewed design contains layers in vertical and horizontal directions to transfer the load in both directions. Furthermore, the skin plate contains diagonally orientated layers to replace the steel strut and tension bar. The girder of the mitre gate is curved to create the biggest stiffness halfway the width of the mitre gate and spare the used amount of timber sideways. The web of the redesign is the connector of the skin plate and the girder. The challenge of the mortise and tenon joint is solved by directly supporting the girder towards the lock chamber wall. This results in a skin plate of 6 layers; all with a thickness of 25 mm. The skin plate has 2 horizontally orientated, 2 vertically orientated and 2 diagonally orientated layers. The curved laminated girder has 3 lamellae each 100 millimetres thick and the distance to the skin plate and girder varies between 0 and 300 mm. In between the girder and skin plate, a web plate of 150 millimetres thick is constructed. The girder and web plate are repetitive elements with a centre to centre distance of 1.5 metres vertically.<br/><br/>To verify the preliminary redesign, the mitre gate is modelled in a finite element program. In this finite element program, the mitre gate is built up of beam elements, and the interaction of the timber elements and fasteners is simulated with springs. For the closed mitre gate, the global outcomes of the model and preliminary design are consistent, but the interaction between the fasteners and timber elements in the dowel cross laminated skin plate requires further research. Furthermore, it can be concluded that the use of cross laminated timber is an equivalent replacement of the steel strut and tension bar to resist the self-weight of the mitre gate. <br/><br/>Based on the performed research in this thesis, the renewed design of timber mitre gates is at an early stage but attainable for the future. The mitre gate with cross laminated timber skin plate works as efficient as the steel gate and is more sustainable. However, the challenge remains in the connection of the timber elements and further research is needed to make the design feasible. The development in the material and connection method would make timber mitre gates more attractive during the choice of design.<br","Timber; Mitre Gates","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering | Hydraulic Structures","",""

Solar photovoltaic (PV) is one of the renewable energy technology types that could play an important role in this transition, given the high resource potential compared to other countries and the global declining costs. The Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resource (MoEMR) has recognized the potential of solar energy and has expressed the intention to increase the share in the electricity mix (which currently is less than 1%) by focusing primarily on rooftop solar PV systems. However, utility-scale solar PV power plants could also play an important role, given the economies of scale advantages relative to rooftop systems. Unfortunately, a financial roadblock can be identified for the further development of utility-scale solar PV: the maximum allowed electricity prices that state electricity company Perusahaan Listrik Negara (PLN) pays for electricity produced by a solar power plant, are often lower than the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE). This creates an financially unattractive situation. This situation calls for insight into the economic potential of utility-scale solar PV and how this can be increased. However, no studies could be found that (1) look at how policies interventions can help to overcome the financial barrier and increase the economic potential and (2) assess the economic potential quantitatively not just in terms of LCOE but also in terms of the potential capacity and electricity generation given the maximum electricity price regulations that are in place.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","",""

The adhesion mechanism of the tree frog is not fully understood, it is a wet adhesion mechanism which works differently than the dry adhesion mechanisms of animals, such as the gecko, studied previously. The wet adhesion mechanism of the tree frog may be based on the capillary force present in liquids. Researching the adhesion mechanisms of the tree frog could help develop new capillary based<br/>adhesives.

The selected concept functions with the use of a pressure sensor connected to the capillary pressure source with capillary channels. This concept allows for a precision of 12Pa determined by the pressure sensor and a responsiveness of 30 ms determined by fluidic circuit while allowing the frog to roam free around the system input. The components were tested to verify their functionality. A controlled pressure source is used to verify the calibration of the sensor, the time constant and hydraulic capacitance; which are<br/>the parameters that determine the accuracy and responsiveness of the system. The sensor was successfully calibrated to measure pressure linearly up to 10 kPa but the time constant and hydraulic capacitance were experimentally measured to be three orders of magnitude larger than the estimated parameters of the components. In order to solve the disparity between the experimental and theoretical values, different tubing and connections were suggested to reduce the hydraulic capacitance and a method verifying the presence of air bubbles was advised. A Sesille drop experiment was performed on the pressure sensor in order to support the principle of measurement, the results suggests the principle of measurement is valid but the issues surrounding the fluidic circuit needs to be resolved in order to complete the system.","capillary force; capillary pressure; wet adhesion; system design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-11-05","","","","Mechanical Engineering | BioMechanical Design","",""

The elevation models have therefore a flat surface, which prohibits the extraction of the water level and volume variability. <br/><br/>The goal of this thesis was to develop a tool, that uses the elevations where no flatting had occurred, and create a linear representation of the shape of the lake or reservoir. The following research question was formulated: <br/><br/>What is the potential of applying elevation models to monitor the volume levels of lakes and reservoirs, when replacing the flat elevations with extrapolated depths?<br/><br/>The case study comprised of two parts. First, the validation of the water level extraction was conducted for pre-selected lakes and reservoirs. The results showed an average RMSE of 4.10 [m]. When analysing the distribution of lakes and reservoirs data, the RMSE was centred at 1.27 [m] (NED and ALOS) and 3.70 [m] (SRTM). The comparison between the three considered elevation models, showed a minor improvement regarding the relative water level. At the same time, it demonstrated that the number of waterbodies that can be monitored increases when applying the developed tool. <br/><br/>The second part of the case study aimed at providing an insight in the potential of applying the DEM for estimating the volume variability. An analysis of the USGS in-situ data compared to the results, showed that the overall RMSE decreased for each considered model.

The developed tool demonstrated that elevations can be extrapolated, which would fit a more realistic shape of the reservoir at areas where the bathymetry was flattened or not found. <br/><br/>Accurate information for extracting the water level and assessing the volume variability of lakes and reservoirs currently depends on extensive hydrographic surveys.

Another phantom study was done to evaluate the (geometrical) accuracy of DWI-SPLICE, a technique that can be used for ADC mapping. This DWI technique is known to have less susceptibility issues than conventional EPI-DWI. We tested both the accuracy and deforming artifacts for an EPI sequence and a clinically used DWI-SPLICE protocol from LUMC. Adequate accuracy and robustness were observed for the standard Philips mDIXON Quant protocol. The LUMC muscle protocol, however, yielded incorrect measurements that were underestimations of the real FF values. The DWI-SPLICE protocol showed better geometrical accuracy than the EPI protocol. Accuracy of the ADC measurements was sufficient for ADC values higher than 0.6 x 10−3 mm2/s which is a clinically relevant range.

Stratification due to the interaction of saline water from the North Sea and fresh water from the Baltic Sea forces bi-directional flow of the layer above and below the density gradient, causing bi-directional spread of the dredging plume perpendicular to the trench as well. During such an event, monitoring on both sides of the trench is required. By mapping out the spatial and temporal behaviour of stratification, a prediction can be given on where and when measuring on both sides of the trench will be needed to include the baroclinic effect. Figures created with monitoring data show that the density profile is influenced by the salinity, rather than the temperature. Therefore, stratification predominantly depends on the in and outflow of water with respect to the Baltic Sea. The figures also show a larger density gradient during out than inflow. It can also be observed that where the water depth is restricted to 10 meters, wind and bottom friction mix the entire water column. Therefore, stratification occurs predominantly during outflow in sections deeper than 10 meters, indicating the need for monitoring the bi-directional plume spread during such circumstances. Whether stratification occurs during inflow in sections deeper than 10 meters likely depends on the duration and strength<br/>of the wind forcing and the initial strength of the density gradient prior to the inflow event. Further analysis should be done to confirm this. Signs of Ekman transport, return flows and the deflection of the currents towards deeper water can also be observed in the measurement figures. Since these processes affect the plume spread direction, additional research can be done on the behaviour of the current direction in the Fehmarnbelt.","Stratification; Sediment; Dredging; Oceanography; Baltic Sea","en","student report","","","","","","","","2023-11-05","","","","Civil Engineering | Environmental Engineering","Fehmarnbelt fixed link","54.568302, 11.275126"

(graduation committee); van Vuren, S (graduation committee); Jonkman, Sebastiaan N. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","For centuries humanity has been engineering the second largest river system in the Netherlands, the river Meuse system. This resulted in improvements for the shipping and water safety functions, but simultaneously has had a negative impact on other functions of the river Meuse system. Nature and water quality, for example, degraded due to the construction of dikes, weirs, locks, bend cut-offs, summer bed mining and floodplain reduction. Additionally, climate change is affecting the fresh water availability due to low river discharges in combination with little precipitation in dry periods. On top of that, weir leakage and levelling of ships lead to water loss, which amplifies the fresh water availability problems even more. What the future might bring is deeply uncertain, however, the current problems are expected to grow larger due to influence of climate change and socio-economic developments.With the upcoming task to replace the hydraulic structures (weirs and locks) in the Meuse river, a unique opportunity arises to improve the problems that the river Meuse system experiences and prepare it for future developments. Replacement strategies need to be developed and tested on the system. Traditionally separate models will be constructed to simulate shipping, nature, water quality and hydraulics. They tend to be complex and computationally heavy and more often than not, these models make predictions based on a small set of the most probable scenarios. However, in the rapidly changing times of today, these scenarios are often not sufficient enough to account for the highly uncertain future. Therefore, in this thesis, one model is constructed containing the multi-functionality of the river Meuse system which is tested on a broad range of future scenarios to test replacement strategies for the hydraulic structures. <br/><b>Methodology</b>Robust Decision Making (RDM) is used to explore replacement strategies from a multifunctional perspective and evaluate them based on their robustness. RDM is a method which helps making decisions that lead to the construction of a robust system without making predictions and a system is robust if the applied strategy performs satisfactory under a wide variety of future conditions. RDM works with four steps, first the river Meuse system is modelled in the system dynamics software Vensim. This Meuse Model consists of submodels that simulate: the flow of water, the flow of shipping and the performance of the functions water quality, fresh water availability and the shipping load on the locks. All functions are therefore assessed in one model. The second step explores the behaviour of the current system by analysing the performance of the functions under future scenarios (i.e., combinations of future uncertainties). To cope with the deep uncertainty of the future, the probability of occurrence for each scenario is assumed to be uniformly distributed. Thirdly, design options are developed based on the vulnerabilities of the current system and combinations of design options form replacement strategies. In the fourth and last step, the replacement strategies are applied to the system in a policy analysis, after which the design options are evaluated based on their robustness. Exploration of the current systemExploring the current system behaviour over a variability of plausible futures demonstrates that in some scenarios problems arise for the functioning of the system. The performance of the fresh water availability is in general robust. The river Meuse system is designed to maintain a specific water level to provide for shipping. However, especially in weir section Grave, which contains outflow to the river Waal and a relatively large leakage of the weir at Grave, fresh water availability problems occurred during extreme drought events. In approximately 18% of the runs, the fresh water availability was smaller than full capacity. A scenario discovery revealed that several uncertainties have crucial impact on the undesired performance of the fresh water availability. It is found that leakage of the weirs and certain dry discharge years are influential uncertain input variables that cause problems for the fresh water availability.The water quality in the weir sections of the river Meuse reaches for most of the runs risky or undesired behaviour. The weir sections Linne, Grave and Lith are the most vulnerable because the weirs in these weir sections maintain relatively large water depths. This results in low flow velocities and therefore high risk for algal and cyanobacterial blooms and low diffusivity of toxic substances. For the intensity of shipping, two future scenarios are composed under socio-economic developments. The first leads to a slight increase of ship intensity and the second one leads to a slight decrease of ship intensity in the coming decades. Most of the locks seem to be able to cope with this change. Only the lock at Grave might experience issues as it contains the smallest and least amount of lock chambers in the corridor. For approximately 30% of the runs, the intensity to capacity ratio of the lock at Grave took either risky or undesired levels (&gt;0.5). <br/><b>Formulating replacement strategies</b><br/>Based on these findings, a number of design options are formulated with the main goal to improve the robustness of the fresh water availability. Robustness performance of other functions, however, should not deteriorate, and preferably improve by applying the design options. Weir section Grave is used as main focus for improvement as this weir section is most vulnerable for future scenarios, and improvements will therefore have the largest impact. The design options are: •Installation of pumps (all weir sections): limit the outflow of water in dry periods•Heightening crest levels of the weirs at Grave or Lith: increase buffer capacity•Relocating the weir at Grave in upstream direction: increase the average water depth •Dynamic crest level (all weir sections): temporarily increase buffer capacity in drought periods•Efficient locking (all locks): limit the daily outflow of water in dry periods by imposing a minimum amount of ships that need to enter the lock chamber before starting the locking cycle<b><br/></b><b>Analysing the replacement strategies</b><br/>Combinations of design options are made to form replacement strategies, which are now applied to the system. All design options lead to improvement of the fresh water availability for weir section Grave. By introducing efficient locking, however, the intensity/capacity value of the lock at Grave increases compared to the current system for more than 80% of the runs. Raising the crest level of the weir at Grave leads to a decrease of flow velocity, and therefore water quality, for approximately 80% of the runs. Changing this to a dynamic crest level results in a decrease in flow velocity for approximately 25% of the runs, which is significantly less. By relocating the weir at Grave, the robustness of the fresh water availability in weir section Lith is slightly reduced and the ship draught downstream of the weir at Grave is at risk. To increase the water depth and remove the risk of insufficient ship draught, the crest level of the weir at Lith is raised. However, an increase in water depth leads to a decrease in flow velocity and therefore water quality. Installing pumps creates the largest robustness for freshwater availability, does not induce any deterioration for the other functions and is therefore seen as best performing replacement strategy. <b>Conclusion</b>The research implemented a general robust decision making method to analyse complex systems and applied it to the replacement of hydraulic structures in rivers. Thereby it has shown how various design options can be evaluated for multiple functions and under uncertain future scenarios. This approach can be used to select design strategies that perform well under a broad scope of future uncertainties and thus make the system more robust. However, the model and tools used in this thesis also know many limitations.

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","This paper introduces a method for gesture-based teleoperation where the human operator can virtually exist within the remote environment using mixed reality. The proposed method visually mixes the operator’s body with their perception of the remote environment, so that the operator is virtually present at the remote site. The idea is the that operator can interact with a remote task directly using their own body while relying on the motion-mimicking of the telemanipulator, rather than having to control the telemanipulator based on visual feedback to execute the task indirectly. This study aims to find out whether the direct coupling of the situated condition has a positive effect on task performance compared to a control condition where the operator perceives themselves and the remote environment separately. A prototype of a gesture-based master-slave teleoperation system was developed[1] using a two-dimensional camera feed of the remote environment¬¬. A human subject study was carried out where 26 novice participants executed a self-paced reactionary task in two dimensions, where they had to balance completion time with error rate. The task consisted of hitting a randomly spawning target 90 times by reaching out and coming back to the starting position. During the experiment, motion input was recorded along with timestamps of the spawns and the successful hits. The results showed an 8.4% faster completion time, a 16.7 % higher maximum input velocity, and a 44.2% lower error rate for the situated condition versus the separated condition. The participants also filled in a questionnaire, which showed that the majority subjectively preferred using the situated condition. For future research, this study recommends focusing on experimenting with different types of tasks, such as precision tasks and tasks of increased difficulty and complexity, as well as expanding the system to three-dimensional visual perception. <br/><br/>[1] https://github.com/Thomahawkuru/panda_experiment <br","Teleoperation; Gesture control; Mixed Reality; telepresence; task performance","en","master thesis","","","","","","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2bA0NZ4GY0 Performing a set of 30 spawns using the separated condition https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zLhqgICGTE&feature=youtu.be performing a set of 30 spawns using the situated condition","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

The use of optical apertures presents various drawbacks regarding the need for calibration, the difficulty of miniaturization, and CMOS integration. This work presents a lensless CMOS image sensor architecture for light source tracking applications, thereby eliminating the need for an optical aperture for angle sensitivity. The proposed design of angle-sensitive pixels (ASPs) with 1 um, 1.5 um, and 2 um grating pitches are implemented on a 5.6x5.6 um2 photodiode array. The fabricated ASP device with 2 um grating pitch can resolve angles up to 0.37∘ accuracy with post-process characterization.

(mentor); van Erp, J. (graduation committee); Mueller, Nick (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","This project is about inclusion in the museum sector. Concerns around inclusion and equality are rapidly increasing. And, due to these societal dynamics, museums are in times of fundamental change towards inclusivity.<br/><br/>At the start of the project, a theoretic framework depicting the different layers and elements of inclusion was developed. This knowledge helped to gather rich contextual insights in the research phase of the project; exploring inclusivity from the museum sector’s perspective and the visitors’ perspective. As a result, three key challenges and opportunities from the sectors’ perspective, and the key visitors’ needs, were identified. From synthesising these findings, it was found that the key opportunity and challenge for the project lay in addressing the relationship between museums and the public: to help move towards a mutual symbiotic relationship, where both parties are able to benefit from.<br/><br/>Based on this challenge brainstorming, experimentation, and observations were done to iteratively develop a strategic service concept. The final concept that evolved was Habitat. To put it briefly: Habitat is a digital museum platform that gives small pieces of context and sparking questions related to art pieces, to support visitors’ curiosity and line of thinking. And, it allows visitors to leave their own ideas, thoughts, or opinion on augmented sticky notes. Habitat’s ultimate contribution to inclusion is that it, on the one hand, helps visitors to become active participants, and allows them to see what art can do and mean to them, without needing to be an art-expert. And, on the other hand, it helps museums to better understand their visitors, tap better into their (inclusive) needs, and facilitate the space to build a mutually beneficial relationship the public.<br/><br/>In validation tests with museum visitors, the concept’s desirability was investigated. In parallel, expert evaluations were performed. The insights from these activities combined were used to formulate the final recommendations. Here advice is being given on how to answer the following questions, related to the desirability, feasibility and viability: ‘Can it be done?’, ‘Does it bring value?’, and ‘Can it be sufficiently supported?’. The project was primarily centred around the Dutch museum sector. However, input was also gathered from international sources and the project aims to be as inspirational and scalable as possible for cultural experiences and organisations, in and beyond the Dutch cultural landscape. <br/><br/>Finally, what this thesis in particular advocates for, when designing for inclusion, is to focus on finding out what people might have in common and what connects them. In terms of defining peoples’ needs, designers should not focus on separating groups of people to fit simplified personas, instead they should look out to find universal needs shared among all. This will help to recognize common grounds on which inclusion can be built. Besides that, this thesis advocates to adopt a system thinking mindset when designing for inclusion. Doing so will help to understand the interactions between the actors in the system, the environment around them, and to see who gets excluded, why, and how.","Museum experience; Visitor Experience; Inclusive design; Strategic design; Service design; Social design; Fundamental needs; Augmented reality; AR; Inclusion","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

This is done by heating a bilayer material made of paper and polypropylene tape to bend the origami surfaces. The use of more or less of this active material is explored, through measuring the folding displacement of the bilayer CCO metamaterial as a result of heating. Furthermore, the stiffness for folding up the varying origami patterns was measured. Additionally both experiments were modelled in an isogeometric analysis. The work shows that using more of the available surface on CCO for actuation, has a positive effect on the folding displacement. For straight crease origami, this effect is shown to occur when applying the active material in the fold lines. For CCO, the positive effect on the folding displacement is found when applying more active material between the fold lines.","Curved crease origami; origami mechanisms; active curved crease origami metamaterial; actuated origami","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-11-08","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Mechatronic System Design (MSD)","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Research into constructing reduced-order models (ROM) to reduce computational cost or to interpret complex datasets from numerical or experimental sources has steadily been gaining popularity over the past few years. Many methods currently exist to construct ROMs. The proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) is one of the most widely adopted methods used for these purposes in the field of fluid dynamics. The POD modes favor high-energy structures due to the formulation of the POD however. This may result in an inaccurate ROM, as it might be possible that dynamically relevant, yet low-energy structures are truncated in favor of higher-energy structures. In recent years, an alternative goal-oriented method has been proposed. This goal-oriented method not only has less limits on the goal function that is optimally represented relative to thePOD, the resulting reconstruction of the flow field is model constrained as well. Both these properties are conjectured to lead to more dynamically relevant modes. This goal-oriented, reduced-order modeling (GOROM) technique has been formalized for the advection, Burger’s and incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in 1D and the Stokes equations in 2D, all with homogeneous boundary conditions. This work extends the formulation to the 3D incompressible Navier-Stokes equations with inhomogeneous boundary conditions and provides a parallel implementation. The method is applied to a DNS dataset of a 2D transitional boundary layer with and without a forward-facing step present and compared to the performance of the POD. It is found that the GOROM modes provide a basis which is numerically more accurate than the POD modes for most cases, yet do not provide additional insight into the flow physics. The results presented nevertheless show promise for further applications to construct more accurate and goal-oriented ROMs with the GOROM technique, especially for problems with nonlinear interactions and nonlinear goal functions.","Reduced Basis; reduced order model; ROM; goal-oriented; Boundary Layer; transition; Laminar-turbulent transition","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Improvement in the SHM of composite materials requires an enhanced understanding of the damage accumulation processes and helps in the way towards lighter, more optimized, and more sustainable aerospace structures. The Digital Twin concept has the potential to address this problem and may revolutionize the designing, certifying, maintaining, and operating of systems and their components in the long term. This thesis presents a first step to assess its fit in the prediction of damage accumulation within composite materials, specifically the accumulation of transverse matrix cracks within a carbon/epoxy cross-ply specimen under a quasi-static tensile load. To make use of a data-driven technique, a sufficiently large data set is essential. An existing dataset of experiments provides a solid basis but needs augmentation. To augment an existing dataset of tensile tests on cross-plies, a FEM model was constructed that models both transverse matrix cracks and delamination by making use of XFEM-CE. Material variability is implemented per element in the model to overcome the deterministic nature of FEM and generate various crack patterns. The crack patterns and mechanical behavior of the FEM simulations show to be in good agreement with the experimental data. The digital twin that provides real-time predictions is proposed as a LSTM-based neural network. The applied strain to the specimen was predicted with reasonable accuracy. The error of predicting the next crack decreased significantly between predicting the 2nd and 5th crack, after which the mean value of the error and standard deviation remain at similar values. These findings imply that from predicting the 5th crack onward, stochasticity’s role is minimized on the part of predicting the next crack strain. The stochasticity and underlying relationship between the locations of the cracks turned out to be too complex to model with the given approach. Two of the main reasons that are attributed to the latter phenomenon are the modest size of the data set, in spite of further augmentation of the data set after theaddition of the FEM crack patterns, and chosen approach in problem definition.","Digital Twin; composite structure; transverse matrix cracks; LSTM; RNN; damage prediction; XFEM-CE; FEM; deep learning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Yet, there is relatively little known about what factors and how these factors influence the remaining life, and methods that can be used to estimate the remaining life of the barrier are lacking. This thesis aims to identify the dominant factors and associated uncertainties affecting the remaining life and to provide a method for the estimation of the remaining life of the Hollandsche IJssel storm surge barrier. The focus of the study is on the functional and technical life of the barrier.<br/><br/>First, the functions and structural components of the storm surge barrier were identified. For each function, requirements were formulated to support the evaluation of the impact of the external drivers. The physical decomposition of the storm surge barrier was needed to identify the dominant deterioration mechanisms. This analysis revealed that the technical life is not governing for the total remaining life of the barrier. Therefore, the focus should mainly be on the functional life of the storm surge barrier. Next, the impact of external drivers on the functional performance or technical state of the barrier was evaluated by a semi-quantitative analysis in which scenarios with the projected changes were used. The study identified sea level rise as the dominant (physical) driver affecting the remaining life of the storm surge barrier because of the potentially large future changes and far-reaching consequences. <br/><br/>By combining the required performance levels expressed as critical amounts of sea level rise with various sea level rise projections, estimates of the remaining life of the Hollandsche IJssel barrier were obtained. It was found that even for moderate sea level rise scenarios, there is a significant probability that the end of life of the barrier could be reached within 20 years. The estimates of the remaining life of the barrier are, however, uncertain, and a considerably longer lifespan cannot be ruled out. Accordingly, it is recommended to investigate possible measures to lengthen the lifespan and determine the best moment in time to implement these measures. The decision to implement specific measures will be dependent on the costs and benefits. Economic considerations should therefore be included as well. Furthermore, a more system-oriented approach is recommended for this kind of analysis since modifications to a certain object could impact other elements within the system, e.g. dike reinforcements affect the required closure reliability of the storm surge barrier. Finally, a more general recommendation is to perform similar studies for other critical structures as the remaining life of those structures may also be reached sooner than anticipated if, for example, functional aspects are taken into account. <br","Hollandsche IJssel; Storm surge barrier; Lifespan; Remaining life; Sea level rise; Functional life","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering | Hydraulic Structures and Flood Risk","",""

Two tests are done, a full 3D CFD simulation and a combination of a 2D CFD simulation with time-domain solver aNySIM. When comparing the computational time, the 2D CFD simulation proved to be the most practical solution, saving much computational time.<br/><br/>Finally, a methodology has been designed in which a long term wave impact study can be done.<br/>A 2D CFD simulation is performed to simulate the wavefield in the domain. This 2D CFD simulation is used as input for aNySIM, in which the motion of the Tri-Floater is simulated. From this motion, the air gap is calculated, and events are selected that will be simulated in a full 3D CFD simulation. The 3D CFD simulation uses initial and boundary conditions from the 2D wave field. It also uses the motions that are calculated in aNySIM for stability.<br/>In this 3D CFD simulation, the wave impact pressures can be obtained.<br/><br/>The methodology results are hard to judge for value, as there are still some problems that need to be solved.

By researching this, heat-related illnesses or exertional heat strokes can be avoided that are caused by a too high core temperature. <br/><br/>The main benefit of the myTemp system lies in the fact that the indigestible measuring pill does not contain a battery and can therefore be manufactured at a lower price than competitive products. This also means that there is no risk of battery leakage in the body. <br/><br/>This requires that the system uses an antenna belt.

Both challenges result in built structures and hard surfaces claiming the public space and leaving less space for green and other functions, resulting in the imbalance in public space demand. Within public spaces the green has a low ecological value and climate change challenges, such as Urban Heat Island Effect and water infiltrattion problems, are not addressed. Yet, we see a call for a mobility transition that is oriented to dominantly soft and shared modes of transport. <br/><br/>This thesis investigates how the mobility transition can be used to create green structures within movement spaces that cater to the urban ecological demand, using the region of Haaglanden as a case study. The urban ecological demand concerns three themes: ecology, social activities, and climate. Each of these themes are represented in the ecosystem services (such as water infiltration or food provision) that natural green and blue structures provide and from which we, as humans, derive direct and indirect benefits. <br/><br/>A strong regional green structure can be created through urban environments by making use of the existing mobility network. By moving the focus away from transportation by car to slow and shared transport and by creating linear green structures, the street is used to connect larger green patches within and around the urban fabric. To realise a regional green structure the street profiles need to change; more soft surfaces are to be applied by minimising the space reserved for car use. A Green Street Toolbox is developed as an instrument to obtain an integrated design where all urban ecological demands are considered by applying a systematic approach to the various considerations. Linking the tools of the instrument to the services they provide to the public space allows for this systematic approach. <br/><br/>By applying the toolbox in combination with new street profiles to the chosen design locations in The Hague, this thesis shows that an average result of softening almost 50% of the street surface is a reachable goal. All these softened surfaces provide ecosystem services to our urban environment, leaving us with healthier and higher quality public spaces.","Urban green; Mobility transitions; Street profile design; Urban ecology; Regional green networks; Slow mobility; Shared mobility services","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Urbanism","","52.0799838, 4.3113461"

In Amsterdam, tourism is changing the experience of place of its city centre, which negatively affects resident’s quality of life by causing feelings of alienation. As a result, more and more residents seem to retreat or move away from Amsterdam’s city centre, jeopardizing the livability and residential function of the city.<br/><br/>The aim of this research is to add architectural interventions in the city centre of Amsterdam, which will evoke new connections with the places overwhelmed by tourists, by mitigating feelings of alienation between residents and tourists. These connections must both be social, as well as to place, in order to introduce a new, more social, sustainable and liveable way of tourism.<br/><br/>In this research, the embodied experiences of Amsterdam's overwelming places such as the Jordaan, the Canal Belt, the Oudezijdse Burgwallen and the Lastage have been studied by means of narratives. These narratives were created from both the resident’s and the tourist’s perspective, in order to find out which (spacial) qualities of place evoke a sense of identification, belonging or connection among the residents and tourists. Ultimately, from the collection of narratives the users, activity, experience of place, structure and architectural atmosphere of the overwelmed places are defined, and together form a concept for the architectural interventions that will mitigate the feelings of alienation.<br","tourism; Narratives; experience of place; perception; embodied experiences; Alienation; Placemaking; social; Social Connection; connection; architectural interventions; temporary architecture; network; amsterdam; Amsterdam Centrum; Jordaan; livability; biodiversity","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Explorelab","","52.377134, 4.883999"

(graduation committee); Dong, H. (mentor); Markine, V.L. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","This research aims to improve the sustainability of Dutch prestressed concrete railway sleepers. Approximately 100.000 to 200.000 sleepers are used every year, corresponding to 12.000 to 24.000 tonnes of concrete. This will be done by replacing cement with an alkali-activated binder. The cement industry is responsible for approximately 5 to 7% of the global CO2 emission, whereas the alkali-activated binder uses no cement. Instead, by-products will take over the role of cement in concrete, activated by high pH alkalies. This research can be subdivided into four parts: Deciding the requirements, designing for the mechanical properties, determining the durability properties and conducting a Life Cycle Analysis (LCA). The main requirements follow the product specification of the railway infrastructure manager ProRail. Some requirements on manufacturability follow from a market consult. Ground granulated blast furnace slag is used as a precursor due to its availability in the Netherlands, unlike other potential candidates. An iterative mix design procedure is conducted to come to three mixes, meeting the requirements for the fresh concrete and the mechanical properties. The three mixes differ based on the binder content and activator dosage. Nineteen different mixes are designed, of which the final three meet all the mechanical and manufacturability requirements. These three mixes are subjected to tests to determine non-required mechanical properties, such as the tensile strength or the material’s elastic modulus. Finally, the durability of the newly designed alkali-activated slag concrete is assessed. Results show the designed concretemeets the requirements for fresh and hardened concrete. The results of the other mechanical properties are similar or better to the concrete mixes used nowadays to produce sleepers. However, not all requirements on durability are met. Due to the unavailability of certain test conditions, a direct result cannot be given. Therefore, the three durability properties are assessed by comparing the results of this research with results from the literature. The comparison for electrical resistivity shows an excellent behaviour, better compared to similar OPC concretes and on par with CEM III/B concrete types. The alkali-activated binder demonstrates less damage under a freeze-thaw attack with de-icing salts than other alkali-activated concretes but still fails to meet the requirement set by ProRail. The accelerated carbonation test indicates a similar carbonation resistance compared to other alkali-activated concrete types but a lower resistance compared to similar concrete. More research is necessary to investigate these properties further. The environmental impact of the concrete used to produce a sleeper is reduced by 34 to 68%compared to a CEM III/B or OPC binder, respectively. Taking into account the global warming potential only, these numbers increase to 75 to 90% respectively. The total environmental impact of a complete sleeper, including steel and plastic components, is lowered by 12 to 35%. This is explained by the fact that the steel and plastic components contribute 75% to the environmental cost, and improving the cost of these components is beyond this research’s scope. This research shows a significant potential to improve the sustainability of concrete structural elements by replacing the cement binder with an alkali-activated binder. This binder is capable of meeting the mechanical requirements, shows good workability. The compressive strength values are comparable to high strength concrete. Further research has to be conducted in the fields of behaviour under carbonation and freeze-thaw attacks. With these results and conclusions, this research has attributes to realizing more sustainable railway sleepers using an alkali-activated binder.","Alkali-activated concrete; Railway infrastructure","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2026-12-31","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

At the same time, it is projected that the effects of climate change will increase, as climate change is expected to intensify. These two trends cause an increased climate risk for the liveability in these new urban areas. Climate adaptation is essential to reduce this risk. Climate adaptation planning is crucial to ensure the development of sustainable urban areas with high liveability standards for future and far-future inhabitants. However, traditional spatial design and -planning practice does not match with the climate adaptation task. If no climate adaptation action is taken now by spatial actors, the problems could be passed on to future generations. Hence, there is a need for a different way of working. A paradigm shift towards adaptive planning is needed to plan for climate adaptation and adaptive pathways are promising approaches to support this.<br/><br/>The objective of this research is to contribute to the search for new approaches that support climate adaptation planning. This research aims to investigate the usability of the Spatial Adaptive Policy Pathways (SAPP) approach for climate adaptation planning in new urban areas in the Netherlands. This research explores this approach to define the possibilities and points for improvement, through four main stages: analysis, identification, development, and application. To test the approach, Haven-Stad in Amsterdam has been selected as a case study area. The evaluation of the outputs and approach provide input to answer the main research question of this thesis: How can the Spatial Adaptive Policy Pathways approach support climate adaptation planning for new urban areas in the Netherlands?<br/><br/>The research has shown that the Spatial Adaptive Policy Pathways (SAPP) can support climate adaptation planning for new urban areas in the Netherlands. The SAPP approach brings forward a paradigm in which uncertainty is embraced and adaptivity is central. SAPPs do not show which trajectory is best to follow, but can address certain options, decision points, and consequences. In addition, it can bring different actors together through spatial- and governance elaborations. Thereby, SAPPs can form a basis for a broad dialogue about the future of an area in the short-term and long-term. It supports the development of adaptive designs and can address potential future governance challenges. The SAPP approach could thus be a promising approach to apply in practice. However, it would have to be further developed first.<br/><br/>Further development of the approach requires more testing at different case study locations and testing in practice. More research needs to be done on the applicability of the approach at different scales and the potential integration of scales and climate stresses.","Spatial Adaptive Policy Pathways (SAPP) approach; climate adaptation planning; adaptive design and -planning; Haven-Stad; Urbanism and Water Management","en","master thesis","","","","","","Double degree in Civil Engineering and Geosciences - Water Management and Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences - Urbanism","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Urbanism","","52.405643, 4.871789"

While road width can be considered as one of the most important factors of the road environments, there is no clear definition of it. To better understand this, we need to reconsider the width of a road not as a single numerical value but as a complex concept that can be interpreted in different ways. Different road users may refer to different width values for the same road. Thus, while estimating road width seems to come with great benefits for different real-world cases, a fundamental rethinking of the purpose of this entire process is necessary.<br/>Road safety management is an application whose overall process is strongly affected by the width of the road. While there are conflicting theories about the effect that road width can have on road safety, we may need to reconsider a few things before exploring their relation. In this thesis, we introduce a novel approach for estimating road width and linking it with roads in such a way that the overall process of road safety management application could benefit.<br/>Moreover, even road width estimation is not a new topic most of the studies so far use LiDAR point cloud or satellite images as input. In our approach, vector data coming from open-sources are used. Different inputs come with different limitations. The advantages, as well as the drawbacks of the different inputs, will be discussed.<br/>Finally, one of the main objectives of this project is to develop a methodology that will be generally applicable. Vector data that can be found in different datasets would be used. Some additional deliverables will result from our efforts to overcome some of the challenges that have arisen in achieving this goal.

These negative consequences of climate change are found to have an often amplifying effect on already existing inequalities based on asymmetries in power, showing great inequality in the levels of preparedness and ability to deal with climate change effects. <br/>In the city of Rotterdam problems with flooding, draught and biodiversity loss, as well as problems with social inequality, a lack of social cohesion and a high demand for new houses put pressure on existing spatial structures. The neighbourhood of Lombardijen, in particular, is one of the cities post-war extensions based on garden-city principles. A once loved neighbourhood is now suffering from poor housing quality, lack of social integration due to fast changing demographics, large underused green spaces due to a lack of programming, poor ecological value due to monotonous vegetation and problems with water management. With the added demand for densification and the development of new houses, a new strategy needs to be made to bring the neighbourhood towards a holistic future.<br/>Through the application of agroecology principles, possibilities are created for the improvement of environmental and social issues. Agroecology is an approach for the design and management of food and its production, as defined by Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations. It integrates ecological and social concepts, and seeks an optimization between plants, animals, humans and the environment through the diversification of landscapes, efficiency in the use of re-sources and the formation of strong community links that ensure possibilities for collaboration. <br/>By introducing the model of an agroecological farm, the neighbourhood of Lombardijen gets the opportunity to receive direct valuation of its public space and communal infrastructure. Farmers hired by the municipality take on the responsibility to care for the public spaces in collaboration with the inhabitants of the neighbourhood. The integration of food production benefits self-sufficiency, social cohesion and mobility for humans, as well as biodiversity through the ecological principles of agroecology. Also water management (through habitat creation), alternative food production and spatial quality are improved due to programming, activity and feelings of ownership. The design of the neighbourhood and the overall strategy is based on the hierarchical structure of the original design of Lombardijen garden city. The application of agroecology and the elaboration of the aforementioned model shows the possibilities for the improvement of social and environmental issues through public spaces design.<br","Agroecology; Rotterdam; Social Cohesion; Public Space; Urban Ecology; Urban Food Production","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Landscape Architecture","","51.8772,4.5220"

Bridging this gap and achieving a successful transition to a new era. In which theory and practice must work together cohesively creating new methods, models, new points of interest, new forms of professional practice and a new vision. The concept of Open Society is chosen due to the similarities of the situation between today and then (1960s), such as: housing shortage, polarization of discourse and reduction of plurality, increase in social inequality and large global migrations. For this reason, it was decided to study this concept and its projects as the starting point and symbolic break of this long investigation of the modernist project and its attempt to bridge theory and practice. The concept of Open Society appeared in the field of urbanism between the 50-60s, the Welfare State, as an attempt to improve living conditions in the city so that society would prosper. These good intentions did not translate into many success stories and the consequences of these operations continue to cause problems today, as can be seen from the current multiple crises (social, economic, environmental, etc.).<br/>Today there are new approaches to the built environment, which allow or offer us new possibilities to reinterpret the concept of Open Society, something of great importance still in contemporary urban discourse. For this reason, this study proposes to carry out a double investigation on the concept of Open Society (both empirical and conceptual) that will provide knowledge about this concept in two Western European countries. This will help to build a network of knowledge around topics of interest in urban matters. This research aims to investigate and analyze the discursive and projective validity of the concept of Open Society today, the relation between concepts-realities (places), and a critical methodology (open framework) that engages between theory and practice in a continuous dialogue as follows:<br/>-Critically review the concept in the theoretical framework and contemporary global policy frameworks (new urban agenda, theoretical critiques, technical code, etc.).<br/>-Empirically review two case studies that illustrate the implementation of this concept, the phenomena and patterns that have arisen in the friction between the place, the ideals (concept) and the resistance generated by the users.<br/>This research uses a mixed methods approach to examine these two case studies and draw conclusions, and also reflect on the principles and possible unlocking mechanisms. In this way, we generate a discursive break towards a new vision of this concept, which advocates a diverse, inclusive, fair and cohesive ecological societies.","Open Society; Eudaimonia; Theory-Practice framework; Critical method; co-design; 't Hool; Montbau; Atmospheres method","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","European Master in Urbanism (EMU)","","51.474849, 5.472387"

This developed through both valuing the Parish Hall with its monumental façade and further ornaments of the past, and valuing the Molenpoort with its re-usable concrete structure.

Interest in hydrogen as an energy carrier has increased due to the global increase in air pollution, greenhouse gas emissions and increased energy demand. The Netherlands aspires to be a European leader in hydrogen deployment, as hydrogen is widely seen as critical to achieving the 2050 climate targets. Residential heating accounts for roughly 12% of total energy consumption in the Netherlands, with natural gas combustion accounting for 71% of this proportion. However, growing controversy about natural gas usage makes this resource less favourable due to the earthquakes caused by natural gas extraction in the Dutch gas fields. Additionally, the Netherlands has a robust gas infrastructure capable of transporting green hydrogen. Thus, green hydrogen might prove helpful in ensuring both flexibility and continuity in domestic energy demand. <br/><br/>The goal of this study was to explore possibilities and problems associated with the transition of the Dutch built environment to green hydrogen-powered dwellings. The shift from a natural gas-powered environment to a green hydrogen-powered environment is envisioned as a transition. This transition could be possible when there is alignment between the different levels of the society (niche, regime and landscape). The barriers and enablers with regard to the transition to a green hydrogen-powered environment have been discussed and the suggestions to overcome these have also been found. The Multi-Level Perspective was used to map the barriers and the suggestions on the three levels (niche, regime and landscape). This resulted in an approximate set of actions along with the required timeline and the actors who could work to overcome the barriers. The mapping of barriers and enablers according to the Multi Level Perspective shows a big divide between enablers and barriers. This divide has to be filled in for a smooth transition to green hydrogen. The uncertainties surrounding the energy transition in the built environment contributes to its complexity. Stakeholders are hesitant to support hydrogen energy applications in the built environment due to a lack of laws governing hydrogen usage in the built environment and significant gaps in the legislation impeding the transportation and manufacture of sufficient quantities of green hydrogen.","Green hydrogen; Dutch Dwelling; built environment; Multi-Level Perspective; Barriers and Opportunities","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

However, little research has been done on the relationship between flood and drought. Thus, this research aims to investigate whether a relationship exists between multi-year droughts and the floods that follow in the post-drought period. The hypothesis is that vegetation decreases as a result of long-term drought, which decreases evaporation and increases the proportion of precipitation that becomes runoff, and thus, increases flood.<br/><br/>To test this hypothesis, the United States is chosen as a case study area. Hydrological data and remote sensing data are collected for 671 basins in the case study area, from around 1980 till 2014. A list of criteria is established to detect the occurrence of long-term droughts, verify the water balance, and ensure data availability. 83 basins fulfill all criteria and these basins are investigated further.<br/><br/>These 83 basins are plotted inside the Budyko space and Fu's equation is fitted to find the free parameter that indicates the runoff ratio. It is found that in general, no increase in runoff ratio is detected after drought. However, looking at the basins individually, changes in the runoff ratio do exist. Further investigations into the cause of these changes are carried out by looking at the effects of drought on the partitioning of hydrological fluxes and separating the basins' movements into climate effects and residual effects. Vegetation changes are also investigated to see whether the runoff changes are related to vegetation changes. The results show that although strong correlations exist between the runoff ratio, evaporative index, and residual effects, no relationship is found between the runoff ratio and the vegetation-related variables. It is concluded that using the method in this research, no significant relationship is found between the multi-year droughts and floods that occur after drought.","Hydrology; Drought; Flood","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Proactive treatment with the use of a predictive alarm could improve patient outcome. The Hypotension Prediction Index (HPI) is a machinelearning algorithm that uses arterial blood pressure waveforms to calculate the probability of impending hypotension. Prior to clinical implementation, the HPI model needs to be validated. In previously published validation protocols of the HPI, possible sources of bias were identified. Therefore, the primary objectives were to assess HPI performance on the ICU population by using a clinically relevant validation protocol and to evaluate the differences between previous protocols. Secondary objectives included evaluation of subgroup performance and the effect of individual validation protocol settings on the subsequent results. The three applied validation protocols used conceptually different methods to classify predictions (e.g. as a true or false alarm). The primary forward sliding window (FSW) protocol labels each single prediction based on hypotension occurrence thereafter. The forward tumbling window (FTW) groups predictions in nonoverlapping time windows to only classify the window based on hypotension occurrence thereafter. The backward (BW) protocol labels the onsets of hypotension based on alarm occurrence at ’t’ minutes prior to onset, hence ’backward’ in time. Identical metrics were used to quantify performance. For secondary analyses the FSW protocol was used. Performance for the FSW protocol was reduced compared to the FTW and BW protocol. Using the FDAapproved alarm settings for FSW, FTW and BW (t=10min) protocols, sensitivity was 0.59, 1.00 and 0.83, respectively. Positive predictive values were 0.41. 0.83 and 1.00, respectively. For the FSW protocol the median [IQR] timetohypotension was 3.3 [1.0 to 7.3] min, for an alarm defined as the last of consecutive alarms prior to hypotension. Reducing the minimal mean arterial pressure in the definition of nonhypotension from 75 to 65 mmHg reduced the area under the precision recall curve from 0.82 to 0.31. Omission of a washout period of 30 min increased the positive predictive value from 0.41 to 0.64. This thesis demonstrates the importance of validation methodology and the generalizability of the Hypotension Prediction Index to the intensive care unit population. The definition of nonhypotension and a washout period strongly influenced the results. Overall, the results demonstrate the ability of the HPI to predict hemodynamic instability in ICU patients. Therefore, validation results support the introduction of the HPI to the ICU for clinical use. However, the optimal alarm threshold and clinical benefit remain to be evaluated in future clinical studies.","Hypotension; Haemodynamic instability; Validation; Intensive Care; predictive model; technical medicine","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-10-25","","","","Technical Medicine","",""

(mentor); Blom, C.B.M. (mentor); Mirra, M. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Conventional building methods are still based on the reinforced concrete industry. In the last decades, timber has become more popular because it could be a more sustainable alternative. However, pure timber is not always an option, especially when slender design is required by the client. Because of its low elastic modulus, deflections often require an increased deck height. Therefore, this research focuses on the strengthening of timber bridge decks with reinforcement and prestress in order to increase their slenderness (= the ratio of the span to the height of the cross-section). This might make timber decks more competitive to reinforced concrete designs regarding slenderness. The problem is that prestressing timber decks will lead to creep deformations that induce losses of prestress force. This research is focused on modelling the creep deformations and the resulting resistance losses of prestressed timber decks.<br/><br/>First, a cross-sectional model is developed to be able to find the initial resistance of a reinforced- and prestressed timber deck. This model is based on an incrementally increasing curvature so that the deck behaviour can be quantified from zero load to the failure load. Second, a time dependent model is developed to find the displacements and resistance through time. The timber bridge deck is modelled with ODE systems. The ODE's are used to find the (1) displacements and (2) strains of the deck. To obtain the time dependent behaviour of the deck, a viscoelastic E-modulus is substituted into the displacement- and strain equations. This viscoelastic E-modulus decreases with time, which causes an increase in displacements (= creep displacement). In the same way, the strains are modelled over time. The time dependent creep stains are implemented in the cross-sectional model to find the reduced resistance of the timber deck. <br/><br/>The outcomes of the model suggest that large prestress forces lead to negative creep deflections (= creep in upwards direction). Meaning that for the right value of the prestress force, also zero creep deflections can be obtained. Besides creep, the instantaneous deflections are a large part of the total deflections. According to the results of the model, the instantaneous deflections can be decreased by up to 70%. Regarding the resistance, the final increase of bending moment resistance can reach up to 30% by incorporating prestress (at t = 50 years, including losses due to creep). Due to creep, prestress force is lost over time, resulting in a decreased deck resistance. This research shows that the creep losses result in a bending moment resistance decrease of up to 12%. Taking this into account, a bridge deck with a slenderness of 31 to 33 will be able fulfil its requirements after 50 years of service life. Depending on the client requirements, a slenderness of over 34 can be reached. <br/><br/>Using Eurocode, creep deformations are calculated with a simplistic and conservative method. The model that is built in this research gives a more advanced way of determining the creep deformations of a timber deck. This leads to more realistic quantification of creep behaviour. However, Several factors still cause uncertainty in the model. Therefore, experiments with timber decks should be done to obtain more accurate data for the creep behaviour. The model from this research can be calibrated according to data from experiments, which will increase the reliability of the results.","Creep; timber; bridge","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

In its presence at the Grote Staat in the historic city its center, the building has expanded twice (in the 1960’s and the 1970’s) and was divided into two department stores in 2002. Within the research approach of the ‘Touch and Feel’ under supervision of Wido Quist, a research was conducted examining the façade its materiality and its relation to the surroundings. By researching how the façade becomes part of the relation between the public, semi-public and private space, a better understanding of the possibilities for the redesign of the building was created.The proposed design and program is aimed at a broad target audience, including tourists and local residents. The new program of the building offers the public leisure activities while simultaneously serving an educational purpose. With its mixture of different functions (a wine experience center, a museum and a cooking workshop space), the local traditions and heritage of the city of Maastricht and its surroundings are presented to the public in an interactive way. The architecture of the building itself contributes to this interactive learning experience by being an integral part of the story that is told within the building.","Vacant Heritage; Vroom & Dreesmann; Maastricht; Heritage; heritage & Architecture; Museum","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Heritage & Architecture","Vacant Heritage","50.8497584,5.6917762"

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","In the energy transition from fossil fuels to less polluting renewable energy sources geothermal energy are considered as a promising technology. Gasses such as CO2 are often dissolved in geothermal waters. With the extraction of these fluids from the reservoir, a change in pressure will occur towards the extraction well which may cause dissolved gas to exsolve. The exsolved gas may clog the pores of the reservoir rock near the extraction well and therefore reduce the effective permeability, which can result in reduced production of geothermal waters. This project is aimed at experimentally investigating the conditions of the onset of the degassing process and what the influence of the degassing process is on the permeability. Therefore Bentheimer and Berea sandstone core flood experiments were performed, using either tap water or brine with different CO2 concentrations (0.2 1.3 mol/L) and at temperatures between 30 and 90°C. Flow rates were varied/kept constant, between 90 2 bar and between 5 and 22 bar respectively. <br/><br/>At 30 °C and up to 50 bar the onset of the degassing process is controlled by Henry’s law, i.e. it is governed by the solubility of gaseous CO2. The onset of the degassing process is not influenced by the pore size and initial permeability. At these conditions the effective permeability decreases by a factor 2 to 5 in the Bentheimer sandstone core and by about a factor 10 in the Berea sandstone core. This change in effective permeability is gradual in the Bentheimer sandstone while in the Berea sandstone the change is nearinstant. For rocks with small pore sizes and low initial permeability, the reduction in effective permeability is larger and the rate of permeability decrease is faster. <br/><br/>Experiments at temperatures between 30 and 90°C show that with increasing temperature Henry’s law becomes increasingly inaccurate to find the onset of the degassing process. The onset degassing pressure increases with temperature but are significantly lower than Henry’s law. This inaccuracy can partly be explained by the fluid in the core not reaching the right temperature or by the values used for extrapolating Henry’s law for different temperatures. In experiments performed with a 1M NaCl brine the pressure at which the degassing process starts is higher than for experiments performed with tap water. The increased salinity does not influence the change in effective permeability due to degassing. The reason for this is that the change in interfacial tension between CO2 does not change sufficiently between tap water and Brine to cause differences in the degassing process. <br/><br/>The results obtained from this research can be used for successful management of geothermal projects. It shows at what conditions the degassing process starts and what the effect of this process is. Once the conditions are known they can be avoided. The research also shows the degassing process and its effects can be reversed.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Earth Sciences","",""

Due to European migration policy, the living conditions were abysmal, causing harm to refugees as well as the host community.<br/><br/>The aim of the project is to create a non-site specific architectural model, framework and strategy for a design of a refugee camp on how quality can be created with very little means, addressing the existing problems within the current refugee camp design (approach). It is an exploration on the possibilities within the realm of architecture to alleviate to alleviate the suffering of the refugees as well as the disconnect between the refugees and the host community. <br/><br/>With this, it can become a part in the larger discourse of refugees/camps, and hopefully giving policy makers and all involved a different look on the whole matter. <br/><br/>First is the need to see refugee camps as something permanent, instead of a temporary solution to a ‘problem’ that will end. The initial framework/design of the camp needs to account for future expansion and development. The focus is on a bottom-up design approach which involves the refugees as well as the host community in the planning and construction process. Co-creation, the ability for the refugee to make changes to their homes according to their own needs, control over their own lives, interdependence (social and economic) between the host community and refugee camp, and fostering (economic) activity of these two parties involved are of essence. To kickstart this, straw is being used as a low-tech self-buildable construction material to create quality dwellings, improving on the living conditions in European refugee camps.<br/><br/>Being a low-tech material, refugees can be involved in the building process. What’s more, Straw is a by-product of cereal crops. Cereal crops in turn can be used to produce food. This two-fold application of food/building construction can help refugees to be (economically) active by cultivating cereal by processing these crops into food, and the straw into buildings. On the flip-side, the building process and cultivation of cereal could benefit the local economy as well. Third, using this cultivation and processing of this crop to food or construction of buildings, can also be points of exchange, collaboration and interaction between host community and refugee. <br/><br/>Shown is a base model, idea and strategy, which can be used anywhere in the world. In this specific project, it is adapted to the terrain and climate of Lesvos. <br/><br/>By actively engaging refugees in the building of the city and giving (economic) opportunities, we challenge the view (rethinking part) from seeing them as a liability or threat and something ‘temporary’ to people who should be treated with respect and in a humane way.

(mentor); León Sánchez, C.A. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","In the Global South, large urban spaces resulted in the duality between the so-called ‘formal’ and ‘informal’ cities. It is the case of São Paulo, a twenty-two-million people metropolis and a financial hub in Latin America. Albeit a vast literature addresses the social-spatial segregation emerging from this dual built environment, the scarcity of spatial datasets regarding informal settlements also enforces a geo-information segregation, resulting in a terra incognita. This is exemplar in favelas, defined as precarious, spontaneous, and unorganised land occupation built on third-party property, most of which lack cadastral data. Since favelas are often not mapped, assessing urban phenomena becomes a technical challenge for several application domains, e.g., the energy one. A recent public initiative in Brazil estimates solar irradiation and photovoltaic potential for buildings at city scale, but favelas are intentionally excluded from the resulting web-based solar maps. Technicians believe that the absence of a spatial pattern in favelas calls for investigation on how to refine a roof mapping methodology. The main research question becomes: “How far is it possible to perform solar analysis on buildings of favelas in São Paulo, with the goal of estimating PV Potential?”. The research is structured into two topics: 1) Roof Mapping, which investigates the data pipeline that leads to a digital reconstruction of favelas; 2) Solar Irradiation, which investigates how existing solar irradiation modules – GRASS GIS, ArcGIS, CitySim, SimStadt, Ladybug and the one developed by Virtual City Systems – perform when assessing buildings of favelas. From a roof mapping perspective, the experiments reveal that the absence of cadastral datasets represents a complex technical challenge. Nevertheless, the reconstructed and post-processed building footprints cover the extension of the cadastral footprints that are available for the study area, with building shapes that are satisfactory as a first approximation. Regarding the solar irradiation perspective, qualitative and quantitative analyses are carried out to compare the results coming from the six solar modules. The qualitative analysis indicates that each solar module offers potentialities but also limitations. Therefore, a straightforward choice is not possible, since the optimal solution will be derived from a data-driven approach that considers, among other factors: the scale of the favela, its topographical characteristics, the presence/absence of urban features other than buildings (such as vegetation), a possible pre-selection of buildings of interest, etc.; The quantitative analysis reveals that ArcGIS outputs an annual summation of irradiation values that is the closest to the one offered by the meteorological station of São Paulo, adopted as ground truth. Nevertheless, from an accuracy perspective, CitySim outputs a daily curve that best corresponds to the ground truth one. In conclusion, based on the geometrical model and the weather dataset criteria, the author expresses his preference for a raster-based solar module – GRASS GIS or ArcGIS – if, on the one hand, the reconstructed building footprints result in an unrealistic or excessively complex vector-based model. On the other hand, if the resulting vector-based model is simple enough and representative of the built environment of the favela, the author suggests the adoption of CitySim.","São Paulo; Favela; Solar energy; 3D Modeling; Building Reconstruction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geomatics","","-23.461222,-46.700156"

In the Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry, professionals and data managers constantly seek to optimize the information management process to better collaborate in projects that include GIS &amp; BIM integrated workflows. The publication of ISO 19650-1:2018 &amp; ISO 19650-2:2018 (ISO 19650-1&amp;2:2018) standards on best practices for information management, including BIM, was recognized as an opportunity to the digital organization of these processes. As a result, main BIM software vendors have started supporting ISO 19650-1&amp;2:2018 in their platforms, and (non)-governmental organizations have started adopting them in their projects. However, the advancement in the field of GIS BIM integration and the tightly integrated workflows drew the attention towards the need for supporting ISO 19650-1&amp;2:2018in Web GIS for web services. I3S web service is an example of an open OGC Community standard that allows the consumption of 3D GIS data and 3D GIS data converted from 3D BIM data in Web GIS. In this thesis, field analysis addresses the challenges and the role of the Web GIS platform in projects information management processes of the Hoogwaterbeschermingprogramma (HWBP) as a case study. Then, literature studies review ISO 19650-1&amp;2:2018 in the context of the HWBP to highlight the need for a Common Data Environment (CDE) in the Web GIS platform to support ISO 19650-1&amp;2:2018. Moreover, the review tackles the CDE components specified in Part-2 of ISO 19650-1&amp;2:2018, such as metadata allocation. Finally, this thesis discussed the implementation of the CDE components for I3S web services in ArcGIS Online as a Web GIS platform. The novel contribution of this thesis is providing a contextual overview of ISO 19650-1&amp;2:2018 standards in the project information management processes that include working with GIS &amp; BIM data. Moreover, using the British national annex (BS EN ISO 19650-1&amp;2), a flowchart was developed for the metadata allocation systems of information container workflows. Furthermore, the reference implementation discussed a variety of options to implement the metadata allocation components in Web GIS. The discussion provided a solution and PoC functionalities of the CDE components for managing I3S web services. The resulting solution on the CDE components can be utilized to configure CDE workflows and technical solutions to enable ISO 19650-1&amp;2:2018 compliant workflowsin Web GIS.","ISO 19650; Standards; Web GIS; BIM & GIS; information workflows; Integration","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geomatics","",""

(mentor); Rezaei, J. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","For centuries, Homo sapiens have been trying to predict the future through supernatural or scientific methods. Since prehistory, this quality has been essential to humans (e.g., anticipate prey, then ambush it). Even in today’s society, predicting the future remains essential in many industries and research domains. Although, we are still far from producing flawless forecasts (e.g., weather) because future events are uncertain. When decisions contain uncertainty, governments, organizations, and individuals alike tend to be interested in the advice of others.<br/><br/>One such case that was interesting is when predicting the outcome of a standard battle. Within such a battle, high-tech firms compete to obtain most customers in a given market through their technological inventions. To predict which technology will be the standard on the market, experts are independently interviewed to determine the importance of factors (e.g., weights) that can influence this battle. Were the second round of expert interviews need to assign a value for each of these factors for every competing technology—resulting in a performance grade used to make the prediction. This prediction indicates which firm/technology will likely have the upper hand in the market. The factors originate from the list of factors in combination with the Best-Worst Method (BWM), which allows evaluating the multiple-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problem (Rezaei, 2015a; v.d. Kaa, G., v.d. Ende, J., de Vries, H.J., van Heck, 2011).<br/><br/>Multiple studies expressed concerns that it is challenging to persuade and find experts willing to participate in the interview. Instead of finding a better way to approach the experts, this study focused on another solution not applied before in predicting standard battles. Hence, the objective was to understand, test, and examine how the Collective Intelligence (CI) of the crowd (i.e., group of random individuals) performs compared to experts. The idea of CI is that it does not reside in any individual but emerges from the group. When people's opinions are combined, their advice should be more truthful or similar to a typical expert's. <br/> <br/>In other words, this quantitative exploratory study investigated if CI in comparison to experts differs when predicting standard battles. Hence, a literature review was required to provide deeper insights and factors that influence CI. This study explored the underlying mechanism of CI and established a conceptual model based on the theoretical background, which indicates the (moderating) relationship between ‘Diversity’ (DIV), ‘Group Size’ (GS), ‘Performance’ (PERF) of the crowd.<br/><br/>The variable DIV was measured based on differences in gender, age, degree, job, and nationality and expressed by the Simpson’s index, reflecting the number of different species and distributions (SIMPSON, 1949). As for GS, the only attribute measured was the number of people in a contrived group. Further, the definition of the PERF of a collective is the quantifiable difference in their solution relative to the prediction proposed by the experts (Wagner et al., 2010). Hence, this was dubbed ‘Relative Performance’ (RP) for the rest of this paper.<br/><br/>Prior research on standard battles was selected to test and validate the assertions in this study. This selection was based on several factors, such as the outcome of the battle was predicted by experts but where the ground truth is unknown. Doing so allowed validating if the crowd performs differently than experts in prediction tasks. The selected study involved the battle of two wind turbine technologies (WTT) dubbed ‘Gearbox’ (GB) and ‘Direct Drive’ (DD) (van de Kaa et al., 2020). Further, to interview the crowd, the traditional BWM questionnaire was converted into a cross-sectionally distributed online survey (i.e., MTurk) to obtain the data. Two hundred respondents completed the survey, but only 137 remained after pre-qualifications.<br/><br/>In this research, ‘groups’ were contrived from the sample that completed the prediction task. Here, the group members employ their expertise to carry out the given task. In other words, all group members performed the same activity and then were randomly pooled based on varying group sizes. Next, simplified random sampling was carried out twice. The first time this resulted in six groups with a respective size of 5, 10, 20, 30, and 40. A second time was required because the former did not provide a good range of DIV scores. Because of this limitation, the sample was sampled multiple times, which resulted in multiple subgroups with each a DIV score—resulting in five groups of size 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, and 137 with respectively 26, 13, 6, 4, 3, and 1 subgroup for comparison.<br/><br/>After sampling the data, the variables were tested for normality and homoscedasticity. The results indicate that the independent variables (i.e., DIV, GS) do not satisfy the normality assumption. Hence, the variables are not suited for parametrical testing. However, both the non- and parametrical tests were applied. Because ANOVA seems not to be very susceptible to modest divergence from normality. Namely, various studies used a variation of non-normal distributions and concluded that the false positive rate is not affected much if the notion of normality is not satisfied (Glass et al., 1972; Harwell et al., 1992; Lix et al., 1996). In addition, it was required to compare more than two groups. Hence, the One-Way ANOVA test (OWAT) and the Kruskal-Wallis Test (KWT) were selected to investigate the relationship between the variables (DIV, GS, RP). More specifically, the effects that GS or DIV can have on the RP of the crowd. In addition, due to systematic limitations with simplified random sampling, Bootstrapping (BOOT) and Monte Carlo (MC) were also performed respectively for the OWAT and KWT to investigate the relationship between DIV and RP. Lastly, the moderation effect was tested based on the Linear Regression (LR) method. <br/><br/>The results did not show any significant differences between DIV and RP, and any significant moderation effect. Hence, the initial hypothesis that a more diverse group of individuals would perform better was refuted. In addition, this research rejects the proposition that the relationship between GS and RP should be positively moderated by how diverse the crowd is. Consequently, this research was not able to conclude how these variables affected the PERF of the crowd. Nevertheless, the former results weaken the theory of (S. Krause et al., 2011; Nguyen et al., 2018; Surowiecki, 2005), who underlines the importance of DIV. In contrast, the results gave ample support to (Reynolds et al., 2017) and their claim that there is no correlation between DIV and PERF. However, their second assertion about an existing relationship between cognitive DIV was not tested. Hence, it is recommended that future studies investigate this relationship.<br/><br/>The findings did show a significant difference between groups for the variable GS in the case of GB WTT. Namely, when the size of the group increases, the PERF also proportionately increases with an upper limit, dubbed ‘Optimal Group Size’ (OGS). A U-shape relationship defines this relation between the variables. However, both the OWAT and KWT provide contradicting findings. Namely, findings from the OWAT suggest that the OGS consists of 15 people and that there is indeed a U-shape relationship between GS and RP, which proves that the claim of (Hashmi, 2005) and our hypothesis is correct. In contrast, the KWT indicates a relatively linear relationship, where the group of 10 and 20 performed significantly better than 30. However, OWAT showed that the group of 30 performed significantly better than the group of 10 and 20 people. Whereas the OGS was 10 and not 15 individuals. The results from the (non) parametrical for the location of OGS indicate that a group of 10 or 15 outperforms the other groups of smaller and bigger sizes. Hence, supporting the claim of (Carvalho et al., 2016) and weakening (S. Krause et al., 2011). <br/><br/>To conclude, how CI operated in this research depended on survey completion time, consistency ratio, selection of best and worst criteria, PERF grade, and the final prediction. Hence, this research concluded that the CI of the crowd did show differences in predicting the outcome of a standard battle compared to the expert pool. This was primarily based on the fact that the crowd had a PERF score that was two-thirds lower than that of the experts. Although, the crowd performed in some aspects in similar or better ways. This research only tested one case, limiting our insights if this happened due to chance or not. In addition, the main goal of this study was to investigate if the crowd could come up with the exact prediction. Meaning that the conclusion and the process (e.g., selection criteria and grading WTT) towards this conclusion should be similar to experts. However, this was not the case. In addition, the consistency ratio remains a matter of doubt since most of the results were initially unreliable, which required (logical) corrections to obtain reliable results. Making the comparison based on the consistency ratio rickety. To reiterate, the crowd performed differently than experts when predicting the outcome of the WTT battle. Despite various differences, the individual and groups would conclude a similar prediction like in the case of experts.<br","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

These batteries are used because of their superiority in gravimetric energy and cyclability compared to other battery technologies. The most common anode used in lithium-ion batteries is currently graphite. Graphite has proven to be a very stable cycling material. However, with a specific capacity of 372 mAh/g, there are alternatives with higher specific capacities.<br/>One of those alternatives is silicon, which has a theoretic capacity of 3000 mAh/g. However, a volume change of 200-300% occurs when a pure silicon anode is cycled. Thereby cracking the material and losing the majority of this theoretic capacity. The capacity retention of a silicon-based anode can be increased by various techniques. Of those techniques, two are used in this<br/>work, alloying the silicon with carbon and creating a porous material.<br/>This research aims to evaluate the effect of carbon concentration and porosity in the hydrogenated amorphous silicon carbide (a-SiCx:H) on the cycling performance of Li-ion batteries when this material is used for the anode. The a-SiCx:H used in this research is deposited on carbon fiber paper (CFP) using Plasma Enhanced Chemical Vapour Deposition (PECVD).

These anodes are then tested using coin-cell batteries in a half-cell configuration. The results of a stability test indicated that the sample with an estimated carbon concentration of 8% and a porosity of 29% had the best capacity retention, retaining 61% of the initial 1800 mAh/g during 60 cycles at 0.3C.<br/>This result is achieved with the sample having the highest carbon concentration and porosity that was researched in this work, suggesting that both a high carbon concentration and a high porosity value increase the capacity retention of the a-SiCx:H anode. Individual contributions of the carbon concentration and the porosity to the capacity retention have not been researched.<br/>Therefore, conclusions to these individual contributions cannot be drawn.","silicon-based anode; hydrogenated amorphous silicon carbide; half-cell test; silicon carbide; carbon concentration; capacity retention; porosity","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

For the past two decades, various industries have increasingly used these materials to improve performance and reduce emissions. This increased use has caused a problematic growth in both production and end-of-life CFRP waste. Recent developments in recycling processes allow recycled carbon fibres (rCF) to have undamaged and clean surfaces with intact sizing, retaining the mechanical properties of non-recycled virgin carbon fibres (vCF) at a considerable cost reduction.<br/>Unfortunately, CF recyclate from these recycling procedures is highly diffuse making them useless for structural application. For making rCF material viable to be used in structural applications, further processing of the recyclate is necessary. To manufacture high-performance rCF materials which feature homogenously distributed, orientated and aligned fibres, considerable effort has to be spent in controlling the microstructure during processing.<br/>The presented thesis has focused on introducing an initial characterisation method that allows for quantitative analysis and comparison between rCF microstructures. Characterisation is performed by analysing elliptical CF footprints in perpendicular cross-section micrographs. Fibres in the micrograph are identified and segmented through a semi-supervised machine learning tool. The elliptical fibre shape is measured by the method of ellipses (MoE) in FIJI ImageJ. This MoE extracts the position and elliptical shape of every fibre footprint in the micrograph. Analysis of the microstructure is done in python to quantify the microstructural morphology by fibre diameter, fibre orientation distribution (FOD), global-local fibre volumes (Vf), fibre density distribution (FDD) and Fibre-to-Fibre (FtF) spacing.<br/>It was found that the method is accurate and reliable in identifying and measuring fibres present in the cross-section micrograph. Similarly, calculated values for Vf, FDD and FtF spacing can be used for characterising the quality of studied materials.<br/>Unfortunately, despite being frequently used in literature to characterise highly aligned and orientated CF materials, all fibre orientation measurements were flawed by the inherent susceptibility of the MoE to calculate fibre orientation with large biases. This orientation bias was caused by the error sensitivity of the arccosines function used for calculating the out-of-plane (OoP) angle. Minute elliptical shape differences in near perpendicular fibres with almost circular footprints resulted in large non-linear errors.<br/>Recommended is to study FODs in samples that are sectioned at a 45 or 60° angle, resulting in large elliptical fibre footprints which are less error sensitive when analysing with the MoE. The induced section angle can easily be transformed back to yield an unbiased FOD measurement.","Recycled carbon fibre; recycled CFRP; Method of ellipses; Microstructural characterisation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Materials Science and Engineering","",""

Its origins are around the Mediterranean, but modern interest is mostly due to Guastavino, and the research done at MIT and ETH. The thin-tile vaults have a unique construction method without any temporary support. Eventually the increase in labour costs and the advancements in concrete and steel made the structure non-competitive.Robotics are a type of machines that can perform (semi)-automated tasks. In the past decades the development of robots have led to their implementation in the construction industry. Robots developed specifically for masonry show a high promise where they're able to lay much more bricks than even the most skilled mason.This research aims to investigate the time it takes for a robot to construct a thin-tile vault, and thereafter to advance the possibilities of research into and construction of the thin-tile vault. This is researched by answering the following question:How does a robotic construction of a parametrically designed thin-tile vault perform based on step-wise structural analyses?To answer this question a parametric model has been made to include the design of the thin-tile vault, the structural analysis and the robotic construction. This model is made in Grasshopper, but is supported by Python and RoboDK. Python performs any calculation necessary and analysis of this output. RoboDK is a robotic simulation program aimed to give users a tool to translate their design to robotic instructions. The structure of this report is based on the three aspects of the parametric model.In the first part the state of the art and the relevance of this research is stated. Thereafter the objectives, questions and methodology are noted.The first part of the model is related to the design. In the first chapter a literature review is provided on thin-tile vaults and similar vault structures. The second chapter of this part describes how the design model has been made. First the global shape of the vault is set as a barrel vault formed as a catenary arch. Then the bricks are placed on this vault surface using a similar approach as map projection. This is done with the introduction of the centre point approach. This ensures that proper information is maintained, like the course and the position within the course per brick. With this approach it is possible to fill this surface even with courses misaligned to the primary curvature. Bricks at the edge of the vaults surface are cut to fit within its domain. The last step is to thicken the bricks, which thus far had been represented as surfaces, into volumes.The structural analysis consists of three major parts. In the first chapter literature is shown to justify the use of a linear elastic analysis on masonry. Additionally the behaviour of this uncommon type of masonry is tried to be found in literature. The materials brick, mortar and epoxy are looked into as well. Bricks have time-independent properties, making these similar as found in the Eurocode, by manufacturers and in research. Mortar and gypsum plaster especially (also known as Plaster of Paris), are described in their material properties as well. Due to uncertainty in these properties, epoxy is investigated as well and found to have more theoretical values useful for this research. A small-scale experiment with bricks and epoxy has been done to verify what values from epoxy should be used.After the literature review on material properties, the structural analysis is done. The flow of this chapter starts with the form from the design model, through the forces of a cantilever, to the stresses occurring in the structure. The vault has been simplified to an arch during construction. Thrust is not present. The sectional forces are found by first considering the (partial) arch as a cantilever with a vertical shear force and rotational moment. Next this shear force is converted into the normal and shear force in the cross-section of the arch. This calculation has been worked out in a Python script.In the last chapter a possible stress distribution is shown. The analysis is based on a phased structural analysis. Each time step is equivalent to the placement of one row of bricks, which have a similar cantilever length. The stresses of the bottom and top side are shown, as well as the stresses between the wythes of the vault. In a DIANA model it is shown these wythes behave more like a monolithic material than a layered one. The last part is related to the robotic construction. First literature is shown related to masonry robotics. In the second chapter the stations the robot visits, are described. At the pallet station three instructions are described. The adhesive station has a number of instructions which is dividable by four. The vault station again has three instructions. This is similar to a pick &amp; place work order, but with the adhesive station in between. Two configurations are considered. The first is when the robot is outside the vault, where it is closer to the support than to the apex. In the second configuration the robot is placed within the vault, where it is positioned close to the apex. In the last chapter the robot is chosen. Additionally the path is described with boundary conditions.The results are shown for 8 computations: a basis computation; one with the robot changed; one with the shape of the vault changed; one with the orientations of the wythes changed; one with an increase of the adhesive hardening time; one with a small course length of the vault; one with a different work space configuration; and lastly one with a different preferred construction sequence.In conclusion the models and results show that the construction of a thin-tile vault is similar to other masonry robotics, if the hardening time is excluded. Included, the number of bricks built per day is similar to two masons building a thin-tile vault prototype. The hardening time is the primary influence of the total construction time and any reduction here is advised. Further optimisation of the movement of the robots is possible with a more in-depth optimization of the work space configuration and an optimization where the shortest movements are considered across instructions. The linear-elastic structural analysis has been found to be possible to use for the calculation of the thin-tile vault during construction. Additionally, two construction sequence preferences work well with the multiple wythes, but one preference shows better results when more bricks with more cantilever length need to be placed, due to reducing the stresses on the edge of the extrados wythe.Further research into thin-tile vaults is still required to fully understand and model the thin-tile vault. Related to the three models (design, engineering and robotics) each have been improved in the models made for this research, but are still a long way away from full implementation.","thin-tile vault; Catalan vault; Guastavino; Funicular curve; Masonry; Linear elasticity; Robotic Arm; robotics; construction time and process; epoxy; Grasshopper; RoboDK; Digital fabrication; digital architecture","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Building Engineering","",""

However, a challenge of the use of silicon anode is 300% swelling/shrink upon lithiation/delithiation, which is a major cause of battery failure. A lithium-ion battery with silicon anode requires the formation of a flexible and stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on the anode’s surface to prevent continuous electrolyte decomposition, to mitigate the volume changes and to enable good Li­-ion transportation. It is still a challenge to develop new electrolyte compositions to mitigate the continuous SEI formation and, consequently, enhance the cycle life. In this thesis, a 100% pure amorphous silicon anode is investigated in lithium-ion battery cells with an energy density up to 1350 Wh/L. The effect of different electrolyte compositions on the electrochemical behaviour and cycle life is studied. The results show that the addition of fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) and vinylene carbonate (VC) to an electrolyte mixture of LiPF6 and a pure linear carbonate solvent improves the capacity retention for over 100 cycles. The addition of co-solvents, propylene carbonate(PC) or ethylene carbonate (EC), improves the silicon utilisation level from ~1500 to ~1700 mAh/g. The diallyl pyrocarbonate (DAPC) additive in the electrolyte improves the capacity retention at 100 cycles from 67.7% to 72.2% in a full NMC­622/Si coin cell and from 84.2% to 90.8% in a full pouch cell. This study demonstrates that the electrolyte composition has an effect on the cycle life of lithium-ion batteries with silicon anode, likely by SEI formation from preferable decomposition products and from a complementary mixture of electrolyte components.","Silicon anode; Lithium-ion battery; solid electrolyte interphase; electrolyte mixtures","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-11-02","","","","","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Following the Paris agreement and the agreements with the EU, the Dutch government has made their climate agreement with the goal for the whole built environment to be energy-neutral and free of natural gas by 2050. The Dutch government has tasked the municipalities to lead this process as they are the most suited party. The Dutch building stocks for housing consist of a substantial part of condominium associations where only 25% scores an energy label B. Especially in the bigger cities, the building stock consists of a large part out of condominium associations. As municipalities can not force them to renovate, they have a slow decision-making process, and there are complex ownership situations, the energy transition for condominium associations is a big challenge. This research focuses on the larger associations (6+ members) as group dynamics also start to play a role. This research aims to advise the municipalities on their approach and position in the energy transition for condominium associations. To achieve this goal, the research focusses on the following main research question:<br/><br/>‘How can municipalities enhance their approach for stimulating condominium associations to renovate their dwelling for the energy transition?’<br/><br/>First, to answer this question, a literature review was carried out to create the theoretical framework. The literature review looked at public policy, energy-efficient governance and different types of policy instruments governmental bodies can use to stimulate people. In addition to that, the literature review also looked at the customer journey of condominium associations. The review on the customer journey also includes transaction costs, collective decision-making processes and stakeholder analysis. With this literature review, two frameworks have been created. First, one framework has been created to study the approaches of different municipalities and one to discover the different barriers that condominium associations encounter in their process. Second, with the framework for the customer journey as a basis, the first round of interviews was held with actors close to condominium associations. This discovered where the barriers lie for condominium associations and what municipalities could do about that. This focuses on the three different types of barriers that condominium associations can encounter: transaction cost barriers, collective decision-making barriers, and barriers to comprehending and applying for the help of municipalities. Third, the second round of interviews was held with representative stakeholders to study Amsterdam, Rotterdam and Utrecht approaches. By looking at the research variables of the framework, it was possible to compare and analyse the approaches. From this analysis, lessons were drawn about the approaches of the municipalities and the barriers. Fourth, the barriers encountered by the condominium associations in Amsterdam were compared with the analysis of the approaches of the different municipalities to see if the approach of the municipality of Amsterdam could be enhanced. This piece of advice was generalized to enhance the approach of municipalities for stimulating condominium associations for the energy transition which states that: <br/><br/>The municipalities should become the facilitator of the energy transition, and condominium associations should be assisted wherever they can be in the customer journey. Municipalities should look for ways to make this possible. Five tasks are given to do this; <br/><br/>Instigating<br/>Municipalities should raise awareness and engage condominium associations to stimulate more condominium associations to renovate their building.<br/><br/>Teaching.<br/>More adequate boards and well-functioning condominium associations must be created by ensuring basic understanding with condominium associations of what it means to be one. <br/><br/>Guiding ans assisting.<br/>Municipalities must assist and help condominium associations in their customer journey to help them overcome barriers to ensure that more condominium associations finish their journey.<br/><br/>Take away barriers.<br/>The municipalities should look for general barriers for all condominium associations and see if there are ways to make this process easier. <br/><br/>Communication and Collaboration.<br/>To prevent them from all inventing the wheel, municipalities must start working together with market parties and each other. This collaboration helps with sharing and understanding the problems and barriers better. <br/><br/> The full advice, together with practical recommendations, answers the main research question. <br","Condominium Associations; Customer Journey; Energy Efficiency; Governance; Transaction Cost; Collective decision-making","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Management in the Built Environment","",""

However, their highly restrictive weight constraints pose a major challenge regarding the available computational power to perform the required control tasks. Thus, spiking neural networks (SNNs) are a promising research direction. By mimicking the biological process for transferring information between neurons using spikes or impulses, they allow for low power consumption and asynchronous event-driven processing. In this work, we propose an evolved altitude controller based on a SNN for an airship which relies solely on the sensory feedback provided by an airborne radar sensor. Starting from the design of a a lightweight, low-cost, open-source airship, we also present a low-control-effort SNN architecture, an evolutionary framework for training the network in a simulated environment, and a control scheme for ameliorating the performance of the system in real-world scenarios. The system's performance is evaluated through real-world experiments, demonstrating the advantages of our approach by comparing it with an artificial neural network (ANN) and a linear controller (PID). The results show an accurate tracking of the altitude command while ensuring efficient management of the control effort. The main contributions of this work are presented in the scientific paper, corresponding to Part I of the document. Besides the research on altitude control based on SNNs and their comparison with an ANN and a PID, this thesis includes an in-depth review of the relevant literate on the main topics covered, in Part II.

This SAR consists in the first ever Socially Assistive Drone (SAD): a quadrotor drone of reduced size conceived<br/>for maintaining human-drone interaction during therapeutic sessions meant for children diagnosed with ASD. The main focus of this paper consists in developing an adaptive control system based on Fuzzy Logic Control due to its inherent advantages such as intuitiveness or the ease with which expert knowledge can be introduced into control systems. In total, four different behavioural modes are developed for the SAD, together with an adaptive algorithm which influences both a set of adjustable parameters associated with each mode and the likelihood of it being selected based on the user specific preferences. The four behavioural modes and their respective adaptive algorithms are tested on 10 participants in 30-minute sessions. The variations in the adaptive parameters and the likelihood of each mode being selected for each individual are registered and reveal that the SAD is able to adapt its behaviour to each participant based on their respective levels of engagement.","Adaptive Control; Fuzzy Logic Control; Socially Assistive Robots; Drone; Autism Spectrum Disorder; Dance Movement Therapy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Since then it has proven to be a useful source of air traffic data for academic research because it is publicly available. Another source of information are the communications between air traffic control (ATC) and aircraft. Methods are (being) developed to enhance the existing radio communications with digital text messages. These are not publicly available while access to these could further the research in this field. <br/>The lack of publicly available machine-readable ATC data hinders research in the field of air traffic management. Therefore the objective of this study is to develop a method that uses open- source data to infer ATC commands. This two-part exploratory study is presented to address this objective. <br/>The first part explains the rule-based analysis used to infer ATC commands. This method uses a set of rules to detect lateral and vertical changes by approaching the ADS-B data as a time series. This approach can detect changes using the turn rate and rate of climb which can correspond to ’heading’, ’direct to’ and ’altitude’ commands. It was not possible to detect changes in speed due to the variability in the wind. <br/>The second part of this paper tests the found method in an air traffic simulator. For 111 flights, ADS-B data was gathered using the Opensky network. The previous method was applied to this data to create a list of possible ATC commands. For every unique flight, two flight plans were made. The first was based on the found list of commands. The second flight plan used the original ADS-B data. These flight plans were simulated and differences between trajectories were used to test the fidelity of the rule-based analysis. <br/>The results showed that the mean absolute horizontal error was below 15km for 75% of the flights and the mean absolute vertical error was below 100m for 75% of the flights. A remark- able correlation was found between the availability of ADS-B data points along the trajectory and the error in the horizontal distance. When more datapoints are available a smaller error in horizontal distance is observed. <br/>It was found that a method could be developed using a rule- based analysis that produces a list of possible ATC commands. The could be done for both lateral and vertical commands, but not speed commands. <br","Air Traffic Control; Air Traffic Management; ATC; ATM; ATC command detection; ADS-B; change detection; aircraft trajectory","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

The questions is how to use the information from microsimulation to say something about the general safety at network level. The objective of this research is to find out how microsimulation can be used to quantify traffic safety at a network level. For this, the surrogate safety assessment module was used to identify the conflicts that occur on a large scale network consisting of a distributor road with 20 intersections. These conflicts are indicated by the Time to collision (TTC) and the post encroachment time (PET). Five years of historical crash data of this same network was compared to the conflicts from the SSAM both visually and statistically. The statistical comparison used the spearman rank correlation to check the correlation for different threshold values of bot the TTC and the PET. An AM-peak and PM-peak simulation scenario were run and compared to the crashes within the same time interval during the day. The AM-peak conflicts showed a reasonable fit with the AM-peak crashes with a spearman coefficient of 0.58 and a corresponding P-value of 0.008 for TTC and PET values up to 1.0. Which is significant within a 95% confidence interval. The PM-peak conflicts showed a bad correlation to the crashes on the network with a spearman rank coefficient of 0.275 and a corresponding P-value of 0.240. To see if there was a connection with other surrogate safety methods, a safety performance function (SPF) from the federal highway administration was used to predict the crashes on the network using the traffic volume. The use of this SPF did not lead to reliable results. The last stage of this research was the application of a newly proposed framework that consists of a linear model. Within this linear model the number of conflicts for each of the conflict indicators of the SSAM was compared to the number of crashes for each intersection at the network. By solving the linear model with a least square estimate the influence of each individual conflict indicator was estimated for different number of intersections. From these estimations, it could be seen that the TTC has the best predictive value out of the conflict indicators present in the SSAM program.","Microsimulation; Surrogate safety measures; Traffic safety; SSAM","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Transport and Planning","","51.595237, 5.046123"

The mapping of landslides is essential for emergency response, disaster mitigation and a better understanding of landslides. Currently, it is still difficult to detect the timing and extent of landslides accurately through satellite imagery. Most often optical satellite imagery is used, but this is limited since it requires daylight as well as cloud-free conditions in order to observe anything on the Earth's surface. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) amplitude imagery shows great potential since it can overcome these disadvantages, the speckle and geometric effects make it difficult to detect landslides. Both SAR amplitude images without temporal averaging and with temporal averaging, within a time window of one month, were tested. This study introduces the use of SAR amplitude images by two Deep Learning models, a U-Net and a Pix2Pix conditional Generative Adversarial Network, to detect and map landslides. These two models are trained and tested on several regions in South-East Asia where landslides have occurred recently. <br/>The two models were not able to detect and map the landslides based on the SAR amplitude imagery, as shown by the mean Intersection over Union values which are smaller than 0.01 and the inaccurately predicted images. <br/>Speckle reduction by temporal averaging of pre-and post-event images and consequently taking the log-based amplitude ratio, Aratio, is recommended when using SAR amplitude imagery. Additionally, reduction of geometric effects by averaging images of descending and ascending order together is recommended. <br/>Despite the application of these measures, the two Deep Learning models used in this study don't have a successful outcome. In fact, a positive Aratio returns landslide scars better than the models. The landslide detection becomes more effective when temporal averaging is done over more time, although this is impractical for timely landslide detection. In general optical imagery is recommended over SAR amplitude imagery, if available within three months after the landslide event. Otherwise, SAR amplitude imagery can be used, by using the aforementioned averaging and a threshold method on positive Aratio.","Synthetic Aperture Radar; landslide detection; U-Net; conditional Generative Adversarial Network","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geoscience and Remote Sensing","",""
