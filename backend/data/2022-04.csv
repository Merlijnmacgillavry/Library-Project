The aim of this project is to develop a model that can automatically restructure the network schedule to enable that delay is mitigated as much as possible while the effects on multiple project criteria are minimized. This model will be developed as an alternative perspective on the original Mitigation Controller.<br/>Approach - Simulation, optimization and multi criteria evaluation are combined to reflect reality and the human goal oriented behavior during the decision making process in large infrastructure projects. Including optimization in a simulation process ensures that uncertainties and risks are reflected in optimization outcomes. Embedding a multi criteria evaluation in the optimization establishes the reflection of multiple project criteria in the model. One of the largest ongoing infrastructure projects in the Netherlands is used as a case study to validate the model and establish its practical relevance.<br/>Findings - The verification and validation on the applied case study showed the theoretical and practical feasibility of the developed model. The probability to achieve a certain project target duration increases significantly for the highest aggregated preference of the applied mitigation strategy.<br/>Originality - The proposed development proposes an alternative perspective on the Mitigation Controller as it examines the optimal network logic rather than crashing activities to minimize project delays. Not only cost, but also multiple other project criteria can be taken into account in the optimization, such as traffic hindrance or stakeholder effects. On this wise Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) is not only combined with optimization, but also with Multi Criteria Analysis. And lastly, a Genetic Algorithm is applied to minimize the project delay for the least effects on project criteria in each run in the MCS.<br/>Future work - To improve the body of scientific knowledge on this topic, further research on how to combine the model on network restructuring and the original Mitigation Controller on activity crashing into one overall automated computer tool would be of interest. This tool can then propose the best mitigation strategies both on the structure of the network as on the lead times of activities to mitigate project delays, which would be a valuable addition for project control in the construction industry.","Soft logic; Risk mitigation; Project delays; Project scheduling; Optimization; Monte Carlo Simulation; Infrastructure; Genetic Algorithm","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2027-04-29","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

Personalized travel assistance services can help make cycling more appealing by providing speed or route advices that can reduce travel time and increase safety while taking into account the personal preferences of cyclists. Due to its ability to learn agents' reward function, Inverse Reinforcement Learning is a suitable algorithm for learning cycling preferences from data. <br/>This thesis aims to describe cycling styles as a set of cycling preferences encoded as a reward function composed of a weighted sum of features. The weights associated to the features composing the reward function represent the importance given to each cycling preference and express the trade-off between different goals of a cyclist. Continuous-time Inverse Reinforcement Learning extracts the weights from empirical cyclists' trajectories collected during an experiment performed in Delft. During the experiment, cyclists were asked to cycle according to three different cycling styles: cautious, normal and aggressive. Differences between weight sets extracted for each cycling styles were analyzed by means of the Kruskar-Wallis statistical test and K-Means clustering algorithm, and the averaged weights for each cycling style were used to simulate a set of test trajectories.<br/>It is shown by simulations that the reward function identified for a specific cycling style leads to an improvement in terms of similarity to test trajectories with the same cycling style with respect to the reward functions corresponding to other cycling styles. The statistical analysis shows that the weights of cautious and aggressive cycling styles show statistical differences and define separate clusters.","Inverse Reinforcement Learninig; Cycling style; Reward function","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Even if a Multi-modal Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm (MMOEA) is designed to find all locally optimal approximation sets of a Multi-modal Multi-objective Optimization Problem (MMOP), there is a risk that the found approximation sets are not smoothly navigable because the solutions belong to various niches, which reduces the insight for decision makers. Moreover, when the multi-modality of MMOPs increases, this risk grows and the trackability of finding all locally optimal approximation sets decreases. One example where this issue occurs is that of High-Dose-Rate (HDR) brachytherapy for prostate cancer. In HDR brachytherapy a treatment plan is to be optimized that irradiates a tumour with a prescribed dose, whilst sparing all of the healthy organs surrounding the tumour. The radiation is administered through a radioactive source that is stopped at certain dwell positions within a set of hollow catheters that have been implanted into the patient. In a treatment plan, each of the dwell positions is given a specific dwell time for which the source is kept at that location in order to irradiate the surrounding tissue. <br/>To tackle the navigability issues, two new MMOEAs are proposed: Multi-Modal Bézier Evolutionary Algorithm (MM-BezEA) and Set Bézier Evolutionary Algorithm (Set-BezEA). Both MMOEAs produce approximation sets that cover individual niches and exhibit inherent decision-space smoothness as they are parameterized by Bézier curves. MM-BezEA combines the concepts behind the recently introduced BezEA and MO-HillVallEA to find all locally optimal approximation sets. Set-BezEA employs a novel multi-objective fitness function formulation to find limited numbers of diverse, locally optimal, approximation sets for MMOPs of high multi-modality.<br/>Both algorithms, but especially MM-BezEA, are found to outperform the MMOEAs MO_Ring_PSO_SCD and MO-HillVallEA on MMOPs of moderate multi-modality with linear Pareto sets. Moreover, for MMOPs of high multi-modality, Set-BezEA is found to indeed be able to produce high-quality approximation sets, each pertaining to a single niche. Set-BezEA is also shown to be comparable to the current BRIGHT approach used in the Amsterdam UMC for the optimization of treatment plans for prostate cancer HDR brachytherapy, which opens the way for it to be introduced in the clinical practice in the future.","Evolutionary algorithms; Multi-modal multi-objective optimization; Niching; Bézier curve estimation; High-dose-rate brachytherapy; Prostate cancer","en","master thesis","","","","","","Double degree in Computer Science and Embedded Systems","","","","","","Computer Science | Data Science and Technology","Fast, accurate, and insightful brachytherapy treatment planning for cervical cancer through artificial intelligence (Brachytherapy treatment)",""

The construction sector is importance to support economic growth and social development within society. However, the conflict that arises here is that the activities of the construction sector are also responsible for a tremendous amount of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This makes the construction sector a key player in the fight against global warming and its consequences. The construction sector can help reduce its emissions and slow down global warming by constructing more sustainable. Sustainable construction minimises the impact on the environment and assures safety and comfort while a financial profit is made. However, the most significant barrier to the implementation of sustainable construction is the affordability of sustainable projects. Sustainable construction often results in higher costs than conventional construction methods, which slow down the return on investment for the project owner. <br/><br/>In 2005, the European Union (EU) introduced the emissions trading system (ETS). The ETS is a policy measure aimed to lower the European emissions by letting the polluter pay for its emissions of GHGs. This policy measure could help overcome the barrier of affordability towards implementing sustainable construction. This research aims to find the ETS allowance price tipping point that financially stimulates the use of natural construction materials like timber over conventional materials like steel and concrete. The tipping point results could stimulate the implementation of sustainable construction and help to slow down global warming. <br/><br/>The results show that the allowance price could help lower the barrier of affordability because a higher allowance price increases the market price of carbon-intensive construction materials like steel and concrete. However, the found allowance price tipping point is unlikely to occur based on the current allowance price of around € 85. Therefore, the current ETS can be considered helpful but not decisive towards a financial favourable timber structure for buildings in the Dutch built environment.","Sustainable construction; embodied carbon; LCA; ETS; Tipping point analysis; Timber; steel; concrete","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

Weirs are used to raise water levels up-stream to increase water levels and storage, but their is little information regarding sediment continuity and transport over a weir. Observational research studies suggest that weirs do not have a 100% trapping efficiency, however, due to the reduced flows this study hypothesizes that sediment will settle upstream of the structure.<br/>Based on data from the White Volta River, a 1D Flume model is created using<br/>HEC-RAS which tests several sediment transport functions and bed roughness parameters with constant bed slope, suspended and bed-load gradation in order to estimate sediment settling. The results suggest that during peak discharge events settled sediments are flushed up and over the weir. As peak discharges decrease, settling occurs based on particle diameter causing increased sediment  storage up-stream until the next flushing event. The volume of sediment stored ramp is highly variable with respect to bed roughness and the used transport function, suggesting river calibration is required for concrete estimates. Based on the model results, approximately 1 − 2% of the White Volta’s yearly suspended load settles in-front of the structure before the discharge flushing event.","sand winning; white volta; Sediment transport; HEC-RAS; Weirs","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

In this thesis project, an alternative installation method is investigated, in which the monopile itself is used as casing, avoiding the waste of extra material.<br/><br/>The ‘drill-drive’ installation method under investigation consists of an initial drill-out of the rock from the inside of the pile and its subsequent driving into the seabed with a hydraulic hammer. No casing is used and a cutting toe is equipped in the bottom circumference of the pile, being responsible for breaking through the rock. <br/><br/>Through finite element analysis, the structural integrity of both the monopile and the cutting toe during the drill-drive process is assessed.

(mentor); Knop, Tobias (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Dawn Aerospace is developing a horizontal take-off and landing two stage to orbit partially-reusable launcher concept. The re-usable first stage spaceplane operates on a return to launch site trajectory and integrates into the existing airspace, flying as an UAV. For any re-entry vehicle the design needs to account for aerothermodynamic behaviour around the vehicle, to ensure the structure can survive the re-entry temperatures. The unique mission of the Mk-III means the thermal design considerations are unique and provide a new engineering challenge and research topic. <br/><br/>This thesis investigates the aerothermodynamic behaviour of the Mk-III flow and structure. A loosely coupled model was created for this purpose, which couples engineering methods to predict the aerothermodynamics and the thermal behaviour of the structure. The coupling is done by transferring the external skin temperature and convective heat flux between the two simulations. <br/><br/>The primary research question for this thesis is “What thermal protection systems have potential to be implemented on the Dawn Aerospace Mk-III spaceplane for a range of different design trajectories.” Two thermal protection systems (TPS) and material choices have been identified as potential solutions. The first is a fully titanium structure, which can handle the temperature experienced by the Mk-III for all trajectories at every point along the vehicle. The second is a combined titanium and BMI CF structure with an insulation layer on the BMI CF. The titanium is required for the temperatures experienced on the vehicle’s leading edges, while the BMI CF has been identified as suitable in areas away from the leading edge if protected by an insulation TPS. A benefit this option produces is that the insulation layer can be changed in thickness to lighten the vehicle for lower design trajectories, therefore creating different vehicles for different trajectories. However, combining a metal with a composite could pose manufacturing issues such as cost for different manufacturing processes and joining problems. This thesis could not properly trade-off between these two options due to it being outside the scope of this thesis and due to limitations in detailed structural knowledge. <br/><br/>These two material choices were chosen from four materials analysed in the thesis and four different TPS. Other TPS were not suitable at decreasing the structural temperature for the Mk-III mission or had an unjustifiable weight penalty. The other material choices would have been suitable in certain situations but were heavier than the current proposed options and might have required a TPS. <br/><br/>This thesis provides valuable insight in what suitable material and TPS choices could be for the Mk-III mission. It also shows that for any future material and TPS choice to be made, a comprehensive structural analysis is required. Mass is a key trade-off parameter between the two proposed solutions and a better structural analysis is required for any further trade-off.","Spaceplane; Aerothermodynamic analysis; Launch vehicle concept; Return to launch site; Thermal protection system","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-04-29","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

(mentor); Lemke, M. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","With an ageing society and fewer people willing to work in healthcare, the pressure on the healthcare sector is growing. And next to that, the high workload increased even more with the COVID-19 pandemic. Next to these factors increase, caregivers need to make numerous decisions each day, is their work emotionally demanding and though to be done. When continuing to work in this way, the quality of care provision will decrease. Therefore technical solutions, like Smart Glasses, can be a way to reduce these high pressures and maintain or even improve the quality of care. <br/><br/>The company 1Minuut already offers an option with Smart Glasses to make knowledge easily, safely and everywhere available to the care provider. Two different Smart Glasses, the VuzixM400 and Google Enterprise 2, and their software Genzõ are already used in several elderly care organisations. Smart Glasses are mainly used to let an expert, like a wound specialist, remotely watch clients from another location. A nurse wears the Smart Glasses, and when video calling with the device, the expert can remotely watch along. <br/><br/>This project focused on two parts. First, the current use and experiences of Smart <br/>Glasses (mainly of 1Minuut) are explored and researched. The second part of the research consisted of developing a design proposal of how Smart Glasses can contribute to supporting caregivers in elderly wound care. <br/><br/>The first part started with explorative activities in the context of Smart Glasses. A better understanding was created of how the Smart Glasses and Genzõ of 1Minuut are <br/>working, are used, and by whom. Then literature research was performed to obtain more information on the experiences of other Smart Glasses users and researchers. <br/>Furthermore, two questionnaires and interviews were conducted by seven participants (clients of 1Minuut) who had all experiences with using Smart Glasses in the actual context of elderly care. A content analysis method was used to analyse the interviews. The project also concentrated partly on what is happening in the elderly (wound) care sector. So when coming up with a proposed design, in the end, this design would contribute to something that can improve or make the work of the elderly care staff easier. <br/><br/>The main results of the study were that Smart Glasses do offer many advantages, <br/>especially for the person watching along and the clients. Less effort needs to be made when experts can see an elderly client remotely, and time will be saved. Nurses receive <br/>expertise on distance and can act faster, which improves the provision of care for the <br/>elderly. <br/><br/>However, Smart Glasses are not yet fully used. This is mainly because there are not yet that many opportunities with and features for the Smart Glasses. In addition, nurses do not yet experience what is really in it for them. Some, especially elderly nurses, find it challenging to control. In conclusion, it takes them more time than it benefits them. Therefore nurses do not use the Smart Glasses much and choose the old manner. <br/><br/>Furthermore, current users mainly use the Smart Glasses when a call is scheduled. They mention that good communication between the nurse and the expert at a distance is essential, as is the reason for use. Therefore an implementation plan is necessary. <br/><br/>The second part of the study focused on proposing a design for how Smart Glasses can support caregivers in elderly wound care. In a short 5-step design sprint, a reporting tool for the Smart Glasses was proposed. This feature helps nurses report wounds with the Smart Glasses by voice. Smart Glasses wearers will be guided through different steps of the report. Closed questions are presented about the wounds, and commonly used answers are shown, which can be selected by saying the answer out loud. There is always an option to add another answer or report at another moment. Reporting can happen now directly in the client’s room after the nurse has finished the tasks. When finished reporting, it will be automatically uploaded to the client’s information file. This makes reporting more accessible, faster and more consistent.","Smart Glasses; Elderly care; Wound care","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction | Medisign","",""

The UJALA policy has been deemed quite successful in this regard meeting its target and resulting in a market creation of the LED technology. Being centrally implemented, the UJALA policy has been implemented with the limited role of state authorities. However, a difference in policy penetration at state levels is observed. Also, the concurrent nature of the energy sector in India deems it important to understand the energy-efficiency efforts of Indian states that contribute to better penetration of energy-efficiency policies like UJALA. This is done via an in-depth analysis of UJALA policy implementation with respect to its impact and the role of the stakeholders involved in the study. This study was utilized to determine the causal conditions that impact the penetration of UJALA policy at sub-national levels in India consisting of policy mix characteristics and exogenous factors.

It primarily emerged from the West and has a wide set of definitions that revolves around the use of technology for urban development. With the concept’s growing popularity in the Global South, countries such as India have adopted it as a national program called Smart City Mission to guide the growth of its cities. However, it fails to address one of the crucial urban challenges of Indian cities - informality. This development model has created urban smart enclaves with aspirations to become a global city and has caused further fragmentation, segregation, and inequalities. The current informal area upgradation is essentially a top-down process seeking change by recognizing people’s needs and empowering them to transform their quality of life.<br/><br/>The graduation project, ‘An alternative smart paradigm,’ explores the possible shift in approach towards an inclusive and just smart city in India by integrating informal areas in planning and governance. The thesis explores redefining the word ‘smart’ through the lens of the local knowledge of the community. Peter Marcuse’s critical planning theory is used as a guiding theory to structure the research. It acts as an operational platform to institutionalize local voices and form a co-production system to recognize the passive actors as smart agents of change. <br/><br/>In order to overcome the shortcomings of the current policies and processes, a ‘Smart Slum Upgrading Program’ is envisioned which converges the existing agendas and is activated using a strategic framework. It is formulated as an evolutionary process of change that revolves around the idea of co-creation and enabling people to become smart citizens. A strategic framework based on people’s values and daily systems is expressed through the design of a spatial framework and finally operationalized using phases of transformation. A collaborative stakeholder engagement is developed to provide the right to the city for the marginalized groups. This project presents a people-centric approach towards informal area upgradation to integrate them within the smart city model and achieve socio-spatial justice.","informality; Smart City; Inclusive Development; collaborative approach; Socio-spatial justice; Thane; India","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Urbanism","Complex Cities","19.203728, 72.948775"

Much critique has been given to the management of data and the effect private<br/>surveillance has on society. Smart doorbells have also entered the street of Amsterdam, prompting the municipality to look into how to deal with the arising privacy issues.

We explore how this medium<br/>facilitates the interchange and how it facilitates an emerging power difference.<br/>To challenge the current design of smart doorbells, alternative smart doorbells were designed, taking a starting point in three different definitions of privacy. Each doorbell opens up for a new form of negotiation of the terms of the interaction between owner and visitor. The end result was an exhibition held in<br/>Amsterdam, where three new privacy-centric designs were displayed.<br/>At the exhibition, data was gathered about visitors’ opinions and views on the doorbells and analysed to understand better people’s values and preferences in regards to privacy in the context of smart doorbells. The result showed that speculative design exhibitions could be a valuable tool for better understanding<br/>citizens’ values and preferences. The physical manifestations of alternative futures allowed a nuanced and concrete discussion about possible interventions.

New possibilities in order to replace fossil fuels have been explored and one of them is the usage of green hydrogen. The Argentinian, North Patagonian, province of Río Negro, has a great potential to generate green hydrogen on a large scale, due to the available natural resources. Therefore, the province is ambitious to contribute in the developing worldwide sustainable energy market by producing and exporting green hydrogen. <br/>Argentina is located at a large distance from the expected green hydrogen sales market in Europe and Asia. In order to reach competitiveness with respect to other future hydrogen ports, the use of a Free-Trade Zone (FTZ) is considered. This is a delimited territory within a country in which tax benefits can be enjoyed. The Province of Río Negro is considering three different locations for a potential green hydrogen export port:<br/><br/> - Punta Colorada Muelle, is an old iron ore export port that is out of operation since 2016. It is located within a FTZ. The deteriorated dry bulk jetty could potentially be reused by accommodating the liquid bulk loading infrastructure. <br/><br/> - Punta Colorada South, is a location roughly one kilometre south of old iron ore export port and is also located within a FTZ. <br/><br/> - Puerto Lobos, is located on the border of the provinces of Río Negro and Chubut. It has potentially favourable bathymetric and hydrodynamic characteristics. <br/><br/>The following main research question is formed:<br/>”Which location between Punta Colorada Muelle, Punta Colorada South and Puerto Lobos is the most suitable for a potential hydrogen export port in Río Negro?”<br/>A conceptual qualitative Multi-Criteria Analysis is executed to compare the locations. In order to complete this analysis, firstly the hydrogen export port requirements and criteria are defined. Subsequently, primary and secondary data is collected. The primary data consists out of fieldwork surveys, including a topographic analysis, a hydraulic analysis and a structural analysis. The structural analysis is completed solely on the existing jetty at Punta Colorada Muelle, in order to create an understanding of the current state of the jetty. Furthermore, interviews are conducted with the director of the Maritime and Fluvial Research Center (CIEMF), the executive director of investment agency of the Government of Río Negro, and an ex-employee of the previous mining company at Punta Colorada Muelle. Secondary data on all locations is gathered through literature studies and presented documents from stakeholders. <br/><br/>With data from the field survey several detailed maps are made. A bathymetry map shows the sea bed profile from Punta Colorada Muelle until Punta Pórfido. A topographic map shows the ground level elevation for Punta Colorada Muelle. An interactive map of the jetty is made which contains all the gathered photographs of the structural components and indicates their level of corrosiveness. Next to that the stakeholders are displayed in a power-interest diagram.<br/><br/>Due to the limited information and the quality of the information that was gathered at Puerto Lobos no fair comparison between the locations can be made. Both locations at Punta Colorada have potential to construct a green hydrogen export port. The jetty at Punta Colorada Muelle has the potential to be used in the short-term if it is restored. Punta Colorada South has the advantage that potential future port operations will not depend on dated infrastructure. Next tot that there is no interference with the iron ore port authority. Puerto Lobos has the disadvantage that there is no FTZ and that is situated adjecent to a marine protected area. <br/><br/>To properly compare all three locations, bathymetric and aerial surveys that were completed at the Punta Colorada locations will need to be repeated at Puerto Lobos. To create a more definitive conclusion on any location, additional research like a CPT and an in depth analysis of the structural capacity of the jetty is required. <br/><br/>From the bathymetric surveys another potentially interesting location was found in Punto Pórfido. It is recommended this location is researched further.<br/><br/>Three alternative scenarios for phasing the port construction and operation are presented. These scenarios differ in permanent, temporary or no use of the current jetty at all.","Green hydrogen; Port; Argentina; Multi-Criteria Analysis","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","CIE4061-09 Multidisciplinary Project","-41.696005, -65.016995"

This allows the reduction of air resistance and wheel-rail contact friction, which translates in higher speeds for smaller power inputs. In the Netherlands, the Dutch company Hardt Hyperloop, has developed a new design concept of such technology, by means of electromagnetic suspension systems, unlike the most commonly applied levitating techniques.<br/><br/> The main aim of this project is to investigate the stability of the electromagnetic suspension levitation system, study the effect that the implementation of an error-based closed-loop control system has on the system dynamics and investigate the vehicle-structure interaction once a control system has been applied to the system. <br/><br/> Along these lines, the overall infrastructure-vehicle system is modelled through an equivalent two degrees of freedom system. In this manner, the inherent instability of the electromagnetic system is confirmed and the initial vehicle dynamics are highlighted. Afterwards, an error-based closed-loop PD-control system that applies to the system definition and reacts on the uncontrolled system dynamics is implemented and the effect of the control parameters on the dynamics and the stability of the system is studied. A certain stability region in the parametric space is derived, which ensures the stability of the system for significant perturbations of the vehicle from its equilibrium point. Besides, the existence of a subcritical bifurcation with respect to the parameter combination is demonstrated. The safety margin in the time delay of the controller response is studied, so as to define a slack time that accounts for not only processing and sampling delays, but also unforeseen events. Finally, the vehicle-infrastructure interaction is studied and its stability is ensured, by means of the previously defined control scheme. <br","Hyperloop; Electromagnetic suspension; PD control; Vehicle-structure interaction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering","",""

Applying timber elements instead of steel or concrete decreases the emissions impact of the built environment. Architect firm ZJA and Iv-consult are interested in investigating a timber railway bridge as part of the Norwegian infrastructure plan. A kilometre-long double-track railway bridge with 50 m spans is used as a case study to investigate the possibilities of timber application. The objective is to design and assess a timber beam bridge with steel sections at the support.<br/><br/>The aim of this research is to design the sections and their connection. The design requirements and calculation methods used are based upon the Eurocodes. The design is considered to be part of the preliminary design phase of a project. Unity checks of the cross-section and deflection are calculated by use of linear mechanics. An FE model with beam elements is created to determine the force distribution of the bridge and calculate deflection. The strength and stiffness of the connection are calculated using empirical and plastic mechanic methods given in the standards. The resulting stiffness is used in the model to determine the final deflection when accounting for the semi-rigid joint. <br/><br/>The design consists of timber and steel box girders that only carry a single track. On top of the support, a slender stiffened steel box girder of 10 m length is situated, 5 m to both sides. Between the steel sections, there are timber box girder sections of 40 m that have very thick flanges and webs. On top of the structure lies a slab track that is only considered as weight. A dowel-type connection is used with double slotted-in steel plates in all flanges and webs of the timber section. The slotted-in plates have a slightly smaller width than the timber elements and have a depth of around 2.7 m. The steel fasteners are simple dowels. <br/><br/>This thesis has found that a timber and steel beam bridge with box girder cross-sections is governed by the creep deflection, shear strength of the timber, fatigue strength of the steel, and the dimensional stability of the connection. Except for the last issue, each of these limits can be satisfied by increasing the dimensions of each cross-section. Dimensional stability is the timber size change due to moisture content variation. The perpendicular-to-grain stresses become too large due to the configuration of the steel in the connection. The use of modified timber, which decreases the dimensional stability effect drastically, is only suggested as a solution.<br/><br/>An architecturally pleasing structure is designed by adding very limited visual elements but mainly practical and structural elements that have two functions, shown in the figure below. The desired continuity and bridge rhythm is accomplished via a line concept. The abrupt material cross-section changes are partly covered by continuous timber elements. From the practical and architectural adjustments, new cross-section dimensions were determined. The governing unity checks of the new design were calculated and showed the possibility of the design under the assumption the connection shrinkage issue is resolved.<br/><br/>Thus a timber and steel railway bridge has potential. It should be stressed that methods and factors from the Eurocodes are assumed to be applicable to the large timber box girder sections. This assumption is recommended to be checked by means of experimental research on large timber specimens. Additional research on the semi-rigid is advised, as introducing slotted-in steel plates in the web and flange plane can significantly improve the moment capacity. <br/><br/>Finally, two alternative suggestions are given to avoid solving the dimensional stability issue. The first is to design a bridge with lower loading demands, like a road bridge. Secondly, the bridge can be made of only timber sections. Alternating spans would have two hinged connections to form a continuous cantilevered bridge. While the first alternative creates easier circumstances to solve for dimensional stability, the second alternative completely removes the issue by having a connection with lower demands. It is recommended to incorporate connections early on in timber design.","Timber; Steel; Railway bridge; Stringer bridge; Box girder; Preliminary design; Preliminary dynamic analysis; Preliminary fatigue analysis; Dowel-type connection; Slotted-in steel plates; Architectural design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering","",""

(mentor); Mosselman, E. (graduation committee); Lansink, J. (graduation committee); Halbmeijer, L. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","The flooding of the River Geul in July 2021 was an eyeopener for the society, the government and many others involved. Besides the major structural damage as a consequence of the flooding, the emotional damage was and still is massive. Therefore, the need for measures to reduce the impact of these extreme events is bigger than ever. Many people had to temporarily leave their house and companies had to shut down. One thing became clear: the impact of comparable or even worse flooding has to be lowered, and one way to achieve that is by implementing measures in the River Geul which reduce the flood risk. The main goal of this research is to find out the impact that certain measures have on the consequences of flooding of the River Geul. Therefore, the main research question is: What is the impact of hydraulic or hydrological measures on the consequences of extreme future flooding of the River Geul? An important aspect is to consider the multidimensional impact of each measure. This can be either social, economic, or ecological impact due to flooding and the implementation of the measure itself. <br/><br/>The evaluation of the impact of measures is done by using different methods. First of all, an existing SOBEK model is used to simulate two extreme events: July 2021 (recurrence interval ≈ 1/100 - 1/1000 per year) and a stress test (recurrence interval ≈ 1/10.000 per year) which simulates 60% larger discharge and precipitation amounts than July 2021. Based on the bottlenecks in the River Geul, which are either bridges, weirs, culverts or orifices, measures are defined and simulated in SOBEK. A distinction is made between possible measures down- and upstream of Valkenburg and in Valkenburg, dependent on the expected effect of the measure. All the measures are simulated for both July 2021 and the stress test. The measures that significantly reduce the flooding depth and local water level nearby urban areas, which follows from the longitudinal cross-sections of the maximum simulated water level, are rated as effective. The effective measures are also evaluated with a damage victim module (SSM2017) to calculate the reduction of damage and victims, but no cost-benefit analysis is performed. Finally, expert judgement is used to estimate the costs of the effective measures. Social impact and the impact on Natura 2000 area is also examined here.<br/><br/>Eleven measures were considered, and four of them showed effective results and therefore their impact is compared. The effective measures are: widen the river downstream Valkenburg, bypass through Valkenburg performed as a tunnel (in-situ or drilled) or channel, remove obstacles in the River Geul along Valkenburg and enlarge the current basins in the River Geul. For the flooding of July 2021, the optimization of current basins in the River Geul scored by far the worst on damage reduction and costs. River widening and removing obstacles both reduce the amount of damage by 6 percent, while the costs are at least a factor of four lower compared to the bypass (dependent on the type of bypass). However, the bypass reduces the damage by at least 34 percent. The most expensive bypass is the drilled tunnel, but it comes with less social impact, because barely any buildings have to be removed in the city centre of Valkenburg (assuming that the subsoil in Valkenburg is suitable for a drilled tunnel). For the stress test, the damage reduction of the effective measures was not significant compared to July 2021. Thus, for extremer events the measures have no longer a considerable impact. This is not an argument to not implement measures, because the probability that a similar event as the stress test recurs is at least a factor of ten lower compared to July 2021.<br/><br/>Depending on the preferences of decision makers the choice for a measure can be made. Based on this research and looking at the flooding of July 2021, a bypass in Valkenburg reduces the damage along the River Geul the most with approximately one-third. For a bypass performed as a drilled tunnel the social impact is limited as maximum five buildings have to be removed but a cost estimate of 112 - 207 million euros is associated with this choice. River widening downstream Valkenburg or removing obstacles in Valkenburg comes with lower costs of 4 - 23 million euros in combination with no social impact but this results in a damage reduction of only 6 percent. <br","Flooding; River Geul; Valkenburg; SOBEK; SSM2017","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","",""

However, energy transition alone will not provide enough improvements to the industry to maintain profitability and increase sustainability. To achieve these goals, chemical processes have to be appropriately optimised, and only the synergy of these two factors can improve existing processes. Epichlorohydrin production is an important industrial process, but it suffers from several drawbacks such as high energy consumption, significant wastewater production, and low atom efficiency. This is caused by chlorohydrin-based technology, which requires operations in very diluted solutions. In this thesis, a novel chlorohydrin-free technology for ECH production was investigated. This approach could allow operation in more concentrated solutions, but this route is in the early development stage. One of the most crucial design parameters for this process is proper solvent selection. On the one hand methanol appears to be the most suitable compound for this purpose. On the other hand, some papers reported the separation system for this case to be infeasible due to several azeotropes present in the post-rection mixture. However, with proper constraints and understanding of components' azeotropic behaviour, a separation system, which enables obtaining high purity ECH, was created and applied to the production process. To perform a comparison between HP route and chlorohydrin process an Aspen Plus simulation of both processes were created. For the hydrogen peroxide route with methanol as solvent a novel separation system which enables high purities of ECH were created. Furthermore, possibilities to optimise distillation in the given process were investigated because this unit operation requires significant expenses in terms of CAPEX and OPEX. A review of advanced distillation techniques concludes that Dividing Wall Column distillation is the most suitable technique for this purpose. This technology was then applied to replace two columns, which purifies the intermediate Allyl Chloride (ACH) from the process. Aspen Plus simulations of both processes with and without applied DWC distillation were created to evaluate the influence of these improvements. Moreover, to establish the impact of DWC distillation, an Aspen Plus model of this apparatus was created. Simulation results indicate that this novel epoxidation reaction produces 98% less wastewater than the traditional process. Additionally, the novel approach offers a 10% higher yield and a smaller amount of by-products than the chlorohydrin process. Energy consumption per unit of ECH is also lower for the novel route. Application of DWC distillation led to 3.5% decrease in OPEX, while the CAPEX was smaller by almost 5%. These results indicate that applying a novel epoxidation route and DWC may benefit a given plant. However, more research needs to be performed to implement a novel process in the industry.","Epichlorohydrin; Allyl Chloride; DWC distillation; Oxidation; Distillation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-04-25","","","","Chemical Engineering","",""

Their size and typical flight velocities are characterized by moderate Reynolds numbers <i>O</i>(10^4-10^5). For such conditions, boundary layers can remain laminar and therefore are highly susceptible to separation and the generation of laminar separation bubbles (LSBs), when compared to more conventional aircraft. Extensive research has been done to study the influence of Reynolds number, angle of attack, sweep angle or freestream turbulence level on the nature of LSBs. However, the study of LSBs subject to unsteadiness is rather limited. This is especially relevant for small aircraft that typically fly in gusty environments such as cities. The problem is aggravated by the recent shift toward composite manufacturing, which allows more efficient high-aspect-ratio configurations, but that deform considerably more when subjected to unsteady loads.<br/>The LSB that forms on the suction side of a modified NACA 64_3-618 airfoil at a chord-based Reynolds number of Re = 200k is studied in a series of wind tunnel experiments conducted at The University of Arizona. Three different flow measurement techniques are considered in the experiments to identify the bubble: surface pressure measurements, Particle Image Velocimetry and Infrared Thermography. The capabilities of the three techniques are first explored in a static characterization of the LSB over a range of angles of attack. For the conditions tested, excellent agreement between the techniques is obtained, showing an upstream shift of the bubble with increasing incidence. For the study of static LSBs, the infrared approach is superior, given its higher spatial resolution and experimental simplicity.<br/>The complexity is then increased to study the influence of aerodynamic unsteadiness on the bubble. For this purpose, two different types of structural motion are imposed on the wind tunnel model. A first experiment considers a pitching-type motion, with reduced frequencies up to <i>k</i> = 0.25. While surface pressure measurements and PIV are not heavily affected by the change in experimental conditions, the infrared approach becomes limited by the thermal response of the surface. To overcome this limitation, an extension of the recently proposed Differential Infrared Thermography (DIT) method is considered. Even so, the unsteady behaviour of the bubble can be only partially detected with this method. All-three techniques considered indicate a hysteresis in bubble location between the pitch up and pitch down parts of the motion, caused by the effect of the aerodynamic unsteadiness on the adverse pressure gradient.<br/>The second type of structural motion studied consists of a sinusoidal plunge, with an amplitude of <i>h</i> = 6% of the airfoil chord and a reduced frequency of <i>k</i> = 0.67. The surface pressure measurements and PIV still capture a hysteresis in bubble location along the cycle, expressed in terms of the effective angle of attack induced by the plunging motion. However, due to the increased frequency of the motion, the thermal response of the surface reduces and the infrared approach fails to detect the unsteady bubble. ","Laminar Separation Bubble; Infrared Thermography; Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV); Unsteady Aerodynamics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

In the field of fatigue analysis and design of welded joints, two overall methods are distinguished: the temporal and spectral approach. Using empirical models, the spectral approach is typically preferred due to its efficiency, even though damage estimates are conservative. With the temporal approach, nonlinear effects can be captured, providing higher accuracy at the cost of additional computation time.<br/><br/>Within this framework, an improvement of the spectral approach was pursued, focusing on incorporating the mean stress effect. Past efforts to include mean stress corrections were continued by focusing on applying the Walker correction.<br/>Nonlinear effects on the mean stress response were investigated and were found to be quite small for the case of a pontoon vessel. This enabled the use of the still water bending moment as a single input to the spectral mean stress model. By using Walker in the spectral mean stress correction, an overall reduction of conservatism of 21% was achieved.<br/><br/>Future research should focus on testing new wave cases, applying additional fatigue models and investigating the effects for hull shapes of naval vessels.","Fatigue analysis; Time domain; Frequency domain; Nonlinear wave loading; Mean stress effect","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Marine Technology","",""

For countries with high population density, land-based photovoltaics (solar) takes up valuable space. Therefore, solar application at sea is considered. <br/><br/>One of the proposed designs is by the Joint Industry Project (JIP) Solar@Sea II. The JIP structure is flexible, inflatable, and considerably smaller than Very Large Floating Structures (VLFS). The goal is to mitigate the installation and transportation disadvantages associated with VLFS. Combining multiple of these singular structures in an array allows for the same operational solar footprint as would be the case for a single VLFS.<br/><br/>To keep the structure at the intended location, a mooring system needs to be designed. For the mooring line analysis, the motions of the attachment points of the mooring lines to the floating structure must be deter-mined. These motions are dependent on the interaction between the fluid, structure, and mooring line system. The development of a numerical method that is able to determine the flexible motions of the structure is required. This method should be suitable for the initial design stages of the structure and mooring system. <br/><br/>A numerical method for the deep-water regime in frequency domain was developed. The structural deformations are determined by means of the Finite Element Method (FEM) in ANSYS. The fluid interactions with the structure are determined by means of a lower order Boundary Element Method (BEM). The combined effect of both structural motions and fluid behavior is captured in an equation of motion. The motions of the flexible structure can then be determined by solving the equation of motion. The method is written in Python and the interaction with ANSYS is achieved by means of an ANSYS APDL interface. <br/><br/>The numerical method was successfully verified by comparison of results with analytical solutions. The nu-merical method is validated by comparing the numerical result with experimentally determined responses of a 1:1 scale JIP structure to incident regular deep-water waves as measured by MARIN. Suitable deep-water test cases were determined from the MARIN data. The undisturbed numerical wave was compared with the undisturbed deep wave measured by MARIN. Finally, three test cases were selected for the validation of the interaction of the structure and the wave. These consisted of a wave longer than the structure, a waveslightly shorter than the structure, and a significantly shorter wave than the structure. <br/><br/>The numerical method was able to accurately predict the structure motions for waves longer than the structure. For waves shorter than the structure, the error between the numerical method and the experimental data increased as the wavelength decreased. The errors found can likely be attributed to the nonlinear interaction of the ballast bags, which are not considered in the current numerical method. This cannot be confirmed based on the available experimental data. <br/><br/>The presented work is part of a larger intended method, which is not yet finished. Satisfactory results were found for the components considered in the verification. The validation provided points for improvement for the current numerical method. The response to waves longer than the structure can be determined accurately. The method is less accurate for waves shorter than the structure. The recommendation is therefore to research the effect of the ballast bags on the structure response in shorter waves. This could result in a better approximation for structural responses in shorter waves.","FEM analysis; BEM analysis; Hydroelasticity; Floating Solar","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

They were all done with residents taking advantage of the system and decided to adopt an all-or-nothing approach. Child support applications would be assessed thoroughly and mercilessly. Consequently, that would also mean that the good can suffer from the bad, as stated by the state secretary of finance Frans Weekers (Frederik, 2021).<br/><br/>In the years that followed, about 30,000 parents were wrongly labeled as fraudsters by the tax authorities. These parents had to repay their allowance in full at the slightest mistake. In some cases, a single missing receipt was enough to make parents pay back tens of thousands of euros. To this day, some parents are experiencing the financial, mental, and physical consequences of the fraud hunt. We now label this the Toeslagenaffaire (Eng: The Child Welfare Fraud Scandal). Within public organizations, every effort is made to prevent these kinds of debacles in <br/>the future. <br/><br/>The Toeslagenaffaire shows that the government sometimes imposes unrealistic demands on residents. Policymakers assumed that residents understood the rules for applying for benefits and had sufficient capacity to submit applications fully and correctly. However, not all parents can submit monthly forms and indicate changes in their wages in practice. Sometimes they are not even aware of the conditions. Here we see a difference between the policymakers’ expectations (the rationalistic perspective) and the capacities of the resident (the realistic perspective). Adopting a realistic policymaking perspective makes public services accessible to more residents, reducing process costs and stimulating residents’ self-sufficiency (NL: redzaamheid).<br/><br/>Within a realistic policymaking perspective, civil servants create realistic assumptions about the mental capacity of residents. This mental capacity consists of two components: the ability to understand the process (NL: denkvermogen) and the ability to act accordingly (NL: doenvermogen). When the procedures of implemented policies match these abilities, the resident will be able to follow the process. If the cognitive load of the policy exceeds the denkvermogen and doenvermogen, the resident faces more difficulties. They might require a customized process, which is costly and inefficient. Assessing the cognitive load of the context and the residents’ mental capacity supports policymakers in creating realistic assumptions about residents. <br/><br/>De ‘Erkenningsmethode’ (Eng: Acknowledgment Method) supports policymakers in creating this realistic assumption. Through empathy exercises and context assessments, stakeholders realize the different mental capacities of residents and consider the challenges they face in the policy process. Some residents might not be able to enter the process or get stuck along the way. When participants experience the challenges of certain residents, they can make an informed decisions for the innovation approach.<br/><br/>First, participants can choose to let the current process’s cognitive load and the residents’ capacity remain the same. This might be the case when resources are scarce, or not all profiles receive the same prioritization. Alternatively, the next phase can increase the mental capacity (stimulating residents) or make the process easier (less complexity and more support). Whatever option is chosen, the stakeholders should all be aware of the prioritized approach, acknowledging the consequences for the self-determination profiles.<br/><br/>This way, a more diverse image of residents can be considered when innovating public services. Understanding these residents and acknowledging their problems is the first step in creating more realistic assumptions about the mental capacity of residents.","municipality; self-sufficiency; The Hague; Empathy; doenvermogen; denkvermogen; self-determination; mental capacity","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

We find that the resulting so-called Bayesian neural network (BNN) has similar predictive strength to an Artificial neural network (ANN), with a post-year 2000 mean absolute error of 9.00 years for temperature, but over-fits less.

It is not fatal on its own but does increase the risk of heart failures and strokes. There is little understanding about the mechanisms behind the disease, so more insight is desired. Using an array of electrodes, measurements are being performed of the electrical atrial activity directly on the heart tissue. These signals are, however, not clean and suffer from far-field interference coming from the ventricles.<br/><br/>During normal sinus rhythm these atrial and ventricular activities are separated in time and easy to distinguish. In case of atrial fibrillation this is not always the case. Luckily, there is a major difference between both signals: the ventricular signal comes from far away and arrives therefore approximately simultaneously at all electrodes. A simple, but effective way to remove this ventricular activity is to use a bipolar electrode. It produces the difference between two normal unipolar electrodes, thus removing the common ventricular signal component.<br/><br/>The bipolar electrode, however, distorts the atrial signal component, which in some orientations can even lead to removing it altogether. This bipolar electrode is known as a differential beamformer from the field of array signal processing. There are more complex beamformers that can keep the atrial component undistorted and therefore produce better results than the bipolar electrode.<br/><br/>This thesis proposes a Fourier-domain signal model for all available electrodes relying on an atrial and ventricular transfer function. It is possible to estimate these transfer functions from the data blindly. Three beamformers are derived utilizing the signal model and the transfer functions. The bipolar electrode is extended to multiple electrodes like the other beamformers as well.<br/><br/>Experiments with simulated data show that the complex beamformers indeed keep the atrial activity undistorted and are still able to remove the ventricular activity effectively when using multiple electrodes, except for very complex data where the signal model is not valid. For low numbers of electrodes the beamformers are not useful, they hardly remove the ventricular activity while keeping the atrial component undistorted, where the bipolar electrode does the opposite.<br/><br/>The electrograms are also used to estimate local activation times of the cells underneath the electrodes which says something about the health of the cardiac tissue. Besides the mentioned filtering, this thesis proposes a method to estimate those moments in time by looking at the time-domain version of the atrial transfer function, called the atrial impulse response. For simple data, it performs well compared to state-of-the-art methods, but for more complicated data, it does not.","Atrial Fibrillation; Epicardial Electrogram; Bipolar Electrode; Beamforming; Transfer Function; Blind Estimation; Local Activation Time","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Signals and Systems","",""

A computer vision model developed using transfer learning and traditional image processing techniques were employed to fuse the data collected by low cost thermal and multispectral imaging sensors on the edge devices. The approach was evaluated through data collection experiments performed in Cambridge, USA. Comparison with parameters in ground truth datasets revealed several significant relationships.

Since innovations making flying in itself more sustainable are taking long to implement, a behavioural change (flying less or not at all) is<br/>necessary.<br/><br/>Recent societal developments show how people’s attitudes to flying might play a role in flying behaviour change, and how attitudes might be changing. Earlier research has established a link between people’s behaviour and attitudes. However, studies addressing changes in air travel attitudes and what causes those changes are not in abundance. Hence, this thesis empirically explores whether and how people<br/>have changed their attitudes towards air travel and to identify what factors contribute to a change in attitude.<br/><br/>This was investigated by applying a dynamic approach to the Q methodology. Three viewpoints on air travel were identified. Consequently, changes in attitudes and contributing factors to attitude change were identified. <br/><br/>This research finds that people in The Netherlands have changed their attitudes in the recent years. The attitude changes<br/>were synthesised into three main directions, namely; people expressing a more environmentally-aware view on air travel, people expressing a more independent view on air travel, and people expressing a less self-evident view on air travel. The factors contributing to the identified changes can be summarised by people knowing more, having different emotions and engaging in certain behaviour.<br/><br/>Finally, this study has made three scientific contributions. The first is an empirical contribution, as it has added to the currently scarce knowledge base on changing air travel attitudes through conducting a first exploratory and empirical study into how attitudes to flying are changing among a group of Dutch people. The second is a theoretical contribution, as this study successfully applied and therewith partly validated the model on attitude change of Van Wee et al. (2019). Third, this study has made a methodological contribution, as it incorporated a dynamic approach in the Q methodology and thereby addressed its suitability for studying attitude change. Regarding the societal relevance, this research resulted in suggestions for policies that aim at creating attitude change on a larger scale in society, which in turn could stimulate the necessary behavioural changes, i.e. people flying less.<br","Q methodology; Attitude; Air Travel; Air travel behaviour","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

Knowledge about this exact behavior has many applications, e.g., room compensation, dereverberation and sound field reconstruction. Inside enclosures, the sound field is influenced by the surroundings, such as the geometry of the enclosure and the materials used.<br/>Reconstructing a satisfying sound field in the whole enclosure by extrapolating from few measurements is thus not an obvious task. The sound field in a room can be represented by a weighted sum of room modes. Thus, we can estimate the room modes and compute the sound field from it. To estimate the room modes, compressive sensing literature uses on-the-grid, sparse reconstruction methods. However, these on-the-grid methods are known to suffer from basis mismatch. In this work, we investigate the use of a gridless framework for estimating room modes using atomic norm minimization, a gridless method. The advantage of this approach is that it does not suffer from this basis mismatch problem.<br/>We derive a bound for the sound field reconstruction problem in a one-dimensional room with rigid walls and relate this to the frequency separation that is required by the atomic norm. We conclude that for perfect reconstruction of the room modes based on the investigated gridless approach, additional<br/>prior knowledge about the signal model is required. For example, knowledge about the shape of the room modes can be used. We show how recovery is possible in a one-dimensional setting by exploiting both the structure of the sound field and the acquisition method.","atomic norm; sparse recovery; sound field reconstruction; room acoustics; frequency estimation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering","",""

(mentor); Rezaei, J. (graduation committee); Saharan, T. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Previous academic work on Portfolio Decision Analysis (PDA) have pointed at the advantage of using PDA in multi-actor situations and environmental sectors, but have also pointed at the lack of research done in such case studies. Currently there exist situations where PDA would be beneficial but current methods are not able to analyse the systems. This is because most of the PDA and MCDA methods require certain data that is often absent in real life case studies, such as reliable information on alternatives performances including synergies and the availability of time and willingness for detailed preference elicitation. Multi-actor situations make preference elicitation an even more time consuming aspect. Therefore, this thesis develops a novel methodology making PDA analysis accessible, robust and fast in decision support to multi-actor systems lacking detailed synergy and preference information. First the portfolios are created in a linear-additivity framework covering the solution space (creating thus all feasible portfolios). The methodology uses different strains of thought and concepts within the MCDA community, such as a combination of stochastic and heuristic approaches to analyse the portfolios. The stochastic techniques include Monte Carlo sampling for uncertainty propagation of the alternative performances and stochastic multicriteria acceptability analysis (SMAA) to handle attribute weight uncertainties. The heuristics applied stand within the Fast and Frugal Heuristics tradition (FFH). The studied heuristics are the Take-The-Best Heuristic and a Lexicographic heuristic to incorporate synergy information. Application results in portfolio shortlists for the involved actors. In order to analyze consensus among the actors a Core Indices (CI) approach is applied. Subsequently a Sobol sensitivity analysis is conducted on the most promising portfolios. The integration of these methods result in an overarching unconventional approach capable of informing decision makers on most promising portfolios and most important attributes. An application of this methodology is shown through application to both simulated data and a real life case study in a multi-actor case-study in India, on wastewater treatment, reuse and resource recovery. The case study encompasses multiple stakeholders in which, due to the political nature of the situation, it is difficult to obtain explicit preference. The alternatives also likely have interactions and interdependencies, affecting the portfolio set performance. The application shows that the method is able to deal with the complexities of real life case studies. For both the simulated data set as for the case study consensus on portfolios, alternatives and corresponding attributes have identified for further decision-making. Regarding the analysis of the attribute weights uncertainty the SMAA-O approach is deemed better than the Take-The-Best approach if a complete ordinal ranking of the attributes is available. Furthermore, the approach of lexicographic heuristics to deal with the lack of detailed synergy information seems promising for situations where synergy information is lacking. For the general application of the method there are, however, some limitations due to assumed linear properties, these encompass: The assumed linear additivity of the alternatives in the portfolio creation, the monotonic behaviour of the marginal value functions and the hierarchical addition aggregation value function. These form also the points where the method can be expanded upon to integrate these assumptions and corresponding uncertainties. In the future the method can be expanded upon in the open source software to make further use of the computing power able to perform stochastic analysis and to build upon the novel application of heuristics, quickly allowing PDA analysis in ever more environmental case studies.","PDA; Heuristics; Multi-criteria Decision Analysis; Decision-making; Portfolio Decision Analysis; Stakeholder Analysis; MCDA","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","Pavitra Ganga",""

(mentor); Zwijsen, K. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Due to the complicated design of nuclear reactors, many complex phenomena can cause points of failure. In the case of nuclear fuel rods, the axial flow that cools the rods can induce vibrations due to the turbulent nature of the flow. Turbulence-induced pressure fluctuations create small but significant vibration amplitudes, which in turn can cause structural effects such as material fatigue and fretting wear. For this reason, turbulence-induced vibrations have been the subject of many studies, with a recent focus on the development of computational methods, so called Fluid-Structure Interaction (FSI) simulations. While scale-resolving methods can predict pressure fluctuations directly, they are typically too expensive for industrial nuclear applications in FSI. Instead, an Unsteady Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (URANS) approach coupled with a pressure fluctuation model can be used, to reduce the computational cost. While showing promising results, this approach generally underestimated the vibration amplitudes. <br/><br/>For this reason, an improved pressure fluctuation model, called AniPFM (Anisotropic Pressure Fluctuation Model), was developed. It models velocity fluctuations based on existing methods for synthetic turbulence. In turn, these velocity fluctuations are used to obtain the pressure fluctuations. AniPFM improves the prediction of the pressure fluctuations in three ways. First, whereas previous iterations could only represent the turbulence as isotropic, in the current model anisotropic Reynolds stresses can be embodied. Second, only the scales that can be resolved on the grid are represented by the velocity fluctuations, causing a more realistic distribution of energy along the different wavelengths. Finally, time correlation is introduced based on the transport and decorrelation of turbulence.<br/><br/>From simulating decaying homogeneous isotropic turbulence, it was found that this time correlation method gives a significant improvement over previous methods. From turbulent channel flow simulations, the results show that for anisotropic turbulence, the pressure fluctuations are overestimated, but they are still within a reasonable range of 10% compared to high-resolution data. AniPFM doubles the cost of simulation, compared to a URANS simulation. Even though that is a steep increase, the cost is still much lower than scale-resolving methods. <br/><br/>Finally, the fluid-structure interaction of a brass beam in turbulent water is simulated, which showed the ability of the AniPFM to predict turbulence-induced vibrations. The AniPFM showed errors w.r.t. the replicated experiment that were in a similar range as LES calculations, while using less computational resources. The AniPFM simulations gave an error range of 15-60% w.r.t. experimental data over the full range of simulated flow velocities, whereas a previously used pressure fluctuation model underestimated the RMS amplitude by a factor of six. While further validation is ongoing, the AniPFM has demonstrated its potential for cheaper simulations of turbulence-induced vibrations in industrial nuclear applications.<br","Turbulence-induced vibration; Synthetic turbulence; Pressure fluctuation modelling; Computational fluid dynamics; Fluid-structure interaction; Nuclear reactors","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-04-25","","","","Aerospace Engineering","","52.78407386045535, 4.674002398095289"

This causes many detrimental effects for both humans and ecosystems such as eutrophication, acidification and biodiversity loss. Ammonia, which is a reactive nitrogen species is difficult to quantify because the compound is hard to observe with measurement equipment such as ground-based measurement stations and remote sensing instruments such as CrIS. Therefore, this thesis aims to improve the monitoring of surface ammonia concentrations with a machine learning technique called random forests (RF). These type of models can detect complex and non-linear relationships between variables and are frequently used in other air pollution studies. In this study, a RF model has been built to estimate the ammonia surface concentration with vertical column density (VCD) datasets, meteorological variables and land-use variables. Different combinations of VCD datasets (either modelled or CrIS VCD data) have been used to train the model and to predict the surface ammonia concentration. The result of the study is that RF models are statistically more accurate at estimating the surface ammonia concentration than the LOTOS-EUROS model when validated by ground-based measurements stations from the MAN and LML network. Especially trained RF models that have been supplied with CrIS VCD data during the prediction phase show strong performance. Moreover, when comparing the RF model that has been trained without VCD data to the ‘complete’ RF models, the complete RF models show better performance, proving the added benefit of incorporating satellite data in RF modelling. Recommendations for further research include performing similar experiments with other input variables and other machine learning algorithms, validating the performance of the RF model in different years and considering using other datasets as the ground-truth variable for RF models – such as ground-based measurement data from MAN and LML.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Industrial Ecology","",""

These can be strain gauges, inertial measurement units or surveying equipment. However, not all buildings have such sensors installed due to lack of space or the cost of the equipment. To overcome this, a spaceborne technique shows potential, namely multi-temporal interferometric synthetic aperture radar (MT-InSAR). This technique has already been applied to monitor damage to sections of buildings or large structures, for instance facades or deformations of bridges. In the context of entire buildings, the result of an MT-InSAR analysis has not yet been paired with a computational model. This is mainly due to the relatively small scale of a building and low spatial density of the displacement data.<br/><br/>This thesis integrates remote sensing data, acquiring displacements due to mining, with a computational structural finite element model of a church structure. The displacements have been interpolated using MT-InSAR data, which contains projections of nonlinear displacements in vertical and West-East directions. The interpolation has been performed using two techniques. The first is Ordinary Kriging, which is used to obtain a general insight into the deformations and the shape of the deformed region near the church. The second uses the least squares method to fit polynomial shape functions. The resulting displacements of the least squares analysis have been integrated into a nonlinear structural finite element model. The structural model consists of a soil-structure interaction model and nonlinear material properties, and is used to assess crack propagation.<br/><br/>Integrating remote sensing with computational modelling, shows potential in providing a monitoring technique for buildings. The interpolation method can be used to obtain displacements at a building, even when the spatial density of the InSAR analysis is limited. The main limitation is the information on the horizontal displacements obtained by the InSAR technique, where the displacement along the North-South is unknown. Furthermore, the structure and integration can then be performed using a finite element model, which can follow crack propagation and account for soil-structure interaction.","MT-InSAR; finite element modeling; mining deformations; church structure","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-04-25","","","","Geoscience and Remote Sensing","",""

Commonly, as for the MMS that Fugro employs to capture 3D measurements from railway surroundings, called RILA, the trajectory of these mobile systems is determined by integrating data from positioning sensors, such as GNSS and IMU. Due to their complementary characteristics, the accuracy and robustness of the navigation solution can generally be considered sufficient. Nevertheless, in certain challenging environments where GNSS positioning conditions are limited, the trajectory results attained may not yet be accurate enough. Therefore, this study presents an alternative procedure to enhance the navigation solution of this MMS, making use of the point cloud data already acquired and georeferenced. Multiple runs or passes of the mapping system over the same problematic area take place at different times and some might possess satisfactory outcomes. Hence, after employing this dataset as reference, the quality of the others could be improved by means of point cloud matching methods. Next, the computed registration values are also applied to the trajectory, accordingly. Results over the area of interest selected show that applying Iterative Closest Point (ICP) using just a few feature points can already enhance the results. ICP iteratively finds the optimal rotation and translation to match two point clouds, minimising the differences between them. Furthermore, trajectory accuracies increase with the implementation of ICP utilising all points, without leading to extra processing times. However, GNSS/INS errors are not constant throughout time and space, which means that the application of a single rigid transformation may not be adequate. For that reason, an interpolated ICP-based method has been introduced and tested. An increasing number of point cloud sections was considered and among all, the solution with a relatively high number of sections performed better. This algorithm comprised a division of the point cloud data into 1000 contiguous sections or slices along the trajectory, each approximately 60 cm wide. The RMSE of the resulting absolute trajectory error and its standard deviation were greatly improved, with their values decaying from 41.1 cm and 18.1 cm to just 4.1 cm and 2.4 cm, respectively. In addition, provided a good reference dataset is available, the method proposed can be executed completely automatically and independently of the type of data captured and environment conditions. Even though these results might not yet reach the desired accuracy of around 1 cm to correctly georeference RILA’s LiDAR data, it has been proven that this method has the potential to yield much more accurate, consistent and reliable outcomes. Further research should be directed at generating an accurate reference dataset when none is initially available, by collectively and statistically combining the results of multiple surveys.","MMS; Point Cloud; ICP; Trajectory optimisation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geoscience and Remote Sensing","","51.925736, 4.472484"

However, death is going to happen, so it is important to discuss the topic while people still can. Discussing death on a more regular basis is beneficial for all people involved. End-of-life conversations can be held to discuss wishes and decisions concerning death and dying. However young adults do not feel the urgency. They can discuss subjects in relation to the end of life. These conversations can help to reflect on life, help to learn to support each other when needed and are meaningful for all people involved. In short, it can improve the quality of life and the end of life. Therefore, it can as well be beneficial for young adults to talk about death.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to discover what can be designed in the context of Museum Tot Zover, in order to stimulate young adults to talk about death more often. The following design goal is formulated for this project: “I want young adults to feel stimulated to engage in conversations with friends about death, by fantasizing about afterlife, learning that talking and thinking about death can be enjoyable.” <br/><br/>Literature reviews and a field study have been conducted to gain background knowledge on the topic, explore the context and understand the young adults, in order to design a concept that reaches the design goal. The field study consisted of a survey filled in by young adults. In addition, interviews were conducted in order to find deeper understanding behind the results from the survey. From the field study could be concluded that young adults associate death with negative emotions as sadness, loss, insecurity and fear. They fear the impact their death has on loved ones, are worried to suffer from mental illness or experience physical pain at the end of life. Moreover, they are not ready to die just yet. They are still young and therefore do not feel the urgency to talk about death in this stage of their lives. Conversations about death are perceived as difficult and uncomfortable.<br/><br/>On the base of the study an Immersive Experience is designed which aims to create a positive association with death in order to stimulate young adult friends to talk about death. The installation is called: The Space To All Places. When entering The Space To All Places, visitors make the transition from life to death, entering the surrealistic world of the dead, where they rise above the clouds and are stimulated to fantasize and talk about their vision on an afterlife. The concept is tested with young adults, who all reacted positive on the experience. It is a positive experience that sparks interest in the topic ‘death’ and in each other. <br/><br/>This concept is designed for Death ceremonial museum Tot Zover and hopefully and incentive for other researchers and designers to help change people’s attitude towards death.","Death; Dying; Afterlife; Immersive Experience; Rich Experience","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor); Reusen, J.M. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Glacial Isostatic Adjustment (GIA) is a process which focuses on the deformations of the Earth due to changing ice sheets. It is an important study in Climate Sciences, gravimetric studies and Earth modelling. Studying GIA allows to contribute to a better understanding of the Earth’s composition, thanks to the testing of multiple Earth models, as well as a broader understanding of the Earth’s ice age cycles. In GIA research, spherical Earth models have been used for half a century. However, 3D Earth models distinguish themselves by using a 3D varying viscosity profile. The reason for this recent interest is that little is known with precision about the Earth’s mantle and deeper layers structure and that such a model was more difficult to create; the inclusion of three dimensional (3D) varying viscosity profiles have not yet been widely used in GIA studies in Greenland. Hence, to this day and to our knowledge, only two papers have made use of a laterally varying viscosity in order to study GIA in Greenland: Milne et al. (2018) and van der Wal and Xu, (2016).<br/><br/>The first novelty introduced by this Master Thesis is the use of the Olivine flow viscosity model, with a wet rheology, to study GIA in Greenland. The second main novelty in this Master Thesis, is the use of a unified ice history from 122000 years from present till 2019 in one GIA model; while using a resolution of 10 [&#x1d458;&#x1d45a;], which is an improvement, compared to for instance Milne et al. (2018), Simpson et al. (2011) or Lecavalier et al. (2014) which use resolutions ranging from 15 to 75 [&#x1d458;&#x1d45a;], which is found to still not be sufficient enough to properly model modern elastic and viscous deformation.<br/><br/>The following conclusions were made through analysing the final results. First, the simulations which use 3D viscosity models are more sensitive regionally and react, to ice load changes with larger amplitudes of solid Earth deflections in shorter time spans. Second, 3D varying viscosity models, with the same ice loads as the 1D varying viscosity models, have a pattern of deflection which is more explicitly linked to the changes in viscosity across Greenland, whereas the 1D viscosity profiles deflection rates are clearly positive in the present day on land and negative in the sea, and hence are more explicitly linked to the coastal limits of Greenland. Last, the inability of the model to properly model elastic uplifts in recent times, is made evident by the constant under estimation of total uplift rates.<br","GIA; Glacial Isostatic Adjustment; FEM","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

In parallel, fashion circularity is an increasing movement that has emerged due to the negative impact that fashion creates on the life on this planet and the planet itself. Therefore, a shift to responsible consumption and production methods (sustainable development goal 12) is necessary. To join this circularity movement, 3D printing onto textiles for fashion is required to fulfil certain requirements, including recycling. However, recycling is nowadays hindered by the lack of methods to separate the 3D printed structures from the textile at the End of Life (EoL). This graduation project researches the possibilities to achieve material separation at the EoL, so that the materials can be independently recycled and turned into new products.<br/><br/>The contribution of this research is a framework to achieve material separation that enables recycling for interfaces created by 3D printing onto textiles. This framework has three key steps, which are: developing a separation plan, selecting materials and designing the polymer-textile connection. The separation happens through heat deformation and more specifically, through increasing the temperature locally during separation. The selected materials are PLA, as the polymer, and plain-woven cotton, as the textile. The printing method used is Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM). The connection design is implemented on a product application, which is a footwear’s mid-sole bond to the upper shoe’s textile. Four interface designs are tested on separation conditions related to EoL and a scenario of usage conditions, to investigate the effect of the connection design on separation and thereafter, recycling. At the end of the research, clean material separation between polymer and textile is achieved, which is a promising achievement for reversible 3D printing onto textiles.","3D Printing onto Textiles; Circular Design; 3D Printing; Textiles; Footwear Design; Separation Technologies for End of Life; End of Life; Circular Fashion; Circular Textiles","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

This can result in improving the traditional designs of those medical devices, and consequently leading to increasing the patient’s comfort and quality of life. By doing measurements directly on or inside the patient, information can be gathered more specifically, which is important for improving detection and diagnosis. Next to that, it enables better decision-making for therapies, treatments and the allocation of prosthesis, causing improved rehabilitation. Problems with the comfort and fitting of the prosthesis can have a big impact on the life of the patient wearing the prosthetic. If there is lack of comfort, the patient is less likely to wear the device and that could limit the rehabilitation and satisfaction about their life in multiple areas. To get a better insight in the transtibial prosthesis in particular, and possibly solve the problems that occur, measurements can be done at the interface of the patient and the socket of this prosthesis. The data can be used to visualize the problem more accurately and, as a result, the response and treatment process can be chosen in a more precise manner. First, a case study about the lower limb prosthesis was conducted. Several questions will be reviewed, including defining elements of the satisfaction of patients about their prosthesis, what current existing problems with prosthesis are and the reasons of patients why they are not satisfied with their prosthesis. Then, two types of sensors will be used to visualise the problems occurring at the interface of the socket and the residual limb. One type of sensor is the piezoelectric pressure sensor. It is used to map the pressure on the limb inside the socket. Several experiments have been done with an existing 3D printed socket design and the data is compared to a finite element model that predicts stress distributions to validate this model. The model itself was changed on multiple areas to get closer to test conditions and improve model outputs. To be able to improve such models, the test-procedure should be further revised. After that, thermistors were used to measure the temperature within a 3D printed socket. A design for a new socket has been made to actively use the temperature data and cool the residual limb inside the socket when needed. This is done by integrating air-channels within the structure of the 3D printed socket and air is forced through those channels with a power-fan. The design has been validated with several tests and it is improved based on that. Those tests, calculations and estimations have shown that the current design may be able to cool the residual limb when further improved and optimized. In the end, several suggestions and recommendations for improvements were provided. Some of those improvements could be made in the size of the air-channels and the interface between socket and residual limb. Finally, present and potential (ongoing) developments on how to change the patient's condition, as well as how to apply promising developments in innovative ways, will be addressed.","Transtibial; Socket; Sensor implementation; Thermistor; Pressure Sensor; Cooling; Cooling channels; FEM; Smart; Active Cooling; Data-based; 3D Printed","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2027-04-22","","","","Biomedical Engineering | Biomaterials and Tissue Biomechanics","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","In developing countries, dependency on the agricultural sector, especially represented by smallholder farmers, is high. Approximately 90% of food in Africa is produced by smallholders.<br/>Smallholder farmers are defined as farmers cultivating less than 2 ha. They often run their business relying on traditional farming methods, making limited use of agricultural inputs. In addition, only a small share of smallholder farmers sells part of their produce, whilst the rest only farms for self-sustenance. Many initiatives in past and present times are aimed at increasing the productivity of smallholder farmers, some supplying agricultural inputs, others focusing on the distribution of knowledge.<br/><br/>In this research, one of these initiatives was reviewed, namely the Farm Incubator Model as implemented by aQysta. The goal of this commercially-oriented Farm Incubator Model, based in Malawi, is to enlist smallholder farmers and supply them with seeds for cash crops such as garlic, fertiliser, a hydro-powered pump for irrigation and pesticides. This is combined with regular coaching sessions, to familiarise the farmers with the novel technologies and agricultural inputs they are supplied with. The ultimate aim of the model is to enable smallholder farmers to make the transition towards commercial farming. In this study, a threefold approach was used to review this model, which at the time this study was conducted was still in its pilot phase. First of all, interviews were conducted with extension officers tasked with implementing the model and with aQysta office staff members. These were aimed at the exploration of the functioning of the model, the assessment of the way in which the model assists participating farmers. In addition, other participatory learning initiatives were reviewed and compared with the Farm Incubator Model. Also, a quantitative analysis was performed, using<br/>remote sensing data, to analyse the impact of the model. Secondly, an analysis of variance was performed on the fourth Integrated Household Survey, a survey containing over 25,000 entries, focusing amongst others on agriculture in Malawi. The focus of this analysis was to identify whether the smallholder challenges addressed by the Farm Incubator Model are widely recognised. Furthermore, by quantifying them, the severity of these challenges was assessed. Lastly, a literature review focusing on smallholder challenges in Sub-Saharan Africa was conducted, to explore the extent to which the previously found challenges for smallholder farming are recognised in a broader scope. Furthermore, it was reviewed whether the way in which the model is implemented is the best way to reach the goal of commercialising smallholder farmers. It was found that the Farm Incubator Model addresses smallholder farmer challenges accurately and therefore is a very promising way to help smallholder farmers. However, findings suggested that for farmers to be commercial, being independent is imperative. In case of farm incubators, where all inputs are acquired for the participants, this independence can be at stake. For aQysta's Farm Incubator Model this could pose a future challenge.<br","Smallholders; Irrigation; Sub-Saharan Africa; Barsha-pump; Energy-neutral","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Water Management","",""

This research proposes a distributed surveillance model in which a UAV swarm autonomously coordinates continuous surveillance in a dynamic environment. The adaptive behaviour of poachers has the potential to negatively affect surveillance performance and is therefore taken into consideration through the proposed ACOSG model. The novelties of this research are twofold. A mission selection algorithm is proposed that addresses the deficiencies of the existing HAPF-ACO model while improving on surveillance effectiveness. Bayesian learning is applied to dynamically prioritise surveillance efforts of the proposed HAPF-BLACOPS model. Additionally, the learning rate of both poachers and UAVs is analysed to determine whether surveillance remains effective in response to adaptive poacher behaviour. Simulation results show that the proposed model significantly outperforms the current stateof-the-art HAPF-ACO model. Prioritisation of surveillance efforts is achieved through the use of (A)BNs, such that coverage of the target area is reduced by 30%, while maintaining the surveillance effectiveness of the current state-of-the-art. It is found that the interactions between the APF and ACO modules limit the extent to which the (A)BNs’ predictions influence the UAVs’ spatiotemporal patterns and therefore limit the effects of prioritisation on surveillance performance as well. The adaptive capabilities of the poachers and the learning rate of the UAV swarm do not significantly affect surveillance performance and the loss of wildlife, due to a limited amount of newly gained experience. Future research opportunities are identified that can improve the influence of the (A)BN on surveillance performance and prioritisation.","swarm intelligence; ant colony optimisation; artificial potential fields; bayesian learning; bayesian networks; surveillance; distributed surveillance; UAV; drone; poaching; continuous surveillance; adaptive behaviour; online learning; online path planning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

The analytical and experimental assessment both show the lateral-directional handling qualities of the Flying-V to be insufficient for requirement compliance, due to a lack of pitch, roll and yaw control authority in low-speed flight conditions and an insufficiently stable Dutch Roll eigenmode. The prototype flight control system, consisting of an adapted control allocation and a stability augmentation system, showed both analytically as experimentally to improve the control authority, stability, and handling qualities of the Flying-V. While the effect on the lateral-directional stability was sufficient for stability requirement compliance, the control authority was not sufficiently increased for manoeuvrability requirement compliance. Thus, a challenge remains to improve the handling qualities of the Flying-V. An approximation of the control authority required for full requirement compliance in the flight conditions tested showed a control authority increase of over a factor four to be required for future control surface design.","Handling Qualities; Flying-V; Piloted Experiment; lateral-directional stability and control; lateral-directional; SIMONA","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-04-21","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Flying-V",""

(mentor); Keijzer, T. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Due to the increase in traffic, road congestion has gone up. Vehicle platooning is a possible way to increase the capacity of a given road, by decreasing the distance between the vehicles in the platoon. At the moment, the control of vehicle platoons is commonly done using PDD controllers. The advantage of this is that it requires little computational resources. With improvements in computing technology in recent years, the possibility of using a more computationally costly method has opened up. MPC is such a method, with a couple of important advantages for vehicle platooning. Firstly it is (finite-time) optimal so should lead to smaller deviations from the desired trajectory, thereby decreasing the minimum safe distance between the vehicles. Secondly, it is inherently able to include constraints on the behaviour of the platoon. This is important because it allows for explicitly enforcing the minimum safe distance between the vehicles, thereby preventing collisions.<br/>While many studies have looked into the possibility of using MPC for vehicle platooning before. None of them have made the direct comparison with the current standard e.i. PDD control in a practical setup. This is important as it will give a good indication of both the possible advantages and pitfalls MPC could have in real platoons. To investigate this both a PDD and MPC controller are implemented on a platoon of RC-vehicles and their performance is compared.<br/>To compare the performance five metrics are used on four scenarios. The metrics used are coherence, combined local error, velocity error, energy expenditure and minimum headway. The scenarios are a step up, step down, ramp up and a ramp down.<br/><br/>From the simulation results, it is clear that in an idealised case the MPC outperforms the PDD controller. However, when looking at the lab results this difference is less pronounced. In the lab setting, it is also clear that both controllers struggle to reliably deal with the added uncertainties caused by measurement noise and inconsistent behaviour of the vehicles.<br/>In future research more emphasis should be placed on the robustness of the controllers used, to mitigate these problems.","model predictive ontrol; Platooning; PID control","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

(mentor); Gielen, M.A. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Since 1975, obesity has nearly tripled globally, indicating a clear trend that threatens public health. Besides changing one’s diet, the illness can be prevented by performing sufficient physical activity. In the Netherlands however, currently only 20% of the children of 11 years old meet the World Health Organisation guidelines for physical activity (Volksgezondheidenzorg.info, 2020). This is worrisome, since habits of sedentary behaviour often stick with a person from youth to adulthood (Hirvensalo &amp; Lintunen, 2018). (World Health Organisation, 2021) <br/><br/>The section Child and Adolescent Public Health Research &amp; Innovation (CAPHRI) of the Amsterdam University Medical Centre commissioned this project to address the lack of physical activity of children in Amsterdam. This project specifically targets the Dapperplein, as the section identified an interesting opportunity space here: During the day it is occupied by its daily market, but in the evening, when the market is cleared, an open space is revealed. This project aims to find ways to use that open space, and design something that stimulates children’s physical activity at the Dapperplein, after market hours. <br/><br/>In order to do so, children living near the Dapperplein were engaged in co-creation. Co-creation with children has the potential to create a design that fits the users’ (children’s) needs, because it creates understanding of their context for the designer (me), via close involvement and collaboration of the user and designer in the design process. The children act as co-designers. During workshops with these children, as well as expert interviews, observations and a literature study the context of the Dapperplein was explored and problems were revealed. As the project discovered, the children (and their parents) do not consider the Dapperplein to be safe during the evening. This is due to people hanging out and drinking at the square, as well as traffic that crosses at speed. Additionally, a lack of hygiene because of market leftovers is identified. Lastly, there are few stimuli present for children to play. <br/><br/>To address these problems, the design of “De Klimkramen’’ was created. It proposes to place playing equipment at the Dapperplein that during the day, with addition of an awning and board, functions as market stalls. This creates a safe playing area, as it forms a physical barrier for traffic, and since it is inviting towards residents, more people will be there to keep an eye out. A sense of community is fostered as it is used in harmony with the market and forms an iconic view for the Dapperplein. <br/><br/>During an evaluation, the design was well received by representatives of the market, police and fire brigade, although adjustments are needed to ensure a better fit with the needs of the market vendors, and to avoid creating a new spot for people to hang out and consume alcohol.<br/><br/>Besides contributing to the section CAPHRI and to involved stakeholders with the design of “De Klimkramen”, this project contributes to the design field with a reflection on the application of co-creation with children, and practical tips for those who (will) apply the method.","Co-creation with children; Physical activity; Playing outside; Amsterdam","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","","52.362180, 4.927790"

The goal of this thesis is to develop an algorithm that provides good solutions to this problem within 30 minutes.<br/><br/>This thesis presents three solution methods to solve this problem. The first is an Adaptive Large Neighbourhood Search (ALNS) algorithm closely related to earlier research. We propose a mechanism with only linear time additional complexity to impose the resource constraint.

For the second method, dubbed ALNS+LS, we extend the ALNS with local search heuristics to enhance its performance. As a third method, we propose a matheuristic novel to this specific problem class. This consists of the ALNS+LS algorithm applied to the problem without resource constraints in the first phase, and imposing the constraints using a Constraint Programming model in the second phase. We show that the ALNS+LS outperforms the other two algorithms on a real-life-inspired benchmark set, and that the matheuristic comes close to the ALNS+LS for small instances. We finally show that the full problem is best solved by decomposing it into four parts and solving these separately.","Vehicle routing; Resource constraints; ALNS; Local search; Matheuristics; Picnic Technologies","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science","",""

The first-order hydrolysis rate was shown to function well for most easily degradable sludges and soluble substrates. This description for substrate hydrolysis in the context of anaerobic digestion has the benefit of being very simple and therefore applicable for many engineering applications where little data is available. On the other hand, in the last decades many studies reported that the first-order hydrolysis would need a modification to better describe the degradation of difficulty degradable solids. Guo et al. (2021) developed a cascade system for anaerobic digestion of WAS that does not seem to follow first-order hydrolysis kinetics when lowering the applied SRTs from 22 to 15 and 12 days, respectively. Based on observations by Guo et al. (2021) and a statistical analysis of the cascade system performed in the study at hand it seems that the first order hydrolysis rate constant is in fact a coefficient and that the first-order hydrolysis rate is not solely dependent on sludge characteristics and substrate concentrations. This hypothesis is tested in the thesis at hand. In Guo et al.’s study the cascade system was always compared to a reference system. To test this hypothesis and understand the kinetics of the cascade system in more detail a statistical analysis was performed for both systems from which an empirical hydrolysis model was derived. This model was implemented in ADM1 to replace the existing hydrolysis rate expression and was tested for the mentioned cascade system and the reference system. The empirical model was compared to the results of the standard ADM1 which uses a first-order hydrolysis expression. The empirical model assumed a dependency of the hydrolysis rate based on load and residence time along the cascade system to achieve a change in hydrolysis rate coefficients along the cascade system. The models were compared based on visual inspection and quantitative analysis of the simulated results. Both models showed low R² values which is likely due to the high level of detail implemented in ADM1 that does not fit to the resolution of the experimental data. However, calculated RMSE values agreed with the standard deviations of the experimental results. Therefore, the overall predictive capability for both models is given. The ADM1 managed to model the reference system with reasonable agreement to the experimental data. The performance of the empirical model for the reference was comparable. For the cascade system however the ADM1 could not fully describe the experimental at the applied low SRTs of 15 and 12 days. The empirical model in this case showed better predictive capabilities. This is an indication that a hydrolysis rate which is made dependent on system characteristics such as load and residence time might indeed have its justification and be better applicable to anaerobic digestion systems that show a concentration profile along the reactor as it is in the case with plug-flow and cascade systems.","anaerobic digestion; cascade system; hydrolysis; mathematical modelling; waste flocculent activated sludge (WAS)","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Environmental Engineering","",""

(mentor); Jovanova, J. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","DEEP brain stimulation is currently the only technique used in the clinical setting, capable of stimulating the deep brain nuclei. Recently, low intensity focused ultrasound has been shown to reversibly modulate brain activity. At present, ultrasound neuromodulation is performed through the transcranial pathway. This requires the ultrasound waves to pass through the skull, thus attenuating the ultrasound waves. To reduce the effect of attenuation, lower frequencies are used of around 0.5 MHz, however, with decreasing frequency the focal region in which the stimulation occurs also increases. Therefore, a stent with an array of ultrasound transducers operating at high frequencies of around 5 MHz has been proposed to bypass the skull, thus significantly<br/>reducing the attenuation. Moreover, such a device would require a minimally invasive procedure removing the need for open brain surgery as currently performed for deep brain stimulation. This research was performed to evaluate the feasibility of using ultrasound arrays within the brain vasculature to stimulate deep brain nuclei using the finite elementmethod.<br/><br/>Initially, a literature review was conducted to identify the optimal ultrasound parameters for achieving neuromodulation. For stimulation, a PRF ranging from 500 to 1500 Hz and a DC of around 50 to 70% were found to be optimal. Whereas for suppression, a PRF of&lt;100 Hz and a DC of around &gt;=10% were found to be ideal. The intensity for both suppression and stimulation was found to greatly depends on the target region and individual as well as anaesthesia for stimulation, nonetheless, for 5 MHz an intensity of around 1W/cm2 was required to achieve neural excitation.<br/><br/>Next, the brain nuclei were studied and the subthalamic nucleus, ventral intermediate nucleus and globus pallidus internus were identified to be the most commonly targeted nuclei for deep brain stimulation. Brain vasculature was then examined in terms of the blood vessel inner diameter, shape, orientation with respect to the nuclei and the distance to the nuclei. Basal vein of Rosenthal, internal cerebral vein and internal carotid arterywere found to be most suitable to target the subthalamic nucleus, ventral intermediate nucleus and globus pallidus internus respectively.<br/><br/>Afterwards, two-dimensional simulationswere performed usingCOMSOLMultiphysics to identify the minimum required array width and length for stimulating each nucleus from its respective blood vessel. However, when compared to 3D counterparts it was found that 2D significantly overestimated the size of the focal region. <br/><br/>Finally, 3D simulations of 100 x 100 x 262 ¹m transducers in a 104 (2D 26 x 4) and 105 (Checkered [3 x 2] x 21) arrays within the BVR were analysed targeting the STN. These arrays were found to produce a focal region of full width half intensity within the subthalamic nucleus model boundaries while reaching intensities and pressures of 0.558 W/cm2 or 0.140 MPa and 0.311 W/cm2 or 0.101 MPa with a 1 V terminal for 2D and checkered array respectively. Therefore, these arrays are capable of reaching the neural excitation threshold of 1 W/cm2 with terminal input of less than 2 V . Additionally, a maximum input of 9.2 V is required to reach 1 MPa pressure threshold that has been reported by other studies. Nonetheless, these values do not take into account the fully unused length of the stents, as the arrays can be designed to be longer. In conclusion, finite element method result are promising for deep brain stimulation via a vascular stent with ultrasound transducers for high-spatial neuromodulation. Nonetheless, further work is required to develop an initial prototype as well as initially test the prototype and array within a phantom.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

Absence of functional dystrophin in muscles is believed to cause membrane instability, making the sarcolemma susceptible to damage when subjected to mechanical stress. However, the process leading from dystrophin-absence to muscle degeneration, and ultimately fat replacement, is still not well understood. Therefore, several hypotheses currently co-exist. Interestingly, muscles of DMD patients are not equally affected, and a more or less consistent successive pattern of muscle fat replacement exists in the lower extremities. The aim of this study was to investigate a possible mechanical role in explaining differential muscle fat replacement in the legs of DMD patients. Based on a published preliminary study, it was hypothesized that eccentric contraction, during which a muscle generates force while lengthening, is associated to muscle fat replacement during gait.<br/><br/>3D gait analysis data of a small cross-sectional sample of typically developing children was used to predict muscle contributions during gait in OpenSim. In one analysis, negative work, the time-integral of force multiplied by lengthening velocity, was normalized to account for differences in physiological cross-sectional area (PCSA) and fiber length, and was subsequently tested for a relation with muscle fat replacement. Furthermore, since muscle architecture parameters PCSA and fiber length are associated to muscle fat replacement, separate effects of total negative work and muscle volume (PCSA*fiber length) on muscle fat replacement were also analyzed.<br/><br/>Normalized negative work was significantly associated with muscle fat replacement, where upper leg muscles generally showed higher fat fractions than lower leg muscles. Furthermore, both the effect of total negative work as well as muscle volume on muscle fat replacement were significant. The effect of total negative work on muscle fat replacement was stronger if muscle volume was smaller. In contrast, normalized and total positive work (i.e., concentric contraction) was not significantly associated with muscle fat replacement.<br/><br/>Eccentric contraction during gait helps explain the differential progression of muscle fat replacement seen among leg muscles of DMD patients. The results of this study generate more insight regarding a mechanical role in the pathophysiology of DMD, and may potentially help in generating or improving therapies that focus on prolonged muscle function preservation.<br","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Wind turbines are decommissioned when they reach their endoflife. The reason for reaching endoflife varies per wind turbine, but they all have in common that the wind turbine blades can not be recycled and thus end up as waste. Since a growing amount of wind turbines will reach their endoflife the coming decade, the waste problem will increase. To solve or limit this problem, the lifetime of a blade can be extended, or a sustainable endoflife treatment can be established. This is currently not available yet. This research focuses on repurposing wind turbine blades. The objective is not to find one application, but rather to propose a method that enables large scale processing of wind turbine blades, for applications in the construction industry. Since to date it is uncommon to repurpose wind turbine blades, Two processes are proposed to give guidance on how to repurpose wind turbine blades. The first process is meant to repurpose as many blades as possible, by sawing the blade in plates and beams that can be applied to construction projects. The second process gives guidance to a project team that wants to incorporate wind turbine blades in their construction project, which can raise awareness for the waste problem. Both processess are supported by a grasshopper script. This script enables the user to either find an efficient mapping of elements that can be extracted from the blade, or gives design freedom depending on the aim of the repurpose project. The first process is further worked out. A geometry model of an actual wind turbine blade is analyzed and categorized in panels with a homogeneous material layup. On this panels, a nesting pattern of plates and beams, as commonly used in the construction industry, is projected which can later be sawn into relative flat plates and beams. With this, almost half of the blade panels can be turned into useful construction elements. The cross section of a blade consists of various functions, and thus various material structures. Three categories are distinguished: Spar caps, shell panels and the shear web. For each of these categories, the material layup and properties are analysed, which has led to an advice on possible applications. Spar caps are strong, stiff and have a homogeneous cross section. They can be repurposed as structural beams. Shell panels are light and stiff and can be repurposed as partition walls, formwork or flooring. The shear web is light, stiff, and entails good insulation properties. This can be repurposed as building cladding. Although this research does not contain sample tests, the material properties of the blade are provided and are of significant value, despite their 27 years of service.","wind turbine blades; grasshopper; repurpose; recycled CFRP; GFRP","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Building Engineering","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","In this thesis a method of combined PIV and LIF experiments on the Turbulent/Non-Turbulent interface (TNTI) of a round jet is presented.<br/>By varying the distance from the nozzle in the measurements, the Kolmogorov scale of a large range of Reynolds number (2×10<sup>3</sup> ≤ Re ≤ 48×10<sup>3</sup>) is kept constant, allowing for a constant resolution. The large range in Reynolds number is needed to identify a difference in scaling of the TNTI, which is difficult to capture due to the weak dependency of the separation of Kolmogorov and Taylor scales on the Reynolds number (λ/η ∼ Re<sup>1/4</sup>). A factor of over 2.5 is achieved in the current work. <br/>An experimental setup for these measurements is presented, as well as the design of experiments for seven Reynolds numbers based on the boundary and initial conditions of the setup. A design for measurements with a camera moving with the flow is presented as well.<br/>Conditional statistics are used on the jet to look at the change of span-wise vorticity over the interface. For the detection of the interface scalar images from LIF are used, where the interface is detected using a threshold of dye concentration (Rhodamine B). <br/>All Reynolds numbers show self-similarity within the measured range, comparable to literature and with a spatial resolution better than 4η. Some small differences between the low and high Reynolds number measurements can be seen. They are not expected to have significant impact on the results and can likely be solved by slight changes in the experimental setup.<br/>The influence of the threshold on the shape and width measurements of the mean conditional vorticity profile is examined, indicating a significant dependency on chosen threshold. Current results indicate a scaling of the interface thickness with the Taylor length scale, around a value of 0.5-0.6λ, or 10-15η This is in accordance to the literature for low Reynolds numbers. Due to this significant influence of the threshold on the outcome, these results cannot be seen conclusive. For this, further investigation is needed on the dependency of the width on the threshold, and validation of the jet contour.<br/>Universal ways to compute the threshold, jet contour and mean conditional vorticity profiles are currently missing, while they have shown to be potentially of significance on the outcome. Another method of studying TNTI scaling is via the local velocity scales, which can be found via current data, which could provide a comparison of methods. The measurements with the moving camera could help identifying the link between physical processes and the scaling of the interface.","Fluid dynamics; Turbulence; Experimental; PIV","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Energy, Flow and Process Technology","",""

The main contributing factor to this accomplishment is its small wetted area relative to the available volume. Three family variants carrying different numbers of passengers are designed simultaneously. The airplane has elevons and rudders serving as control surfaces for trim and maneuvering. The Flying-V has been optimized for aerodynamic efficiency in previous research, but stability and control constraints have not yet been considered in detail. To find the effect of stability and control on the design variables and performance, an aerodynamic solver, mass distribution model, and control authority simulation have been established. The mass distribution model can be used to find the center of gravity and moment of inertia in any loading scenario. A strategy for fuel distribution for minimum CGtravel is proposed. An optimization is performed using SciPy optimization tools. Planformgeometry is used as the design vector. The design constraints include geometric contraints like maximum span and fuel capacity, and stability and control constraints like control authority for pitch, roll, and yaw maneuvers and static stability. The results of the optimization have shown that the stability and control constraints can be satisfied without a large fuel burn penalty (less than one percent) and stability and control constraints are not driving as long as the fins are large enough to accommodate rudders that provide sufficient directional control power. An optimized design that meets all requirements has a shorter outer wing, shorter fuselage, longer fins, and smaller outer wing sweep compared to the initial design. For the three optimized aircraft, the acceptable range of center of gravity is bounded by longitudinal stability and control requirements. The distribution of passenger and cargo weight in combination with the active fuel distribution system should be such that the CG during flight stays within these bounds. This is shown to be the case for the design payload configuration.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

They would like to see more families visiting the museum. <br/>Their vision is ‘Getting closer to art’, meaning they wish to offer visitors a personal connection with art. <br/><br/>The personal art experience is anything someone thinks, feels or perceives about art that is unique to that person. It is interesting to help families explore and discuss this experience, because children might have trouble identifying them and have trouble putting them into words. In turn, adults might underestimate their children and never try, or they don’t know how to talk about it.<br/>By discussing the experience, you can not only learn about art, but more about yourself and your family members as well. <br/><br/>To have a shared experience that successfully enhanced the personal experience, it is important that all family members are equally engaged. During this project, I identified four design principles of creating engagement in museums and four ways towards enhancing the personal art experience.<br/><br/>The four ways to engagement are:<br/>- Role-play and autonomy<br/>- Anticipation and reward<br/>- Appropriate novelty and challenge<br/>- Facilitation of varied energy levels<br/><br/>The four ways to enhancing the personal experience are:<br/>- Pushing and challenging behaviour<br/>- Novelty and weirdness<br/>- Asking the right questions<br/>- Relatability to one’s own life<br/><br/>The final product consists of six role-booklets that each use different questions and exercises to explore and discuss the personal art experience.

The wayfinding boards helps with choosing an artwork to explore and discuss with your family. The family is still in charge of choosing their own artworks, but they are challenged to choose art they might otherwise not. It also makes for variation in activities during the interaction.<br/>With this game, families are able to direct their own visit, but be supported in their journey toward a more personal experience.","Personal experience; Family; Museum experience; Engagement; Shared experience; Art museum","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

In this work, we attempt to leverage spatial priors<br/>to boost contrastive learning for segmentation on urban scenes, where self-supervised depth estimation is readily available. We argue that the semantics of a pixel can be determined by its adjacent pixels in 3D space without looking at other irrelevant pixels. Based on this concept, we group the pixels based on 3D adjacency and perform copypaste to build cross-context correspondence. We optimize our model to retrieve this challenging correspondence in a contrastive learning manner.

An alternative dataset can be found in the form of optical satellite data, which has become increasingly more suitable due to better spatial resolution and revisit times. For this study the optical satellite data from Superview is combined with the LiDAR elevation data set AHN on a 1-meter raster. With this data available, the goal is to classify vegetation into three different classes: sand, grass and trees. And do this for multiple epochs to analyze class transition patterns. Three classification methods were compared: nearest centroid, random forest and neural network. These methods were tested on 11 epochs on the Meijendel en Berkheide dunal area on the Dutch coast. Both neural network and random forest seemed in good agreement with the aerial imagery data set. Where neural network was faster to process, the random forest produced a more stable result. All the methods are also able to output probabilities, which are used to classify mixed class pixels. The location of these mixed class pixels agree with the transition process that are expected between the classes.

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Sensitivity analysis and uncertainty quantification of nuclear reactors requires many expensive high-fidelity simulations. To approximate the dynamics of such a time and parameter dependent system efficiently and effectively, reduced order modelling (ROM) is used. In previous research, a ROM was constructed which used a combination of proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) and a locally adaptive sampling strategy based on sparse grids. To improve the representation of the physics in local parts of the parameter domain, in this thesis, the previous ROM is altered to use multiple local bases instead of one fixed global basis covering the entire parameter domain.<br/><br/>The spatially dependent local bases and local time dependent coefficients are interpolated separately in the parameter domain using the method of interpolation on a tangent space to the Grassmann manifold (ITSGM). The separate interpolators of the local bases and local coefficients are coupled in a space-time coupled approach. The algorithm based on sparse grids is modified so that it can adaptively draw new tangent planes in the parameter domain in a hierarchical manner. This results in the domain being split up into into smaller overlapping subdomains, each having their own tangent plane, number of basis vectors, and interpolators that use radial basis functions (RBF). The algorithm was tested on the Burgers Equation and the Molenkamp test which have an analytical solution. Then, the algorithm was tested on a numerically solved 2D neutron diffusion problem. First the parametric dependence of the modes and coefficients was analyzed, after which the performance of the algorithm was evaluated on these models via different experiments.<br/><br/>The results of the experiments on the 1D Burgers equation and the 2D neutron diffusion problem showed that the algorithm can adaptively and hierarchically draw new tangent planes and can accurately interpolate to new unknown solutions in the subdomains in both a 1D and 2D parameter setting. Higher order non-linear modes and coefficients are harder to interpolate than lower order modes and coefficients. The performance of the interpolator also depends on a combination of the chosen RBF and the size of the subdomains. The results from the Molenkamp test showed that in the smooth setting the new algorithm achieved a higher error with a higher number of evaluations, while in the steep setting the new algorithm performed on par with the previous algorithm, only if the interpolation accuracy threshold is set lower. The results from the neutron<br/>diffusion problem indicate that the first principal angle can act as an indicator of which parts of the parameter domain contain more relatable physics than other parts of the domain.<br/><br/>The dependence of RBF interpolator on the subdomain size is caused by how the RBF values scale for further distanced points from the point of interpolation interest. Also more higher order modes than necessary can be included in the local basis interpolation method without worsening the interpolation accuracy of lower order modes, given that no numerical noise is present in the local bases or coefficients. Interpolating the time-dependent behaviour can be easier in the<br/>space-time coupled approach than in the approach based on the global basis. However, a lower interpolation accuracy threshold should be chosen as full time evolutions are being interpolated instead of single state vectors. The current interpolation method scales worse than the previous algorithm, as the corner points of the parameter domain will always have to be sampled when using the RBF interpolator compared to local linear basis functions. Additionally, far more data is needed to represent this ROM compared to the ROM based on the global basis.<br/><br/>This research presented a method that generalizes reduced order modelling of time and parameter dependent problems on sparse grids, by using multiple local bases instead of a fixed global basis to represent the underlying physics of a model. The novel local basis interpolation scheme was competitive with the global basis approach on test problems, showing that manifold methods<br/>such as ITSGM have great potential to be utilized in reduced order models. However, more research on matrix interpolation methods is needed to improve the overall performance, scalability and efficiency of the algorithm.<br","reduced order modelling; Time and parameter dependent; locally adaptive sparse grids; local basis interpolation; Grassmann manifold; nonintrusive","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Sciences","",""

(mentor); Gaudard, Joseph (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Litter decomposition in soils is a microbial process linked to soil respiration, affected by soil composition as well as environmental factors such as temperature and moisture. For alpine areas in particular, these stand to vary significantly with climate change. To characterize the impacts of these projected changes on the carbon fluxes and carbon cycling in the environment, this study uses turf transplants along an altitudinal gradient in Western Norway. Warming is simulated for alpine and subalpine soils. Because the soils differ in composition, this enables the quantification of the influence of soil composition on soil litter decomposition and respiration. Decomposition is quantified using the standard Tea Bag Index (TBI) where the mass loss of buried rooibos and green tea bags over an extended period is used to model the labile and recalcitrant fraction of litter in the soil. Respiration CO2 fluxes are quantified from concentration measurements in an infrared gas analyzer (IRGA, LI-84A, LICOR) across a prescribed period and bare soil area. Results from this study show that simultaneous optimal soil moisture and temperature conditions maximize soil respiration and litter decomposition rates. These optimal ranges are 15-35% for soil moisture and the maximum measured 22 oC for temperature. However, the impacts of the conditions individually are more complex: soil moisture is positively correlated with soil respiration, while the correlation with temperature is inconclusive. Decomposition rates and stabilization factors for the Liahovden, the alpine site, consistently exceed those for Joasete, the sub-alpine site, which contains less soil organic matter (SOM) and carbon. With warming, Joasete exhibits opposing behavior to that of Liahovden: reduced decomposition rates and litter stabilization. These findings suggest that the availability of nutrients due to soil moisture and the soil composition itself are the most important factors determining the carbon emissions and cycling in the soil. Nevertheless, under coupled optimal conditions (warmer climate with soil moisture at approximately 35%), there is a clear maximum in flux. The complexity of the interrelations of soil moisture and temperature for different soil types supports further research on the topic, with more replicates and soil moisture content variation plot by plot.","","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Geoscience and Remote Sensing","",""

This thesis examines the front end components and thus initially focuses on resolving the issues in the front end. Although bandwidth enlargement is possible, the APF limits the performance resulting in an inefficient two-stage architecture. For optimal system efficiency, the APF requirements must be relaxed, which is achieved by decreasing the amount of resolved bits in the coarse ADC. Due to this reduction in bits, more stages must be incorporated into the architecture. To facilitate this, power and error budgets are devised to visualize the effects of adding stages. Hereafter, the 2 bit coarse ADC is compared to a 3 bit coarse ADC. This results in a trade-off<br/>between the applicable gain (APF complexity) and the noise requirements of the front end.<br/>The five-stage (2-2-2-2-6 bit) architecture proves to be the most promising design to achieve the desired FoMs of 172dB.

Switching from natural gas to hydrogen presents plenty of unknown factors which must be properly evaluated for an accurate and realistic risk picture, including the danger of running out of hydrogen. The objective of this study is to examine the security of a 100% hydrogen supply in city buildings. For this MSc thesis, the security of supply is defined as a reliable and uninterrupted supply of hydrogen for heating purposes. We explore the security of supply by evaluating the risk to it.<br/><br/>To achieve this goal, we construct a hydrogen supply system using Stedin's criteria. The Classical Model for Structured Expert Judgement and the Bayesian Network are the two mathematical techniques we use to evaluate the risks. The lack of acceptable data makes the task of quantifying the risk to supply much more difficult in this regard. Expert opinion remains the sole trustworthy source of information in these conditions for quantifying uncertainty. However, expert opinion should be validated using objective performance measures. As a result, we adopt the Classical Model for Structured Expert Judgement. The resulting uncertainty distributions of the Structured Expert Judgement research are then integrated into a Bayesian Network that models the uncertainty within the hydrogen supply system. Bayesian Networks are an effective tool for visualizing a domain's probabilistic model, examining all random variable interactions, and inferring probability for scenarios based on available data.\\<br/><br/>The findings of Structured Expert Judgment reveal that there will be a forecast of 114 minutes of not enough hydrogen in the buildings of Stad aan 't Haringvliet in the first year of realizing Stedin's pilot, given the event that there will be a lack of hydrogen in Stad aan `t Haringvliet. Moreover, the security of supply is expected to not be achieved with an estimated probability of 0.06839 for the first year of realizing this pilot. Furthermore, failure rates for each component of the hydrogen supply system have also been quantified using the Classical Model, and one or more mitigations have been proposed for each component. Quantifying the Bayesian Network with the distributions for each component of the hydrogen supply system that resulted from the expert judgment study, yields distinct results than experts' aggregated distributions on the estimated probability and the duration of not meeting the energy demand. The results show that the best-estimated probability for not having enough hydrogen in the buildings equals 0.2067 and when we consider the event of having a lack of hydrogen in the buildings, the best estimated time for how long this will last equals 3.135 minutes in the first year of realizing Stedin's pilot.<br","Bayesian Network; Structured Expert Judgement; Classical Model; Hydrogen","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics","",""

One patient explained this feeling as entering the in-between-land, the transition period from ending curative care and entering the end-of-life care. This in-between-land feels like entering an unknown land where you do not know the way and do not speak the language. Hospice Bardo expressed an interest in supporting these patients using the technology Virtual Reality. Therefore, this thesis aims to create a place for people where they can safely land in these tumultuous times and feel welcome to engage and open up to the 'in-between land' using Virtual Reality.<br/><br/>RESEARCH &amp; DESIGN GOAL<br/>During this thesis, research activities have been performed to get insight into the patient's wishes and needs. Literature research and explorative interviews were performed to get insight into the patient's journey after the diagnosis of an incurable disease. The interview panel consisted of patients, loved ones, care professionals, and experts in the palliative world. The insights of this research have been clustered and led to fourteen criteria that support the design goal. <br/><br/>IDEATION &amp; CO-CREATION<br/>The criteria were used as an inspiration for the ideation. Four students worked on this project in a hack-a-thon of Young Medical Delta and created a framework that complemented this research, leading to the final design. This framework exists out of five worlds that all answer to a different need: The forest, the library, the home, the communal space, and the beach.<br/><br/>THE FINAL DESIGN | THE ENTRANCE TO HET TUSSENLAND<br/>The Tussenland is a digital platform that will be offered to the patient after the bad news. In this thesis, only the entrance to The Tussenland is designed. 'The Entrance to The Tussenland' is a forest-like environment in Virtual Reality where people are welcomed and shown around by a guide. The patients own a tree where their experiences grow as blossoms on their tree. The tree can be shared, enabling others to enter this world and comment on these experiences.<br/><br/>EVALUATION<br/>For the final design, a prototype was evaluated by the panel. The panel was pleased with the meaningful interactions that were created in the design. It felt like a safe way to let people be welcomed and immersed in this new magical world. The participants felt like it was a tool that enabled them to express their thoughts, give them information and offer consolation in a meditative world.<br/><br/>IMPLEMENTATION<br/>A service system map and roadmap were created for the future development of 'The Entrance to The Tussenland.' The three milestones in this roadmap are the pilot, launching 'The Entrance to The Tussenland', and further development of The Tussenland.<br/><br/>DISCUSSION &amp; LIMITATIONS<br/>However, the platform still needs to be developed as a full-service VR application. It is now a demonstration of what it could look/feel/sound like. <br/>'The Entrance to The Tussenland' is not a concept meant for everyone because not every patient wants to engage the in-between-land. <br/><br/>CONCLUSION<br/>In conclusion, the platform and service 'The Entrance to The Tussenland' supports patients after the bad news conversation by letting them safely land in the in-between-land.<br","Palliative care; In-between-land; Virtual reality","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

It began as a small settlement on the River Rotte, at the place where the river met with the Nieuwe Maas. In 1270, the long dam was built in an attempt to reclaim the swampy land for development. In another word, since its origins, Rotterdam had to adapt to the natural circumstances of the delta, the threat of the rivers and sea waters. Now, according to NASA (2017), there is scientific consensus about the fact climate change trends over the past century are very likely a consequence of human activities. And one of the major consequences of global climate change is more extreme weather events. For example, global warming and accompanying sea-level rise are threatening many of the world’s lowland areas which have the Dutch nervous about the future of their country. Moreover, predictions indicate that there will be more extreme weather conditions, such as heavier rainstorms, longer periods of drought. Within the dikes, the inner-dike city of Rotterdam is mostly well below sea level (The Rotterdam Climate Initiative 2013) which means it is vulnerable to sea-level rise and some related issues like flood and salinization. Moreover, the current defenses are adequate up to 2050 and only allowed it to deal with around 40 centimeters of sea-level rise. Especially in Prins Alexander polder, with the lowest point being as much as 6.67 meters below NAP (the National Amsterdam Level, is an agreed ordnance measurement that is almost equal to mean sea level), the pumping stations are regulating the water levels and keep the polder dry. The project will explore the possibility of the existing polder system to face extreme rainfall, flood, and salinization in an urban area for a better living environment and enhance biodiversity. The result of the design assignment can be described as follows. - Based on the current system to come out with a set of typologies of small-scale design interventions which can generate interrelation between the informal settlement, the dynamic of the landscape, and water. Analysis- - Illustrate the timeline of climate change events from the current situation to the future with section/ typologies. - Map the threats to find out the most vulnerable area. - calculate the adequate amount of daily use water and purification area to build a circular water system. Design- - An ecological masterplan to show the relationship between the site and the surroundings. - Specific site design of a chosen area with more elaborate detail design of materialization and flows. - Come out with the principles that can be applied for the other places facing the climate change effect in the urban area.","Urban Ecology; Climate Change Adaptation; Water storage; Polder; Water nuisance; Drought; Salinization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Landscape Architecture","Urban ecology and eco-cities","51.954466884664065, 4.600137373792433"

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Treatment planning for radiation therapy is a complex process, as there are many machine parameters to determine for a treatment. To decrease the required labour and improve the plan quality, auto-planning systems have been developed, which can automatically generate high-quality treatment plans. These plans still have to be checked to ensure their quality, which means an independent and automatic quality assurance method is needed. This is where deep learning comes in, as recent advancements in computer hardware and artificial intelligence make it possible to quickly train neural networks for fast predictions of dose distributions based on the anatomy of a certain patient. Even though these models have proven capable of generating predictions comparable to the actual delivered dose, there is no guarantee that the distributions are actually deliverable. Therefore, this study is conducted to develop a novel deep learning model that uses physical information of how dose is delivered to constrain the neural networks and force realistic and deliverable dose distributions. The models presented in this study are implemented on prostate cancer patients treated with the Volumetric-Modulated Arc Therapy (VMAT) delivery technique.<br/><br/>First, the conventional Anatomy-based dose prediction model is further developed to improve the quality of the predicted dose distributions. The goal is to assess how accurate the predicted dose is from a deep learning model without any physical constraint. The model with U-net architecture has shown to be capable of predicting dose distributions of very high quality with average DVH differences of less than 1 Gy and errors in the dose coverage statistics on the PTV of less than 1\%. Furthermore, the lack of deliverability was confirmed due to the missing ray effects in the dose distributions, showing no clear entry points of the external photon beam. This lack of ray effects was quantified and confirmed using the dip in the S\o rensen-Dice Index around the 30\% isodose contours, where the ray effects are most apparent.<br/><br/>Second, the Physics-guided prediction model was developed by combining the Anatomy-based dose prediction model with the newly developed Segment prediction model, which predicts Multi-Leaf Collimator (MLC) positions and beam intensity values for all directions from which the dose is delivered. These predictions are based on the prediction from the Anatomy-based dose prediction model and the Beam's Eye View images of the CT and the delineated structures. The segment prediction is used in a stand-alone dose engine, based on the Matrad dose calculation algorithm, to calculate a dose distribution from the predicted treatment plan, which is deliverable by definition. The performance of the Physics-guided prediction model is underwhelming, scoring considerably worse on most evaluation metrics compared to the Anatomy-based dose prediction model. The lack of performance is mainly caused by the poor performance of the Segment prediction model component.<br/><br/>To circumvent the issue of the Segment prediction model, a dose mimicking model has been developed and investigated, where a dose mimicking algorithm is used to mimic a prediction from the Anatomy-based dose prediction model by optimizing the segments on which the dose is delivered. This model has only been tested on a single patient but seems to be performing better than the Physics-guided prediction model, with the downside that an optimisation process is involved. Still, the performance is not on par with the Anatomy-based dose prediction model.<br/><br/>Further investigation on the Segment prediction model will be needed before the Physics-guided prediction model can be considered as a serious quality assessment tool. Once performance of the Segment prediction model has increased, it could prove an interesting model that could even replace an auto-planning system in the far future.","radiotherapy; Deep Learning; Treatment Planning; Quality Assurance","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-04-19","","","","Applied Sciences","",""

This simulator achieves several configurable metrics including topology and routing schemes, network size, the number of channels, and neuron mapping methods.

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","To extract energy from wind, both Horizontal Axis Wind Turbine (HAWT)s and Vertical Axis Wind Turbine (VAWT)s are used. Different from the HAWT, the axis of rotation of the VAWT is perpendicular to the ground. This vertical design offers some unique advantages for the VAWT. For example, the generator of the VAWT is located on the ground, hence the maintenance costs are lower compared to the HAWT. Furthermore, the VAWT can be upscaled easier than the HAWT to harvest more energy from a single turbine. These benefits demonstrate the potential of VAWTs for offshore applications. However, the VAWT’s blade suffers from periodic aerodynamic loads from the periodically varying Angle of Attack (AOA), and unsteady aerodynamic phenomena, which harm the durability and hence the economic feasibility of the VAWT.<br/><br/>This thesis aims at resolving the blade loads mitigation problem of the VAWT. For wind turbines, pitching the blade is a common way to reduce the loads on the blade. There have been studies done that focus on the power maximization for the VAWT. However, research on the pitch control system for load reduction is lacking. To tackle the blade loads mitigation problem, a data-driven approach called Subspace Predictive Control (SPC) is used to control the individual pitch actuation of a two-bladed 1.5 m H-Darrieus VAWT. <br/><br/>This closed-loop control strategy consists of two parts, an online identification block and an optimal control law based on the identified system. The online identification method applied is called Recursive Predictor-Based Subspace Identification (RPBSID). It can estimate the system parameters online by using the input and output data collected from the VAWT system. Then, two different types of controllers are designed to reduce the blade loads. In the first approach, the constrained Model Predictive Control (MPC) is used. The optimal control input is calculated by solving a finite horizon constrained optimization problem. The individual pitch control action can be automatically adapted based on the online identified model. In the second approach, a Linear-Quadratic Regulator (LQR) is used as a comparison to the first approach. The LQR solves an infinite horizon unconstrained optimization problem to obtain the optimal state-feedback law. The control gain can be calculated analytically. <br/><br/>Both approaches are first tested on a Simulink model, which is based on the interpolation of lookup tables computed by the Actuator Cylinder (AC) model and blade element theory. Under a stepwise wind condition, the SPC approach shows the potential to reduce the normal load on each blade. It is also found that the MPC is more robust and easier to implement, compared to the LQR. Then, the MPC based SPC is applied to a mid-fidelity simulation tool called Qblade to acquire more realistic results. The controlled pitch trajectory shows good load reduction results under both uniform and turbulent wind conditions. The work presented in this thesis provides a control strategy to reduce the blade loads on VAWTs following a data-driven manner and demonstrates the capability of MPC based SPC in VAWTs’ application.<br","Vertical Axis Wind Turbine; subspace predictive control; Qblade","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

Northern European artists and writers perceived nature as a symbol of grief and death. Cemeteries such as the Woodland cemetery in Stockholm, Sweden, confirm this tendency. Funerary spaces interweave the physical and the spiritual world by containing grief in nature and experimenting with shadow and light and the presence or absence of materiality.<br/><br/>The recent COVID-19 pandemic and the massive deaths resulted in an emergency in funeral services worldwide. Restrictions such as social distancing, the use of face masks, isolation, a limit on the number of guests allowed, and not being allowed to touch the deceased’s body severely affected the way grief is experienced among the bereaved. The outburst of COVID-19 also affected the way funerary rituals were performed. Several funeral rituals were broadcasted digitally, making the body no longer the physical means of mourning. These practices have given birth to new grieving rituals on the Internet, an immaterial tool designed to instantly share moments of the users’ lives.

Long work hour culture, which is working more than 49 hours a week, besides physical damage, reduces the well-being of its participants and thereby their productivity. Even though a long work hour culture sometimes feels imposed, it is ultimately the actor’s choice.

Also, under the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), the bio-based concept raises more awareness.<br/><br/>This strengthens the aim to create a circular economy. The industry in the Port of Rotterdam is mainly based on fossil-based industries that follow the linear system. Therefore, high emissions and waste are caused. This contradicts the aims of the SDG and the idea of a circular system. Consequently, the port area should be transformed into a flexible system that can adapt to changing future situations. This will be realized by a circular system that contributes to the development of the bio-based industry. <br/><br/>This transition is triggered by the current oil- and plastic industries taking place within the Port. By treating the bio-plastic industry as a trigger industry, a strategy for the transition towards a bio-based system is created. This leads to a circular economy that depends on bio-based materials. Since the bio-based system might face future challenges, it is important to guarantee further adaptation and self-improvement over time. The final goal is to create a closed-loop within the Port region to reduce emissions and waste products using these bio-based materials.<br/><br/>To close this loop, the Bio-Loop ZH2050 is integrated into the Port area. A Green Belt strategy promotes the circular economy within the province of South Holland, and by implementing the Living Labs, knowledge and technologies are improved over time. The Bio-Loop ZH2050 influences the aim of the province to become 100% circular by 2050 and several SDG topics. Environmentally, this project supports the transition towards a circular bio-based system and to reduce the impact of pollution and climate change. Socially, the Bio-Loop ZH2050 creates the possibility to get society involved in the bio-based circularity. And finally, economically, the Port of Rotterdam will become the port of Europe based on the bio-based economy, which is the entrance connecting the global market and EU market.<br","bio-based plastic; circular economy; biomass; green belt; port industry","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Urbanism","AR2U086 R&D Studio – Spatial Strategies for the Global Metropolis",""

The Port of Rotterdam (PoR), the largest and busiest port in Europe, has strong potential to become a future circular hub. The PoR has been a major player in the seaport industry for centuries with, among others, a strong logistics sector and a robust shipbuilding industry. However, the Netherlands does not have a solid shipbreaking sector. During 2016 - 2020, an astounding 86% of the vessels that were serving Dutch beneficiaries were scrapped in the Global South. To achieve a circular maritime manufacturing sector in just under 30 years, collaboration between stakeholders is needed to realize innovative solutions. The research question is therefore how can cross-pollination between the shipbuilding industry, knowledge sector, and local makers lead to a circular ship manufacturing sector? A combination of literature review and research by design was applied to gain insight into the required changes in the material and waste flows, and the possible role of the Makers industry in realizing a Dutch circular maritime manufacturing sector. It is expected that the educational needs and skills required of the labor force will have to evolve to fit the circular economy, therefore, the requirements to ensure a just social transition were investigated. The results are a spatial vision for a circular maritime manufacturing sector anchored to the existing waterway networks of South Holland, and a road map to implement this vision. By 2050, South Holland is the leading creative maritime region, where stakeholders in the Randstad collaborate on innovative solutions based on a shared maritime identity, respect for nature, and accessible physical learning and working environments. With the projected sea level rise, achieving a circular ship manufacturing sector is poised to play a crucial role in realizing a resilient water-based future.","circular economy; shipbuilding; maritime manufacturing; steel recycling; makers industry","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Urbanism","AR2U086 R&D Studio – Spatial Strategies for the Global Metropolis",""

First, the relationship between architecture and film is explored through lite- rature research.The articulation of lived space forms the basis and common ground for architecture and cinema. Being both arts of the author, cinema and architecture have the potential to generate emotions, awaken our soul and to shift the attention of the viewer from the inside to the outside. Both cinema and architecture have the ability to construct spaces in the mind, articulate the surface between the world and our own mental experience, where meaning and value are blend.<br/>The architecture, which plays a central role in the films of Anderson, is analy- zed. Anderson introduces spaces through the habits, ideals and aspirations of the indi- vidual, bringing buildings to life. Anderson balances stories between reality and fantasy, transcending the rules of geometry. The architecture in The Grand Budapest Hotel (2014) is analyzed as a case study. The film depicts the glory days and the fall down of a grand hotel in different eras but is above all a story of decay, loneliness and personal loss.Anderson intended to give homage to European Grandeur at the turn of the 19th century on the one hand and communist architecture on the other hand. The observations and research show contradictions and paradoxes in the blend of architectural styles depicted in the film. The conflicts and contradictions between foreign influences and ideological structures are both visible in the 1940s and the 1960s version of the exterior of the hotel. In the interior, the contradictory usage of material on the one hand and the rational floorplan and technological developments on the other hand shows the changing ideas about the function and definition of the hotel. Most important, the hotel resembles the personage of the characters who live in a forgotten and lost world.Anderson shows that spaces can question our narrative and imagination. When architecture can evoke this experience, the true quality of the practice is utilized and a level of consciousness is reached where dream, feeling and emotions reside.","AR2A011; Film; Architecture; Cinema; Wes Anderson; The Grand Budapest Hotel; Jugendstil; Art Nouveau; Neoclassicisme; Neo-baroque; Neo-Renaissance","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","AR2A011",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Since oil was struck at Dammam’s Oil Well No. 7 in 1938, the Dammam Metropolitan Area (henceforth referred to as ‘DMA) has undergone rapid urban expansion, in part due to the influx of foreign national oil workers. With their lifestyles differing from the local population, the urban sphere has developed to cater to their diverse demands. There is limited literature on the relationship between the history the foreign national populations’ urban experiences in the DMA and its petroleumscape. The petroleumscape, as defined by Carola Hein, is the physical, represented and lived palimpsest of petroleum’s physical and financial flows into the (urban) landscape guided by corporate and public actors. In the DMA, the petroleumscape’s main actor - ARAMCO – was the first to define spatial distributions of ethnic and socioeconomic groups in Saudi’s Eastern Province. Other actors such as the Saudi government and other petrochemical companies followed suit, resulting in ethnically segregated urban zones and architectural typologies. A failure to understand the historical relationships between petroleum, ethnicity and nationality could be an obstacle to current Saudi city-planning strategies, particularly frameworks such as Vision 2030, which anticipate an economy slowly shifting away from oil and ‘inclusive’ cities. This paper investigates how the development of the DMA’s petroleumscape resulted in urban spaces for foreign national populations (henceforth referred to as ‘FN populations’) and affected their urban liveability in terms of their housing, work, education and leisure environments. A study of this intricate historical relationship could provide a background for future urban planning policies in the DMA and the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia. The analysis of historic documents, aerial imagery, photographs and geographical information systems can locate oil-related infrastructure throughout history. Coupled with personal accounts and statistics, segregation and integration of FNs in urban space is explored. An online questionnaire conducted for this research provides quantitative and qualitative data on the quality of life for FNs. Secondary sources, such as books, articles and magazines which investigate housing and employment conditions in Middle Eastern oil and port cities are used to analyse and deduce findings from primary sources. A cross analysis of sources and findings identifies and maps out urban interventions that improve liveability arising from Dammam’s petroleumscape. The historical upward trajectory of Dammam’s petroleum industry has improved liveability for FN residents since the discovery of oil in 1938. Consequently, through the creation of urban spaces, such as gated communities, cultural enclaves and commercial districts funded by petrodollars, liveability for FN populations has improved in tandem with the rise of petroleum. However, a generalisation of all FN groups cannot be made as their urban liveability has historically depended, and continues to depend, on their position on the racial and socioeconomic ladder. Saudi’s waning reliance on oil revenue will affect liveability in the DMA for Saudis and foreign nationals alike, possibly even altering urban distributions of various FN groups. The objective is to present the correlations and causations in the history of the DMA’s urban development and its FN population and to illustrate how and why this affects liveability for FNs so that the objectives of local planning authorities can better manage the demands of a historically diverse population, in line with the Vision 2030 framework and local urban planning schemes.","AR2A011; petroleumscape; oil spaces; oil industry; foreign nationals; urban liveability; segregation","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","AR2A011","26.315700, 50.101000"

Sofonisba Anguissola (c. 1532-1625) and Judith Leyster (1609-1660) were two well-known and praised painters and are the selected representatives of this comparison. The comparison consists of paintings in five categories: self-portrait, en profil portrait, portrait of children and animals, paintings of multiple figures and games and portrait of a woman. The categories are chosen to represent the broad spectrum of the work of both women, which was remarkable for women in their field. Though both painters came from different backgrounds, they managed to garner admiration for their work and reached the top in their field. They operated in different circumstances; where Leyster’s clientele consisted of amongst others, the newly risen bourgeoisie, Anguissola operated at Spanish court and often painted for the nobility and was, therefore, more confined to specific subjects, such as reserved portraits. Despite these different clients and their expectations, Anguissola and Leyster were both forerunners in their art, which is for instance shown in the use of relatively unused compositions and their paintings of everyday scenes with a liveliness and familiarity that was not often seen. They painted with confidence and displayed their pride in their profession. The comparison shows us how one could have influenced the other and gives insight into the extent of their work.","AR2A011; Anguissola; Leyster; Renaissance; Dutch 17th century","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","AR2A011",""

Everything goes fast and consequently it is increasingly difficult for planners to govern the new phenomena of the city. Architects have the important role of trying to solve urban issues through the architectural project, whether it is a building, a square, or even just a seat. It is important to focus our attention on small things as well.<br/>One of the aims of this research is precise to demonstrate how the simple design of a boundary is able to strongly influence people's perception of space. In this sense, history can teach a lot to contemporaneity. In particular, between 1960 and 1990, some Dutch architects addressed the issue of the boundary between public and private, between exterior and interior, and so on, in such a revolutionary way that it is still the object of research today. Aldo van Eyck's Burgerweeshuis, Piet Blom's Bastille, and the Delftse Montessorischool designed by Herman Hertzberger are three magnificent examples. In these buildings, every edge, corner, and surface was designed to be used by its inhabitants.<br/>However, if we focus our attention on the new areas of the contemporary city we can still recognize some characteristics that were already criticized during the last century. In this sense, brushing up on some virtuous experiences of the past is a useful exercise. Indeed, the history of architecture has a great deal to teach the contemporary practice. History provides prototypes, a catalog of tried and tested responses to problems. It is for this reason that past themes and ideas return cyclically in the practice of contemporary architecture. The aim of this thesis is therefore to provide a catalogue of references based on Dutch structuralism that can be a source of inspiration for architects of today and those of tomorrow. Especially for the kind of architects who care not only about issues relating to 'design' but also to issues relating to its 'humanization'.","AR2A011; structuralism; boundary; experience","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","AR2A011",""

The goal is to understand the limits and shortcomings of the user involvement processes implemented to evaluate and discuss the reasons for why the experiment in participation, community and multifunctionality carried out by architect Frank van Klingeren together with Eindhoven Municipality and Amro/Westland-Utrecht received extensive criticism and was ultimately viewed as a failure. This paper finds that the participation efforts were extensive and that a lot of effort was taken to ensure the successful implementation of ideas, needs and wills of the neighbourhood inhabitants to make the multifunctional centre theirs. Shortcomings can be understood as a combination of the nature of the experiment, the key stakeholders and their role, the extent of participation and the expectations contra the implementation. It is evident that there was a certain degree of dissonance between expectations on the participation processes and the results where key stakeholders asserted inertia in the further development of the centre. The participation was also demanding on all interest groups, causing long discussions as hundreds of participants were expressing their views on how the centre should be redeveloped. These factors ultimately dragged out the process, leaving the centre in a prolonged state of disarray where certain aspects stayed in an undesirable state.<br/><br/>The paper aims at closing the gap in the evaluation of participatory processes and investigations into real life case studies to better understand the limits and basis of user involvement in design processes.

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","This thesis is structured like the book Invisible Cities by Italo Calvino. Its aim is to interpret and defragment it, thus the structural organisation being the same. Eleven themes are to be tackled and inserted alternately in nine chapters, whereas some contain different definitions or subjective interpretations.<br/><br/>Invisible Cities is a poetic narrative. Mythic, unreal and ethereal descriptions of cities serve as a metaphor to describe the decaying of some architectural principles with the start of the modern era. Calvino names these cities invisible, yet his narrative is extremely visual, in the mind. There is usually an abstract space we inhabit when we read a book. When reading Calvino’s narrative that space becomes tangible. These never-seen cities become haptic - they become, almost, real. What was he doing? Where are these cities located? What purpose do they have? Why are they invisible? The creativity, the dreams, the imagination without limits. How do people relate to the spaces described? What is the architecture behind imagination and perception? Through trying to decode the messages held within his book, this thesis will cautiously investigate and interpret these questions by analysing the deep relations between people and their experience in architectural spaces. However, the subjective individual perceptions occur to be a large part of the decoding process, as the evocative descriptions of the imagined places has been investigated by numerous literary writers, yet all with different analogies.<br/><br/>In the second part of the body, the cities Calvino portrays will be traced as subjectively visualized in this thesis author mind and compared to other people’s personal interpretations. The consequent similarities and discrepancies will indicate the infinite number of ways of imagining virtual things based on people’s lived experience and memory. <br/><br/>Henceforth, this paper approaches the manipulation and creativity of the human imagination. Is our basic interpretation of things based on our lived experience? Do we every so often solely see what we want to see? On the other hand, there is the unseen and its various interpretations attached that will be deciphered in this paper. The experience, the senses, the memory - the dreamlike fragments we keep when we visit a new city, a new place are discussed and portrayed in order to show that imagination is itself a space we inhabit.","Imagination; The Unseen; Lived Experience; Architectural experience; Visionary architecture; Story-telling","en","student report","","","","","","","","2022-04-14","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","AR2A011",""

More than 8% of the Dutch population faces energy poverty, and this percentage will increase with the rising energy prices and unstructured national framework.

After undergoing a rapid shifting of administrative and legal system change, Macao has experienced its peak of concentrating wealth and economy in the last two decades, backed by its intense gambling and entertainment industry. As a reaction to this economic phenomenon, Macao has eventually received titles like “Las Vegas of the East” and “Monte Carlo of the East” from the international market.<br/><br/>While celebrating the enormous wealth brought by the industry, the impacts that follow have fundamentally transformed the urban setting of Macao, including but not limited to the way people live, experience, local culture, and identity from the past.

Through the use of testimonies of practitioners, teachers and students, their writings, lecture recordings and archival material, links between engaged pedagogy and a participatory design process are analysed. The reasons for, and implications of, a feminist approach to design and user involvement are situated within the larger socio-economic and political context to enquire how historical analysis of the conditions within which the production of architecture becomes a mutually-empowering practice can be translated into contemporary circumstances.","AR2A011; Feminism; Participation; Pedagogy; Architectural Education; feminist practices; Women’s Studies; WIAB","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","AR2A011",""

However, despite their noble intentions and friendly image, zoos have some darker moments in their history. The animals in the first zoos, which date back to ancient times, were an exotic addition to the owner's assets and a status symbol. <br/>In the 1970s, the rapid growth of animal rights movements brought a new perspective to the debate about the human-animal relationship. Zoos made efforts to rebrand themselves as places of education and conservation. The shift in ethics of the modern zoo is evident in the contrast between old and new zoo architecture, therefore a visit to the zoo established in the 18th or 19th is a fascinating experience. <br/>A great example of this contrast can be found in The Wrocław Zoological Garden - the oldest zoo within polish borders. Since its foundation in 1865, it has constantly been expanding and building new enclosures for animals. Undoubtedly the historical buildings make the zoo more interesting, but they also create challenges. The way the renovations of the older buildings are carried out raises a question: how the historic buildings of Wrocław zoo were adapted to meet the 21st-century ethics of keeping animals? <br/>This thesis will analyze the topic of heritage architecture in Wrocław zoo from two perspectives. The first one is presenting the zoo through the lens of history, pointing out the changes that buildings and structures went through and highlighting the general trends in their preservation. Despite its complex history, Wrocław Zoo was not a subject of such analysis. <br/>The other important topic in the debate about the zoo is the ethics of keeping animals. The main points of such debate will be discussed and supported by examples from the Wrocław Zoo. This thesis will analyze the renovations of heritage buildings in Wrocław Zoo and will add a layer of discussion about the ethics of keeping animals. <br/>By analyzing the existing literature, the generations of zoo buildings will be drawn out. Then by presenting the history of Wrocław zoo, from its foundation till the modern-day, through photographs and publications, the characteristic buildings representative of each generation of zoo architecture will be described. Two case studies of renovation work in the Wrocław zoo will be presented: the Bear fortress as it is the oldest building in the Wrocław zoo and the birdhouse as it is the newest finished renovation project. Then by describing ethical views on the human-animal relationship throughout the ages, the previously discussed events in Wrocław zoo will be analyzed. Then, the discussion will focus on assessing the methods of renovation of buildings in Wrocław zoo and conclude on the direction zoo architecture has taken.<br","AR2A011; Zoo; Ethics; Renovation","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","AR2A011",""

The dynamic changes of the buildings’ and districts’ functions is hugely related to the political and economical situation in Britain, in addition to the global economy. The focus is put on the four periods of time which define the biggest changes: the time of industrial glory (1850 -1914), the decay and abandonment caused by wars and de-industrialisation (1914-1980), the interim use that enhanced artistic expression (1980-2007) and the newly regenerated commercial district (2007-now). <br/>The analysis is conducted considering various aspects. Firstly, each chapter discusses the direct relation between architecture and the function behind it. Secondly, it focuses on the changes of social dynamic of the site.

It is known for its unique and sophisticated system of the urban greenery which can be reached within a 10 minutes radius from any point in the city. How was it achieved in such a large and dense urban area? Why was such an intricate greenery system introduced in the first place? What was it inspired by? How was it devised? These are merely a few questions that come up when one sees the original plan for the first time. The answer to these questions are as fascinating as the history of the expansion plan itself which is directly related to them, as the AUP is a sophisticated, clearly layered, harmonised and hierarchal system of urban elements. What elements contributed to such a success of this plan? What adjustments the pre-war plan had to undergo in order to answer the needs of the society in the post-war world? In order to answer all these questions, a wide research has been done in an attempt to uncover the long and complicated history of AUP, and all the events, societal factors, brilliant individuals that have shaped the city of Amsterdam into what it is today.<br/>The first section of this paper takes on the historical background relevant to the AUP. It explains the ideas of the pioneers of urban planning and greenery planning, which inspired the planners of the Amsterdam extension plan. In the second part, we will look closely at the AUP itself and at its history. It will be shown what factors contributed to its creation, and what was the system on the big scale. The third part will focus on the smaller scale, looking closely at the details and particular strategies applied, and at how the new neighbourhoods were planned out. This will be shown with the example of the Slotermeer district, as out of all the neighbourhoods planned in AUP, that one was the most successful as the designers were more free in their processes. Finally, in the last section, the greenery system of AUP will be analysed in detail.

The 442-year colonial state and the post-colonial period, which began in 1998, have influenced architectural ideologies over time due to an evolution of self-identity, place identity, people, and material culture. Beginning with the earliest colonial settlements and progressing to current international applications. Throughout history, urban and architectural decisions have always been associated with economic prosperity and foreign culture when it comes to shaping a city’s identity.<br/><br/> In Macau, postcolonial architecture has been adopted, demonstrating the influence of colonial ideology and modern capitalist globalization to the present day. Gambling and tourism have transformed the city from a traditional enterprise with a self-sufficient culture to Asia’s global entertainment and financial hub. Aside from colonial architectural ideologies, the thesis seeks to demonstrate how other Western ideologies and preferences, such as Chinese and American, can influence local architectural and community identities. Furthermore, it attempts to interpret the social and cultural implications of architectural transformations. This will be investigated through a variety of sources, including books, research papers, and articles that examine both local and Western perspectives on Macau’s urban development history.<br/><br/> Certain economic developments added a new dimension to a city that had grown due to significant changes in local architecture.

During architectural studies the impact of non-Western architecture on Western architecture is often neglected. Most western sources on the subject are old and are powered by orientalism which is important for the perception of these sources. The exact moment that an architectural concept originated is impossible to say as architectural influence is a constant motion of inspiration,<br/>although an estimate of when it emerged can be made. Based on the findings from the literature and case study analysis, it can be concluded that Islamic architecture had an influence on the architectural Gothic style during the Middle Ages. The Islamic architecture itself was a synthesis of different architectural influences due to the variation of the Middle East. Both architectural styles share similarities in characteristics that were transferred through various methods. Gothic architecture and Islamic architecture both want to show the godly through nature, this concept manifests itself in the usage of ornamentations. This influence is shown through historical examples and first examples in the world that show certain concepts and techniques that originated from the Middle East region.","AR2A011; Gothic Architecture; Middle Eastern architecture; byzantine architecture; Architectural Influence; The history of Gothic architecture,; Islamic Architecture","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","AR2A011",""

For centuries, in both the Netherland’s and the USA's history, the public realm was envisioned as a space for men while the domestic spaces of a home were predominantly associated with women. However, at the turn of the twentieth century, this dichotomy began to be challenged. Due to the demands of World War I, women started occupying a more tangible portion of the paid workforce. Additionally, with the rights won through the women’s suffrage movement they became a relevant patron of architecture as well, in their fight for living independently from their families or male partners. With the rise of this so-called pink-collar working class, a much needed housing typology finally began to develop. It provided living arrangements for independent women without the strict rules and regulations of a “Young Women’s Home” , an all women housing arrangement where symbolic house mothers raised their daughters in the traditional ideas of women and domesticity. From Hull House, founded in Chicago, Illinois in 1889, to Het Nieuwe Huis, built in 1928 Amsterdam, the Netherlands, there is a clear exchange of profound thoughts from influential women, joined together over the fight for global peace and women’s rights of that period. Feminist activists such as Aletta H. Jacobs, Charlotte Perkins Gilman, and Jane Addams all contributed largely to the American-Dutch intellectual pipeline that made many of these changes come to fruition, working tirelessly to promote women's evolving role in society.<br/><br/>Dwelling design was a place defined by its relationship to domesticity, but these spaces had to adapt to the paradigm shift brought about in the early 1900s. This research paper investigates the effect these women and their activism had on the USA’s and the Netherlands’ dwelling architecture, focusing on the impact that single women had on the spatial and programmatic aspects of housing. This study is based on compiled plans and images of both Hull House and Het Nieuwe Huis, literary research from Dutch and USA newspapers, and letters sent between Jacobs, Gilman, and Addams. Additionally, through contemporary architectural and gender theorists, these ideological drivers and how they manifest themselves in the architecture become clear. This discussion also identifies how designing for women altered the traditional expectations of women in the public realm and the way they were viewed in society. It solidifies social values into the built environment and in order to design consciously and considerately, for contemporary as well as future use, it’s crucial to understand how societal movements have altered design in the past so that one can predict the requirements of the next generation of architecture and the people who inhabit it.","USA Housing; Dutch Housing; Women and Architecture; Dwelling; Suffragism; Gendered Spaces","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","AR2A011",""

Zo heeft deze bloembollencultuur van 1850 tot 1965 ook in gebouwde erfgoed haar sporen nagelaten. Na 1965 is de herkenbare bloembollenschuur haar karakteristieke eigenschappen verloren en zijn ze nog moeilijk te onderscheiden van andere bedrijfshallen. De afgelopen jaren is er dan ook steeds meer aandacht gekomen voor de bollenschuren tot 1965. Zo’n 25 jaar geleden werden de bollenschuren al van cultuurhistorisch belang gezien. Vanuit gemeentes in de Bollenstreek wordt daarom ook gesproken over het behouden en herbestemmen van de (monumentale) bollenschuren. Zo wordt er elk jaar door de Werkgroep Behoud en Herbestemming Bollenerfgoed van het Cultuurhistorisch Genootschap Duin- en Bollenstreek de Zwarte Tulp-prijs uitgereikt. Deze is bedoeld bestemd voor de eigenaar van een bollenschuur in de Bollenstreek die hun bollenschuur op een goede manier hebben behouden of herbestemd.<br/>Het doel van deze thesis is om de ontwikkeling van de bloembollenschuren vanaf 1850 tot 1965 in kaart te brengen. Het is hierbij van belang de redenen van deze ontwikkelingen hierbij vast te leggen en te kijken hoe dit van invloed is geweest. Hierbij luidt mijn hoofdvraag ‘‘Hoe zijn de bollenschuren in de Bollenstreek veranderd tussen de jaren 1850 en 1965 en waarom?’’<br/>Hierbij wordt gekeken naar verschillende nog bestaande bollenschuren uit deze periode. Zowel het exterieur als het interieur tussen de verschillende type bollenschuren worden met elkaar vergeleken en bij verschillen wordt er gezocht naar de reden waarom een verandering heeft plaatsgevonden. Dit zal gedaan worden met bestaande literatuur en het bezoeken van verschillende bollenschuren.<br/>Uit het onderzoek is gebleken dat de grootste reden waarom er verschil zit tussen de types bollenschuren komt doordat de vraag naar bloembollen vanuit Nederland vanaf de jaren 1850 zo erg is toegenomen dat de kweker de beste conditie om de bloembol te drogen en te bewaren ook daadwerkelijk kon realiseren. Hier is een periode aan experimenteren geweest over hoe dit het beste gedaan kon worden. Uiteindelijk heeft de aanleg van elektriciteit in 1922 een grote rol in gespeeld, mechanisch ventileren werd mogelijk. Dit had effect op het exterieur van de bollenschuur, de gevel werd hierdoor meer gesloten. Daarnaast veranderde ook het belang van een bollenschuur, deze is getransformeerd van een opslag naar het uithangbord van het bedrijf.","Bollenschuur; Bollenstreek; Ontwikkeling","nl","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","AR2A011",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","The formation of social space through architecture is becoming increasingly important in today's society. In order to design social space as effectively and sustainably as possible, however, it is first important to know the current society and its problems and grievances. Furthermore, social scientists, architects and spatial planners can learn from the development of social spaces in the past decades. The development of social space will be the main component of this work.<br/><br/>Utopias aim at the ideal human being and the perfect society. They achieve this goal both by designing physical space and by designing social space. Utopias have therefore accompanied the cultural history of mankind since time immemorial and often reflect the current zeitgeist or represent a counter-design to the prevailing social conditions. Utopias are therefore holistic wishful architectures. <br/><br/>A prominent example of such wishful architecture from the time of the Third Reich is the design of the World Capital Germania. An urban design created by the architect Albert Speer for the German capital Berlin. This utopia designs social space in the sense of the ruling Nazis' thinking about representation and power. The architecture is supposed to give people the feeling that an individual person alone is powerless in the face of the community. Therefore, structures of gigantism can be found repeatedly in the architecture of the World Capital Germania. Speer wanted to use the design of the physical space to ensure that the population would develop into a cohesive community.<br/>A clear counter-design after the WWII is the concept of New Babylon by the architect Constant Nieuwenhuys. Unlike Albert Speer, Constant Nieuwenhuys places the individual in the center and predicts an architecture of individual possibilities. Through the elimination of all work and the automation of all processes, people have the freedom to build and design their own environment. All people are thus placed on the same social level.<br/>In today's society, climate change and the depletion of the planet in particular play a significant role. NEOM is a design of a futuristic city that aims to sensitize people and to pay more attention to the environment with its 100% sustainable architecture. Furthermore, NEOM's design also puts people back in the foreground, whereby the innovative progress of this project is based on the community.<br/><br/>The development of social space and the goal of architecture can be seen not only in the overall architectural structure, but also on a smaller scale, many insights can be gained. These will be discussed in more detail in the essay.<br/><br/>The comparison of the various influences of physical architecture on social space and the analysis of the historical reasons for the emergence of the different utopias bring great added value to modern architectural, as well as urban planning projects. This large-scale analysis can substantiate the concept of social space and broaden the view on this topic.<br","social space; physical space; architectural space; influence of architecture; pre-war period; post-war period; image of society; definition of the human being; Individuum, Community; social theory; utopia; evolution of space; development of space","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","AR2A011",""

The degree of influence that this economic- political evolution of Luxembourg had on the architectural and urban development of Luxembourg City marks the focal point of this thesis. Two iconic projects realised during the 1960s serve as case studies: The Grande-Duchesse Charlotte Bridge that functioned as the cornerstone of the city's urban expansion, and the Alcide-de-Gasperi Tower, which represents Luxembourg's integration into European affairs. The architectural and urban transformation during the 60s in Luxembourg City, was mainly driven by the political integration into European affairs, aiming to fulfil the city’s role as European capital. Fuelled by the rivalry between the three European capitals Brussels, Luxembourg and Strasbourg, architecture served as a political national branding tool, resulting in international recognition and economic growth.<br/>With its participation in the European Union, Luxembourg needed to create a strong image and international recognition, supported by its architectural infrastructure. Today, the European project is still incessantly growing, and Luxembourg as one of its capital cities is required to grow synchronously and adapt it’s image to contemporary ideologies.

It will systematically review the Dutch and English literature regarding gentrification combined with data provided by and of the city of Antwerp, the history of the researched area, and fieldwork.

The paper turns to the negative and positive impacts this process had on the built and social environment. It will be argued that the most prominent negative impact the process had on de Oude Dokken, was the homogenization of the social composition of the neighborhood and more specifically the expelling of earlier residents by wealthier residents. Although it could be argued the negative consequences outweigh the positive, one benefit should be highlighted. Due to the gentrification of the area, which was partially caused by the involvement of the government, the previously abandoned harbor area regained its vibrancy.

The country regained its independence after 123 years and got shaped by newly distributed borders in the Treaty of Riga. Following, 35% of the population identified themselves as ethnic minorities (14% Ukrainians, 10% Jews, 3% Belarusians and 2% Germans). The population worked on developing culture, architecture, and national identity. According to the Small Versailles Treaty (1919) non-poles had to have equal rights and be provided with free access to their own education and religion. The Jewish, living mostly in urban areas (74% of the minority's population), were the only ones to create their own science institutions and higher education facilities. They had literacy rates higher than non-Jews (24% amongst non-Jews were illiterate and only 15% among Jews) and became present in all social classes. In the first decades of the 20th century, it became common that Jewish people from privileged social classes would design tenement houses that they would later profit from or inhibit themselves. However, the representation of their influence on architecture became insignificant with the intensification of their persecutions after the rise of Nazi Germany in the 1930s. This previous heritage, part of Polish cities’ history, has been marginalized ever since. Especially in the newly founded city of Gdynia (located on the North coast) which was experiencing rapid growth, the Interwar period played a crucial role. The city mustered numbers of young architects to practice their profession as it was blooming. As Poland regained its independence and people strived for a rebirth of culture, the new and fast to build modern architecture became favored. Central European Jewish architects played a crucial role in its growth. The research studies various works of the architects with Jewish roots like Władysław Grodzieński (1895-n.d.), Edward Fuhr­schmied (1909-n.d.) and Eliza Unger (1899-1983). Moreover, it examines how working couples (Eliza Unger (1899-1983) and Oswald Eryk Unger (1896-1967)) operated in the architecture profession with their modernistic approach.

Looking into how societal and aesthetical factors resulted in brutalist architecture, an egalitarian and utopian movement at its inception, taking on the stereotypical role of the dystopian-future aesthetic in popular media subconscious. This thesis analyses the foundational ideas of the Brutalist movement and examined several film examples to establish this assumption. Illustrating the main points, and its adoption throughout cinema, by using notable real and paper architecture case studies that have played a key role in this transition.

As people migrate from their homeland, they bring with them their culture and mould their surroundings into something that emulates ‘home’. These migrant populations try to fit into their new environment, and the host country has to take measures to help them adapt to their new home. Their place of dwelling is the zone within the larger urban context that should make them feel secure, and the various housing projects implemented for migrants may reveal strategies for their integration into their current environment.<br/><br/>This architectural history thesis focuses on the story of migration and migrant housing in the Netherlands, beginning with the influx of guest-workers between 1964 and 1973, family reunification programs in the late1970s and the recent migration after the European Refugee crisis. There are three phases of assimilation in terms of scale, the larger urban context studies through the case study of the housing crisis for guest-workers in Utrecht in the 1970s, the neighbourhood level study conducted in the Post World War II Neighbourhoods of Enschede, and the residential level study conducted in the INTERACT projects in Startblok Riekerhaven, Amsterdam and Place2BU, Utrecht and the ‘Utrecht Refugee Launchpad Project’.The historical time frame of migration and the different integration methods implemented along this timeline may facilitate newer modes of integration while overcoming the shortcomings of the existing bundle of techniques. Moreover, the study of migration architecture may help understand the urban ethnographic polyvalence. Through literature and spatial mapping studies conducted from the larger urban context (in terms of frequency in social housing schemes) to the changes in the spatial layout of homes (understanding prevalent Dutch rituals compared to Turkish cultural traditions), we may understand these pre-existing transitions methods.","migration; identity; Housing; Netherlands","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","AR2A011",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","“Squares, boulevards, Favelas, refugee camps - have served throughout history as the setting for political protest and revolt.”(Weizman et al., 2015). These protests play a vital role in identifying what societal and political views a population uphold. Architecture is usually a representation of societal views, incidents and political ideologies (Fletcher, 2020). However, authoritarian or colonial regimes instill elements and design public spaces to sometimes stray away people from objecting against their policies. Contrarily, in instances where large scale massacres took place during these protests; the public square and the surrounding context become a place of remembrance. For Example, in the Melanesian archipelago, French colonialists publicly executed a group of indengious locals in front of their tribes men to invoke fear in the Kanak people who tried to challenge their regime the execution site is now known as the “Memorial of Uvanu” (Lambert, 2020)[2]. Comparably, in Jallianwala Bagh in Punjab, similar actions were taken by the British colony in India, where a large-scale massacre took place due to the protest against British imperialism (Pletcher, 2021).<br/>Tahrir square formerly known as Ismailia square in Cairo, Egypt is a location where protests, massacres and overthrowing of colonial regimes took place. The square was built under the request of the Sultanate of the autonomous entity of the Ottoman Empire that ruled Egypt; Khedive Ismail Pasha. It was designed to appropriate the Parisian boulevards of France after his visit to the French capital in the mid 1800s. Although the architectural design of the area was finalized in his era; the square’s construction was finished in the 1900s. The structure of the square and the surrounding context has undergone many changes that symbolize the changing regimes and social classes in the country.<br/><br/>The main research will focus on examining Egypt in the 1900s as a French postcolonial nation. Consequently, it will address the extent in which Paris shaped the planning of Ismailia (Tahrir) square and its urban context, and how it changed over time. Furthermore, the thesis will address the impact of the shifting of political ideologies in Egypt that influenced these physical changes.<br/><br/>The thesis will inspect the varying photos of Tahrir square since it was first established till present. Furthermore, an examination of drawings found in archival architectural journals published by Sayed Karim in the 1940s is used to understand the various unrealised proposals for Tahrir. In addition and an observation of the political movements through news articles and official statements found on archival websites . Additionally, Journal articles and books explaining the culture of Egyptian society and its effect on urban space will be reflected to support the argument. Finally, an excursion has been conducted where i visited the Nile Ritz Carlton to view Tahrir from a different perspective. <br/><br/>My Hypothesis is that Tahrir square and its urban context greatly resembles the Parisian boulevards in terms of urban planning and architectural design as seen in the photographs found in ‘Paris Along the Nile’. However, due to its extensive history in Egypt’s many revolutions, it gradually transformed to represent Egyptian various identities in spite of its French reference.<br","AR2A011; NATIONALISIM; IDENTITY; PERSEVERANCE; Redevelopment; POST-COLONILISM; Egypt; modernism","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Architectural Design Crossovers","AR2A011",""

To accomplish so, the thesis focuses on and investigates the case of Shree Jagannatha Temple in Puri, which was built in the 12th century. The temple serves as the spiritual heart of Hinduism, one of the world’s oldest religions. As one of the country’s ‘Char Dhams (four prominent Hindu temple locations),’ it is crucial to the city’s economy. The inflow of pilgrims to the temple on significant occasions like the Ratha Yatra (Chariot Journey) surpassed the support system’s basic capacities. Grand Road (main road) for key religious rites degraded over time as a result of commercialization of the surrounding area, leading to illegal settlements as well. The urbanization of the area surrounding the temple has also adulterated the temple’s pinnacle’s visibility. The government of Odisha has presented a plan by Puri Konark Development Authority to transform the city of Puri into a world heritage city by 2031 in order to protect the temple and its significance. The thesis examines three architectural dimensions – setting, scale, and space – to better comprehend the factors that influenced the government’s decision. The research is limited to the urban changes in the 19th century, 20th century, and latest developments because considerable urban growth occurred in the last few decades.

Architecture always has a social aspect to it, since designs are made for the people. Social interactions were already studied in the 1930s as the Noordoostpolder is being developed, but did they influence the architecture in any way? Things were adjusted to make the designs of each design aspect more suitable for the new inhabitants. These things included more leisure space in greenery around villages, a design for Kraggenburg which was solely formed by social layers in the community and changes in the floorplans of the farmhouses to accommodate for the function of a farm. These changes were broad, however, and not adjusted to specific parameters that would follow from the selection. This was a very difficult task to achieve, due to the varying characters within the selection, the resistance by the Direction itself and the lack of knowledge about the candidates at the time of the design phase.","AR2A011; Urban Design; Architecture; Sociography; Granpré Molière; Pieter Verhagen; Henri ter Veen; Piet Dingemans; Kraggenburg; Noordoostpolder","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","AR2A011",""

These schools have different educational methods to determine if it influences the portrayal of the theme. The designs of each of these schools stress the collective. They define the collective as non-hierarchic and approach it on different scales. The individual is easily identifiable within the collective and functions as a building stone for the collective. Therefore the individual is portrayed as strong and independent with their own identity. For the individual to develop in such a way, the schools are designed as a warm and safe place where children feel at home. Verhoeven accomplishes this by using the human scale, nature, simplicity, and fantasy. Lastly, the collective contributes to creating a warm and safe place such that the individual can develop well. Therefore in his school buildings, the collective helps the individual, and the individual is fundamental to the collective.

This research investigates how architecture was used as an expression of political ideology in the public architecture of Hermann Henselmann and Hans Scharoun in East and West Berlin. The research is conducted through a literature study and compares four case studies: the Philharmonie and State Library in the West, Haus des Lehrers and the Fernsehturm in the East. An exploration into the architectural context of Berlin, the theory of architecture as a political tool and the biographies of the architects result in an analysis of the case studies on three themes: monumentality, community and reference to the past. The research concludes that common goals which the GDR and FGR both aimed to achieve through architecture were to: gain the trust of their population, propagate themselves as the better side and to create a sense of identity among their population. Whereas the West mainly concerned itself with expression to the United States, the East primarily wanted to demonstrate its competence to the other side. Scharoun’s designs clearly fitted the FGR’s ideology whereas Henselmann’s designs were not always the result of his agreement with the political leadership or vision, but rather based on a deeper incentive to design architecture that suited the new socialist society. <br","AR2A011; politics; architecture; Cold war; Scharoun; Henselmann; Public architecture","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","AR2A011",""

At a time when problems such as the spread of AIDS, homelessness, drug abuse, and prostitution were heavily portrayed as inherently related to the queer community, trans people of color were specifically and disproportionately affected by this political climate. In combination with the lack of security they faced in public spaces, this community was forced to use ballrooms to shape their own places of encounter away from the public eye. Drag shows became an escape and a support system through the creation of Houses, intangible structures of kinship, that hosted the grad shows and occasionally provided physical shelter to queer homeless teenagers. However, beyond the hidden ballrooms, part of this community remained in the public eye appropriating parks, piers, and whole streets in unconventional ways. The informality, and often illegality, of these ephemeral spaces resulted in a lack of documentation of the presence of this community in urban and architectural systems and their relation to the city as a whole. Consequently, there is a missing piece in both black and queer history and their relationship to the built environment. This historical research uses the work of queer theorists of the 20th century such as George Chauncey and Laud Humphreys, whose discourse focuses almost exclusively on gay white men, to expand the narrative to transgender women of color. Additionally, with the support of historical photographic material, such as the work of Chantal Regnault and Leonard Fink, it analyzes how this community related to public space and how it shaped discretely the urban uses of Manhattan. It exposes the duality of the queer public space, on one hand, related to the secrecy of ballroom, and on the other, to the public development of queer life. It explains how these two realities existed in the city simultaneously and intertwined.","AR2A011; Transgender; Drag Ballroom; Public space quality; New York City","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","AR2A011",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","The scope of this thesis is set to examine the immediate relation of a city’s public spaces to the daily life of its citizens and portray how this relationship evolves. The location under examination is the city center of Athens, Greece. Specifically, focus will be given on two major public squares, namely Syntagma square and Omonia square. Syntagma square functions as a front stage for the Athenian citizen. Its location being right in front of the Hellenic Parliament strongly influences the uses and activities that take place. In contrast, Omonia square stands as a backstage of public life in the city center. Importantly, these two squares are closely located and are linked together via the axis of Panepistimiou and Stadiou streets. Both comprise some of the busiest streets in the center of the capital and play an integral role in the function of the city. Therefore, the squares, being linked through such important arteries in the circulation network of the city, gain significant importance in the context of the public life.<br/><br/>The analysis will focus on the observations and recordings of human activities (movement/flow, behavior, and occupation) that are taking place in these public squares. Open observation will help to understand how the structured outdoor public sphere is being used and whether it controls its user. The question of ownership, a fundamental issue in regard to public spaces, directly affects and influences how the public space is used. Hence, I aim to understand who owns these public squares and how this influences their design and structure. Are private interests and goals favored over the interests of the public? If that’s the case and local actors are not consulted prior to and during development, this may result in the construction of public spaces that only serve upper- and middle-class individuals and add to socioeconomic and ethnic exclusion and segregation. <br/><br/>To this purpose, I will analyze case-studies chronologicaly in relation to the changing context (pre- and mid- pandemic conditions) and will aim to identify all relevant changes occurring on these squares. I will focus on public activities in the years 2011 and 2022. For the observation of 2011, as a comparative period, I will rely on Dr. Fani Kostourou’s research that analyzes human activities in the center of Athens at that time under non pandemic conditions. This work will serve as a basis for my analysis which focuses on the pandemic conditions of the year 2022. <br/><br/>Between 2011 and 2020 numerous events took place which resulted in profound changes in the public space. Furthermore, the pandemic drastically affected the public sphere and the overall human activity in it. The essay is going to identify how user’s’ behavior changed in relation to the squares’ new layout and analyze the impact that an unprecedented pandemic environment has had on the public sphere of the city.<br","AR2A011; Public Space; Human Activity; Pandemic; Privately Owned Public Space","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","AR2A011","37.975500, 23.734900"

(mentor); Hein, C.M. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Building an oil fairy-tale investigates oil’s potency as a socio-cultural force and its role in shaping civic spaces in Stavanger, Norway. It posits that the Nordic city represents an exemplary case study on the complex and co-dependent interaction between petroleum and architecture. Since the discovery of oil in Norway in the late 1960s, the historically peripheral Nordic nation has experienced a remarkable economic, social, cultural, and architectural transformation. The rapid and comprehensive transition towards a petroleumscape has given rise to the term ‘oljeevntyret’ or the oil fairy-tale in the Norwegian lexicon. The oil fairy-tale has functioned as a reflection of changing socio-cultural conditions and a potent device to perpetuate an energy culture reflected in Stavanger’s architecture, cultural practices, economic developments, governmental policies, and visual expressions over the past decades. Following a general analysis of the national and local historical context, the thesis uses four architectural case studies in Stavanger, supported by archival and contemporary writings and media, to demonstrate how the city’s oil fairy-tale and civic spaces have developed in a feedback loop. Oil actors’ political and economic sway has created a new class of oil-civic spaces in Stavanger. In turn, these oil spaces’ narrative potentials contribute to an ever-expanding petroleumscape and celebration of oil as a heroic and Norwegian product. As the end of the oil age looms closer and cities around the world, including Stavanger, strive to imagine a post-oil future, we must appreciate the power and extent of oil in shaping our everyday spaces. Only then may we engage meaningfully in imagining a post-oil city future for cities that have become deeply drenched in oil.","AR2A011; oil spaces; Norway","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","AR2A011","58.9700, 5.7331"

The rich history of SF Chinatown battling a diversity of forces intruding on its survivability, has transformed and acclimatized the neighborhood to have social, political and economic mechanisms to adapt and mutate to an ever-changing ethnic urban landscape. A chronological approach has been applied to highlight major events within SF Chinatown’s history that reveal significant factors and mechanisms that amalgamate in the neighborhood’s current urban resilience. The story begins with colonial expansion that attracted many Chinese laborers to America, where increasing racial hostility forced Chinese immigrants into ethnic enclaves like SF Chinatown in 1850. The development of district Associations created a cohesive and self-sufficient community that protected itself from continued racial hostility. The 1906 earthquake and fire, built a foundation of oriental tourism that solidified Chinatowns permanence, creating a mutually beneficial relationship with the hegemonic white society. Increased urban redevelopment of the financial district during the 1960s, inspired civil rights movements that mobilized and empowered the Chinese American population to renegotiate their rights. The aforementioned historically rooted mechanisms accompanied with new community initiatives, enables SF Chinatown to continuously adapt and mutate to internal and external forces of change, which has and will continue to cement its place in the heart of the city.","","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","AR2A011",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","CIAM’s Charter of Athens and Le Corbusier’s books stipulated new urban planning and new laws of architecture. The theory of the modern architectural movement, which defines the principles of modern cities, has been systematically applied since the construction of the French apartment complex. “Mapo Apartment” was the first complex-type apartment in South Korea built by the government in 1962, and Korean call it “Apatu.” However, contrary to the original intention of modernist high-rise apartments, it actually played an object of desire as an urban landmark for the upper class of South Korea. Over the next sixty years, apartments have completely established themselves as Korea’s representative residential typology, and about four hundreds thousands housing units continue to be produced until now under the leadership of large capital.<br/><br/> First, a comparative analysis between US and Korea explains the success and failure of modern architecture. This movement of modernization appeared in different forms between US and Korea. “Pruitt-Igoe” in US can be said to be “a house is a machine for living in” as a product of industrialization. It was an apartment building to accommodate a sudden increase in the urban population, but it soon faced limitations symbolizing poor management, poor architectural beauty, and poor living conditions. On the other hand, Korea’s “Apatu” was, conversely, used as a tool for industrialization. At that time, the government built “Apatu” to urbanize the capital city Seoul, thereby achieving the goal of increasing the population and development of the city. Since then, “Apatu” has successfully operated as “A house is a machine for industrializing,” which symbolizes modernized and luxurious lifestyles. <br/> <br/> Next, the history of Apatu will be studied. The Korean modernity of the modernist ideal proposal will be investigated. In Korea, the history of high-rise housing called Apatu can be largely divided into three stages. From the early 1930s to the 1960s, it was used as a solution to solve the housing problem in Seoul in the process of modernization after the Korean War. However, from the 1970s, the target class of Apatu was changed to the middle class, and from that time the supply of it began in earnest. In the process, private construction companies participated in the industry. After that, There was fierce competition between major construction companies, and as a result, Apatu product of more value than necessary continued to be produced. Since then, each construction company has taken various strategies to sell Apatu to the public at a higher price.<br/><br/> Le Corbusier’s utopian theory was left as a dystopia of commercialization of architecture contrary to his intention through the process of Korean modernization. As a result, major elements closely related to the residential environment, such as school districts of good quality and comfortable infrastructure have been determined depending on which brand’s apartment complex it is, which soon caused a continuous rise in its housing prices. In other words, it has served as a place for reproduction, where wealth is continuously transferred and high-quality education is provided. Fundamental solutions will be studied to overcome the problems created by the top-down development of such standardized housing.","AR2A011; Apartment Building; Korea","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","AR2A011",""

Finally, the thesis reaches its apex by tackling the symbolism of the 432 Park Avenue needle skyscraper, a building which plays a more important role in the trading market, rather than in the sheltering sphere, something which signals an entirely new way of understanding this type of expensive architecture. Ultimately, by constantly shifting the scale of focus, as well as addressing architectural projects of varying typologies and urban functions, this thesis hopes to emphasize that Manhattan is a product of a design motivated by finances, a far cry from more historically established cities such as London or Paris.","AR2A011; Manhattan; Architecture; New York City; Money","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","AR2A011","40.783100, -73.971200"

It investigates not contested women's contribution to architecture development, as they are unquestionably underexplored and underappreciated. Women's participation in the construction of Polish cities remains a blank page in the literature, with only a few names of female architects appearing infrequently. This paper aims to track down female architects working and those unnoticed in the descriptions, to identify the reasons for and differences in the architectural education of people in Poland during the chosen time.<br/>More specifically, the research investigates the beginnings of the ""wives' school"" (Szkoła żon) dates to 1927, established by architect Władysław Jastrzębski and architect Aleksander Kapuściński and Dr. architect Mieczysław Popiel, that was primely called “Female Architectural Courses” (Żeńskie Kursy Architektoniczne). This incongruous name came from the focus of female education on being architects' wives and drafting technicians working in their studios. In 1960 the name of the school was changed to the Stanislaw Noakowski State School of Architecture (Żeńskie Liceum Architektury im. Stanisława Noakowskiego). Since 1970 the school has had a co-educational character and function as a technical High School of construction engineering and architecture (technikum Architektoniczno – Budowlane), graduating with a Building Technician title.<br/>In post-war Poland, women were educated not only as architects but also as housewives according to 20th-century standard, so-called ""Mother Pole"" (Matka Polka) – family-focused, musical, talented in painting and interior design. Therefore, the curriculum included building-related subjects and those enriching ""sensitivity"" and ""imagination"" such as ""The Sunlight in Architecture"" or ""Musicology"". The original idea was to organise during design classes. The pieces performed were, of course, related to the theme of the architectural project.<br/>In the pre-war period, the school was completed by 150 - 200 female graduates , obtaining the title of architectural technician, not an architect, which prevented them from potentially starting their businesses, building projects, or signing plans. Their only position opportunity was to work as an assistant to an architect or drafter. There is no documentation of their later fates, as nobody recorded and stored data about technicians.

The Smithsons conceived the concept as a solution to the lack of public space on ground level due to the proliferation of automobiles, envisaging a vibrant uplifted public life. Hence, the notion gained critical acclaim in the early 1960s since it was also a response to the rigid urban planning of CIAM, prioritized community as a critical fragment in design and no long treated human as functioning machines. Nevertheless, the notion received increasingly negative feedback as more housing following this concept was built and gradually became viewed as a castle in the air. Scholars and the public no longer perceived the idea as a feasible design solution for the society. This thesis will deconstruct the concept through historical and socio-political lenses using three reference projects: Golden Lane Competition, Park Hill Estate and Robin Hood Gardens. The thesis investigates also the external and internal forces that turned ‘streets-in-the-sky’ into a castle in the air. The paper would be divided into three parts to understand the development and decline of the notion. What were the driving forces that fostered the formulation of ‘streets-in-the-sky’? How did architects implement this architectural theory into practical usage? What were the factors that led to negative public perception of the notion? Although the original ideas were not able to materialize as perfectly as expected in the 1960s, the urban values and historical values are inherited and engender an immense impact to later city development as vertical connection cores and elevated walkways re-appeared in metropolises in the recent decades.","AR2A011; streets-in-the-sky; Alison and Peter Smithson; social housing; uplifted public life; human association; identity","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","AR2A011",""

Despite this, traditional Thai accommodation represents Thainess as Thai people believe. Yet it is rarely found, particularly in Bangkok's capital city. Ruean Thai seems obsolete, unnecessary, and complicated design from a modern perspective. Some traditional Thai houses still exist, but many are old and neglected and will devalue over time. How has traditional Thai housing been devalued? Modernization is undoubtedly one factor that influences the alteration of Thai residential design. Conversely, what if it began before modernization after the twentieth century?<br/>Between the 15th and 19th centuries, there was extensive Western colonization across the world. Colonization happened during the Ayutthaya period, from 1350 to 1765, until the relocation of the capital city to Bangkok from 1765 to 1930. The introduction of Western culture in Siam/Thailand began in 1517, establishing Ayutthaya's first trading contact with western nations. As a result, westernization had a substantial role in Siam's development and transformation in every field, including the Thai domestic sector. By influencing Culture, Political, Christian religion, new constructions, and materials from the other side of the world into Ayutthaya. The hypothesis of the extinction of Ruean Thai is not only about westernization but also the consideration of the Siam political and social aspects. The transition from Feudalism in Ayutthaya (1350-1868) to before the beginning of democracy (1868-1934) is crucial to understanding how feudalism and patriarchy caused a shift and devaluation in traditional dwelling identity? During the colonial period, how did political and social issues influence the designs of traditional Thai households in terms of architectural orientation and ornamentation vocabulary? What impact does the decline of feudalism and the more equality society has on building orientation? <br/>Towards investigating the Ruean Thai extinction process in the context of Thailand's political history, this thesis also explores and analyses the transformation between three different Thai housing characteristics. Namely Thub Kwan Royal Residence (1911), The House on Sathorn (1899), and Baan Na Navee (1887).

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","The projects: Plan Voisin, Broadacre City and Futurama, of the three architects: Le Corbusier, Frank Lloyd Wright and Norman Bel Geddes, are all three based upon the criticism the architects had on the design of their contemporary city’s and the mobility within these urban structures. The coming up of the automobile had consequences for the city and its traffic, and the three architects called the contemporary cities no longer suited for this new mode of transport. With the coming up of the automobile, the ordinary man is able to travel with the units of the new standard, and it is this new standard that laid the groundwork for all three projects. It is in this architectural history thesis that the development of the vision for the future of mobility between 1925 and 1940 is investigated. The research question that was used in this thesis was the following: What effect did the growing influence of the car have on the ideas of the role and position of mobility in the city of the future? The chronological first of the three is Le Corbusier, he envisioned the automobile to travel at speeds never seen before, and it is this speed that gives a city its success. Within his Plan Voisin, verticality is used to create space. The separation of pedestrian and motorised vehicles creates the opportunity for superhighways to give the automobiles the possibilities to connect city and country with speed. Wright later reacted to this verticality, blaming the liveability of the city. Stating with his Broadacre City that with the automobile and the highways, it is should not be speed but space that must be achieved for the ordinary man. Space, the decentralization due to the technology of the times, gives the ordinary man the possibility to prosper, and therefore create a successful urban design. Norman Bel Geddes and his Futurama came back with the verticality and the centralization of the city, but expresses that the speed of the automobile, with its highways, had no place in the urban structures. Where there is space, there is speed, according to Geddes, so the highway systems should be designed outside of the city, in order to efficiently connect the country with the city and vice versa. Thus, the coming up of the car influenced the mobility and the plans for the city of the future, over time in different ways. It was the speed of the automobile that first gave incentive for this change in urban design. This speed was later used to create space outside of the city, to pursue what could not be found within the city. But it is due to this mobility of the automobile that finally gave incentive to return the interest back to the city. By implementing efficient highways the connection between city and country could be restored, and it is this restoration of the city and its traffic that influenced the ideas for the plan of the city of the future.","AR2A011; Plan Voisin; Broadacre City; Futurama; Le Corbusier; Frank Lloyd Wright; Norman Bel Geddes; Mobility; Automobile; Influence of the car; City of the future","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","AR2A011",""

In the first part, this paper will investigate how coal energy framed current architecture and infrastructure, which indicate why Poland and Bulgaria are reluctant to act due to their deep-rooted energy grids. The analysis of urban economic changes through satellite maps and archived photos in Poland and Bulgaria will demonstrate how their regional urban redevelopment gives urban planners directions for future transition. The last part explores new standards of living comfort for inhabitants to follow to propose new design schemes that architects and engineers should implement. This is supported by evaluations of building design strategies from existing projects.

Therefore, the need to transform the linear material flows towards circular chains is increasing. Steel is a material that is produced and used globally and has high potentials for recycling. However, in the maritime sector, steel is currently barely recycled, let alone reused in a more direct way. Maritime manufacturing is a vital industry in the province of South-Holland, strengthened by a strong knowledge network. The aim of this project is to localise and extend the steel life cycle, to create an environmentally and socially sustainable province in which maritime manufacturing can grow in a responsible way. In order to close the loops, the R-ladder is used as a framework for circular material flows in the manufacturing industry and in the participation of the citizens. A local steel life cycle for maritime manufacturing will be achieved through the connection of the steel using maritime companies in Rotterdam and the Drecht Cities with the steel production company of TATA Steel in IJmuiden. Missing links in the cycle, a secondary steel processing company and ship disassembly companies, will be brought to the province, providing a new purpose to the Port of Rotterdam when fossil fuels phase out. The transition to material circularity will be made possible through innovations in modular shipbuilding and renewable fuels. Innovation centres in the maker's industry will bridge between knowledge and practice. The consumers will be involved in the material transition through community re-hubs in their cities, where they can share, reuse and recycle products. In this strategy, the extensive water network will function as a backbone along which spatial developments will take place. The water backbone will be a connector for both public transport and industrial transport. This strategy for a transition towards circular steel flows in maritime manufacturing, can be an incentive and inspiration for other manufacturing sectors to close their material cycles.","circular economy; maritime manufacturing; R-ladder of Circularity; steel; urban manufacturing; Participation","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Urbanism","AR2U086 R&D Studio – Spatial Strategies for the Global Metropolis",""

At the same time the native Latvian population belong to rural peasantry who had almost no rights. However, as result of serfdom emancipation and the rapid industrialization of the 19th century, Riga’s population experienced massive growth as many rural peasants came to city in hope for better lives. With it the population growth came the urban developments that would shape the urban fabric of the city for ages to come.

Through the ideas of space and power by Paul-Michel Foucault and the embedded relationships between physical space and urban inequality we can investigate how the city was shaped according to the ruling class.

This is no different in the field of architecture. When designing the built environment, the white man is still the norm and within the work field, the man still fills the majority of the higher positions in architectural firms. However, women have a different, more care-centric view of the environment than men, which enables them to look at buildings with a broader perspective and to enhance them substantially with other qualities. The feminist theory “ethics of care” explores the issue of how historically the primary responsibility of women has been taking care of others. This research connects the theory of ethics of care to the history of feminised domestic work and uses the historical progression of the women's advisory committee to examine the role of this theory within housing. In the Dutch housing sector, <i>Vrouwenadviescommissies</i> (Women’s Advisory Committees, VAC) of voluntary women have been set up since 1946 to assess the quality of use of dwellings and the living environment from the point of view of the residents, using their situated knowledge as housewives. The VAC Hengelo was founded in 1957 to provide housing quality advice within the major reconstruction task of this city, which was bombed in 1944, and was the first VAC in the region of Twente. This thesis aims to expose the difference between the male and female views on housing by giving examples of the female perspective through the case study of the VAC Hengelo during the years 1957 to 2017. Primary data collection has been done by interviewing former members of the VAC Hengelo and the housing association Welbions, and through archival research at the Municipality Hengelo. This secondary data was collected by doing literature research, with Carol Gilligan and her theory of the ethics of care, and Silvia Federici, with her theory of reproductive labour, being the leading sources. The case study of the VAC Hengelo is used to fill the research gap of the theoretical framework with the role that housewives have played in housing design through the Women's Advisory Committee. Background information on the origin of the VAC in general, the history of Hengelo during this period and the VAC Hengelo is provided to establish historical insight. The case study of the VAC Hengelo reveals, by examples, how the feminist concept of ethics of care could perfectly work as a background explanation of how women, through history, made choices in the design of housing in a different, broadening and more inclusive perspective than men.<br","AR2A011; housing; care; Women's Advisory Committees; gender; Hengelo","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","AR2A011","52.2574121, 6.7927725"

Furthermore, Norman and Donald worked both at SOM could also explain the similarities, while Norman also worked on the House for Cheerful Living project.

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","In his influential work ‘On collective Memory’, French sociologist Maurice Halbwachs described an intrinsic relationship between the past and present, a reconfiguration of the perceived past through the lens of its current generation’s ideas and experiences. This represents an increasing challenge in the urban realm due to the growing amount of historized fragments left within its fabric as a result of the modern societal obsession of leaving traces behind. This thesis therefore investigates what influence commemorative architecture has today as integral parts of our city and the negotiation necessary to work this historized palimpsest. To do this, the city of Vienna, Austria will be investigated as the turbulent decades following WWII led to a first reconstruction of national memory based on a founding lie in its ‘Opferthese’. Once that mythos crumbled in the 1980s, it resulted in palpable shifts of its collective memory which were materialised in a tangible form through monuments around the city. Through an excursion to Vienna, the circumstances leading to the construction of three prominent monuments, their performance and the broader developments of Vienna’s memory politics were studied. Local and foreign papers on Vienna’s past century and collective memory, historical photographs, newspaper reports, vocal reactions to the unveiling of the monuments, personal writings as well as archival research formed a supplementary background to the excursion for this study. The thesis investigates it through three parts, foremost, it creates an overview of the events shaping memory politics in Vienna post WWII. This historical understanding will be accompanied by a theoretical framework on the concept of collective memory based on predominantly on the theories of Maurice Halbwachs and Pierre Nora. The second portion will include thorough case studies of three important Viennese memorials: ‘Judenplatz Holocaust Memorial’ (2000), ‘Memorial against War and Fascism’ (1988) and ‘Deserter Monument’ (2014). This chapter will connect them to the context of their realisation, historical site context, design, and spatial performance. Thereby, understanding how collective memory forms public space and its perception through physical edifices. Lastly, the paper forms a connection between the theoretical ideas and their physical manifestations. Through a broader view of urban effects, the findings of the research and the dialogue between them, it hypothesises on the increasing historicization of our cities, its memorial landscape and the constant negotiation architects and inhabitants face in the context of our palpable past.","Collective Memory; Public Space; Memory and Space; 20th Century Vienna; Architecture and Politics; Commemorative Architecture","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","AR2A011","48.208200, 16.373800"

The role that high-rise plays in the city of Rotterdam has been developing throughout the years and started becoming more important. Through literature and municipal archival research, the significance of high-rise buildings and their role have been explored through three different aspects: cultural physical and economical. High-rise buildings emerged from the culture of congestion but were merely used as a tool for the densification of the city after World War II. While the early urban planning did not address high-rise buildings it laid down the urban foundation for the designated high-rise zones in the city. With the exponential growth the municipality set up policies for high-rise buildings to keep the built environment in check. Because of the lack of historic city value of Rotterdam, the high-rise buildings and structures form the iconic image of the city. While high-rise buildings fulfil their role of accommodating people it also functions as a tool for city branding to not only promote the city but also revitalize the built environment However, high-rise buildings can also have a negative impact on the social wellbeing of its users. Both anonymity and the lack of connection with the public realm high-rise buildings can bring more harm than good to its users. Although the municipality is already addressing this problem in their most recent high-rise policy and urban planning it appears from this research that it is important to explore how high-rise buildings can sustain communities and the future generations.","AR2A011; High-rise Buildings; Rotterdam; urban planning; city marketing","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","AR2A011",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Berlage completed the design for the expansion plan of the south of Amsterdam in 1904. This plan was approved by the local council, but did not remain uncriticized. Among others, J.H.W. Leliman commented that the plan did not meet the demand for affordable housing and suspected the direct implementation of Camillo Sitte’s theories. Berlage himself preferred a monumental approach and he often referred to the Paris development by Haussmann. However, at that time, monumental urban planning in Amsterdam was received as provoking and this was not accepted by the local council. The execution of the first ‘Plan Zuid’ delayed, among others as a consequence of the First World War. Ten years later, in 1914, the plan had to be revised. Fortunately for Berlage the discourse on monumental urban planning took off in the interim period. In 1914, Berlage gave four lectures about urbanism. The quoted sources in these lectures are consulted to gain a deeper understanding of Berlage’s Theories. Berlage explained the historic development of urban growth. Because of the subjective individual style and the lack of a generic style it was impossible to obtain a coherent cityscape without regulations by authority. For a coherent cityscape, an urban plan should not only contain the street layout and the division of land, it should include how to build on the created plots as well. Additionally, a façade influences the street and eventually the city and that is why this should not be left to the individual. Consequently it would be ideal to develop an entire block of housing at once. However, this also led to monotonous façades. Thus, to stimulate the development of an entire block façade with architectural quality, it was unavoidable to use regulation and provide economic advantages. When Berlage revised ‘Plan Zuid’, which was approved in 1917, he created the monumental urban plan he preferred. Regulating the execution of the plan started with experimental committees. The influence of the committees concerned the assessment of submitted designs and increased by providing silhouettes as a framework for architects. Eventually the ‘Commissie Zuid’ was appointed in 1925. The members of the committee worked extremely precise. The designs were discussed and adjusted many times before they were approved. They had a considerable influence on the execution of ‘Plan Zuid’, of which the quality relied on the regulation of the execution.","Blockfront; 'Plan Zuid'; Berlage; Monumental","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","AR2A011",""

Finally a comparison is drawn between the two painters.<br/>The paper has established that Mucha grew up in Moravia, which had been struggling for independence from the Austro-Hungarian Empire. This struggle motivated Mucha to create art that would legitimize Czech independence and would emphasize that the various Slav nations were not inferior to their German oppressors. His nationalist art therefore mainly focused on various scenes from Czech and broader Pan-Slavic history. <br/>Vasnetsov lived in the Russian Empire, where progressives promoted Western liberalist policies as a possible solution to class inequality and poverty. Vasnetsov saw this Westernization as a threat to his heritage and therefore decided to preserve aspects of Russian culture that he deemed beautiful. He therefore painted in the folkloric and religious genre, since they symbolized an abstract strength and hope in a local solution of the problem. <br/>Consequently the nationalist sentiments in Mucha’s work are intended to institute change in Czech society, while Vasnetsov’s nationalism is less politically involved, but aims to provide comfort in times of despair.<br","Alphonse Mucha; Viktor Vasnetsov; Pan-Slavism; Russian Revival","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","AR2A011",""

When abortion was considered a controversial topic in society, this work has successfully contributed to sharing public awareness about the risks of illegal unsafe abortions performed in countries in which this medical practice was not allowed by the government. This abortion clinic inside a shipping container sailed the ocean in several sea campaigns, and later made its debut in the art world, such as in the Exhibition at the Venice Biennale in 2001. The A-Portable is not a stand-alone example in the history of feminism, and since the 19th century with the suffragist movements, art has been frequently used as a medium in feminist history. Other examples of art activism are mentioned in the paper, such as the public performance of the feminist Serbian artist Tanja Ostojić at the same Venice Biennale, and the more recent research of the American architect and author Lori Brown, who in 2013 published the book “Contested Spaces”, about improving the architectural features of abortion clinics for women’s wellbeing.<br/><br/>The following research takes into consideration several sources regarding the history of abortion rights and the action of WoW, to contextualize and explain the influence of art in the women’s emancipation process. Moreover, through an interview with Joep Van Lieshout, the artist’s point of view has also been crucial to find a complete answer to the research question. The final findings will demonstrate that art has always been a powerful media used by politics, and in this case, has created an opportunity for WoW to make a change in the public and private spheres. In the public, it served to stimulate people’s empathy around the topic of legal abortion, while in the private it created a safe space and a shelter from the violent opposition movements, finding physical and psychological help while performing this delicate medical procedure. <br","Feminism; Activism; Social art; social architecture","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","Architectural History Thesis",""

These new revelations prove that there is still a lot to learn about the complex social systems of different ethnicities, classes and genders in the former Dutch East Indies during the colonisation. In the early 19th century, the Netherlands colonised the former Dutch East Indies (now the Republic of Indonesia). Dutch families and individuals inhabited the former Dutch East Indies from colonisation until the Indonesian National Revolution. With the introduction of the Kodak camera for private use at the end of the 19th century, family life in the former Dutch Indies was choreographed, captured and documented through photographs. The galleries of the family homes, where domestic scenes are enlivened in the comfortable shelter by walls on three sides of the outside room, are often the backdrop of these photographs. Accordingly, “Captured on the Gallery” examines how Dutch and Indonesian women were portrayed on these galleries at the beginning of the 20th century. An image analysis based on preserved pictures by the Tropenmuseum in Amsterdam provides insights into the gallery’s spatial features and how these concerned Dutch and Indonesian women. As a result of close examination, galleries can be considered a befitting place for the daily practices of both Dutch and Indonesian women. This result appertains to the gallery’s liminality that establishes a safe transitional space between indoors and outdoors. This liminal space allows women to simultaneously perform domestic work and connect with their surroundings. Moreover, pictures of the galleries prove that boundaries between Dutch families and their Indonesian domestic workers could dissolve and become explicitly pertinent. Altogether, the results of this research shed light on the ethnical, social and economic differences between Dutch and Indonesian women in the former Dutch East Indies.","Galleries; Indonesian Women; Dutch Women; Domestic portrayal; Liminal space","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","AR2A011",""

Urban revolt is examined alongside urban diversity and correlations between two seemingly unrelated phenomena are explored. The first part of the research revisits archival work and historical maps to examine Exarcheia's morphological, social, and cultural characteristics. In particular, the author reviews urban revolt actions in Exarcheia throughout the neighbourhood's recent history. The second part of the research goes on to apply a six-step workflow to quantify and map urban diversity in the area of Exarcheia. The diversity map created through this workflow is used to assess which urban activities may make Exarcheia particularly diverse, and whether diversity is correlated with urban revolt actions.

Circularity is currently hardly integrated into the ship manufacturing sector, as the lifecycle of most ships follows a linear path. The cycle starts with raw metals being extracted from the earth, ending with scrap steel being poorly recycled for other sectors in Asia. Because of the lack of a global regulatory framework, and the growing capacity and capability pressures on the ship recycling business in Europe, the business will not be able to process the increasing number of ships to be recycled in the future.<br/><br/>To generate a spatial vision and strategy to solve these issues, which helps transition to a more circular ship manufacturing sector, this research uses evidence-based design. Several methods are used including literature research, data analysis, site analysis, and research by design.<br/><br/>This is done to work towards the final goal: integrating spatial, technological, and regulatory solutions into the ship manufacturing business of South Holland, to build circularity into every stage of the ship’s lifecycle. Essential in reaching this goal, is safeguarding the ship manufacturing sector, which is in a vulnerable position, in symbiosis with resilience, innovation, collaboration, and transparency.<br/><br/>In the end, the province of South Holland will be a world-leading example demonstrating more circular ship manufacturing in the port of Rotterdam. Spatially, this will result in a better port-city relationship, where ship manufacturing is embedded and mixed with other activities where possible, creating a synergy between different stakeholders. In addition, flows are connected by sustainable water transport.<br/><br/>By transitioning to a more circular ship manufacturing sector, the port of Rotterdam can contribute to the mitigation of the negative effects of climate change and resource scarcity. Additionally, the port of Rotterdam and its shipbuilding sector is of great international importance, which means the implementation of circularity can stimulate change and benefit people from the local to the global scale.<br","ship manufacturing; circular economy; recycling industry; south holland; material flow","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Urbanism","AR2U086 R&D Studio – Spatial Strategies for the Global Metropolis",""

(graduation committee); Auping, W.L. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","In 2020, the world was hit by a global pandemic through COVID-19, causing millions of deaths worldwide. The last two years proved that a health-related crisis like COVID-19 strains us as a society and the capacities of health systems worldwide. Severe infections of COVID-19 require higher capacities of hospital beds, ICUs with ventilators and Personal Protective Equipment. For health systems, the question arises of how to secure enough PPE and ventilators before and during a health-related crisis like COVID-19.<br/>This research explores how health systems can create responsive and prepared supply strategies to meet the rising demand for critical medical supplies during health-related crises. Concerning the availability of critical medical supplies, preparedness entails stockpiling as a supply strategy. Furthermore, preparedness entails actions decision-makers in health systems can take to increase the effectiveness of responsive supply strategies. Responsiveness refers to supply strategies used at the beginning of a health-related crisis in the short term. Responsive supply strategies include ramping up domestic production, supporting innovations, loaning medical supplies, and purchasing medical supplies from the world market or through direct tender.<br/>In this research, a System Dynamics model was developed to explore how health systems can create resilient and responsive supply strategies, a System Dynamics model was developed, focusing on the English health system as an example for the Global North. Given the deep uncertainties surrounding the supply chain of critical medical supplies, Exploratory Modelling and Analysis was conducted to identify candidate policies and explore their performance given the uncertainties. Specifically, uncertainties affecting the success of purchasing supplies through direct tender and from the world market had the most impact on the availability of PPE and ventilators. <br/>The results of the analysis and the findings in the literature provide the following recommendations to decision-makers in health systems to create prepared and responsive supply strategies that ensure the availability of critical medical supplies during health-related crises. Decision-makers can implement (i) stockpiles exhibiting higher inventory levels than recommended, and no delays concerning the operation within the warehouse or the delivery of the medical supplies. Furthermore, it is suggested to (ii) implement diverse supplier frameworks and crisis frameworks, (iii) diversify supplier, (iv) implement stocks of raw material for domestic production. It is useful for decision-makers to apply several responsive supply strategies simultaneously. Furthermore, health systems can further investigate additional supply strategies.<br/>In this research, it is assumed that collaboration is not relevant nor of interest for the English health system. Hence, it would be interesting to explore the effect that sharing critical medical supplies between national health systems could have on the shortage of PPE and ventilators in the future.","Critical Medical Supplies; preparedness; Responsiveness; Supply Chain Strategies; Decision making; System Dynamcis; Exploratory Modelling and Analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","",""

(mentor); Negenborn, R.R. (graduation committee); Duinkerken, M.B. (graduation committee); Berkheij, J. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Background: With around 70 supermarkets, Hoogvliet is one of the smaller supermarkets in the Netherlands. During the past years, more companies have become aware of the importance of efficient reversed logistics (Senthil et al., 2018). By optimizing this return flow, the return hall of supermarkets plays an important role. With the expected increase of supermarkets that the same return hall must serve and the limited capacity of employees in mind, Hoogvliet wants to redesign its return hall. However, based on literature research, research is primarily done on reusable packaging systems instead of processes and the dynamics within a return hall. This article partly closes this knowledge gap with a conceptual design for the return hall of Hoogvliet, which gives insight in the efficient solutions and layouts within a return hall. Based on the brownfield of the return hall of Hoogvliets DC, this article aims to ‘design an efficient, flexible, scalable and future-proof return and packaging hall, which solves the capacity issues in employees and workspace and increases the throughput of containers per hour.’ <br/>Method: A design method is used, derived from Dym et al. (1999), containing five phases: problem definition, conceptual design, model and evaluate design, optimize and implement design, and conclusion. <br/>Results: Analysing the current situation shows that 23 main processes can be defined. The quantitative analysis shows that the transportation of loading carriers is one of the most labor-intensive jobs. For all of the 23 processes, three designs are made called ‘split waste and packaging’ (1), ‘carousel’ (2), and ‘completely automated’ (3). All these designs are simulated for three future scenarios. The simulation shows that design 2 has the best score for transport and loading. However, design 3 obtains a higher overall score. The disadvantage of design 3 is the long inbound queue. With some improvements, the second design will get the most stable performance in the future and has an inbound line that is acceptable for Hoogvliet. <br/>Implementation: The second design is advised to implement at the return hall of Hoogvliet. This could be done in different phases. First, Hoogvliet needs to make someone responsible for the implementation and coordination. One of his first tasks should be job standardization and allocation per employee, then relocating some sorting stations, and lastly, the different solutions could be implemented step by step. Per scenario, the estimated quantities per solution are given. Based on the developments in terms of growth, a separate floor is needed as a buffer zone for empty loading carriers, which is already part of the optimized second design of this thesis. <br/>Concluding: The (different) conceptual design(s) give insight that closes the knowledge gap: (1) Transportation within return halls with the same processes significantly impacts the workload and should be eliminated as far as possible. (2) In the short term (&lt;3 years), transport solutions could result in significant savings. (3) In the long term (&gt;3 years), advanced automated sorting systems have higher savings than minor improvements.","return hall; reversed logistics; conceptual design; efficiency; Sorting Process; Supermarket; roll container","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Transport, Infrastructure and Logistics","",""

Promising results have already been seen in structural weight, aerodynamic efficiency, high angle-ofattack handling qualities, and noise reduction ascribed to the over-wing installation of the engines. A nose cone model with interior components was established in a previous effort, together with a center-body trailing edge fairing to reduce the center-body pressure drag seen in the early aerodynamic studies. However, the models proved inadequate in generating designs reliably, hence the need for a redesign. The objective of the study at hand is to establish new parametric models that describe the shapes, perform a drag minimization study at cruise conditions that employs the Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes equations and establish a method that enables such a procedure for graduate projects. In the numerical nose cone optimization, the design space is bound by radar and nose landing gear storage, pilot seating, and windshield size. In addition, the fairing shape is constrained by the size of the galley that it accommodates. The parametric models are built on the Knowledge Based Engineering platform ParaPy. A total of 24 design parameters are used to design the nose cone shape, and 20 are used for the fairing shape. The parametric models are established in such a way that they can easily be extended with more design variables to increase the complexity of the shapes. The existing Salome-ParaPy interface was extended with the ability to build hybrid meshes that incorporate tetrahedral and prism cells. This allows for spatial discretization suitable for resolving the boundary layer. During the aerodynamic shape optimization, meshes with 5 million cells are used. The optimizer, which employs six processes simultaneously, is coupled with the High Performance Computing 12 cluster at TU Delft to ensure a decrease in computational time for the aerodynamic simulations. In a parallel structure, the computationally costly nose cone constraints are assessed simultaneously with evaluating the forces on the cluster. The fairing constraints are analyzed before calculating the aerodynamic force coefficients. The aerodynamic shape design is performed at a constant angle-of-attack of 3°, a cruise Mach number of 0.85, and an altitude of 13.000 m. Adding the unoptimized nose cone and fairing shapes increases the drag coefficient by 1.3%. After both optimizations, the drag is reduced by 3.4% compared to the unoptimized design and by 2.1% with respect to the baseline Flying-V. Despite the fact that the shock severity on the center-body is not decreased markedly, the pressure drag sees a significant decrease. Notwithstanding the large curvature of the optimized nose cone, separation is only found on the trailing edge of the optimized shape. The windshield area increases by roughly 50% relative to the windshield of the A350 and the A320.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Flying-V",""

Single-cell analysis is a method that is employed to gain further understanding of the working mechanisms on a single-cellular level. The controlled transport of substances through the cell membrane is important for studying the behaviour and responses of single living cells. Femtopipettes are used as a means to accurately target and sample cells with high viability rates. Different actuation principles exist for femtopipettes, but pressure actuation is identified as the most versatile and straightforward method. However, the volume dosing resolution of pressure driven femtopipettes lags behind other actuation methods. Throughout literature, the minimum reported dose is identified as 100 femtolitre (1 fL= 10^-15 L), achieved by applying a pressure pulse to a femtopipette. In this work, two new concepts are proposed and researched with the goal of increasing the volume dosing resolution of pressure driven femtopipettes. A multi-scale 3D printing strategy was employed where functional femtopipettes were successfully printed using two-photon-polymerization (2PP). The first concept incorporates a physical barrier in the form of a flexible membrane into the femtopipette. It was expected that the volume actuated by the deformation of the membrane could be controlled and calibrated. The deformation of 2PP printed membranes was characterized and the achieved volume displacement was well in the desired range of 100 fL. However, tests with liquid dosing did not succeed in achieving this same range, and difficulties were experienced with reproducibility. The second concept exploited the phenomenon of capillarity by incorporating axisymmetrical phaseguides as a means to control the position of the liquid-air meniscus. Consecutive geometrical steps were created that allowed for discrete and robust control over the liquid portion within the femtopipette. Step sizes of 10 picolitre (1 pL= 10^-12 L), 200 fL and 60 fL were fabricated and successfully tested, breaching beyond the current state of the art. This concept thus demonstrates both the level of customization and the unprecedented volume dosing resolution that was achieved.","Femtopipette; Microfluidics; microfluidic AFM cantilever; 2PP; DLP; Liquid dosing; multiscale 3d printing; Micropipette; two-photon polymerization; single-cell analysis; phaseguide; membrane","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-04-14","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Micro and Nano Engineering","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","This thesis has been commissioned by the Delft University of Technology for the course AR2A011 Architectural History Thesis. This thesis focusses on the city of Istanbul. Istanbul enjoyed a unique status as the capital city of two great civilisations: the Byzantine Empire and the Ottoman Empire. Over the centuries, the city absorbed and reflected the cultural heritage of its rulers; Eastern Orthodox Christianity followed by Islamic Ottoman civilisation. Its metamorphosis from “Roma Nova"" to the ""sacred city of Islam"" produced unparalleled configurations in its urban form. As a result of this, Istanbul nowadays faces great fragmentation of its urban plan. In this urban plan different heritage buildings and historic urban plans collide. The directory of this thesis will be to provide a solution on how in 21st century Istanbul can deal with its fragmented urban plan, while also preserving its complex heritage. Therefore the main question states: How should the fragmentation of Istanbuls urban plan be dealt with in the future, while preserving its heritage both ancient, historic and modern? In order to conclude on this several subquestion have been drawn up. These state: I. What ancient heritage, cultural and architectural, are still visible in Istanbul? II. How did the nineteenth century modernization movement in Istanbul viewed and dealt with the heritage? III. What are the main principles to deal with heritage? Which of these principles are applicable to the present day urban plan of Istanbul? <br/>Opening with an architectural survey of The Ancient, Byzantine and Ottoman city the complex heritage of Istanbul is explained. This is followed with the description of the late nineteenth modernization movement, essentially being a longing to the west, which contributed to the fragmented urban plan by implementing an architectural plurality in Istanbul. Finally in order to make a proposition, a framework by Janssen et al. is introduced that shows three approaches on how to deal or incorporate heritage in spatial design. <br/>Evidently, Istanbuls heritage both ancient, historic and modern is very complex. However the same heritage also created issues as mentioned above. Istanbuls urban plan needs to be revised in order to exterminate said issues. Therefore a mixed-mode model of dealing with heritage needs to be applied in order to preserve as much of the value of this heritage. By using heritage as a tool in spatial design, not only will the heritage be preserved but also eliminates the obvious roadblocks of progress that can be a result of preservation. Furthermore, the fragmentation of the urban plan can be brought to a minimum if the spatial vision on the future will see Istanbul as a whole.","Heritage; Istanbul; Fragmentation","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","AR2A011","41.008361, 28.980164"

In the rapidly transforming cities facing the process of hyper-urbanisation, the problem of street harassment, sexual abuse, and other forms of violence against women in public spaces escalated. Increasing social segregation and isolation, enhanced by new spatial planning and architectural typologies, adversely affected safety. In those enormous cities, women found opportunities to denounce the shared experience of violence through new forms of protest, organised and united. Since 1981, feminists from Latin America were building solidarity in the struggles to end violence against women at the regular meetings, Encuentros. One of the most relevant outcomes of those meetings was the novel idea of establishing the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women in 1981, which was later recognized by countries around the world. Demonstrations on the 25th of November, which followed that event, united masses of people in public protests. Through these and other demonstrations, women continued to gradually appropriate public space - following the way which was earlier marked by a movement from the 1970s, Las Madres. With the evolution of their presence in the city, feminists were able to reach out to the public. The multifaceted activism of women in the cities through protests, gatherings, performances, and press publications was significant for influencing the legislation and the social mentality. <br/><br/>This research traces from a historical perspective how women denounced violence and fought for their safety in the Latin American cities in the 1970s and 1980s. It recognizes how women discussed, condemned, and opposed patriarchal violence, looking at the feminist press articles and illustrations, photographs and audio-visual materials from the strikes and gatherings, interviews with the protagonists of the demonstrations, as well as previous research on the history of Latin American feminist movements and their fight for the right to the city. The study tackles the question of the role of the urban context in those struggles. Which were the threads of hyper-urbanisation and how did they affect women? What role has the appropriation of public space played for the feminist movements in creating new forms of protest, gaining exposure, and establishing social significance? My claim is that the new reality of rapidly transforming cities had a significant and complex influence on the struggles to end violence against women. On one hand, the patriarchal modes of hyper-urbanisation exacerbated the problem, while on the other, cities created the opportunity to act on a larger scale, in an organised way and made women’s struggles to end violence visible to the public. <br/><br/>Latin American feminist movements of the 1970s and 1980s shifted global understanding of violence against women and girls. They mobilized a strong and diverse network that was pioneering in the large-scale, international mobilization in the fight for human rights. Through multi-form activism against patriarchal violence, they not only inspired changes locally but also influenced women in other parts of the world. <br","AR2A011; violence against women; feminist movements in Latin America; public space and gender inequalities","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","AR2A011",""

He organized the project brief that aims to develop ideas for an online job-matching platform that brings healthy changes to the hiring process. He gave a working title for the platform called HelloCareer. Quincy’s focus was on addressing the issues around bias and communication gaps in hiring and giving autonomy over self-representation to job seekers - their ability to choose and control how they communicate their skills, motivation, personality, and experience.<br/><br/>Diving into the scene, the problems that Quincy mentioned related more to CV than to other hiring tools. Companies have to process the biggest number of applicants in the application stage since it is open to everyone. Therefore, applicants can only deliver written forms that recruiters screen in a few seconds without any communication. Because what they can tell is limited, and they never get feedback, applicants feel that they are not respected. The problem for companies is that they may miss the talents that are hard to identify in the application. Based on the given situation, the project’s goal was determined: how to allow job seekers to self-represent in their CV.<br/><br/>The project followed the double diamond design process. The first step was conducting desk research to explore the context, and the key takeaway from the desk research on the hiring process was seeing how different steps and recruitment tools are intertwined. The materials and tools are often used over multiple steps. Thus, the design direction for Hello Career was determined: a platform that covers the entire job searching journey supporting a seamless experience. Employees nowadays keep changing jobs which means the job searching journey keeps ongoing. The platform will help the users document their work-life regularly so that they can whenever start the job search in a prepared and constructive manner.<br/><br/>Interviews and a creative session were conducted to discover the job seeker’s needs for the main research focus, self-representation on CV, and each step of the journey. Converging techniques were used to bring the gathered ideas and insights into concrete ideas.<br/><br/>The solution to the primary research goal was derived: an interactive online CV. A job seeker can form a bigger picture of who one is by connecting the experiences. Interactive elements and media content support delivering the story clearly. The CV would stay as an online page while being processed and screened. It would make the process transparent for applicants. The result highlights the job seeker’s need for a platform that takes care of the entire job search journey and provides transparency in screening.

(mentor); Bet, E.M. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","This thesis report, the new neighbors: urban revitalization in the Rosmolenwijk, presents the socio-spatial effects that urban revitalization plans combined with the housing crisis (and other trends and policies) have on working-class neighborhoods. The working-class neighborhoods are built-up with mostly social housing to provide home for the workers of the industries in the industrial revolution. However, with the industries disappearing, the neighborhoods are left with low quality housing and homogeneous population with low-income levels. Currently, these working-class neighborhoods are often considered as fragile and low-quality neighborhoods with a various of problems by the municipalities. To tackle these problems, municipalities came up with revitalization projects that meanly consists of methods like state-led gentrification and social mixing to boost the socio-economic status of the neighborhoods. On paper, these plans sound promising. Although, these plans are conducting friction between the new and native inhabitants. Firstly, the displacement of native inhabitants, who often have a strong connection to the community is high. This displacement is strengthened by some urban policies on housing associations that put pressure on making the housing more sustainable, leaving no other choice than selling blocks to the private sector or rebuilding blocks for the highest rental prices to be able to finance such investments. Secondly, the mix of new and native inhabitants rises the socio-spatial fragmentation between the new and native inhabitants as they are not mixing groups but create hotspots with the wealthier groups. And thirdly, the lifestyles are so different that the target groups do not seem to connect with each other. They have their own perception of theirs and what is not, the new inhabitants seem to like the community idea but hardly participate in it themselves, and the environmental connection to the neighborhoods of the new inhabitants is different than from the new inhabitants as well. The thesis plan points out some centers that have the potential to increase the social cohesion between the target groups based on the usage of the neighborhood. Furthermore, these locations will be transformed in a way that embraces the positive goals of the revitalization plans, while decreasing the socio-spatial friction that has is conducted with the current revitalization plans of working-class neighborhoods. Combined with this transformation comes the new condition in policies and legislation that are necessary to fulfill the aim of this thesis.","Urban Revitalization; Social Mixing; Gentrification; Housing Market; The Netherlands; Zaanstad; working-class neighbourhood","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Complex Cities","","52.448088836569454, 4.822751119388979"

To ease the administrative burden of clinicians, digital scribes offer the potential to automate clinical note taking. Digital scribes are intelligent documentation softwares that combine automated speech recognition (ASR) and natural language processing (NLP). Digital scribes transcribe clinician-patient consultations and convert the conversation into structured clinical notes. Attendi, the client is developing a digital scribe for orthopedics: the Assistant. Hip arthrosis consultations have a well-structured anamnesis, therefore a promising use case for the digital scribe. <br/><br/>This Master thesis investigates the clinician perspective of implementing the Assistant. Literature was reviewed to understand the problem space and the design implications of the enabling technologies. Core concepts in human-AI collaboration such as system transparency and human control were identified to design for hybrid documentation. Also, the perspectives of recording consultations were translated into values for hospitals, clinicians and patients. The findings lead to both mutual benefits and tensions for the clinician-patient relationship and obstacles for implementation. <br/><br/>To contribute to developing the Assistant, user research was carried out in context by shadowing orthopedic surgeons to see their day-to-day workflow and understand the current cycle of clinical documentation. Several surgeons were interviewed to gain more in-depth views about the digital scribe. As synthesis, personas and journey maps were created both for a typical consultation cycle and a daily workflow. From the research phase, a list of user requirements were gathered in order to aid the design phase and future development. Finally, the envisioned user journey is presented in a service blueprint with the developed interface of the Assistant.<br","digital scribe; Automatic Speech Recognition; Natural Language Processing; healthcare; user experience; Service design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design | Medisign","",""

It focusses specifically on user participation in the design of community centres in Rotterdam, 1960-1990. First, a literature investigation has been conducted to establish context and theory on user participation in architecture. Secondly, research on three study cases has been executed; Two similar community centres: De Klimmende Bever and De Larenkamp; and separately Pier 80. The researched focused on three aspects possibly influenced by user participation: functions, floorplan design and aesthetics. This was done by a combination of archival research, research in historical newspapers and analysis. <br/><br/>It was found that during the 60s and 70s, the role of the architect was questioned with the increasing critiques on Modernism. De Carlo was one of the first architects to argue the importance of user participation in design and define different types of participation. Meanwhile, in the Netherlands a similar movement begun. The municipalities in the Netherlands were shifting their focus from growth and scaling to urban renewal. The community centre was a key element in the new and renewed neighbourhoods.<br/><br/>From the case studies, it became clear that user participation and the relation between architect and user can influence the design significantly. The biggest influence was found on the functions of the building. Moreover, aesthetics and floorplan design can also be influenced. Although it must be considered that this is also heavily dependent on the approach of the designer. Municipal architect Bister, who designed De Klimmende Bever and De Larenkamp, took a Modernist approach designing a shell with open floorplan, which could be placed in multiple neighbourhoods or anywhere else. Consequently, the buildings are not unique and adjusted to the surroundings, except for the functions. Pier 80 however, showed how a design can be influenced by a lot of user participation and be adjusted to its surroundings. <br/><br/>The relation between user and architect is always changing and will always change. We, as designers, have to question our role in design to achieve the best results.","AR2A011; User Involvement; Community centre; Participation; Design Process","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","AR2A011",""

With the use of gentrification it was tried to hide the poverty by improving the quality of neighbourhoods. Although this improved the liveability and wealthiness of a neighbourhood, it did not improve the lifes of the former citizens as they were forced out. This shows the wrong focus of the regeneration that is often used in deprived neighbourhoods, improving the liveability instead of improving the lives of the citizens. To be able to improve the life of the citizens, it is important to find out what their wishes and needs are, so an urbanist can implement these in the design. Therefore, this thesis researches how an urbanist can establish citizens’ participation as a design method to be able to design life improving neighbourhoods for its citizens. This will be done by answering the main question of: “how can the use of citizens’ participation in the urban design process of the regeneration of deprived neighbourhood improve the liveability?”. To answer this question, research on citizens’ participation, happiness and liveability will be combined with analyses on a case studie to create a new design method for urbanists that is focused on participation as the main way of designing. The manual will show how participation can be used as a design method and how an urbanist should approach this way of designing. The main focus is on the way the urbanist should communicate with the citizens so they will both understand each other.<br","Citizen Participation; Deprived neighbourhoods; liveability; design process; (Role of) urbanist","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Urbanism","",""

Besides, the soundscapes of Ming dynasty’s Chinese classical gardens combine natural elements to make various sounds, always with the sound of water as the background. Then, comparisons are made, finding out that the soundscapes in Italian and Chinese gardens have different emphasis on technology and nature but have common stress on water. The historical contexts of Italy and China are studied to find the reasons for their soundscape designs from various perspectives. The different worldviews and cultural contexts play leading roles in soundscape designs, as social factors and political intentions also influence.

While Africa was in the phase of decolonization, Ethiopia gained more importance due to its status as the only non-colonized country in Africa. In the context of these historical developments, the emperor Haile Selassie aimed to modernize Addis Ababa, which was supposed to be recognized on the global map, with architectural designs that would make his country proud. However, how exactly did Addis Ababa undergo this process of modernization? And how was the representation achieved through architecture ? In this period, there was a great number of international architects who contributed to the modern cityscape of Ethiopia. But especially the architects Michael Teodros and Zalman Enav who worked together in a joint firm, have made a very great contribution. For the understanding of Ethiopian modernism it becomes inevitable to understand their approach and to address their works of modern architecture. <br/>In order to understand how modernism expressed itself in Addis Ababa in the 1960s, this work will analyze architectural features of a political and residential building built by these architects. The documentation of the projects is provided by the Israeli Planning, Architecture and Development in Africa (ISPADA) archive, an online archive that studies Israel’s past involvement in architecture and documents architectural projects designed by Israeli architects.

In the city white factory buildings with the Philips logo are prominently displayed in the city. In the prime of Philips around the 1930’s it was a real industrial hub. This is the reason why residents of Eindhoven are still proud of the city (Onna, 2002). The city of Eindhoven is in a large extent formed by Philips. The buildings are designed from the company architecture of Philips. Architects employed by or under direct supervision of Philips’ Technische Bedrijven (Philips Building Design and Plant Engineering Division). Optimal use of the production facilities was priority in the designs (Geevers, 2014). Because of the lack of space, the factories needed to be built higher and this gave the white towers the appearance of a ‘world industry’ (1908, p.134). The retiring of Philips from Eindhoven in 2001 can be seen as a pauperization of her identity, but as well a release. The architecture of Philips remains nowadays to the collective memory of the city (Doevendans, 2009). The architecture and city planning of Philips is still recognizable. The old production facilities are used nowadays for Brainport, creative and innovation city and reused for new functions as living, culture, recreation, and offices. But the brands Brainport and Design Capital will never win it from the trademark Philips. Eindhoven will always be able to use the name Philips for its reputation (Doevendans, 2009). The challenge for Eindhoven is to combine this tradition with the next phase of architecture.

In response to the fears of cultural decay, the Deutscher Werkbund, an association of artists and craftsmen, was established in 1907. While its goal was to improve the quality of German design, it never officially defined the concept of quality. Its members theorised about it for years, but the debate between proponents for mass production and individualists broke out and swayed the historical interest away from quality. <br/>In this study, the statements of the key figures of the Werkbund – Henry van de Velde, Hermann Muthesius, and Friedrich Naumann – are analysed to distil their theories on quality. The ideas behind quality creation, such as the production process and the physical characteristics of a product, are uncovered. When the stylistic discrepancies and historiographical biases are ignored, we see that the actors were trying to achieve the same goal – the highest quality – despite the multiplicity of opinions. <br/>This study defines approaches to preserve the quality of products and work in a highly industrialised society. It outlines the ideas of personal creative freedom on the rise of mass production. These ideas are the lessons of those at the forefront of 20th-century industrialisation and are still relevant in present-day society. <br","AR2A011; Quality; Werkbund; mass production; Individualism","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","AR2A011",""

Incorporating batteries for electricity storage, a salt cavern for hydrogen storage and cryogenic tanks for nitrogen storage, the system is designed to work as flexible as possible to cope with the variations in PV output. <br/><br/>Scaled to an industrial scale output of 200.000 ton-NH3 per year, the resulting LCOH in 2030 will be 1.63 €/kg-H2, and the LCOA will be 0.394 €/kg-NH3. The competitiveness with fossil fuel-based production is dependent on the price of natural gas, which in this case will need to be higher than 3.16 $/MBTu or 12.25 €/MWh (converted using a USD/EUR rate of 0.88 and a conversion factor of 0.29308 MWh/MBTU, and taking into account a carbon price of 100 €/ton-CO2-eq) for green hydrogen to be competitive. For green ammonia to be cheaper, the gas price must be greater than 4.49 $/MBTu or 17.41 €/MWh. <br/><br/>A sensitivity analysis shows that if the CAPEX and OPEX cost of the five most contributing components to the levelized cost would be 50% higher, the LCOH (2.4770 €/kg-H2) and LCOA (0.5817 €/kg-NH3) would still compare favourably to blue hydrogen and ammonia with a natural gas price of 7.71 $/MBTu (29.89 €/MWh) and 9.04 $/MBTu (35.05 €/MWh). By analyzing the operations of the salt cavern, it is discovered that 6.4% of the salt cavern is used from the available capacity of 3300 ton-H2. Even when the necessary yearly output of ammonia is raised 2 or 4 times, the salt cavern uses only 12.7% and 16.8% of the available capacity. Overall this research shows that green hydrogen and ammonia can compete with hydrogen and ammonia produced from fossil fuels in 2030 and that the possibilities of salt cavern storage for hydrogen are greater than expected because a capacity of 250 ton-H2 is enough for a yearly production of 200.000 ton NH3.","Green hydrogen; Green Ammonia; Levelised cost; Morocco; Salt caverns storage; Solar Farm","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

At first, it seemed hard to understand why someone in Kenya would choose a metal roof over the vernacular alternatives, as metal roofs bring dependence on skilled labour and a lack of comfort during the hot summer days. With this consideration in mind, the transformation that was taking place seemed all the more improbable and required an explanation. This present thesis is a first study of what is happening. <br/><br/>Using household surveys and satellite imagery, I study how metal roofing has spread in Kenya. My preliminary study will be a primer for those who will find interest in studying the broader context of housing in Africa. The continent is currently in the midst of a massive population boom, accompanied by considerable changes in housing conditions. The transition from grass-thatched roofs to corrugated iron sheet roofing is a part of this story that should not be neglected. <br/><br/>This thesis, among others, indicates that it will be relevant to collect more data on housing conditions in rural areas.

These events act as catalysts for art production, inspiring generations of artists, creatives, and thinkers, allowing them to produce period-specific art in Lebanon and the region. What is primordial to note, here, is that these two events had almost contradictory outcomes: the first provided artists with the unique opportunity to reflect and critique a peculiar reality, while the second inspired a whole population to express its collective frustration and imagination. In order to explore the previous statements, the following research question is the central focus of this narrative: How did contemporary art evolve simultaneously with historical events in Lebanon from 1940 to 2020? Could the paradigm shift in collective expression provide a new argument in favor of the exclusivity and agency of art production in the country? It seems likely that, after the recent succession of political and cultural happenings in the country, we are arriving at a place where Art is unconsciously becoming an instrument for all. In order to answer this research question, the adopted methodology will consist of a three-dimensional approach that will comprise the following: Firstly, I shall research the importance and relevance of art as a tool for social and political critique, and its role in society as an agent of expression and change in accordance with the overruling paradigm of each historical period. Then, I shall compare the Lebanese population’s status quo with the evolution of a primordial public space – Martyr’s Square – that clearly mirrors contextual Political and Artistic circumstances of respective times. Lastly, I shall select and analyze relevant pieces of contemporary art that clearly critique and respond to these previously mentioned periods, demonstrating how historical happenings have generated specific artistic styles and methods that are strongly vernacular and expressive.

Thus, the analysis of the Scheveningen identity is focused on three main areas, defined in the main theoretical and methodological axis of the thesis. Firstly, the identity of Scheveningen is explored at the level of community life. This section covers topics such as notion of community, the clash of local customs and European lifestyle, as well as focal points of social interactions. Secondly, the thesis explores the physical environment of Scheveningen. The issues of both the urban layout and transitions in the architecture are presented.

The arrival of more than 220.000 refugees in the metropolitan area of Athens and Piraeus after the Asia Minor Catastrophe and the population exchange that followed the Treaty of Lausanne posed the great challenge of refugee rehabilitation since the population of the area almost doubled in a period of limited financial resources due to the preceding two Balkan Wars and the First World War. This led to a rapid expansion of the city, signified the beginning of the history of social housing in modern Greece, and contributed to the acceleration of the procedures for planning legislation in Athens. <br/>46 refugee settlements resulted from the imperative need to house this population. Housing units ranging from unauthorized self-housing and almost slums to prefabricated wooden parapets, to single-family buildings, to organized apartment buildings influenced by the modernist movement, emerged. Nowadays, these morphological and typological forms have survived and constitute a considerable part of the city. <br/>To synthetically provide information, show relations between the different forms of housing rehabilitation, and answer the question of how the refugee housing rehabilitation in Athens and Piraeus was realized and how it evolved historically this paper will analyze the urban footprint of these settlements by examining plans, maps, photographs, and through textual secondary sources, the criteria and policies that shaped them, giving an overview of the extent and influence of these areas to the contemporary image of the city. The focus will be sharpened on the architectural scale, by examining housing typologies, including self-housing and social housing, through archival material and photography. The housing typologies, which emerged will be divided into categories and analyzed based on one representative example for each of them. These will be illustrated with consideration of the actors and policies involved in the creation of the housing, the location and organization of the settlements, within which the typologies are to be found, their architectural characteristics, their transformation throughout history, and the situation encountered today. <br/>The thesis will shed light on the origins, historic development, and transformation of these settlements throughout their 100-year long history and argue on the arising topics, mainly the involvement of the state in contrast to the lezzes faire, the influence of the settlements on the city’s urban structure, the architectural characteristics of the housing, the subsequent decline of the social housing sector in the city and the notion of sociability and neighborhood ties. The qualities and faults of these spaces and the policies that created them will be assessed. The thesis will argue for the significance of these parts of the urban fabric for the collective historic memory and their preservation and adaptation, as well as an interpretation of their qualities as a countermodel to prevailing housing developments.","Social Housing; refugee housing; Greece; Athens; urban planning; architecture; arbitrary housing; housing typology","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","AR2A011",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","In this thesis, it is being examined how music influenced the design strategy of two renowned architects: Le Corbusier and Steven Holl. The projects that are analyzed regard the Philips Pavilion in Brussels (1958) and the Stretto House in Dallas Texas (1989-1992). The design of the Philips Pavilion followed from a number of concept try-outs that led to the physical translation of a “Poème électronique”, created by Edgar Varèse and Le Corbusier. An analysis of this building shows how sound and design are inevitably interwoven with each other in a practical way and it states Le Corbusier’s opinion about the interference of music and architecture.<br/><br/>The Stretta House displays the design of a piece of music in a more philosophical way. The continuous and discontinuous tonal properties of the concert of Bèla Bartok (1937) “Music for String Instruments, Percussions and Celesta” are interpreted as horizontal and vertical structures. Roof form, window proportions, sizing and open and closed spaces display the different instruments used in the concert. A mathematical analysis brings together the idea of these two art pieces: A symphony and a residential house.<br/><br/>By discussing the used design methods and reviewing these two case studies, general differences and similarities can be stated about design techniques inspired by music over a time span of 30 years. Therefore, an imaginary discourse between Le Corbusier and Steven Holl, based on citations and true quotes, illustrates what could have happened if the two architects would have been working together on the design of the Stretto House. A crucial moment in the conceptual design phase of the Stretto House shows a breakthrough in linking the two arts. The result is a better understanding on what architectural designing with music entails. Therefore the following research question is asked:<br/><br/>“How can the implementation of musical elements contribute to an architectural design concept?”<br/><br/>Rhythm, proportion, harmony, unity, sound projection and other elements are key points that should be taken into account when designing. Holl and Le Corbusier strive to find a balanced interaction between order and disorder in their designs to create harmony. By comparing the definition of harmony in a musical structure with the definition in the field of architecture, new innovative ideas and alternative design approaches concluded in a reflection and conclusion of the imaginary discourse. There has been some experimenting with this concept before, so by reflecting on previous studies and critically analyzing the discourse between Le Corbusier and Steven Holl, a creative way of conceptual designing will be established. Learning from different arts like music opens possibilities to review and change existing design methods.","Music; Concept; Idea; Space; Harmony; Architecture; Le Corbusier; Steven Holl; Xenakis","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","AR2A011",""

One of the main objects of study, and now an active subject promoting debate, is the Colonial Museum of Rome, a fascist institution for colonial propaganda, which eclipsed into oblivion in 1971, only to be unearthed in 2017.<br/>Reading this museum as a text, this research explores: what narratives concerning colonial memory have been constructed by displaying and storing objects? The question is approached by connecting the wider narratives identified by historians with the displays of the Colonial Museum, through images and historical accounts.<br/>Four phases were identified in the history of the museum. During the first phase (1914-1937), the museum was born and functioned as an unscientific instrument at the service of the colonial mission, exhibiting a broad variety of objects for a universal propaganda. With the advent of the war and the independence of the colonies, the museum remained trapped in an inertia memoriae. It kept perpetuating the same narratives, only stripped of its fascist symbols (1937-1971). In 1971 the doors of the museum closed and remained locked for almost half a century, hindering social awareness and historical research on Italian colonialism (1971-2017). Since 2017, as the deposits were opened again, an ongoing process is re-evaluating and re-exhibiting the collection to problematise its history.<br/>By investigating the narratives shaped by the museum from its origins until the present, this investigation brings attention to the power of storing and displaying in constructing the histories we want to tell today, at the intersection of memory and identity with issues of race, civil rights, freedom of movement and international relations.","italian colonialism; postcolonialism; Museum; Narrative; memory; display; store","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","AR2A011",""

The dynamical switching selects the most suitable caching policy for the request sequence and thus ensures the best of both worlds, working well under any request sequence and having comparable performance to the conventional caching policies. The Dynamic Expert Caching (DEC) policy designed in this thesis uses algorithms from the expert selection problem to achieve the dynamic caching policy selection. The DEC policy is evaluated using various datasets where it is shown to have comparable performance to the best caching policies in the simulations. The DEC policy is also adapted to work in a network of caches, named MultiDEC. In this setting, MultiDEC has significant advantages over other universal caching policies where each caching node can have a different caching policy that is optimal.","Caching policies; Experts; Online learning; Edge caching","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Embedded Systems","",""

This goal was split into two sub-goals. First, understand the evolution of airport’s market shares based on the allocation of air traffic passengers amongst airports in a chosen MAR. Second, understand the market dynamics of passenger integrated transport systems in a MAR. Forecasting its underlying determinants can provide estimates for the future transport system in a MAR, which accommodate and facilitate smooth future operations of used logistical components. Greater London was chosen as a multi-airport region. <br/><br/>Part one consists of a quantitative model that can compute annual air traffic demand for a multi-airport region, and the allocation of this demand over airports within, for the period 2010 - 2050. Aggregate air traffic demand is based on UK's GDP projections and the allocation model was based on the relative performance of airports in terms of their accessibility, airfares and connectivity. A multivariate regression model was applied correlating historical (2010 - 2019) airport performance to their respective market shares. The results show regional air traffic demand is likely to grow 82\% over the next 30 years. Based on 60 observations, the model can predict its market shares with an R-squared of 0,952. <br/><br/>Part two progresses the quantitative model to generate a forecasting framework for the next 30 years for various important aviation-related variables in the region. This concludes that for London Gatwick, City and Stansted airport the projected growth in air traffic demand will not form any capacity problems, but for London Heathrow, Luton and Southend airport, it will. A major factor influencing this is the rising environmental awareness and increasing costs for carbon emission abatement. London Heathrow Airport, being UK's most important airport, together with the UK government has identified several developments to facilitate the expected growth in air traffic demand.","Aviation; Modelling; Forecasting; Multi-airport Region; Air traffic demand; London; London Heathrow Airport; London Gatwick Airport; London Luton Airport; London City Airport; London Southend Airport; London Stansted Airport; Quantitative analysis; Qualitative analysis; Accessibility; Airfare; Connectivity; Airport; Urbanization; Metropolitan area; Public transport; Regression analysis; multivariable linear regression; Airport allocation; Air traffic passengers; Market Dynamics; Infrastructure; Environmental awareness","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Developments regarding mass timber construction have increased the potential to do so. This thesis addresses the problem that the opportunity of reducing CO2 emissions by constructing in timber is not utilised to its full potential. Timber can contribute because the production of structural timber elements is less carbon intensive compared to concrete, the most used structural building material in the Netherlands. Additionally, timber has the capacity to capture and store carbon. From a literature study it is concluded that one of the main reasons for the reluctance towards timber structures is the perception of higher cost.<br/> <br/>The goal of this thesis is to qualify and quantify the conditions under which timber structures can be competitive with concrete structures in the Netherlands. For two designs to compete at the same level they must have the same potential profit and serve the same function. Nine interdependent variables are investigated in this research: |1| building use, |2| vertical bearing system, |3| stability system, |4| structural floor system, |5| floor span, |6| building height, |7| CO2 emission costs, |8| additional revenue for timber structures, and |9| the calculation method regarding biogenic carbon. <br/><br/>It is found that considering both the costs and the (non-financial and financial) benefits is important when choosing a structural building material. The competitiveness of timber structures increases if CLT is efficiently used with a limited building height and reduced floor span. Imposing a CO2 tax will give the industry an incentive to reduce CO2 emissions and therefore use timber more frequently, which is essential to mitigate climate change. <br","Timber; Competitiveness; Structures; Biobased; LCA; Costs; Climate Change Adaptation; CO2 Emissions; Wood Construction; Carbon","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Building Engineering - Structural Design","",""

To increase their survival chance and improve the treatment plans available, it is important to accurately predict the patient's response to treatment. For HER2+ breast cancer patients, normally a set number of chemotherapy rounds are administered. However, perhaps some patients would benefit from more chemotherapy or conversely, fewer rounds are sufficient. A reaction-diffusion model as well as a mechanically coupled reaction-diffusion model are used to predict the tumour cellularity. Using two magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, a patient-specific model is calibrated to calculate the response for each individual patient. A third MRI scan is used to validate the results. Several preprocessing techniques are used to obtain the necessary information from the MRI scans such as tumour cellularity, segmentation of tissues and breast region.<br/> <br/>The model calculations are performed in 2-dimensions and the slice thickness chosen determines how much effect the incorporation of surrounding tissue has. Using thicker slices means that the surrounding tissue has a larger effect on the tumour growth. For patients that respond well to treatment, the models are both able to calculate the downward trend in tumour cellularity. For thin slices (1.6 mm), both models perform similarly. Using thicker slices (6.5 mm), the mechanically coupled model shows better performance. The most important additions to the model are implementation in 3-dimensions so the slice thickness no longer has an effect. Most importantly, the chemotherapy should be incorporated to better obtain a patient-specific prediction of the response to treatment.","Reaction-Diffusion; HER2+; Breast Cancer; Tumour Response; MRI","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","The extraction of natural gas in the northern part of the Netherlands, from the region of Groningen, has been causing human-induced seismic activities for the past several decades. This is a problem since the existing building stock in this region, which consists of mainly unreinforced masonry buildings and historical structures, are not designed to withstand seismic events due to the lack of empirical earthquake-resistant design features. Further, the combination of a soft topsoil and the gas extraction, is responsible for ground settlements which may compromise the capacity of the existing buildings. <br/><br/>The bed-joint reinforcement technique is a strengthening method which consists of cutting a slot in the bed-joints and installing steel bars embedded in a high-strength repair mortar. Although this strengthening method is commonly applied in the Netherlands to counteract settlement damage, limited investigations on the performance against seismic loading are available in the literature. Therefore, an experimental campaign (Licciardello et al., 2021) was conducted at Delft University of Technology in which a quasi-static cyclic in-plane test on a full scale wall was performed to characterize the performance of the bed-joint reinforcement technique. The wall featured artificially introduced cracks (pre-damage), achieved by the inclusion of plastic sheets between bricks and mortar, to account for the settlement-induced damage. Compared to the un-strengthened walls, tested in a previous experimental campaign (Korswagen et al., 2019) under similar conditions, it is observed that the bed-joint reinforcement technique can provide a significant increment in terms of displacement capacity and ductility of the wall but not in terms of the force capacity. <br/><br/>In this thesis, numerical simulations of both un-strengthened and strengthened walls from the experiments were performed using 2D-models and the nonlinear static analyses (monotonic and cyclic) were carried out in the finite element software DIANA. The objective of this research was to compare different numerical modeling approaches and material models to find the best suited one for simulating the in-plane seismic response of both un-strengthened and strengthened masonry walls. Moreover, the objective was also to extrapolate the experimental results to other wall configurations, which are not experimentally tested, to investigate the combined effect of the bed-joint reinforcement technique and the change in size and location of the window opening on the in-plane response of the wall (parametric study). <br/><br/>In the scope of this thesis, three numerical modeling approaches were investigated (Figure i). The bricks and mortar joints are modeled as one homogeneous continuum in the macro-model. On the other hand, the bricks and mortar joints are modeled separately for the continuous and detailed micro-model where interface elements are included at the brick-mortar bonds for the latter one. The discrete (simplified) micro-model was not investigated because the reinforcement bars cannot be connected to the mortar joints since they are substituted by zero-thickness interface elements. Moreover, the Discrete modeling approach of the reinforcement was used in order to simulate the pull out behavior of the bars. Cracks were modeled using the discrete cracking approach and the smeared cracking approach where the former one was used at the brick-mortar interfaces and the latter one was used for cracking in the mortar joints (micro-models) and in the masonry composite (macro-model)…<br/><br","Nonlinear finite element analysis; Unreinforced masonry wall; Reinforced masonry walls; Bed joint reinforced repointing; Macro-modeling; Continuous micro-modeling; Detailed micro-modeling; In-plane seismic response","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

These systems for functionality reasons require the use of eccentric joints. The behaviour of such joints is not a well-studied topic, and little is known of their effect on the buckling behaviour of structures. Buckling of trusses using conventional centric (non-eccentric) joints has been examined extensively in the literature. This work aims to answer what the effects of using eccentric joints compared to centric are, on the stability of steel truss structures. Additionally, a reduction of the computational and design time is attempted, by extending a simplified approach developed for centric joints, to eccentric joints.<br/>The main investigation is performed on a simply supported truss comprised from eccentric K-joints and square hollow sections (SHS). Detailed models are used, with the joints being modelled by shell elements. The results are compared to equivalent trusses with centric joints. The main conclusions are that due to the eccentric joints, a better buckling behaviour can be realised for the truss members in the case of in-plane buckling. This improvement is more evident for the buckling of the braces and for combinations of chords and braces with γ&gt;8 and 0.30&lt;β&lt;0.70 respectively. In those cases, a decrease of the buckling length of at least 5% is observed and reaching nearly 20% for γ=15.9 and β=0.4. In the case of out of plane buckling, the observed behaviour is slightly worse. The difference is considered negligible in practice, with all configurations checked giving a difference of less than 2% between the buckling lengths.<br/>The simplified design approach, which uses beam elements and rotational springs, is validated, by comparing literature results with detailed shell element models. It is, also, further improved by performing new research on individual centric K-joint models. Having validated the approach for centric joints, three different modifications are proposed to extend it to eccentric joints. None of the proposed modifications give the validation required but insight is gained regarding the behaviour of eccentric K-joint trusses. It is concluded that eccentric joints require non-symmetric stiffness matrices for their behaviour to be captured.<br","Buckling; Eccentric joints; Welded joints; Stiffness; Truss structures; Connection stiffness","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

However, for the vast majority of these research projects, the filter structure was loaded by uniform flow, either in the parallel or perpendicular direction. This means that, while for filters under flow loading multiple design options and diagrams are available, the knowledge on design rules for sloped, closed filters under wave loading remained limited. These knowledge gaps mean that, in design practice, often the design criteria for closed filters under flow loading, for instance the original criterion by Terzaghi, are used for the design of closed filters under wave loading, while these have not yet been experimentally verified for this use case.<br/><br/>This thesis combines model test results from two historically performed experiment programs on sloped, closed granular filters under wave loading with new experiments, which were conducted especially for this thesis. By analyzing the results from these three research projects, it was found that commonly used interface stability criteria for closed granular filters under flow loading are not valid for use in the case of a sloped, closed granular filter under wave loading. Based on the test results from the three test programs that were analyzed, a new interface stability criterion for sloped, closed granular filters under wave loading is proposed.","Granular filter; Geometrically closed; Wave loading; Terzaghi; Rock Manual; Giroud","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-04-13","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","",""

(mentor); Pascoe, J.A. (graduation committee); Giovanardi, Bianca (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Composite materials have multiple failure modes. Most of these failure modes are dedicated to the different layers, e.g., delamination. Unfortunately, these damages can occur internally, causing it to be invisible to the naked eye. A better understanding of how this happens and what causes it, is required to ensure safety. Therefore, for this research, delamination is the most interesting failure mode. Previous researches have primarily been focusing on quasi-statically loaded UD specimen. However, since a layup in a structural part of an aircraft consists of multiple layers with different fibre orientations, it is not guaranteed that a delamination will occur between two 0º plies. Furthermore, an aircraft is designed to be in service for decades and consequently is loaded thousands of times. A structure which is subjected to a cyclic loading will behave differently than one to a quasi-static loading. Hence, in aviation industries, tests with cyclically loaded specimens are more relevant. This research project focused on fatigue delamination crack growth of multi-directional interfaces. In order to generate mode I delamination, DCB specimens were manufactured and tested. Fatigue experiments were conducted to see the influence of the interface angle as well as that of the orientation of the interface angle. To cover most relevant delamination planes, tests with the following interface were conducted: 0º//0º, 45º//45º, 90º//90º, 0º//45º, 0º//90º, 45º//−45º and 30º//−60º. Furthermore, the crack fronts were monitored by means of C-scans and the fracture surfaces were examined. It was found that for all different interface orientations, fibres bridged. This was demonstrated with an increased delamination resistance for a longer crack. The nature of these bridging fibres, however, differed. Fibre bridging regarding to nesting showed a less significant increase in fracture resistance than bridging fibres due to oscillatory crack propagation behaviour. Furthermore, the different interfaces showed various crack fronts. The crack front tends to propagate towards the direction of the fibres of either of the fibre orientations around the interface.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

In terms of architecture and urban development, China is unprecedented. In a way, the sheer speed and volume of construction is a phenomenon, becoming characteristic for Chinese developments. Like all matter, this in itself is neither necessarily positive of negative. However, such dialogue becomes relevant when interest of parties differ. Arguments can be made for it being a necessity economically, socially, politically. At the same time, it can be perceived as destructive. This becomes especially apparent in the face of the heterogeneity of border conditions.<br/> An exploration of exactly this juxtaposition is the base of the thesis, wherein architecture plays a particular role. Architecture is not merely a collection of built production within context of the urban environment, it is also intrinsically interwoven with the individual and how it is perceived in value. In such way, architecture as its object, while its widely recognized in form as a building, is a mediator in defining life in its cultural-historical, socio-economical, political values. In perceiving architecture not merely as an object, we can explore and understand the values of the existing urban fabric. This understanding is essential for future developments. Proceeding the urban expansion, in this sense, can also mean the continuity of history. It is all a matter of perspectives.<br/> To write about this juxtaposition, the scope has to be defined. Topics such as the heterogeneity of border conditions, the political influence, destructive urbanism and the cultural-historical context are far too large to address in the thesis. As such, the focal point of the thesis is not about the tension of politcal dissonance around border conditions, rather it is about the issues or chances of rapid and overwhelming planned urban developments, mainly the aforementioned phenomenon in regards of the existing urban fabric. However, the notion of politics is inevitable and should be touched upon, as it is an aspect playing an important role and evidently can not be taken out of the dialogue. This aspect is viewed not to create friction, but as an actor that is providing the urban context. Furthermore, it is about understanding and defining the border conditions on the specifically chosen site. The project is situated on the border of China and Hong Kong, therefore is in need for emphasis and understanding on the socio-cultural aspect. The context will be divided in themes of past, present and future perspectives. Additionally, it is not merely looking to what is, but rather, what can <br/>become. When a region is threatend to become absorbed by the larger development surrounding it, what are the values of such place? What are the necessities of maintaining these? These are the themes that play an imminent role as the border condition of China and Hong Kong.<br/> The border is endowed in a duality. It is, in times, non-physical, yet present. It reflects exclusiveness, yet is universal. It is between inside and outside. In this way, the thesis will take the phenomenon of the Chinese development as an inevitable and take the position in favour of co-existence, rather than restrictiveness. In a way, it is easier to resist something that cannot be grasped, yet having an open approach is encouraged for the sake of new perspectives, activities and understanding. The thesis therefore, is not trying to be a ‘toolbox’ for urban developments or architectural design. <br/>The thesis, as a base, and the design intervention try to explore and transcend the political aspect of development and uncover the values of a region that is prone to losing its identity and characteristic. A step further, in the relation of Hong Kong and China, the border conditions where the two regions collide, create an intricate dynamic in which co-existence is the norm and an integral part of the area. Frankly, this dynamic is not one politically, rather it is socio-economic and cultural-historical. This dynamic itself is ultimately a notion that transcends the border itself. It is one that creates the communal and one that is embraced.","Indigenous; Socio-economic; Border Conditions; China; Hong Kong; Dichotomisation; Defragmentation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Explorelab","","22.5316,114.2032"

The latter reroutes passengers simultaneously with the delay management resulting in computation times larger than the time window of a Train Dispatcher to make a decision. This thesis proposes an alternative method of Delay Management which calculates the alternative routes before the Delay Management optimization using a modified Dijkstra algorithm.

To contribute to changing the Dutch healthcare system, this project proposes a possible strategy to reshape the operations of Service Apotheek towards 2032. Service Apotheek is one of the bigger pharmacies operating in the Netherlands and they have almost 500 branches in the country. The strategy describes a desired change and has been constructed using the path of the double diamond. In the first part, the foundation of the project is described. In the second part, the current practice is deconstructed into three focus areas that are affecting the future operations of the pharmacy. The third part introduces the insights of the empirical research and ends with a list of aspects that will become characteristic for the operations of the pharmacy. The next part presents a vision that uses these characteristics to describe the future operations of Service Apotheek and how these can be translated into strategic requirements for a new intervention. By turning receiving care from the pharmacist from a one-time event into a more continuous flow, health behaviour arguable can be influenced. The intervention presented in part five is a new proposed service delivered by Service Apotheek that aims to make preventive health the new standard in 2032. The pharmacy no longer only dispenses medicine, but the pharmacy offers programs that can help people to live a healthier life. In doing so, Service Apotheek transforms from a static medicine dispenser to a dynamic care provider that takes care of its patients. The value for the user is added when Service Apotheek can create advice or propose interventions that are specific for that patient on that specific moment in time. To show how this intervention can be implemented, a roadmap is constructed that shapes the transformation of Service Apotheek over the coming years. During the different steps, the service of Service Apotheek gradually expands to become able to deliver preventive care in 2032. In the end, recommendations for future research are introduced that could really make this intervention fly. If Service Apotheek succeeds to implement this transition in the coming years, they can contribute to creating a Dutch healthcare system that is viable again.","Future visioning; Preventive health; Pharmacy operations; Service design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

This project was executed for the Innovation Hub, part of the department of Strategy &amp; Airport Planning withing RSG. The initial assignment was to find a way in which RSG could identify and select modalities with potential. <br/><br/>During the project, first the context was outlined by analysing the organisation of RSG and the environment in which they are operating. After this literature concerning open innovation has been compared to the way RSG handles external innovations at the moment, as this is how RSG can strengthen their MMH position further. It appeared that currently RSG misses a structured approach to handle new modalities. RSG therefore needs a strategy and a corresponding way to assess innovative modalities. An extra exploration was done, consisting of literature, interviews, observations and internal documents, which led to design principles for the strategy and the toolkit (wat waren deze).<br/><br/>In the end a strategy is developed in which 4 steps (identifying, identified, assessing, choosing) were included. In this strategy RSG is encouraged to connect more to the world of mobility and its future with the use of an orchestrator, positioned in-between the innovation hub and a newly acquired scouting team. Executing these steps would lead to a decision on the fifth step: engaging. In the developped strategy, RSG shifts from reacting on modalities to proactively monitoring the world of mobility by providing structure in searching. In this way they can connect to this future world of mobility and by regularly assessing modalities, Schiphol can quickly change direction if necessary. Within the strategy, an orchestrator is present to lead the strategy. The orchestrator will be responsible for setting the exact strategy within the MMH direction, as he or she knows what happens in the market and within Schiphol. He or she will be building bridges between RSG and start-ups.<br/><br/>For the assessment, a toolkit is developed in which the factors which influence the potential of a modality at Schiphol have been incorporated as well as the proposed way of working in the strategy. This is reflected in a card deck that should be used to assess modalities, and canvases that should be used to document the session and ensure follow up of the session is assured. Herein, the goal of the toolkit is to facilitate a structured discussion concerning new modalities which can be used to substantiate decision making by RSG. <br/><br/>This report describes the entire process gone through to come to the final design.

(mentor); Lotz, J.E. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Delft University of Technology has access to a towing tank where a wave maker can generate waves. When generating waves, non-linear start-up effects occur at the start of a wave train which affect the rest of the signal.<br/> The aim of this thesis is to develop a model which can take these effects into account. A numerical modelling approach is adopted, due to the necessity for generating a large space of wave profiles and the need to optimize towards a wave maker input given a wave profile. <br/> <br/>A clear assessment of the state-of-the-art revealed a scope of present methods to model non-linear free surface waves. A potential flow assumption proved a clear balance between accuracy versus computational cost. Analysis of this model showed that the state is described by a balance between potential and kinetic energy and should, in principle, be conserved. <br/>For numerical modelling, the Finite Element Method is adopted. The sparse matrices and ease of evaluation of the integrals allow for a better adaptation in present computer architectures. Additionally this method provides more rigorous mathematical tools to demonstrate properties such as stability and convergence. Lastly, the use of Isogeometric Analysis where the solution space is described by splines instead of polynomials could provide an advantage over conventional methods with respect to continuity, convergence and refinement strategies. Subsequently, literature revealed that the potential flow model in conjunction with FEM will result in model that is accurate, stable and fast.<br/><br/>A novel numerical model is presented where the spatial discretization is done using IgA and the resulting semi-discrete Ordinary Differential Equation is integrated in time with a separate method. Analysis shows that this spatial model inhibits the same energy conservation laws as the physical model.<br/><br/>Implementation is done in the DelFI, an in-house fixed domain Navier-Stokes solver with an Open Source back-end named MFEM which utilizes clever FEM abstractions and parallelization. To successfully implement the non-linear problem, first a linear problem is implemented to facilitate computation of variables that are defined on the domain only, in this work the free-surface elevation. This results in introducing an additional problem to compute the elevation on the interior which is dependent on the free-surface, but not vice-versa. This, to ensure the wave problem remains unaffected. Coincidentally, this definition of the free-surface elevation on the interior is used to deform the mesh required to capture non-linear effects in the time-dependent domain.<br/><br/>Results of the linear problem show to agree with literature. Conservation of energy is guaranteed, yet conservation of mass can be attained with sufficient mesh and time resolutions. This affirms the successful implementation of free-surface problems in DelFI. Extension to the non-linear case shows that energy is not conserved, yet analysis shows it should. The same holds for conservation of mass. Still, both quantities can again be contained with sufficient mesh and time resolution. Additionally results demonstrate that implementation of a stabilization scheme is needed. Finally a benchmark case demonstrates that with the current limitations, results agree with others. <br/><br/>This research demonstrated a novel mathematical framework to compute non-linear free surface waves with special emphasis on conservation laws and geometric compliance with the fluid through Isogeometric Analysis. A basis has been laid towards optimization of wave maker signals given a free-surface wave envelope.","numerical modeling; iso geometric analysis; IGA; Waves; Free Surface; Finite Element Analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Today’s urban water cycle in Curaçao is characterized by linear, centralized, polluting, costly, time and energy consuming and does not contribute to cultural value. Architecture can play part in creating a more efficient and sustainable urban water system, while increasing the public awareness of issues related to the freshwater cycle. Heritage of water typologies and systems like water plantations, cisterns and wells give example of how Curaçao used decentralized micro water catchment systems (MWCS), in the pre-desalination period, to provide freshwater for the communities inhabiting it. In addition to the concept of these heritage inspired designs solutions (HIDS) the concept of current nature-based solutions (NBS), referring to ecosystem-based and biomimetic approaches, are analysed as alternatives. The integration of HIDS and NBS is a much-needed step forward towards an integrated and holistic approach of spatial planning and design in general and water related design and management in particular.<br/><br/>‘Regenerative Ruins’ focuses on the neighbourhood Otrobanda, centrally located in the capital Willemstad of the island Curaçao. The island has a rich history of urbanization in which the natural freshwater cycles have been neglected. As a result, the island is dependent to obtain its freshwater from a centralized desalination plant. The trend to live in the peri-urban area of Willemstad also led to an exodus of the formerly renowned labour district of Otrobanda, resulting in a cityscape dominated by decaying monuments. The project provides a solution to both problems by transforming a dilapidated monument into a regenerative decentralized freshwater production space, whereby the existing envelope becomes a central freshwater harvesting courtyard.<br","Curaçao; Heritage inspired design solutions; Nature-based solutions; Decentralized water systems; Small Island Developing States; Hydrological cycle; Dilapidated monument; Freshwater harvesting; Otrobanda","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Heritage & Architecture","Architectural Engineering","12.1094497, -68.9405465"

It contains of two parts: first it explores the problems related to the mall, and how these problems influence the community. Second, the project explores through different design scales how these problems can be solved, and how social cohesion can be enhanced by design. The suburban Modernist mall is a widespread concept in the Netherlands that in its current form embodies problems with car-mobility, inside orientation, and monofunctional programming. Due to a dominant focus on consumers mentality, it dominantly focusses on serving the consumer in buying goods. This mentality directly undermines the indoor and outdoor public space and therefore indirectly weakens the strength of the community, as public space is vital for strong communal bonds. <br/><br/>In the second part the project aims to move beyond the single focus on consumers mentality and by design, transforms the challenges into opportunities for Hof van Spaland. Firstly, the design is encouraging biking and pedestrian movement, and with the dismantling of dominant car-mobility, it leaves space for other activities, as biking and people on foot need less space and place. Secondly, the inside orientation that generates backsides is transformed into a dual-side orientation with housing that activate the unsafe expedition streets. Thirdly, the monofunctional programming of shopping is extended with a cultural centre, a canteen, coffee corner, and other communal facilities, including plaza’s, pocket parks and a place for a weekly market. A crucial section in the design preposition, where many interventions collide, is worked out in further detail. It uses local materials and resources to serve the local people. It shows how public facilities can generate extra value, and how several interventions like this can help generating a bright new future for the suburban mall: A future where the mall becomes a buzzing meeting spot for all living in the neighbourhood.<br","Mall; public space; Interior urbanism; civic centre; Schiedam; Social cohesion","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","","51.93512119476605, 4.375944686914497"

However, unlike most delta regions, displacement of parts of the population is not part of Dutch culture anymore. An extensive delta system protects even the lowest parts of the country. Displacement, in this case, is not a direct consequence of sea-level rise, but rather a consequence of how the Dutch government decides to deal with it. The delta strategy is currently in transition, meaning it is unclear what the outcome will be.<br/>The Dutch Delta Programme deals with the uncertainty in sea-level rise predictions by laying out different conceptual scenarios, the most extreme being Move Along. Move Along suggests allowing the ocean to take back parts of the Netherlands. There are more explorative studies on the future of the Dutch coastline. However, none of them incorporate the human aspect in abandoning parts of the country; displacement of part of the population. As sea-level rise is slow-onset, there is time to plan ahead offering opportunity to deal with the displacement in a strategic way.<br/><br/>The project focusses on exploring the potential of combining a strategy for retreat with existing spatial planning goals as a means to deal with the uncertainty of sea-level rise. In addition, this combination creates a shared goal in order to preserve livelihood for the affected population.","Spatial planning and strategy; Managed retreat; Groningen","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","",""

To increase the brand power among younger consumers and overcome the barriers this project is initiated, a project to create a place to open-mindedly explore the future of beer and beyond. The motive of this thesis was to advice Heineken in building an innovation lab. <br/><br/>A future oriented approach is chosen to create this place, called DIVE (Design, Innovation, Vision, Exploration). This approach is combined with the Vision in Product Design method, the dynamic capabilities framework, and the Design Driven Innovation method. Since the combination is new, there will be a reflection after every step. The steps are: 1. Understanding the present, 2. Approaching the future, 3. Imagining the future, and 4. Establishing final boundary object. <br/><br/>Understanding the present is achieved through analysing Heineken and the target group. Findings are that the world of beer is under pressure, that Heineken has not their fair share among the Gen Y and Z and that gen Z will bring disruption. For further research the domain is delimited to quality socializing among Gen Z.<br/><br/>Approaching the future results in a list of factors and together with knowledge from the previous step form a future worldview. This worldview is used to create a narrative about the place which indicates characteristics of the Heineken LAB. The place should be in an upcoming urban area where Heineken revamps an old building, look for combining nature, facilitating outstanding experiences, and repurposing old stuff. The place will have an amazing bar at its core to explore new drinking rituals, new production techniques, new beers and drinks and use new technologies.<br/><br/>The final boundary object, which is the result of this thesis, is a strategy including the aim, objectives, KPI’s, characteristics and a roadmap of four steps including planning, approach, allocation of resources, and accompanying themes for creating the Heineken LAB. The defined steps for developing the Heineken LAB are the brewery, the bar, the lounge, and the program. Through a workshop with both internal and external stakeholders the previous research and strategy is validated. Although the number of participants is low, the participants confirmed the research and agreed with the roadmap. After graduating, the strategy will still be in place.<br/><br/>The created framework in the beginning of the project needs more validation before concluding whether it works as an approach to create an innovation lab.

In 2015 197 parties agreed to the Paris-agreement, settings goals for limiting global warming. The transportation sector contributes for almost 25% of all global greenhouse gas emissions (GHG). A promising pathway to decrease emissions from fossil fuels in the transportation sector is to replace conventional internal combustion engines (ICE) with Battery Electric Vehicles (BEV).<br/>This thesis analyses how the introduction of BEVs in Europe can be accelerated. Five countries were selected and categorised, based on Rogers' diffusion of innovation theory.<br/>Based on a literature analysis, the factors influencing the adoption of the BEV were identified and selected. From these factors, an analytical research model was created. This analytical research model was applied to each country in order to compare the countries and draw conclusions. The analytical model consisted of the factors: government regulations and incentives, purchase price, total cost of ownership, charging infrastructure, model availability, consumer characteristics and BEV adoption.<br/>The study concluded that governments have two tools to stimulate the BEV adoption: make the BEV cost effective compared to the ICE and stimulate the charging infrastructure. If it is financially more attractive to drive a BEV in a country than an ICE, this will have a major impact on BEV adoption. Making the BEV financially attractive can be done with tax measures and subsidies. In general, countries with relatively high car taxes can make BEVs more financially attractive than countries with relatively low car taxes, which results in a higher BEV adoption<br/>In addition, a country must ensure that the charging infrastructure grows along with the BEV adoption. In general, it is a pre-condition to develop its slow charger network to stimulate BEV adoption. However, it depends on the country how the slow charger network should be set up. An indicator for this is the percentage of detached houses. If this percentage is high, a country must focus on private charging when setting up its slow charging network. With a low percentage of detached houses, a country must focus on public charging when setting up the slow charging network. Furthermore, it is expected that private parties will jump into the fast charging market. These private parties will only step in if a country has a relatively high BEV adoption, such as Norway and the Netherlands, because it is only then profitable. The study also shows that in countries with a large surface area, it is a precondition to develop its fast charging network. Therefore, when a country has a low BEV adoption, but a large surface, incentives are needed from the government to stimulate a fast charging network.<br/>A financial attractive BEV environment and a well-developed charging infrastructure has as consequence in increasing the number of BEV models. When more BEV models enter the market in a country, consumers have more choice, and this has a stimulating effect on BEV adoption in a country.","#electricvehicle; #adoption; #europe","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

(mentor); van Eekelen, Erik (mentor); van Prooijen, Bram (graduation committee); van Wesenbeeck, B (graduation committee); Terry-Tyson, Rachel (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Mangroves are productive ecosystems. Degradation of mangroves has been observed since the 1970s, due to a variety of reasons. Successful rehabilitation focuses on restoring conditions suitable for mangroves. Sediment availability has been shown to positively impact mangrove growth. Therefore, it can likely play a role in mangrove rehabilitation. This research aims to explore if the rehabilitation of coastal mangroves is possible using a sediment nourishment. <br/><br/>A process analysis is performed, to identify the processes driving sedimentation on a mangrove coast. This analysis uses a schematised, cross-shore, one-dimensional model, based on global data of mangrove coasts. Convex, linear and concave bottom profiles are used. The forcing on the coasts consists of three different wave heights, tidal ranges, and sea level rise rates. A homogeneous mangrove forest is present above mean sea level. <br/><br/>Sedimentation within the mangrove forest is caused by a combination of processes. Waves pick up the sediment, which is transported by the tide. Tidal asymmetry then drives the actual sedimentation in the forest. An increase in asymmetry results in increased sedimentation. Mangroves increase the flood dominance of slack water asymmetry, but also cause an ebb dominant peak flow velocity and duration asymmetry. <br/>Dependent on the tidal range, the influence of mangroves on net sedimentation can either be null, negative or positive.<br/>Sea level rise increases sedimentation within the mangrove, by enhancing slack water asymmetry.<br/><br/>The main tipping point identified is the gradient of the bed slope in cross-shore direction. If the slope becomes milder towards the shore, i.e. a convex coast, this value is negative. If the slope becomes steeper, which is the case for concave coasts, it is positive. The tipping point is when the slope does not change towards the shore. The gradient of the slope then is zero. The net sedimentation is considerably less for concave coasts than for convex coasts. <br/><br/>Sediment nourishments can increase sedimentation in the mangrove forest. Four nourishment designs were simulated, using the same model as for the process analysis. The designs varied in location and achieved depth across the coast.<br/>Three design considerations for a successful sediment nourishment have been identified, which are firstly the obtained bed level by the nourishment, secondly the slope of the original bed, and thirdly the location of the nourishment. <br/>First, the obtained bed level by the nourishment influences the quantity of sediment pick-up. Higher bed levels increase the sedimentation within the mangrove, by increasing sediment mobilisation rates. <br/>Second, the slope of the original bed largely influences the feasibility of a nourishment. Due to mild bed slopes, the construction of a nourishment is difficult and large volumes for a nourishment are required. <br/>Finally, the location of the suppletion should be close to the mangrove. If the nourishment is located far offshore, the sediment is not transported towards the mangrove. Rather, it then is transported away from the coast. <br/>This thesis has shown the rehabilitation of mangroves using a sediment nourishment is possible.<br","mangrove rehabilitation; mangroves; Sediment nourishments; Sediment transport; Delft 3D; Sediment Supply","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","",""

(mentor); Kelder, E.M. (graduation committee); Kortlever, R. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","In the coming energy transition, the availability of reliable and affordable energy storage will be of vital importance. Battery storage is a large factor in the energy storage sector, and current battery storage is dominated by lithium-based batteries. However, lately, alternatives to lithium have been given renewed attention, due to the insufficient abundance of lithium in the earth’s crust and the promising theoretical aspects of these other types of batteries. Fluoride-based batteries, for example, have high theoretical capacities and are theorized to be very suitable for application in solid-state battery technology. Fluoride-based batteries have only been produced on a lab-scale relatively recently, with the first reversible solid-state fluoride-ion battery produced in 2011, and the first room temperature reversible fluoride-ion battery produced in 2018, yet interest in this technology has drastically increased over the past few years. The current main issues fluoride- ion batteries are running into are its poor cyclability, its low current densities, and its inability to meet the theoretical capacities. In this report, multiple facets of fluoride-ion batteries have been analyzed in an effort to improve on these characteristics. In particular a focus has been placed on two commonly used materials in fluoride-ion batteries: electrolyte BaSnF4 and cathode material BiF3. The ionic conductivity dependence on pressure was deduced for each material, with BaSnF4 having its highest ionic conductivity at ∼280 MPa and BiF3 having its highest ionic conductivity at ∼680 MPa. To test the effect of oxides in BiF3, which form spontaneously when BiF3 is exposed to air or humidity, various Bi-O-F compounds were synthesized and had their ionic conductivity measured. It was found that each of the compounds that contained oxygen had a drastically lower (factor 1,000-10,000) ionic conductivity than pure BiF3. An attempt was also made to improve the ionic conductivity of BiF3 by doping that material with SnF2. BiF3 doped with SnF2 concentrations of 5-20% were synthesized, and had their ionic conductivity measured. It was found that the ionic conductivity was increased by dopant concentrations of 5% and 10%, with the material with 10% SnF2 having the highest ionic conductivity, while the materials with 15% and 20% SnF2 had a similar ionic conductivity to pure BiF3. Symmetric fluoride-ion batteries were also produced, with BiF3 as an electrode material and BaSnF4 as an electrolyte material. The produced batteries reached charge and discharge capacities with values of at most only 30% of the values reported in literature. The batteries also had poor capacity retention over multiple charge-discharge cycles. Batteries were also produced using BiF3 doped with 5% and 10% SnF2 as an electrode material. These batteries had higher initial capacities but had even poorer capacity retention over subsequent cycles. It was however also found that the critical current density for the batteries had increased as a result of doping with SnF2, allowing higher current densities to be applied to the batteries.","Fluoride-ion batteries; Bismuth Fluoride; Barium tin fluoride; Ionic conductivity; Symmetric cells","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics","",""

Although passive HVAC is not a new concept, advances in environment sensing, control methods, and hardware have made it a more viable method. Some difficulties still exist, such as optimal sensor placement and optimal control strategies. Sensor selection is an important aspect of HVAC design. The system can become difficult to control with incorrect placement of sensors, resulting in higher energy consumption, lower comfort levels, or poor air quality.<br/>There are essentially three methods to determine the optimal sensor location: model-driven, data-driven, and simulation-driven. The model-driven methods use mathematical models to maximize the observability of the system but are mostly used for simplified simulated rooms. Data-driven methods often use clustering algorithms, or maximize metrics such as entropy or mutual information. These methods focus on estimating the indoor air temperature distribution. Simulation-driven methods use simulations to determine the airflow or temperature<br/>fields, often with CFD. These are used to find local hot spots or locations for fast detection of contaminants. No research was found that used sensor data of additional building components besides of the indoor air temperature. <br/>In this work, the sensors are selected based on model prediction accuracy and the overall control performance to determine the effect of addition state measurements. A model is constructed to simulate the building, together with an MPC and an extended Kalman filter for state estimation. These are combined to run the optimization and determine the control performance. The sensor set average of each measured state is considered the true temperature. For all possible sensor combinations, the error of the combination average w.r.t. the true temperature is assumed Gaussian. The fitted Gaussian error distributions are then used as measurement noise in the model. The building and control response is simulated<br/>with the measurement error over multiple days. Two algorithms are implemented to find the optimal sensor set: a predictive method and greedy method. The results are compared to each other and both methods showed that the indoor air temperature measurements have the largest effect on performance. Measuring additional states only resulted in a small increase in performance.","Sensor selection; model predictive control; extended kalman filter; predictive method; greedy optimziaiton; passive HVAC","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

One of the key elements in the energy regions is the active involvement of citizens through participation. However, a good relationship between the municipalities in the energy region is not self-evident. The thirty energy regions in the Netherlands have the task to form and lead and provide access to information and other forms of citizen support. Every energy region takes its own approach to involve citizens in their energy transition decision-making. Therefore, it is interesting to study to what extent and in which manners energy regions are able to involve citizens in the RES decision-making and in which ways governments are able to live up to their own participation goals.

One year later 66% had made youth participation a policy goal, while 18% was planning to. At that time most municipalities involved young people to some extend in their policy-making, but were dissatisfied with the results and expressed a need for tools (Mak, Gilsing &amp; Wróblewska, 2016). In 2020, despite considerable effort, the dissatisfaction had not changed (Movisie, 2020).<br/><br/>This thesis aims to design a new approach that allows youngsters aged 14-17 to structurally participate in municipal policy- and decision-making, in the context of the energy transition. The energy transition, which refers to the transfer from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources with the aim of reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the Netherlands with 95-100% in 2050 (RIVM, n.d.), is seen as the largest strategic challenge for municipalities and one of the main societal challenge of our time (Ebskamp &amp; Verbraak, 2019). Municipalities ask Citisens, an organisation specialised in reaching and involving (adult) citizens and this project’s client, ever more frequently if they can support them in involving young people in shaping this transition. This project is their first step in exploring this new market.<br/><br/>Three methods characterize the project approach. Frame creation, a method well-suited for the open, networked, complex and dynamic problems of today, provides the main structure to the project (Dorst, 2015, p. 73). Within the structure of Frame creation, the project adopts a participatory approach, involving 163 stakeholders and experts in 15 co-creation sessions throughout the project. Besides bringing in new perspectives, giving stakeholders a voice in the design and building stakeholder support (Boeijen et al., 2020, p. 61), these co-creation sessions all generate insights on collaborating with the stakeholders in a Research through Design approach. While most co-creation sessions use prototypes or artefacts to generate new knowledge, the sessions themselves can also be seen as prototypes for collaboration (Stappers &amp; Giaccardi, 2017).<br/><br/>Following an in-depth analysis of the challenge, this thesis creates an overview of frontrunners that have a new and promising approach to (youth) participation and/or involving people in climate issues. Looking at common factors of these frontrunners, four themes emerge: equity, ownership, collaboration and action. Based on these themes, several new frames to approach youth participation are developed. The final design, Design your dream places, is based on the frame Holacracy.<br/><br/>Design your dream places involves all youngsters through guest lessons at schools and facilitates them to create their own, sustainable dream places in the municipality. It allows everyone in the municipality to vote on their favourite place, and encourages the municipality and youngsters to collaborate on next steps. The final design was tested and evaluated during a pilot session with key stakeholders, yielding encouraging results while showing the importance of testing it in a real-life setting with actual follow-up. Finally, an implementation and integration plan was created to envision next steps for the project. <br","Participatory City Making; Delft Design Labs; Youth participation; Energy transition; Participatory design; Co-creation; Frame creation; Municipality; Democracy; Sustainability","en","master thesis","","","","","","Double degree in Design for Interaction and Strategic Product Design.","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor); van der Ent, R.J. (graduation committee); Morales Napoles, O. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","The future hydrological response of a river system is often predicted using hydrological models that are calibrated on past observations. By using static model parameters it is assumed that hydrological systems do not change in time. For long-term predictions, this is in clear contrast with the notion that vegetation actively adapts its root-system. Moreover, it neglects the possible impact that climate change might have on vegetation species and land-use. The root-zone storage capacity (S<sub>r</sub>) is a key component in hydrological models as it has a critical function in the partitioning of water fluxes. This research (1) proposes a regression relationship using climate analogy to estimate the time-dynamic root-zone storage capacity for the Meuse basin, and (2) quantifies the impact of this time-dynamic root-zone storage capacity on the change in hydrological response under future climate change. <br/><br/>A selection of catchments from large sample data sets have been used in the analysis. For each of these catchments we calculated 27 catchment descriptors and the S<sub>r</sub> using the water balance method. The regression relationship that is developed based on climate analogy and Multi-Linear Regression analysis showed that the S<sub>r</sub> value can be estimated based on 4 catchment descriptors, namely Holdridge Aridity Index, phase shift of precipitation, seasonal amplitude for the potential evaporation, and sand fraction. This regression relationship has an adjusted R<sup>2</sup> value of approximately 0.70. <br/><br/>We considered three model scenarios. Each scenario consists of a part that models the historical hydrological response which is forced using the simulated historical climate data, and a part that models the future hydrological response which is forced using the simulated 2K climate data. The differences between these model parts indicate how the hydrological response of a system will change in the future. The benchmark scenarios use a static S<sub>r</sub> value which is estimated for the simulated historical climate data using different methods. We considered the benchmark scenario for the water balance method and for the regression relationship. The third model scenario is called the dynamic regression scenario. For this scenario the regression relationship is used to estimate the S<sub>r</sub> of the simulated historical and simulated 2K climate data. These values are then used for the historical and future part of the model, respectively. <br/><br/>Comparing the benchmark scenarios shows that the regression relationship only has a minimal impact on the change in hydrological response. The impact of the time-dynamic S<sub>r</sub> on the change in hydrological response of the system is quantified by comparing the benchmark scenario for the regression relationship with the dynamic regression scenario. The comparison indicates that a time-dynamic S<sub>r</sub> results in an increase of absolute evaporation during the summer months (+6.6%), while at the same time resulting in lower values for the streamflow (-8.6%) and groundwater storage (-4.8%) during the winter months. The root-zone storage capacity shows an increase throughout the whole year (maximum +23.6%). In other words, the time-dynamic root-zone storage capacity has a significant impact on the seasonality of the change in the hydrological response. The results also show that the regression relationship is promising and suggests that it might be a good way to estimate the root-zone storage capacity for climate projections in temperate climates.<br","Root-zone storage capacity; Time-dynamic parameter; Regression relationship; Climate-analogy; Hydrological model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Water Management | Hydrology","",""

The river has always been an important shipping route, even though its navigability has been problematic in the Netherlands. To solve this problem seven weirs were constructed in the Dutch part of the Meuse. They are located at Borgharen, Linne, Roermond, Belfeld, Sambeek, Grave and Lith. Weirs are hydraulic structures and mainly control the upstream water level to allow for sufficient depth for shipping. Structures such as weirs generally have a technical life span of 100 years, and because the Meuse weirs were built 100 years ago they are up for replacement. Rijkswaterstaat wishes to have uniformity in the designs of the next Meuse weirs. This decreases the amount of unique components which in turn leads to the reduction of repair and maintenance costs. <br/><br/>The main objective of this thesis is to determine the most cost-efficient maintenance strategy for the next generation Meuse weirs. Part of the objective of this study is also to determine the influence of ship collisions on the availability and costs of weirs. In this thesis a case study is used to set up the analysis. The case study consists of two weir alternatives that were proposed as the replacement for the weir in Grave. <br/><br/>Based on the results for both the availability and costs of both maintenance strategies in this report it seems that the preventive maintenance strategy performs better than the corrective maintenance strategy for both weir alternatives. The availability under preventive maintenance is higher and the total costs (maintenance costs and repair costs) are lower under preventive maintenance. The availability of the weirs are mostly influenced by the failure mechanism of ship collision and the weir component “hydraulic aggregates”. The largest contributor to the maintenance costs are the hydraulic cylinders and for the repair costs the most significant contributor are the hydraulic aggregates. Ship collisions seem to influence the availability greatly, but has limited influence on the repair costs of the weirs. <br","Weirs; Asset Management; Availability; Life Cycle Costing; Meuse; Rijkswaterstaat","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering | Hydraulic Structures and Flood Risk","",""

It can be seen that with a flat plate, the impact increases almost instantaneously and produces a high peak. Adding aeration reduces this peak considerably. Fromexamining the impact of the wedges, it can be concluded that the pressure rises more slowly at a higher deadrise angle. The almost instantaneous drop in pressure seen with a flat plate changes to a smoother rise at a high deadrise angle. <br/><br/>In addition to the experiment, numerical simulations are carried out to verify the solution. The numerical simulations also give a better insight into the pressure across the width of the object. Upon examining the numerical simulations, it is concluded that the results for deadrise angles of 15± and 30± are equivalent to the results of the results of the experiment. However, the simulations for a flat plate result in an high pressure which is probably due to a low number of data points which capture the peak. <br/><br/>It can be concluded that the shape of the structure and aeration have a significant influence on the maximum pressure. However, the decrease due to a higher deadrise angle is more significant than the effect of additional aeration. With higher aeration, the maximum pressures are closer together and the difference in deadrise angle has less effect. When examining the impact pressures the effect of both deadrise angle and aeration can be seen. The maximum impact for a non aerated flat plate impact measured is 9.93[bar ] and is decreased by 8.8[bar ] for a wedge impact with a deadrise angle of 30± which drops in water that is 4% aerated. The influence of both shape and aeration can be reviewed independently which leads to an reduction of impact pressure for a flat plate of 59 percent when 4% air is added to the system. When only changing the deadrise angle to 30± a reduction of 86% is found.","Green water; Pressure impact; Experimental; CFD; wave impact","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Marine Technology | Ship Hydromechanics","",""

(graduation committee); Flipsen, Bas (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","With the already happening governmental regulations(The Netherlands), an increase in consumer price of natural gas is noticeable. With COVID-19 and now the war in Ukraine energy resources are becoming increasingly expensive. 90 percent Dutch houses are heated with gas. Based on the energy consultant, gas supplies an average to 9769 kWh of energy per m3. Each house use up to 1500 m3 per year. 14654 kWh for a year on an average is needed for one household. A heat pump (HP) needs about 6513 kWh average per year depending on type house, size and season. From society we are going through a shift from gas to electricity. For a house this can be done with replacing a gas based boiler with for instance a heat pump. But it doesn’t necessarily provide people the same scale of thermal comfort. Shouldn’t we rethink the way we feel comfortable in our homes? Design opportunities that contributes to Bosch’s future vision and mission are explored. The problem at the heart of this project is defined as: To what extent can a product increase the personal thermal comfort of the user and be more energy efficient? And can therefore a personal product provide the necessary heat if the central heating temperature settings is set to 18°C? User-centered design and thermal comfort are the key methodology and research supporting this project. Both were used for exploring the relationship between users’ behaviour (personal heaters) and the influencing factors, thereby providing valuable insights for all design directions. This project is finalized with a product concept, “Ori”, a flexible Far Infrared (FIR) heater that has multi product configurations and use-cases. It applies various design criteria based on the inputs of thermal comfort research, user interviews, heating technology research, aiming and product flexibility configurations to create a personal experience for users. If the challenges are addressed, Ori could be a valuable product for Bosch’s consumer products portfolio and offer the user financial benefit and a decrease in yearly electrical energy consumption. Ori will use up to 229 kWh per year which is nearly 10 times less compared to a conventional personal heater (2148 kWh). The performance would be measurable through a simulation of a working HP, a room, a user, Ori and a Predicted Mean Vote (PMV) measurement device that address thermal comfort (ISO 7730). In addition to this concept, this project has addressed possible opportunities and requirements in the field of FIR heating, which could be used as an input for other relevant product developments within Bosch’s (thermal) comfort and well-being department.","Infrared Heating; Far Infrared; Personal Thermal Comfort; Aiming heat; Personal Heating; Product design; Energy efficiency; Radiant heating","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

(graduation committee); Levin, Yigal (graduation committee); van Maarschalkerweerd, Rens (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Rijkswaterstaat’s Storm Surge Barriers are expensive assets providing economic value with the expectation of future returns. The maintenance is executed by the asset management department, which aims at maximizing operability without sacrificing safety and reliability. However, regular maintenance becomes more stringent as circumstances change, and a budget shortfall is expected in the same timeframe. These operational and economical interferences urge the asset management department to adapt using more data-driven approaches replacing (some) physical inspections and only conducting maintenance when needed. This so-called data-driven asset management has the potential to reduce costs and ensure reliability. <br/>Despite the promise, there is no guidance for developing data-driven asset management. In this thesis, design principles are developed to assist in better decision-making using data-driven technologies, resulting in effective maintenance. These new design principles integrate three different areas into the current asset management: Digital Twins (DT), providing a virtual environment for safely testing in various scenarios, Predictive Maintenance (PdM) for confidently predicting a future asset failure and Data Governance (DG), ensuring the data quality for appropriate decision-making for the mentioned data-driven technologies. In other words, the goal of this research is to develop design principles that overcome real-world asset data-related problems during the implementation of DT, PdM and DG within the asset management context.<br/><br/>The qualitative design-based research methodology consists of the following steps: Identifying real-world problems, developing appropriate solutions, and then finalizing by prescribing actionable sentences, also known as design principles. This research design was demonstrated in a real-life case for the Storm Surge Barriers asset class at Rijkswaterstaat (RWS). Two data-collecting research methods were utilized. The first data collecting method was the literature study, which acquired information from 25+ scientific papers from three developing fields in the scientific literature: PdM, DT and DG. The second was a series of semi-structured interviews held with 33 RWS interviewees in different parts of the organization, collecting real-life asset data problems and the associated best practices. To guide the interviews across the data-driven developments and the current status of data governance within RWS, an interview protocol was constructed. The interviews results revealed contrasting views on (1) the SSB openness to new technology, (2) the alignment between asset management priorities and the data-driven technology, and (3) data access by third parties. These contrasting viewpoints unknowingly construct invisible (almost) impermeable walls between different layers in the RWS organization, which prevents knowledge spillovers, resulting in departments maturing at different rates and impeding the understanding and communication between them.<br/> <br/>As part of the research design, four types of design principles were formulated. The first was the interview-derived design principles. The second type was the literature derived design principles acquired by the results from the literature study. After that, the interview and the literature-derived principles were combined into 'the refined design principles’. The last type is the data governance design principles, for which the problems were inspired by semi-structured interviews and are solely solved by the current data governance literature. <br/><br/>Thereafter, the refined and data governance design principles were tested within the context of the DT and the PdM by using data flow diagrams. The benefit of using the data flow diagrams is to test if the selected design principles improve the practices of asset management. <br/>Consequently, 33 design principles were developed across the four types of design principles that prescribe guidance on how PdM, DT and DG contribute to developing data-driven asset management. From these, 4 were data governance design principles, and 12 were refined design principles. The refined design principles were not found in prior literature and could be further grouped into short-term and long-term relevance for asset management.<br/>The novelty that these refined design principles bring is twofold, filling in two gaps in the literature. Firstly, It brings clear guidelines which were previously scattered and unclearly presented across the scientific literature. Secondly, these design principles are approached in a novel manner by combining the core insights from the literature and the inclusion of empirical best practices in a real-life case. <br/><br/>The results of implementing the relevant data governance and refined design principles into the AM are twofold. Firstly, the DeP’s enhanced the DT from primarily visualization into a more multifunctional usable digital asset for various asset management purposes. Secondly, implementing the same set of principles enhanced the PdM by including the most important factors to produce reliable automatic predictions to better manage the maintenance schedule.<br/><br/>The managerial recommendation is that the digital twins and predictive maintenance development need to develop hand in hand with data governance aspects and utilize a system to centralize the knowledge across all storm surge barriers, like periodic communities of practices. A lack of these two crucial developments will inhibit RWS long-term vision of transitioning from a pure civil organization to a hybrid organization: A synergy between civil engineering discipline and data-driven technologies.<br/><br","Storm surge barrier; Digital Twin; Predictive Maintenance; Data governance; Design principles; asset management; Rijkswaterstaat","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","This thesis is performed with the aim to investigate whether split flaps can be a feasible solution for increasing the Flying V directional control power. In order to do so, a set of wind tunnel experiments have been concluded with a 4.6% half wing model in the Open-Jet-Facility at the Delft University of Technology. Here, several split flap geometries have been tested on the model outboard wing section to fully establish their behaviour in terms of yaw and other parameters of interest. Additionally, calculations have been performed to provide an adequate split flap design for certification of the lateral-directional specifications from CS-25. <br/><br/>From the wind tunnel experiments, it was found that split flaps on the outboard wing section can effectively increase the directional control power over angles of attack between 0 and 30 degrees. However, yaw control is lost when over negative angles of attack due to lower wing stall. The maximum decrease in split flap effectiveness over positive angles of attack is found around 17.5 degrees, where a leading edge vortex is present over the outboard wing. This decreases pressure over the upper split flap, resulting in a effectiveness decrease of around 41%. As the effectiveness does not decrease further, split flaps can be continuously effective at higher angles of attack when compared to the winglet rudders. The low pressure on the upper flap also causes large adverse coupled moments in pitch and roll. The effect of split flaps on the yawing moment is found to be linear with deflection angle, where their effect on other aerodynamic properties is found to be more non-linear.<br/><br/>The deflection of outboard split flaps do not have a significant interference effect on rudder yaw power, but can have some interference effects on adjacent main wing control surfaces. Differential deflection between the upper and lower flap has been shown to potentially decrease coupling in pitch and roll. The split flaps can also be globally rotated trailing edge down to mitigate adverse coupled moments while beneficially increasing the total created yaw. <br/><br/>From trim calculations, it was found that a maximum additional yaw coefficient of 2.4113e-3 has to be provided by the split flaps. Designs with a maximum deflection angle above 30 degrees are deemed feasible, as this would maximally require only the replacement of the current CS3 surfaces. When a maximum deflection of 60 degrees is set by the designer, a sub-scale split flap width of 111.87 mm is needed, which translates to a full-scale split flap of 2.431 m. Based on the sensitivity analysis and projected Reynolds effects, this is considered a conservative design for the full-scale Flying V. At 0 degrees angle of attack, the recommended geometry is projected to increase the maximum directional control power of the Flying V by 38.1%. At 27.5 degrees, the maximum directional control power can even be increased by 85.5%. Both increases come at the cost of a significant drag penalty.<br","Flying V; Wind tunnel testing; Split flaps; Directional control; Flying wing; Stability and control","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

This research investigates a flexible, floating and modular seaport. This seaport is stored all around the world and when necessary it ships seaport handling capacity from those storage facilities to the disaster area in order to help with the disaster relief effort. After usage of a mathematical optimization model and the determination of several possible future disaster scenarios we propose that an applicable logistical design of this seaport stores 1,950 TEU/h of handling capacity of this flexible seaport at Kuala Lumpur and 812 TEU/h at Algiers. Next to the logistics contribution the way in which the possible usage of such a seaport influences the communication process of actors involved in a disaster relief effort is studied. We propose that the collaborative sensemaking in disasters is the object of interest. With the help of an emergency simulation role playing game experiment it is concluded that the usage of the seaport leads to, among other things; more equally distributed participation, quicker start of sharing of information, increased awareness of the role of others and more agreement on the common goal. The hypothesis is that this is because of an increased complexity. Integrating this complexity with the logistical applicable design leads to storing a smaller amount of seaport handling capacity at a lot of facilities. This results in a design of opening facilities in Kuala Lumpur (with 1350 TEU/h stored), Algiers (with 356 TEU/h stored), Dakar (with 57 TEU/h stored), Maputo (with 279 TEU/h stored), Berbara (with 35 TEU/h stored) and Corinto (with 332 TEU/h stored).","humanitarian logistics; disaster response; mathematical optimization; warehouse location; Collaborative sensemaking; Complex interaction","en","master thesis","","","","","","Double degreee in Mechanical Engineering and Applied Sciences | Science Communication","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

The V-shaped configuration of the Flying-V integrates the passenger cabin and cargo volume into the lifting surface and has fins to provide lateral and directional stability. Several studies have been conducted into various aspects of the Flying-V, including the aerodynamics, structure and handling qualities. The objective of this research is to evaluate the flight performance characteristics of a Flying-V aircraft and compare results to a reference aircraft, by simulating takeoff, landing, climb and cruise using a flight mechanics model. More specifically, the performance characteristics of the Flying-V-1000 (FVK) and Airbus A350-1000 (A35K) are evaluated and compared. The subject of flight performance answers practical questions about what an aircraft is capable of. Using an in-house developed flight mechanics toolbox, various sub-models are integrated to create a flight mechanics model. The aerodynamic model is based on data from a vortex-lattice method developed by Airbus, enhanced with empirical zero-lift drag and wave drag models. Other sub-models that have been integrated include an inertia model, a propulsion model, a pilot model and a landing gear model.<br/>On average, the FVK features a 25% shorter takeoff distance than the A35K. This difference is mainly due to the significantly smaller minimum unstick speed of the FVK, which is a consequence of the FVK’s larger tailstrike attitude. For both aircraft, geometric tailstrike constraints determine the minimum unstick speed, rather than the elevator effectiveness. The shorter takeoff distance of the FVK also leads to an averaged 30% shorter Balanced Field Length (BFL). The relative difference between the BFL of both aircraft is larger than for the takeoff distance, because the FVK is able to brake more effectively than the A35K.<br/>The landing distances and approach speeds of both aircraft are similar, although the total landing distance is distributed differently over the phases of the landing manoeuvre. Due to a combination of a higher touchdown attitude and smaller ground attitude, the derotation distance of the FVK is significantly larger than for the A35K, assuming equal derotation rates for both aircraft. The FVK is able to compensate its longer derotation distance with a shorter braking distance to achieve a similar total landing distance as the A35K. An analysis of the pilot’s vision during the landing flare manoeuvre has shown that the FVK’s obscured segment can be twice as large as for the A35K. For landings performed with poor visibility, this could be problematic for the FVK.<br/>Due to its larger maximum L/D, the FVK has better climb performance characteristics than the A35K. With One Engine Inoperative, the FVK is able to meet the climb gradient requirements of CS25.125 for altitudes up to 8000 ft at Maximum Takeoff Mass. The absolute service ceilings of the FVK and A35K were found to be 13.4 km and 12.0 km, respectively.<br/>Evaluation of the Specific Air Range (SAR) parameter shows that the FVK outperforms the A35K in terms of cruise efficiency. The maximum trimmed aerodynamic efficiency, transonic efficiency and Range Parameter (RP) were found to be respectively 17%, 21% and 21% higher for the FVK. The Mach numbers and lift coefficients where the RP maxima are located suggest an optimal cruise altitude of 12.0 km for the FVK and 11.3 km for the A35K.","Flying-V; Flight Performance; Flight Mechanics; Unconventional aircraft","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Due to global warming and the subsequent rise of the sea level, scarcity of land to build on, the continues increase of the world’s population and a shift in population from rural areas to the city, there is a need for innovative projects to tackle or deal with the increase of needed liveable area. One of the solutions is floating cities. A component of a modern city is high-rise buildings. High-rise is an advantageous option to deal with the limited availability of ground surface on the floating platforms. The question is whether it is possible to realise these floating high-rise structures.<br/>This research investigates whether it is possible to realise high-rise buildings on floating platforms with limited dimensions on the sea or ocean regarding stability. And if it is feasible, what the requirements are for the general dimensions of both the platform and the high-rise building. For this purpose, conditions were used from three representative locations. At these three locations, the floating high-rise is tested for four different wave situations: Tsunami, Growing waves, most extreme wave. And an Irregular wave field. The platform and building are tested whether the structure could meet the various requirements and regulations. These are divided into three forms of stability: Buoyancy, static stability and dynamic stability.<br/>In this study, for both the platform and the building a square cross-section is used and both are prismatic in the direction of the height. The platform and the core of the building are made of concrete. Apart from the four parameters: height of the building and width, height and depth of the platform all other parameters are based on these four parameters. No stability systems in the building were used (except the core), nor methods to keep the platform in place, such as mooring systems.<br/>For the buoyancy, mainly the relation between the mass and the depth of the platform is determined. This is a relationship that has been used extensively in static and dynamic stability. The mass of the building and platform pose few problems for staying afloat. In fact, extra ballast water can easily be used to make the platform heavier in order to achieve the desired mass or depth.<br/>For the static stability a combination of hand calculations based on the GM-method and a model that can include deformations in the calculations as well is used. A linear relationship was found between the height of the building and the width of the platform for which the floating high-rise is stable.<br/>The model is used to determine the minimum platform depth and height, as well as the rotation for different building heights and platform widths. It follows that there are platform widths for which the vertical force is minimal. This is when the width of the platform is equal to the wavelength of the wave or a multiple of it. In addition, there are platform widths for which the moment due to the wave force on the platform is minimal. These values are called ""zero moment widths"" because for these widths the wave moment, regardless of position or time, is approximately equal to 0 kNm. Therefore the rotation is minimal when these zero moment widths are used for the platform width. These widths are only optimal for the specific wavelength for which they are calculated. If the wavelength is different, the zero moment widths will be different.<br/>For the dynamic stability, a model consisting of three point masses distributed over the height connected with a beam was used. The three point masses each have three degrees of freedom: vertical and horizontal translation and rotation. With this model the accelerations of the three possible motions for different heights of the building, platform widths and platform masses (this can be adjusted by including ballast water) are calculated. It follows that: The tsunami and the growing wave are not a problem and the most extreme wave or the irregular wave field is normative; The vertical acceleration is minimal when the width of the platform is equal to the wavelength or a multiple of it; The vertical acceleration is only normative for small building heights and platform widths, whereas it is the biggest cause of seasickness; The horizontal acceleration at the top of the building due to both the horizontal motion and the rotation is almost always normative. It is largely caused by the rotation of the platform; If the zero moment widths are used for the width of the platform, the rotation and thus the horizontal acceleration is minimal. This does not mean that the accelerations are below the limit.<br/>In order to avoid resonance in the motion, and thus extreme accelerations, of the floating high-rise with an irregular wave field, graphs are made were the combination of the height of the building and the width of the platform that result in resonance are shaded. <br/>Using the results of the static and dynamic analysis and a few case studies, it can be concluded that with the design choices and simplifications used, it is not possible to realise floating high-rise buildings on platforms with limited dimension at the North Sea and the North of the Atlantic ocean due to too extreme condition causing too high accelerations, especially in the horizontal motion. The static stability and the buoyancy are less of a problem. If one of these locations is chosen, platforms over 600 m wide are required that are so stable that the rotation of the platform is minimal and no resonance occurs in the rotation motion. In this case, the conditions are similar to those on land and the wind force becomes the governing factor. In those cases, the same approach and measures should be used as for high-rise buildings on land. Even with these sizes, it is advised to use the zero moment widths to limit the rotation as much as possible. <br/>The location on the Atlantic Ocean around the equator is the only location that is promising. The results show that several building heights are possible on different platform dimensions for the highest wave, as long as the platforms have the zero moment widths dimensions. However, it appears that the accelerations become too high when these sizes for the building and platform are tested with different wave frequencies with lower wave heights. Therefore, this option might not be suitable either, but it is not excluded in this research. One option is found that meets the regulations for all possible wave frequencies is a 50 m building on a platform 223 m wide (a zero moment width) and 22.7 m deep for the location around the equator. This proves that it is possible to construct high-rise buildings on platforms of limited size with the design choices used, but that it is very difficult and the options are limited.<br/>Despite the conclusion that it is almost impossible with the design choices, floating high-rise buildings on limited platforms are still expected to be possible as the design can be improved. The first next steps to investigate are other, better shapes for the platform and building to increase stability and reduce overall forces. In addition, it is recommended that other methods of increasing stability and reducing motion, such as building stabilisation systems and tuned mass dampers, are investigated. With these improvements floating high-rise is more feasible than found in this research.<br","Floating; High-rise; Stability; Cities; Buoyancy; Static stability; Dynamic Stability","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Building Engineering - Structural Design","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","In the near future, pressure on sustainability requirements in building structures will increase further as governments around the world are forced to tackle climate change issues. The construction industry is one of the most resource intensive and wasteful sectors in the world and is estimated to keep growing at a fast pace due to growing populations. Earth building materials and construction systems are perhaps one of the most attractive options available. The advantages of raw earth are that it is considered to be widely available, recyclable, can be sourced at low costs, can exhibit high strength and can provide an excellent indoor climate for occupants. The interest in building with earth is experiencing a renaissance but advancements in Earth Building Technology is currently at its infancy. Most improvement in earth buildings has been related to fabrication methods, where current developments and opportunities in additive manufacturing has potential to create a new form of earth architecture. From a mechanical perspective, earth materials are strong in compression and weak tension, making compression-only structures like arches, vaults and domes especially interesting.<br/>The purpose of this thesis is to determine how feasible it is to combine earth material with a robotic sprayed earth fabrication method to build wall and arch structures. Emphasis has been put in understanding the material for robotic fabrication. Therefore, an in-depth literature study of earth materials and their properties was conducted to understand how they gain strength. In AM, modelling the structural-up of a printed structure requires time-dependent material properties where early-age behaviour is especially critical. As a result, time-dependent compressive strength and Young’s modulus of potential shotearth with and without cement stabilisation was predicted. Equations from the material predictions were input into the design tool developed by Witteveen+Bos to explore geometrical shapes, assess printing time and dimensions that can be achieved.<br/>The results of this work show that earth building materials is essentially impossible to predict without testing as soil composition has a big influence on mechanical strength. Prediction of raw earth properties was based on understanding of soil consistencies and water content. Prediction of cement stabilised earth properties was based on existing data from 3D extruded and sprayed concrete experiments. 3D printed structures, extruded and sprayed, can be compared to ancient masonry structures in their structural design and inspiration from these structures sees different layering techniques adopted to minimise formwork and maximise structural efficiency and strength. Through a geometrical non-linear FE analysis with the time-dependent properties defined and varying robotic printing speeds between 1000 -6000 mm/min, a free standing wall structure of one meter width can reach heights between 0.1 and 0.62 m. For the overhanging structures, a barrel vault and a half dome, considering no formwork, an 8.5 -10.5 degrees arch or tilt can be achieved, compared to the vertical free wall. It is found that for lower printing speeds, more structure can be printed before failure. For the half dome almost the full geometry can be achieved. The unstabilised and cement stabilised upper bound material models resulted in comparable geometric dimensions for all structures analysed. Results of this study also compared the barrel vault and half dome using the roman (radial) and nubian (inclined) layering techniques.","earth construction; sprayed earth; Robotic fabrication; 3D printing; Structural parametric design; FEM modelling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Building Engineering","",""

This unreliability therefore currently makes it impossible to accurately recognise lane changes from solely this data. This study looks into the recognition of lane changes from only Floating Car Data by the use of a Random Forest algorithm. In order to find the ground truth, a trajectory reconstruction algorithm is implemented, which uses the matching of trajectories with loop detector passages in order to find the lane a vehicle is in at each loop detector location. This information is then used to know whether, for each vehicle, a lane change is made on the road section in-between two consecutive loop detector locations. By training the model on this data, it was found that when using solely Floating Car Data, lane changes can be recognised with an accuracy of up to 64%. Indicators for lane change were found to be the lateral distance of a vehicle to the middle of the road, as well as the heading of the vehicle.

Inner-city developments in Dutch cities are limiteddue to the high density of the urban fabric. Therefore, the focus of urban transformation gradually moved from the inner-city developments to the periphery of the city. These boundary zones are often former industrial sites that are currently derelict and underused, due to the rapid de-industrialization in Europe that took place. These areas offer a unique opportunity to address the demand for housing and the space for new economic sectors. The Dutch urban areas are more than abandoned industrial sites that need to be regenerated. The presence of industrial legacy in the form of industrial heritage is a source of added value for these redevelopments. The reappraisal of industrial heritage is a catalyst effect that ensures further urban revitalization due to its societal, historical, architectural, and technological importance. This type of development is a kickstarter for further redevelopment and upgrading deprived areas. <br/><br/>Furthermore, the reappraisal of industrial heritage by adaptive reuse has a positive effect on the triple bottom line of sustainability. Capturing the value that is linked to the triple bottom line of sustainability is challenging due to the various components that define them. To reach sustainable development on the basis of the triple bottom line of sustainability, linkages and an equilibrium of all components should be reached. The sustainability of adaptive reuse in industrial heritage is an interplay between coping with challenges and emphasizing on benefits. Developments are always reaching for the maximum, and try to achieve sustainable development. Despite the identifiable benefits, the revitalization of Dutch urban areas also faces a myriad of challenges. Challenges and barriers encountered make it futile and hard to obtain. The financing of complex urban development, with the adaptive reuse of industrial heritage, is a major challenge. Due to the challenges and uncertainties this development faces, the cost rises with it. The main challenge is finding implementation methods and feasible and appropriate financial instruments that maximize<br/>the benefits on economic, social, and environmental sustainability of regenerating these areas.<br/><br/>Adaptive reuse of industrial heritage greatly improves social and environmental sustainability. The degree to which this sustainability is improved is dependent on the perceived sustainability benefits on sustainability. This research begins to understand the factors that impact the degree of added value. Understanding these factors, the process of adaptive reuse of industrial heritage can be optimized to ensure more sustainable and successful end-products.<br/><br/>Adaptive reuse of industrial heritage has clear benefits, it is important that industrial heritage is continuously being transformed to preserve the industrial legacy and to cope with the pressure on the current building stock.","Adaptive Reuse; Industrial Heritage; Revitalization; Stakeholder management; Financing; Economic; Social; Environmental; Sustainability","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Management in the Built Environment","","51.91110774884677, 4.449507844911606"

(mentor); Mulder, S.S. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Intelligent and connected services have become essential in the manufacturing industry. The surge of these services has even started a new phase of industry; industry 4.0. The COALA consortium aims to develop a service to assist operators within this new industry. The COALA consortium is an European Union Programme and aims to develop a Digital Intelligent Assistant (DIA). The DIA supports operators in situations characterised by cognitive load, time pressure, and little or zero tolerance for quality issues with trustworthy AI components. Diversey is one of the consortium’s partners and perceives COALA’s DIA as a viable solution to their stoppage challenge on their production lines in the factory. These stoppages can be caused by various bottlenecks, which are hard to determine due to the production lines’ complexity and processes. Therefore, this thesis explores how to prepare for AI service adoption within the factory of Diversey. However, management from the Diversey factory has attempted to identify the bottlenecks by collecting production information through operator data entries. Unfortunately, the operators did not provide the tool with quality data entries. Therefore, replacing this tool with the DIA most likely not succeed, especially when the new tool utilises AI technology that requires learning data to generate insights. In order to explore this resistance toward new tools within the factory, I used the frame creation method of Dorst. This method excels at finding innovative solutions for problem definitions with previously unsuccessful attempts. The method explores underlying themes within the context to reframe the problem definition and find new solution spaces. The themes are formulated from interviews with management, eight support staff employees across four departments, a team lead, and six operators. Four themes are generated by analysing the values, interactions, and ‘currency’ exchanged between stakeholders. These themes regarding new tools describe the unclear contributions to operators’ work, the lack of acknowledgement regarding operators’ role and expertise towards production improvements. These themes result in a lack of trust between operators and management, which diminish the willingness to adopt new tools. Additionally, management expresses concerns about the themes expertise and consistency, which are essential to the manufacturing industry. In order to address these themes, COALA’s DIA is reframed as a stage for expertise and exploration. Instead of simply requesting data entries, operators are put in the spotlight where they can showcase their knowledge and expertise. Additionally, this stage provides a space for operators to explore production improvements through collaboration with COALA’s DIA. The framing of the problem definition addresses the data collection aspect of COALA’s DIA. However, AI systems change over time as the systems adapt to the data input. Additionally, the thesis did not assess the users’ perception of the current DIA interface. Therefore, I recommend further research into human-AI interaction with regards to the system’s evolution over time and the interface. Lastly, the themes are generated from one production line’s operators who are experiencing the most stoppages. The themes cannot directly be generalised to other production lines as the number of stoppages, or other contextual factors can influence the themes.","Frame creation; Artificial Intelligence; Industry 4.0; Design Strategy; COALA","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

A vital part of the logistic chain, it is also one of the main contributors to the worldwide CO2 emissions. Current propulsion technologies all rely on the same classic diesel driven technology, as diesel is widely available and has a high energy density.<br/><br/>The goal of this research is to identify greener solutions to propel a vessel sailing for short distances. During a definition study, several fuels and energy converters were studied and benchmarked based on a use case. The results showed that (a combination of) the dual fuel internal combustion, using bio diesel and hydrogen, and the low temperature proton exchange membrane fuel cell, fuelled with hydrogen, is the most feasible setup for the use case. Such a combination in itself is not a new one, but in the literature only an all-electric setup is described. In the proposed solution an internal combustion engine is driving the propellor shaft directly, assisted by an electric motor powered by the fuel cell.<br/><br/>Based on this outcome, the following research question was defined:<br/><br/>How can an internal combustion dual fuel engine and/or LTPEM fuel cell be integrated to form a cost effective solution to propel a short sea ship running on hydrogen?<br/><br/>First, nine designs were created, ranging from a conventional diesel engine setup as a reference case, to a fully electric design powered by fuel cells. All main components in these designs are analyzed regarding part load efficiencies. With these efficiencies, the fuel consumption at different loads are calculated. Based on a use case scenario the total fuel costs are calculated. The CAPEX and the OPEX of the designs are determined to calculate the total costs. As currently no other fuel can compete with diesel, the designs are compared based on the price per tons of CO2 emissions, as the shipping industry is expected to see a CO2 emission penalty in the near future. For each design, what the height of this penalty has to be to reach the breakeven point at the end of the use case was calculated. Based on the lowest CO2 price, an all-electric, fuel cell powered design was identified as the most promising option. Applying additional operational arguments such as redundancy and end user acceptance, it was decided together with Conoship to choose a combination of an internal combustion engine and a fuel cell.<br/>This configuration is worked out in detail to answer the sub questions, covering efficiency improvement and system integration, during which it became apparent that not all information is available to answer all these sub questions. The design needs further research in a multidisciplinary team. A simulation model would be helpful in this further research.

This is especially apparent when certain features of the environment are unknown such as unexpected downsteps (for example, suddenly walking off the side-walk or not expecting the last stair when descending). Humans can negotiate these downsteps ---both expected and unexpected--- with remarkable agility and ease. The contributions from active compensation, passive dynamics, and reflexes that humans employ to overcome these downsteps are however not inherently present in bipedal robots. This motivates us to assess whether externally observed behavior can be used to achieve the same capabilities in bipedal robots. One of the challenges with this proposal is the morphological differences between humans and robots. Taking the bipedal robot Cassie as an example, these differences predominantly constitute to overall- and segment mass, leg morphology, and a lack of an upper body. The observed behavior from the human should subsequently be scaled to represent an appropriate nominal and compensatory behavior of the robot.<br/><br/>This thesis aims to systematically study the translation of this human behavior to bipedal walking robots, regardless of the morphology of the walkers. We start from human experimental data where nominal walking, expected downstep, and unexpected downstep trials were conducted. The human data is analyzed from the perspective of a reduced-order representation of the human. The reduced-order representation encodes the center of mass dynamics and contact forces. An equivalent reduced-order model is used to represent the bipedal robot, which allows for the translation of the nominal walking and downstep behaviors between human and robot. The morphological differences between the human and the robot are therefore resolved by realizing dynamically equivalent behavior which is embedded into the full-order dynamics of a bipedal robot via optimization-based controllers. The results demonstrate traversing expected and unexpected downsteps in simulation on the underactuated 3D walking robot Cassie.","bipedal Walking; robotic locomotion; human locomotion; Dynamic Environment; unexpected downsteps; reduced order models; template models; bipedal robotics; robust locomotion; dynamic similarity","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

The large amount of complex operations performed nowadays, motivates the relevance of motion predictions. The company Next Ocean provides these forecasts, based on linear seakeeping theory. While highly linear degrees of freedom are predicted accurately, roll motion predictions prove to be more demanding and are less accurate. This research aims to improve roll prediction accuracy by adding (non)linear damping to the equations of motion. The prediction optimization is performed on data of the platform supply vessel Acta Auriga.<br/><br/>To enable the use of nonlinear forces, the equations of motions are first implemented in the time domain using Cummins’ equations. The linear coefficients in this equation are determined from the frequency dependent coefficients in Acta Auriga’s hydrodynamic database. To ensure the correctness and investigate the limitations of the implemented Cummins equation, the results from the time and frequency domain are extensively compared. Both monochromatic excitations, as well as spectrum (JONSWAP) excitations are considered. In contrast to linear force coefficients, nonlinear force coefficients are generally not known for a given vessel. Implementing these forces into the equations of motion imposes the need for an approximation of these coefficients. Estimates for the linear, quadratic and cubic viscous damping forces are made, using both the measured motions of a vessel operating at sea and the predictions of the corresponding excitation force, made by Next Ocean. A multivariate regression algorithm is used for the identification.<br/><br/>The Cummins equation was successfully implemented. However, the translation from frequency to time domain was more error prone than anticipated; the frequency dependent coefficients need to meet requirements that are typically not met by databases meant for frequency domain calculations only. Furthermore, degrees of freedom without a restoring force showed running away behaviour that could not be negated without adding extra damping. The roll motion was susceptible to instabilities. The exact origin of this instability was looked for, but could not be found. Adding damping resolved the instability. Furthermore, the interpolation in the roll response amplitude operator introduced errors in the initialisation of time domain calculations, which led to inaccurate results when spectrum excitations corresponding to more severe sea states were used. Only under specific conditions, these high energy spectra led to accurate roll predictions. Adding damping made for a close match between frequency and time domain calculation for all degrees of freedom. The complexities mentioned made that an easily scalable algorithm could not be obtained using time domain calculations. Easy scalability be- ing important to Next Ocean means that running time domain simulations in Next Ocean’s product is deemed unrealistic. This also means that no nonlinear forces can be used in real time applications.<br/><br/>In an attempt to improve linear predictions, coefficients in the linear seakeeping model, including the linear damping coefficient, are identified and vessel motions are re-predicted with the added damping and updated linear force coefficients, using the Cummins equation. None of the identified parameters led to better predictions than were obtained by Next Ocean. Identifying and updating parameters was therefore concluded to be not beneficial to the quality of the motion predictions. Adding a fixed amount of linear roll damping, which was not identified from the field data, did lead to improved prediction quality; correlations between predictions and measurements increased by 9.6%.<br/><br/>While the motion prediction could not be improved using the Cummins equation, valuable information on the time domain simulations was obtained. The finding that better predictions were consistently obtained by adding a fixed amount of damping, sparks an opportunity for further research into the ideal amount of damping. This, and more elaborate identification schemes could provide meaningful insight to improve motion predictions.","Time Domain; Identification; Non-Linear; Motion Prediction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-04-07","","","","Marine Technology | Ship Hydromechanics","",""

The Province of South Holland envisions sustaining the region with the port of Rotterdam as an important energy node for Europe and the region itself. Now, the port still relies heavily on petrol, which will become obsolete in this transition. Therefore, the petrol dependency endangers a sustainable and secure future for the port of Rotterdam region. The energy transition will be achieved through three phases from 2020, to 2030 and 2050 in an aim to gradually phase-out fossil fuels and phase-in renewable alternatives, together with increasing levels of circularity and social inclusion. Hence, this process revolves around the integration and intertwining of three main pillars that shape the framework of this project: Energy transition, Spatial justice, Circular economy. <br/><br/>In the post-petrol era of 2050, the region of Zuid Holland will embody a dynamic and adaptive energy landscape. This new energy landscape will become more resilient and autonomous. The landscape will consist of an interdependent and just network of actors and relies entirely on renewable energy sources. <br/><br/>In the future, the port of Rotterdam will be an important node on the global and regional scale. The futural port will be the core of the decentralized energy network in the region, consisting of several energy nodes that connect autonomous and self-sufficient energy regions. Besides, these nodes are serving as hubs for energy storage, raising awareness, education and other social activities. The port and the energy network will be opened up to the public to establish a new cultural relation between use and production of energy. Pernis-Botlek will be the strategic location where this comes together. The development strategy will reveal how individuals from all origins and walks of life will be included and can adapt to this change. Since, not only public actors have high interest to make this transition happen, private actors and citizens that have to change their business models and daily activities have to be considered. Therefore, the strategy also reveals how different stakeholders can work collaboratively and what actions are needed to combat the energy transition together. This will be shown with casestudies in Brielle, Delft and Westland. To maintain the economic importance in the energy sector of the port on a global scale, an invert of energy flow will be purposed, , from the import of Petrol to the export of hydrogen.<br/><br","Circular Economy; Spatial Justice; Energy Transition; Decentralized Energy Network; Post-Petrol Era","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","AR2U086 R&D Studio – Spatial Strategies for the Global Metropolis",""

This would serve as an additional economic incentive to support the pressing need to mitigate environmental damage. The guiding principles that make this transition possible include renewable energy generation, eco-sensitive development, nature-based solutions, valorization of biodegradable waste, and using policies to change consumer patterns and reformulate development trends. The proposal, along with the layers of soil data that support it is a case of why soil remediation through bio-based economic activity is vital to sustainable growth and a vision of what development within planetary boundaries would include.<br","Soil City; Soil Remediation; Bio-based economy; Nature Based Solutions; Province of South Holland","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Urbanism","AR2U086 R&D Studio – Spatial Strategies for the Global Metropolis",""

Predominantly, in the oil-based generation of energy and the consequent export of raw material. However, there is a need for a systemic shift in the energy sector as the Netherlands embarks toward its goal to become 100% carbon neutral by 2050. <br/>An analysis of the prevalent scenario revealed that the fossil-based energy production systems are not only embedded in the physical infrastructure of the region (Zuid Holland) but also in its social, economic and geopolitical networks. This means that as we phase out fossil fuels, its implications will be witnessed on both the local as well as global scales. Keeping this in mind, “Transtopia” aims to accelerate the transition towards renewable energy (production - consumption) by proposing synergies between the Port of Rotterdam and the rest of the Zuid Holland region. <br/>Primarily, by decentralizing, diversifying renewable energy production, and activating the potentialities of its regional landscapes to harness energy. It proposes endogenous methods of co-creating energy landscapes aimed to establish a resilient and adaptable energy system. One where all sectors of society (civil, public and private) can contribute and play an active role in facilitating this transition. Consequently, the spatial relations between areas of energy consumption and production can be seen as activators of urban development in Zuid Holland. Not only by strengthening the economic resilience of the region in face of the energy transition, but also ensuring social integration in this change by co-creating new infrastructure initiated by a collaboration of active sectors.<br/>Additionally, Transtopia focuses on the transformation of the port into a renewable energy hub. Since selected renewable energy such as solar, wind and biomass will be produced locally, the port becomes a backbone for the production and distribution of hydrogen in the Netherlands and around the globe. As an energy hub, the port will also facilitate research and innovation for renewable energy, establishing collaborations with universities and institutions to constantly improve the functionality of the newly integrated renewable energy systems.<br/>Transtopia aims to accelerate energy transition, focusing on engaging multiple stakeholders by creating policies. Thereby ensuring different levels of systems and synergies, which will eventually transform the urban environment into a symbiotic landscape, with a resilient and inclusive energy system that creates opportunities for economic growth.","Energy Transition; Zuid Holland; Renewable Energy; Port of Rotterdam; Resilience","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","AR2U086 R&D Studio – Spatial Strategies for the Global Metropolis",""

However, a circular economy - an economic model in which materials circulate in closed loops and waste is viewed as a resource - is vastly different from the current linear system of extraction, consumption and waste. The plastics industry that is currently present in the port of Rotterdam is one such industry where large amounts of raw material is being used and large amounts of waste generated. It is still far from circular. Thus, transitions in the industry itself and in our interaction with products are necessary. The question that arises is: how can the transition to circular plastic manufacturing in the Rotterdam maritime region contribute to a more sustainable, resilient and just economy?<br/><br/>Theory on transition management and socio-technical systems, analyses of spatial use and networks of the plastics industry in South Holland, and research on the developments in plastic manufacturing, has led to the understanding of the current networks and flows in the plastics industry. A subsequent analysis of stakeholders, policies and design options has led to a vision and strategy for the South Holland region, on how to shape a new circular plastics economy.<br/><br/>In the proposed strategy of Plasticity, (1) the strength of a strategic location in the port of Rotterdam is used to expand the renewable cycle of the bioplastics industry, and (2) by actively engaging citizens in reusing and recycling plastic products on a local level in the whole region, a technical circular cycle is enhanced in the whole province. Plastic is used as an example to demonstrate the contemporary issues around dependency on fossil material in the South Holland context, but similar principles regarding integrating the biological and technical cycle, facilitating space for innovation and growth of circular models, and engaging the whole socio-technical system in the transition process can be applied to other sectors and places.

In the process of this transition, the Port of Rotterdam, associated with the biggest fossil fuel industry landscape in Europe, is confronted with the danger of becoming a drosscape. As the Province of Zuid Holland attempts to deal with this challenge under the umbrella of circularity, new issues regarding environmental and social justice in the whole area arise and call for a coordinated planning effort towards a just transition. This effort begins by answering how can the province use the obsolete fossil fuel infrastructure to transform the port‘s material landscapes fostering spatial justice and balancing the problematic relationship between natural and man-made systems.<br/><br/>Consequently, the project decodes the layers of the material, social and environmental dimensions investigating the critical issues that associate with the port‘s distinctive territories. In parallel, it defines the main concepts that can instruct this just transition arising from the fenced urban and port districts towards the whole province and combining top-down with bottom-up planning processes. As the project evolves in time, starting at the most critical territories as nodal points and involving all the different actors, it takes the form of a central green-blue spine that meets Zuid-Holland‘s energy demands while embodying a redefined symbiosis between nature and human. The result defines a new paradigm for the energy transition and the remediation of fossil fuel drosscapes that incorporates material circularity, environmental and social justice under the concept of “Energy Habitat“.","energy habitat; energy transition; fossil fuel drosscape; material landscapes; spatial justice","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","AR2U086 R&D Studio – Spatial Strategies for the Global Metropolis","51.949600, 4.145300"

The main goal of this agreement is to obtain a climate-neutral world in 2050. The CO2 emissions should decrease as soon as possible to achieve this goal. Concrete is the world's most used building material, and with good reason, it provides cheap, solid and reliable products used for over 200 years. However, concrete is responsible for 5-10 % of the yearly CO2 emissions worldwide. These emissions are mainly because of cement production, the binding agent of concrete. Therefore, to lower the CO2 emissions from concrete, it is most effective to opt for an alternative binder. This research focuses on alkali-activated materials (AAMs), where an alkali-activated binder has replaced cement. This binder consists of a precursor and an alkaline activator. The materials most commonly used as precursors are blast furnace slag and fly ash, waste products. The production of these materials is not nearly enough to replace cement. Therefore, there is a need for alternative precursors. Volcanic materials can be an alternative precursor, and some have been successfully applied in AAMs before. However, since volcanic materials come in different forms, validation of a wide range of volcanic materials. <br/><br/>This research has investigated four European aluminosilicate volcanic materials: trass, phonolite, perlite and pumice. Each of these materials has been assessed on their particle size, chemical composition and microstructure to determine whether they exhibit (pozzolanic or latent hydraulic) reactivity. All four materials classify as inert. For trass and phonolite, the lack of reactivity is most likely because of their lack of amorphous phases (around 30% and 5%, respectively). For perlite and pumice, it is because of the too coarse particles. <br/>The reactivity of trass and phonolite is enhanced by calcination, and the reactivity of perlite and pumice is enhanced by grinding. Determination of the reactivity shows that calcination had no or a negative effect on the reactivity of trass and phonolite. Most likely because of the lack of calcium and magnesium in these materials. Ground pumice does show an increase in reactivity. However, not sufficient to be classified as reactive. Ground perlite does show reactive behaviour and is classified as pozzolanic, less reactive. <br/><br/>Ground perlite and BFS are used as precursors in mortar to assess the contribution of perlite to compressive strength development. It shows that perlite contributes to the strength of mortar when combined with a sodium silicate and sodium hydroxide activator. Likely, the sodium silicate is necessary to delay the alkalinity of the mixture. This alkaline delay makes that perlite does not form a layer of hydration products over the particles, making it impossible for perlite to react further and contribute to the compressive strength. TGA measurements found that because of the silicates that perlite contributes to the mixture, the hydration products become denser, which seem to cause higher strength. However, it is also found that silicates from sodium silicate solution are more effective in providing silicates than perlite is. <br/><br/>Of all four materials, only perlite seems to be reactive enough to contribute to the strength of alkali-activated binders as precursors. Volcanic materials cannot be considered to be one material, and each one has to be assessed individually.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering | Concrete Structures","",""

At the core of their company lies the craftsmanship of producing delftware by hand, from creating the moulds to hand-painting each piece of Delft Blue. With a fast moving industry, Royal Delft needs to innovate constantly to keep their market presence. By modernising their designs and collaborating with external companies, they manage to create contemporary Delft Blue.<br/><br/>Apart from hand-painting and transfers, Royal Delft wanted to look for new possibilities to decorate delftware. Through a collaboration with TU Delft, a first prototype was made with a lot of potential, which let to this master thesis. <br/><br/>This thesis presents an improved design of a Delft Blue painting robot with a working demonstrator. This demonstrator is able to autonomously decorate tiles with different techniques, ranging from creating personalised anniversary tiles to gold lustering and painting large tableaus. The consistency of the painting robot is achieved by analysing the surface of each tile and adjusting the brush accordingly. The robot uses the traditional brush and paint as hand-painted delftware, meaning that the robot is able to change brushes and dip the paint automatically. <br/><br/>The benefit of this production method is the quick personalisation and cost efficiency compared to other production methods. As hand-painted products are easy to customise but very expensive, and transfer products require a large batch, robotic painting is a good alternative that is both easy to customise and affordable. <br/><br/><br/>An attempt was made to expand the product range to 2.5D products, such as plates and dishes. After scanning the surface and writing the software to follow the surface, the results lacked consistency due to the accumulation of uncontrolled variables, making 2.5D painting not viable with this configuration. <br/><br/>Finally, a design was presented for implementing the robot into the Royal Delft production process. The concept was validated with a showcase product, a demonstration day in the museum and a discussion with the account managers of Royal Delft. The results were promising, and the robot could be a valuable addition to Royal Delft. <br","Craftsmanship; Ceramic; digital manufacturing; Robotics; Painting; digital craftsmanship","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

PDMS has many beneficial properties such as biocompatibility, transparency, elasticity, and easy prototyping. The main disadvantages of PDMS are its hydrophobicity (reducing cell attachment and cell proliferation), quick hydrophobic recovery (within a few hours) after surface modification, and unselective absorption of small molecules, altering drug concentration during testing or causing cross-contamination between channels. To overcome these shortcomings, an alternative material lacking the disadvantages and retaining the advantages of PDMS is needed in the field. Ostemer 324, Ostemer 220 and a variation of PDMS (PDMS+) were characterized to determine whether they would be a suitable alternative to PDMS as substrate material. The materials were compared to PDMS and characterized for spin-coating and curing on silicon wafers, moulding, etching, surface wettability before and after surface modification (plasma treatment), stiffness, optical transparency, biocompatibility and absorption of small molecules. The results of this work show that Ostemer 324 appears to be a promising alternative, with similar characteristics to PDMS. The main advantage is its hydrophilic surface, which becomes even more hydrophilic after plasma treatment, and slow hydrophobic recovery rate. However, its curing time is longer, the material is stiffer and not easy to mould. Ostemer 220 shows very poor adhesion on Teflon coated silicon wafers, is hard to mould, and shows inconsistent results during biocompatibility testing. PDMS+ is very similar to PDMS, and improves upon the latter in terms of surface wettability after surface modification, hydrophobic recovery and small molecule absorption.","Organ-on-Chip; PDMS; Elastomer; Ostemer 324; Ostemer 220; Microfabrication; Heart-on-Chip","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-04-06","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

Do we not all wish we could be forever young? We are all full of hopes and dreams for the future, never having enough time to do it all. Always studying, working and growing day by day.

This way they can ensure a worry-free retirement. However, especially younger people have a difficult time imagining their future self and making plans for the long term. All these big life decisions can be rather overwhelming. <br/>The goal of this project is to make younger participants [21-35 years] in the care and welfare sector feel more in control of their own pension by making them aware of the impact that they can have on it themselves. The idea is to develop a concept of a ‘future self’ tool for this that uses predictive knowledge. <br/>A process of literature research, two rounds of interviews with participants and interactive workshops has led to a set of criteria for this ‘future self tool’. One of the main findings is that participants, of all ages, are just not that interested in their pension. Some can worry about it or feel bad that they have not looked into it before, but no one really does anything about it. No matter someone’s age, it just still feels too far away. This is why a pension specific tool is not going to do the trick here. <br/>The Toekomstplanner (EN: Future planner) therefore does not focus on pension, but rather on the life events that younger participants are interested in already. From the interviews I have learned that especially decisions regarding moving to a new home or career related events are things that the target group already thinks about or even works towards. These decisions also have an impact on a person’s future, including their pension. The Toekomstplanner is an add-on to a participant’s Email platform. Participants can use the tool to create a checklist for a life event they plan to look into. The Toekomstplanner uses predictive knowledge to help the participant make a checklist for this life event that fits their current and future personal situation well. Pension tasks related to the life event are included in the checklist to introduce the participant to their pension in a more low key way. Next the Toekomstplanner again uses predictive knowledge to help the participant find a suitable moment to sit down and work on the checklist. In addition, The Hooked model by Nir Eyal was applied to the concept to design for a habit-forming tool that is ingrained in participants’ daily lives. <br/>When people are more knowledgeable, this decreases negative emotions like worry and increases their feeling of being in control. When people feel more in control they are also more likely to prefer delayed rewards like pension over instant gratification. Positive experiences with the Toekomstplanner elevate PFZW’s customer satisfaction to a new level and the tool provides PFZW with an easy way to connect with this younger target group that is relatively hard to reach for the pension fund. <br/>The concept of the Toekomstplanner is not ready for implementation yet. The discussion section of the report reflects on the concept so far and presents recommendations for further research and exploration. <br","Pension; Pension fund; Delayed gratification; Motivation; Predictive knowledge; Design for habits; Hooked model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

Right now it can be hard to make sure that what is documented about an API is correct everywhere and to know if a change will have impact on the users of a web API. When details are missing in an API specification users of that API need to make assumptions about how the API works. The creators of the web API also wants to know what users expect from the API. There are two sides to this problem, enforcing that the implementation is actually the same as what is specified, and making it possible to define API specifications as precise as possible. The type system of a programming language is a useful tool for enforcing the struc- ture of an implementation. In this thesis we use a dependent type system to enforce an API specification in the implementation. By using the dependent type system we can de- fine additional, more specific, constraints on the API. These constraints are more specific than constraints expressible in possible research. With this approach we can be sure that the specification and implementation are actually describing the same API. And with the added flexibility we can create a more complete description of web APIs.","Dependent Types; Web API; API Specifications","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science","",""

Several methods can assess the extent of these potentials. Research shows that embedded sensing methods can be used in dynamic measurements of composites. This thesis studies a full-scale application of a network of embedded piezoelectric sensors in an FRC marine propeller blade. The study prefers using piezoelectric sensors because of their ability to operate in a relatively wide frequency range. The focus of the thesis starts with designing the full-scale network of embedded piezoelectric sensors. Since no literature includes this application on FRC blades, this study holds a pioneering role in embedding piezoelectric sensors in an FRC marine propeller blade. Detailed analysis of material dimensions - including sensors, wiring, and fiber plies - leads to a successful sensor network design. Considerations regarding the location of 24 sensors included both the in-plane and the in-depth position within the FRC laminate. Fabrication of an FRC blade has been done using a resin transfer moulding (RTM) process. For the first time, an FRC marine propeller blade is embedded with piezoelectric sensors. Demoulding of the blade caused damage to some of the sensor wires. An amount of 54% of the embedded sensors survived the process with full connectivity. The performance of the intact sensors after fabrication is assessed. These sensors are exposed to free vibration tests of the FRC blade. An excitation is imposed on the blade with an impact hammer. A data acquisition (DAQ) system is used to capture the responses of the embedded piezo-sensors. The frequency response functions (FRFs) of multiple locations on the blade are computed. These FRFs provide more insight into the dynamic behavior of the blade. A frequency range of 1-1000Hz is used in the modal analysis. The first five natural frequencies are found between 240Hz and 840Hz. Natural frequencies measured by the embedded piezo-sensors and surface-mounted strain gauges differ up until 25% from natural frequencies computed by a finite element model (FEM) of the blade. The mode shape of the blade at the natural frequencies is computed for by the FEM and embedded piezo-sensors. Some difference in mode shapes is demonstrated between measurements computed by FEM and those measured by the embedded piezo-sensors and surface-mounted strain gauges. The piezo-sensors and strain gauges are in agreement regarding the measured natural frequencies. Therefore, it is expected that discrepancies exist between the physical blade and FEM. Several points for improvement of the results have been found. The study provides the first-time feasibility of dynamic measurements from embedded piezo-sensors in an FRC marine propeller blade. Additionally, a framework for reconstructing the full-field vibration response is provided, which can provide more accurate results when the agreement between piezo-sensor and FEM measurements has improved.","Piezoelectricity; Strain fields; Modal analysis; Embedded sensor; Propeller blade","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-04-05","","","","Marine Technology","",""

Different methods are available to assist people with quitting smoking, with various degrees of effectiveness. Researchers developing smoking cessation approaches would like to have controlled environments to test how effective they are before offering them as viable options. Virtual reality has been demonstrated to be an efficacious tool for facilitating the presentation of cues aimed at eliciting smoking cravings in the lab. Addiction, however, is a complex matter involving different parts of the brain, and how or when conditioned responses causing smoking cravings are activated depend on the individual in question. There are strong indications that personalization of smoking cues, or in other words using elements relevant in the addiction model of an individual, may elicit higher or at least consistent smoking cravings. The general aim is that developing smoking cessation approaches targeting those most relevant elements may have higher ecological validity and therefore be more effective in assisting people both with quitting smoking and maintaining that behavior change. To assist researchers with testing their smoking cessation approaches using a virtual coach, we have created a system enabling the presentation of virtual environments and facilitating communication between researchers and participants while the latter are viewing them. We have evaluated the effectiveness of our system in eliciting a familiar experience, which we posit is a major component tied to smoking cravings. Our results showed that personalized virtual environments elicited a more familiar experience than non-personalized ones.

New regulations imposed by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) aim to reduce the emission of green house gasses. Consequently, ship owners turn to technological solutions in order to achieve this. The Ventifoil from Econowind is a promising device in the field of Wind Assisted Ship Propulsion (WASP). By applying boundary layer suction, this airfoil shaped profile can generate large aerodynamic forces, which are<br/>used as additional propulsion to reduce fuel consumption. Often multiple devices are installed on the deck of a vessel.<br/><br/>Literature shows that the aerodynamic interaction between multiple airfoils can significantly influence the local flow conditions in which each individual device operates. Nonetheless, literature agrees that it is possible to mitigate detrimental effects by adapting to the local conditions. The operational guideline of the Ventifoils are based on the far-field wind conditions. Consequently, aerodynamic interaction between Ventifoils is not considered. This leads to the main research question: ""To what extend does aerodynamic interaction between two Ventifoils mutually affect aerodynamic performance?"". This thesis aims to analyse aerodynamic interaction using a numerical Lifting Line Model (LLM). This method has the potential of evaluating a broad range of operational and environmental conditions in limited computational time.<br/><br/>Aerodynamic interaction between two Ventifoils will be evaluated over a range of apparent wind angles between 0◦ and 180◦, for two different absolute distances. The results fromthe LLM will be validated by means of three dimensional, steady Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) simulations. Five different interaction components will be analysed, being; changes in flow angle, changes in flow velocity, viscous interaction, pressure field interaction,<br/>and boundary layer suction interaction.<br/><br/>The results reveal that aerodynamic interaction can reduce the lift and drag coefficients by multiple tens of percentages. It is found that the reduction ratio of the thrust force coefficient, CX, varies between −16% and −1% relative to a single isolated Ventifoil. The magnitude is mainly depending on the relative position of the devices. It is concluded that the interaction is most significant if the devices are positioned closely near each other and parallel to the flow<br/>direction. Both methods show good qualitative agreement. It is concluded that discrepancies in the magnitude of reduction ratios can be attributed to modelling differences in terms of viscosity, pressure fields and boundary layer suction. Better quantitative agreement is found for larger absolute distances. The LLM is furthermore used to maximize CX by optimizing the angle of attack of each Ventifoil independently. The resulting increase in CX showed to be between +5% and +11% added to the non-optimized reduction ratio.","Ventifoil; Aerodynamic interaction; interaction; aerodynamics; potential flow model; RANS; lifting line; lifting line theory","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-04-05","","","","Marine Technology | Ship Hydromechanics","",""

Coherent Fourier scatterometry (CFS) is a scanning bright field technique that is capable to detect nanoparticles on Si surfaces. The optical readout of CFS consists of a two pixel split detector that gives a voltage signal based on the intensity difference between the two halves. While an area of the wafer is raster scanned, the flat surface with no particles gives a zero voltage and on the particle an asymmetrical (non-zero) signal will be detected. <br/><br/>In this thesis, we demonstrate the use of synthetic optical holography (SOH) as a new method to improve the sensitivity of CFS. By adding a reference mirror with a piezo stage to the setup, we can interfere the scattered field with a plane reference wave. And by moving the mirror in steps, we can change the phase of the reference wave for every line of the raster scan, such that the 2D scan represents a digital off-axis hologram. Applying the standard digital holography reconstruction process, we retrieve a signal that equals the complex far field difference scaled by the reference field amplitude.<br/><br/>Overall, we see consistent signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) improvement over the conventional CFS. For the detection of a polystyrene latex (PSL) particle with a diameter of 60 nm (λ/10) on a silicon wafer, this new implementation leads to a SNR of 10 dB, which is about 4 dB over the filtered conventional CFS signal. For measurements of a dust particle using a very low amount of incident power (0.0014 mW on wafer), a SNR gain of more than 6 dB is achieved compared to filtered conventional CFS, due to the attenuation of low frequency electronic noises. Therefore, the implementation of SOH improves the sensitivity for detecting small nanoparticles and allows low power applications, such as biological imaging.","scatterometry; holography; wafer inspection; nanoparticle detection","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Sciences","",""

However, current methods that enhance motor variability show divergent results and need to be better understood. <br/>In a lab-based experiment with twenty healthy participants,<br/>we studied the effect of a new method that haptically increases participants’ motor variability in learning a dynamic task, i.e., controlling a pendulum. This new method consisted of applying pseudo-random perturbation forces to the internal degree of freedom of the dynamic system (indirect haptic noise), instead of applying forces directly on the trainee’s hands as previously studied. The main task consisted of swinging a virtual pendulum to hit incoming targets with the pendulum ball. To assess generalization of learning we used two transfer tasks, which consisted of altered target positions or altered task dynamics (i.e., a pendulum with shorter rod length).

Participants that trained with indirect haptic noise seemed to benefit in transfer of learning to altered task dynamics but not in the task with altered target positions.

The dam stretched from Bergen in Norway to the north of Scotland and from Ploudalmézeau France to the Lizard Heritage Coast England. The main objective of this thesis is to investigate the technical feasibility of the NEED. To fulfill this objective, the following aspect were studied in more detail: the location and layout of this dam, the favorable cross-section of the dam, and the most likely closure scenarios.<br/>The first step was to find out what the optimized location was. The proposed location from Groeskamp was compared to an optimized location based on the boundary conditions. The two alignments are distinguished by their length, depth, and location. <br/>An engineering perspective was used to evaluate the alignments. The outcome of the multicriteria analysis (MCA) was that the initial alignment by Groeskamp was most favorable. However, a different perspective can result in a different conclusion, and it is therefore advised to look in further detail to come up with a well-founded decision. <br/>For the favorable cross-section, two types of closure dams were investigated to determine the best dam design, the caisson dam, and the earthen dam. Both designs were dimensioned based on safety criteria. These safety criteria were derived from the Dutch guidelines for primary flood defenses, with the top event, inundation of west Europe, given a probability of failure of 1:10 000 per year. A Monte Carlo analysis was constructed to determine the dimensions of both dams. Two failure mechanisms are assessed fully probabilistically as these are considered to be the most relevant. The ULS (ultimate limit state) and SLS (serviceability limit state) conditions are considered per failure mechanisms. The main difference between the resulting designs is the sizes; the earthen dam needs a mild slope to be stable (1:5), requiring a tremendous amount of material. The earthen dam requires seven times more material than the caisson dam. This results in the caisson dam being a more technically feasible design for the NEED than the earthen dam. The caisson is made of concrete filled with sand. Rock protection and concrete foot protection blocks to protect the sill from erosion.<br/>The closure procedure depends on the flow velocities inside the closure gap. The occurring flow velocities during the closure determine the feasibility. These velocities were calculated using the shallow water equation. <br/>A critical boundary condition for the caissons closure is that the maximum flow velocity in the gap is less than 2.5 m/s. For higher flow velocities, placement of the caissons is impossible. Based on the model, a closure procedure was proposed in which this essential condition is met.<br/>The most likely closure scenario is that first, the Southern dam is closed to ensure that the flow velocities do not exceed the critical value. The next step is to fulfill the Northern dam closure. The gap is closed until the maximum velocity is approximately 2m/s. The last part is then closed using sluice caissons. These caissons are placed openly in the gap and closed between 1 tidal cycle, completing the dam. The location of the final gap is at the Norwegian trench.<br/>The results from this research are that the NEED is expected to be technically feasible. However, the enormous size of the NEED poses new challenges and effects. Further research is required to comprehensively analyze all impacts of the NEED in order to make it feasible.<br","NEED; Dam; Sea level rise; Probabilistic design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","",""

Both young and old are being challenged in preparing themselves for a world they do not know yet. Children are growing up in a faster changing world than their parents, increasing the tension between parents and children in how they perceive the world around them. Therefore, this project focuses on the generation differences between parents and children in perceiving the digitising world. This report describes the research on digital citizenship in the current and future context and describes the concept design process derived from it. The project takes a holistic approach, using the ViP method, and is done in collaboration with the design lab of the public library in Amsterdam. The two main questions in this project are: How do parents and children relate to the digitising world? And how can they be invited in creating a common understanding of what it means to be a (digital) citizen? The research phase of the project consisted mainly of interviews with parents and children and interviews with experts, getting to know the different points of view. Literature and desk research complemented the research. The concept presented in this project is Bubbel Babbel. Bubbel Babbel is a conversation box that allows parents and children to discover their digitising world together. The box invites parents and children to step out of their bubble and lets them experience the online world through the eyes of the offline world, and vice versa. The concept fits well with the future role of libraries, which become more focused on digital transformations. Therefore, Bubbel Babbel could serve as the first tool that builds a bridge between the physical world and the digital world, letting people wonder “how do we actually see the world?”.","ViP approach; Social Design; Digital Citizenship; Parent-child relationship","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","In recent years, efforts are focused on developing an acoustic based autonomous detect and avoidance system for UAVs to minimize interference with other air traffic. The purpose of this research is to study the potential of artificial neural networks for fast, grid-free acoustic source localization. A multi-layer perceptron has been trained to localize simulated white noise acoustic point sources using a converted version of the cross spectral matrix. The ANN based method shows similar localization behaviour to different frequencies as conventional beamforming. A new ANN architecture is proposed that uses the converted cross spectral matrices of multiple different frequencies as input to improve the localization accuracy. The multi input model has shown to have a mean absolute error of approximately 0.27[m]. The proposed model has also been applied on real world recording data of an aircraft flyover. The ANN based method has shown to be able to obtain a prediction within approximately 0.05[s], compared to approximately 1000-2000[s] for conventional beamforming. However, the magnitude and inconsistency of the localization error for the recording is higher compared to the simulated white noise source.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

(mentor); Dankelman, J. (graduation committee); Breedveld, P. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","The spine is an intricate and crucial part of the human body. Unfortunately, spinal conditions such as scoliosis and trauma can cause instability and deformity to the spine. Patients can experience discomfort and pain. Spinal fusion surgery is used to repair and correct severe cases. During this procedure the vertebrae are fused to prevent them from moving relative to each other, thus increasing stability. Pedicle screws and rods are used to lock the vertebrae together and bone grafts are inserted to grow the vertebrae together. The insertion of the pedicle screws is a complicated procedure where breaches of the cortical wall can occur leading to tissue damage and possible complications for the patient. To prevent breaches, guidance methods have been introduced. However, these methods have considerable disadvantages in terms of patient safety and costs. Introducing an alternative guidance method, this master thesis investigates the development of a drill that uses diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS). DRS is a spectroscopy method that uses diffuse reflection to determine the structural and chemical properties of a biological sample. By differentiating cortical and cancellous bone based on their fat content, directional feedback is provided to guide the user during the drilling of the pedicle. In this work, a drilling prototype was developed that uses DRS to provide directional feedback. The prototype uses integrated optical fibres to sense in two different directions: along the drilling direction and at a 90°angle to the drilling direction. This allows the device to sense the surrounding volume and provide feedback on the type of bone the drill encounters. A 3D Monte Carlo RTE solver, MCMatlab, was used to simulate photon transport inside biological tissue. Core-to-core distances larger than 1 mm were investigated to find if the corresponding look-ahead would increase distances as well as different fibre configurations for a prototype. Multiple design concepts were proposed and assessed. A prototype was made and tested on a 2-layered bone phantom. The results indicated a frontal look-ahead distance of 3.6 mm for a 4 mm core-to-core distance as well as a 1.5 mm sideways look-ahead distance for a 1.5 mm core-to-core distance. The prototype provides a proof of concept that DRS can be integrated into a drill in such a way it can provide directional feedback. Although results are promising, improvements can still be made in the collection of data to provide consistent results for directional feedback.","Guidance; Spinal surgery; vertebrae; Scoliosis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2025-04-01","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

(mentor); Willemen, A.M. (graduation committee); Cox, Jeroen (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","This project proposes a no-waste, reusable packaging approach for networking equipment used in KPN’s business-to-business market. The goal of this project was to create a first proof of concept of reusable packaging in KPN’s logistical and manual processes, and therefore create a stepping stone towards further scaling-up reusable packaging across their operation. <br/><br/>KPN, the leading telecom company in the Netherlands, wants to accelerate the journey to become near 100% circular by 2025, in which the reduction of packaging waste plays an important role. To reduce this to virtually zero, a reusable packaging approach is suggested. Additionally, research showed that the return logistics of a number of B2B services are hindered due to a lack of packaging, which causes product damage and a delayed turnaround time. <br/><br/>With insight from the research a packaging prototype was designed and developed to be tested in a first pilot. A ‘ reusable messenger bag’ concept was selected, as it is durable, relatively cheap, size efficient and an already known, and valued packaging concept among mechanics and the refurbishment partner. To support the distribution of the packaging in an effective way, a logistic concept is proposed. This mechanic-centred system architecture ensures the availability of packaging at all times, potentially solving the return issues that were found in the research. <br/><br/>In the pilot, the accessibility of logistics, workflow of employees and the functionality of the product are tested in an actual order of a popular B2B service of KPN. The pilot resulted in a successful proof of concept and a first stepping stone towards the implementation of a zero-waste, reusable packaging approach for KPN. With a small-scale, technical implementation of this concept, it was shown that reusable packaging has the potential to not only reduce packaging waste, but also increase the workflow of involved stakeholders, improve the return logistics of electronics and therefore also reduce costs. This resulted in a positive and profitable business case for further development of this concept. <br/><br/>The biggest limitation was the small and narrow scope of testing (n=1). This made it difficult to actually validate if the return logistics were improved by a reusable packaging, as logistics manifest itself at scale. As a further roll-out of the concept shows to be interesting for KPN, the first next step would be to scale up the testing over the entire VPN service (±1000 orders yearly) to validate the logistic concept and functionality of the product.<br/><br","packaging design; circular economy; circularity; Zero waste design; packaging","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

The accompanying labelling Scheme informs customers about the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) of their products with a focus on the Repair Costs. The Total Cost of Ownership Tool (TCOT) offers customers a better comparative potential with regard to the longevity of products. <br/><br/>The tool distinguishes itself from currently existing initiatives and tools for it provides a quantitative scoring of the cost of ownership and repair. This quantitative scoring is detrimental to the fair comparison of products. Previously existing tools mainly provided a qualitative grading. For this concept to work product manufacturers will be obliged by legislative organs to fill in the TCOT to get a corresponding label that needs to be displayed at the place of purchase. The tool in return provides the manufacturers with valuable data on how to improve their products. The newly obtained quantitative data can be used by legislators to assess the progress of longevity of products to assess the effectiveness of the newly adopted TCOT legislations. <br/><br/>To explore this solution space the cost of ownership and repair needed to be expressed in a mathematical formula. Thereafter the factors that influence the variables in this formula needed to be quantitatively expressed. One major qualitative element however remained. The grading of the chance of a successful repair was performed by including conditions and criteria of the French Repairability Index (FRI). <br/>The development of the tool relied on iterative cycles of performing case studies with data on smartphones. The early iteration cycles revealed that small variations in the input variables resulted in significant differences in the outputs. Not only was the available literature on some of these variables limited. Often sources provided contradicting figures making conclusive results difficult to obtain. To test the technical aspects of the tool and assess the individual impacts of the input variables, different scenarios were explored. This provided insights into how the tool deals with the varying input data. The outcome of these tests fell within the bounds of expectation and revealed what further steps need to be undertaken to further develop the TCOT.<br/><br/>The quantitative display of these often unknown and intangible ownership costs provides the customer with the information that she needs to better be able to choose a longer-lasting product. This newly acquired transparency towards the customer can help legislators nudge manufacturers into producing longer-lasting products. The further development of the tool and its accompanying label scheme will help with the transition towards the envisioned circular European Union by 2050<br","Cost of Owndership; Scorecard; Repaircosts","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""
