(TU Delft Applied Sciences; TU Delft RST/Radiation, Science and Technology)","Perko, Z. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","Automated Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT) planning is based on a set of constraints and objectives, called a wish list. This thesis concerns automated IMRT planning with a non-smooth, non-convex, discontinuous, multivariable objective function. Specifically, constrained optimization using the Long Run High Gray-level Emphasis (LRHGE) texture analysis feature as objective was tested for IMRT planning of prostate cancer treatment. Incorporation of the LRHGE in the in-house developed, non-linear, gradient based solver Erasmus-iCycle by using finite difference derivatives showed that gradient based optimization does not lead to convergence, most likely due to the non-smooth, non-convex, discontinuous behavior of the LRHGE. Two global optimization solvers that do not require gradients were tested as well and both did converge. However, the resulting plans were not clinically optimal. An attempt was made to speed-up optimization using reduced order modeling. The relative inaccuracy of multivariate regression approximations and radial basis function approximations of the LRHGE was used as a benchmark for performance. Using multivariate regression approximations of the LRHGE led to 2.5 orders of magnitude speed-up, while maintaining median relative error below 2% for two out of four data sets. Radial basis function approximations performed better than multivariate regression in terms ofmedian relative error for three out of four data sets.<br/>However, in terms of speed multivariate regression approximations were superior to radial basis function approximations, since multivariate regression approximations were calculated around 15 times faster than radial basis function approximations. Despite the improvement in computation time, it is still impractically long for clinical practice, especially for realistic problem sizes. Also all attained solutions from optimization did not show improvement compared to current practice. All in all, using the LRHGE in treatment planning did not show any benefits.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This aligns with the fundamentals of Urban Symbiosis and district heating where the conscious choice is made for the use of local heat sources and their by-products to serve as heat input for the district heating system when the heat source is in geographic proximity.

A metamaterial consists of a unit cell which is periodically repeated in space. In this study, a new metamaterial unit cell is proposed, derived from a class of space structures known as deployable masts. What makes these masts particularly interesting is their ability to contract to a fraction of their original length. In order to use such a structure as a unit cell, requires a deep understanding of the design parameters impact on material response. To guide this project, a novel data driven approach to design will be implemented. Here, computational simulations are used to create a database of mechanical responses, which in turn is used to model the relationship between input and output responses. This approach essentially flips the conventional approach of mechanical design on its head by using computational simulations to define the design space before manufacturing and testing. This replaces designer intuition with predictive charts, becoming increasingly useful for non-intuitive problems. This study validates the data driven approach through mechanical testing of a metamaterial unit cell. This testing is done at the macroscopic scale, utilizing a hobbyist 3D-printer (Ultimaker 2) to manufacture the structure. This study demonstrates that the material model is capable of accurately predicting the unit cell response. The limitation and possibilities for fused deposition modelling printed parts to be used as functional components is also investigated. Based on the insights gained from the data driven design process and experimental validation, design parameters are proposed for which a metamaterial unit cell exhibits both extreme compressibility and a high compressive strength.","Metamaterials; Machine Learning; Fused Deposition Modeling; Data driven design; mechanical metamaterials; compressible; Additive Manufacturing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Vehicle Engineering","",""

These lines are generated when material due to debris accumulation on the foreshore has been transported onto the dike surface by wave run-up. Hydraulic engineers who used flotsam line measurements, interpreted a flotsam line as a line which is marking the highest wave run-up. In the past, flotsam lines were used to assess the safety of coastal dikes along the Wadden Sea. Currently, models (SWAN and WAQUA) fulfil this function and this may result in losing the value of flotsam lines. This study aims to rediscover the value of flotsam lines.<br/>The objective of this study was to shed light on the value of flotsam lines. Using the spatial information obtained from flotsam levels it is investigated whether flotsam levels can be used to assess the quality of models (SWAN and WAQUA). This was done by calculating flotsam lines using a sequence of models and wave run-up formulas and then compare to measured flotsam lines. This study showed that the upper side of the flotsam line marked the maximum wave run-up in case of a small layer of flotsam. Besides, a relative thick layer of flotsam was able to absorb the force of the wave run-up and remained in position. This means that the amount of flotsam can disturb the wave run-up and eventually flotsam levels. It also was determined that the analysis of (calculated) flotsam lines gives an indication of the performance of the applied set of models (SWAN and WAQUA) and wave run-up formulas, provided that a systematic comparison between modelled and measured data is performed. A large database of detailed flotsam lines with corresponding storm conditions (water level, wave conditions, wind, etc) can provide valuable information to low costs.

Recently, a lot of research has been successfully put into this field along with the advancements that make it more feasible, though a major obstacle to achieving the new generation of spacecraft is the technical challenge of fitting a suitable propulsion system. Useful chemical propellants are usually corrosive, flammable, and/or toxic, so alternatives need to be found. The aerospace industry is shifting towards green and nontoxic propulsion systems, so water could be used as an effective propellant, considering its relatively high mass density and low molecular mass. New microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) technologies show promising opportunities for the integration of miniaturized propulsion systems, due to their versatility and robustness. In this thesis, a comparative study of nozzle flow, heat transfer, and thermodynamics in two different thrusters is conducted. One thruster is based on MEMS, with a typically quasi-2D geometry, while the second thruster is based on more conventional technologies and manufacturing techniques, with an axially symmetrical 3D shape. After briefly introducing micropropulsion and discussing the propellant selection and nozzle fabrication along with the background theory related to micropropulsion as well as the analytical and OpenFOAM numerical (DSMC, continuum, and a hybrid approach containing both to accommodate to the variation in Knudsen number throughout the computational domain) modeling methods, the used methodology is based on using OpenFOAM's DSMC solver (dsmcFoam+) following the mesh creation using blockMesh and snappyHexMesh and developed analytical model (using MATLAB and CoolProp) along with an additional VLM ANSYS Fluent CFD model prepared in advance at TU Delft, where their (steady state as well as transient for DSMC) results (including the same conventional and MEMS nozzles) are processed and discussed. The nozzles are simulated for inlet pressures of 5 and 7 bar at inlet temperatures of 550 and 773 K for a total of four cases for each nozzle. To note, many of dsmcFoam+'s functionalities (mass flow rate measurements, inlet pressure boundary condition, axisymmetric capabilities, statistical error measurements, and dynamic load balancing) are implemented and described along with the full methodology, as Blender (with add-ons) and ParaView with a Python script to extract averaged data (along the nozzle and plume region) along with sampleDict are also used in pre and post-processing respectively and the simulations are carried out on a computer cluster. Furthermore, a quite interesting theoretical project on the side has been independently worked on in parallel. It started as a noticed idea that was decided to be explored using equations, which led to extended continuum/kinetic dimensionless numbers for diffusivity and rarefaction intensity relative to the studied object’s timescale. Ultimately, there are tradeoffs to choosing either thruster, where it is impractical to fault one nozzle for not performing better than the other, as it comes back to the desired features and nature of the mission each is undertaking, where compromises have to be made.","MEMS Thrusters; de Laval Nozzles; Spacecraft Micropropulsion; Analytical (MATLAB and CoolProp)/Numerical (OpenFOAM dsmcFoam+); Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC)/Continuum/Hybrid; Blender; ParaView Python Shell","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

However, in scientific literature, little attention is paid to this type of traffic signal controller evaluations. Indeed, it is found that a functional, and integral evaluation and diagnosis method for traffic signal controllers, based on a multi-variable assessment, is currently lacking. This thesis tries to fill this gap, by developing, and presenting an integral method, which detects inefficiencies in terms of traffic performance functioning, scores the vehicle-actuated traffic signal controller, diagnoses the cause of the detected inefficiency, and propose countermeasures to improve the traffic performance functioning of the vehicle-actuated traffic signal controller, based on a multi-variable assessment. This resulted in a five-step procedure, in which consecutively (1) the multi-variable performance indicators are selected, (2) the computational models are calibrated, (3) inefficiencies are detected, (4) the problems are diagnosed that caused the inefficient performance, and (5) optimises the traffic signal controller by implementing the countermeasures that aim at mitigating the diagnosed problems. The procedure includes a feedback loop to check whether the proposed countermeasures were effective. The testing of the method in a case study, using simulation data, showed that the method is indeed able to successfully detect inefficiencies, and diagnose the corresponding problems. Although the presented method is not perfect yet, its potential is clear. Therefore, it is recommended to develop the method further in the future, and include the use of data from practice as a way to make the method more widely applicable.","Traffic Signal Control; Decision support tool; Evaluation method; Diagnoses; Vehicle-Actuated Traffic Signal Control","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There is a defined medical symptom which is called “alarm fatigue” that refers to numb auditory senses, stress, low job satisfaction as a result of being exposed to excessive noise for the extended period, and it often leads to low job performances in the end. One report reveals that 65% of significant ICU incidents occur by not responding to alarms appropriately (Cho, Kim, Lee &amp; Cho, 2016). Since the alarm is not a single source of noises in the ICU, this report first defines which sound group will be seen as a culprit of “noise fatigue” as an expanded concept of alarm fatigue in this project. The way this graduation deals with noise in the ICU is different from the conventional approach of providing a design intervention as a solution. In this project, the focus is rather how sound stimuli and stress level of nurses can be precisely captured from the perspective of nurses and be correlated altogether so that the new system can function as an investigation tool for further design intervention to improve the sound environment in the ICU. In this regard, the sound classification method using machine learning, heart rate tracking as a means of an objective stress level assessment, and emotion report as a subjective stress evaluation tool was studied. Furthermore, beacons, an indoor positioning detection device, was investigated and combined with the project concept, so that Cacophony Mapper can function as a mobile data collection platform with dynamic data summary and analysis. After the exploration of possible technology options for this project, the way of combining opted technologies was contemplated. As a result, two devices for heart rate tracking and sound collection, one mobile application for emotion report and data analysis, and a web platform which function as a hub for the data summary were developed as Cacophony Mapper prototype. In the evaluation phase, the reliability of the sound filter was tested by directly putting the WAV sound data and a dataset collected through a user test, separately. Two datasets were compared to find the significant impact of the environmental factors so that the external impact can be minimized by further optimization. Also, the usability of the overall system and the application was evaluated. It has been done to see the possibility of implementing the Cacophony Mapper system in a medical environment and find which aspect of usability should be improved for further design development.","Noise fatigue; Sound classification; Sound collection; Stress analysis; Medisign; Data visualization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

However, on this topic, there are a few issues the current researches have not tackled yet, and these will be discussed in this presentation. First of them is the lack of mathematical description of the micro-Doppler patterns. and most research works are based on real measured data so far. In this thesis, an EM backscattering model in HH plane of drone propeller is developed, simplifying the propeller’s geometry structure as a few cylinder thin wires. Radar signal model and micro-Doppler model are subsequently developed for the thin-wire propeller model when it is rotating. Second, most current researches focus on the micro-Doppler patterns achieved in short CPI cases that are valid for radar systems with PRI much shorter than the rotation period of the drone’s propellers. In this thesis, the drone micro-Doppler patterns in long CPI circumstances are investigated. Features are proposed to characterise the amplitude and frequency distribution of the simulated micro-Doppler spectrum. Applying these features to SVM gives good classification accuracy for the simulated micro-Doppler data. Third, most researches at present are carried out in short range for static or stable hovering drones, while from a practical point of view, it is also of great interest to investigate the drone micro-Doppler patterns in long range and dynamic scenarios. In this thesis, the micro-Doppler patterns of different drones at a distance of 9 kilometres are achieved by S-band radar in long CPI circumstance. Applying the previously proposed features to the real measured micro-Doppler spectra to SVM gives good classification accuracy for drones in hovering and manoeuvring flight modes.","radar; micro-Doppler; drone; simulation; long CPI","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Signals and Systems","",""

Overall, an exergy-gravimetric approach towards mass minimization was developed in this thesis work. Multiple fuel cell - battery hybrid powerplants were sized for the Pipistrel Alpha Electro.

In some regions, however, the levelized cost of energy is still rather high, posing some challenges for this technology to take a leading roll in the energy mix. In order to overcome this, two approaches are being taken by the industry. On the one hand, improvements on the PV technology itself are nabling new PV systems to achieve higher yields of energy. One of this novel echnologies is bifacial PV modules. On the other hand, some research is being done in the deployment of PV systems in alternative configurations such as floating on water. This allows countries with land limitations, such as the Netherlands, to consider PV energy as a feasible and cost effective way to supply its energy demand.<br/>A pilot system called InnoZoWa is being developed by the water authority Rivierenland in the Netherlands. This system will evaluate the feasibility of floating bifacial PV systems in the country. At the current phase of the project a monitoring system is developed. This system serves as means of data acquisition for research purposes from a PV system that can potentially be deployed in larger areas of inland shallow water. Delft University of Technology is one of the partners involved in the development of InnoZoWa. The PVMD group from the university is in charge of the electrical specifications and data analysis. The same group has developed in recent years a toolbox for the design and simulation of PV systems. This tool must go through different validation stages. This project is an opportunity to test out the toolbox and establish its accuracy and reliability. The toolbox presents also an opportunity to simulate the outcome from the InnoZoWa study system . Therefore, the toolbox is used to reproduce the different scenarios and configurations proposed in the pilot. As a result of this simulation, it is concluded that bifacial floating systems with reflectors are the technology with the highest potential in the setup. Other configurations including tracking functionalities show an even larger potential but their self energy consumption is a concern.","Bifacial PV; Floating PV; Solar energy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-05-29","","","","Electrical Engineering","",""

Wind energy is currently one of the most attractive solutions for the transition to a more sustainable energy future. Since wind energy is not the only competitor in this journey towards a greener earth, reduction of the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCoE) is an important indicator to stay competitive. The wind industry pursues this goal primarily by increasing the size of wind turbines. As a result, the increased rotor size also comes with a significant increase in static and fatigue loading on the wind turbine’s rotating and fixed structure. To address this problem, the industry continues to investigate the application of alternative and economically more viable drivetrain technologies. An interesting development highlights that the implementation of robust compact hydraulic wind turbine drivetrains presents such an alternative. Hydraulic transmission systems are typically employed in high-load systems and form an excellent opportunity for application in multi-megawatt turbines. The Delft Offshore Turbine (DOT) is a hydraulic wind turbine concept which replaces conventional drivetrain components with more robust hydraulic components. It substitutes the conventional power-train inside the nacelle with a single seawater pump. Pressurized seawater is directed through the high-pressure discharge line to a combined Pelton turbine, connected to an electrical generator on a central multi-megawatt electricity generation platform. Moreover, the low-pressure feed line, directing seawater to the seawater pump, also has to maintain a certain pressure to prevent cavitation in the pump cylinders. This requires energy, which forms an issue since the availability of electrical energy is not self-evident on offshore locations. The goal of the DOT concept is to be completely self-sustainable and independent of external power sources. One solution for this problem is the extraction of hydraulic energy from the pressurized seawater inside the high-pressure discharge line before it is harvested by the Pelton turbine. This mechanism is referred to as the turbine’s<br/>Regenerative Power System (RPS), and adds up to the challenge of hydraulic turbine control. This thesis presents the modeling, control design and control evaluation for this intermediate version of the DOT concept. Besides rotor speed control, also the feed line pressure and the regenerative power system have to be regulated. Decentralized gain scheduled SISO controllers are employed and evaluated in below-rated conditions.

This strategy has been developed through an extensive analysis of the internal environment, customer trends, industry developments, and emerging technologies in combination with Design Thinking and Roadmapping activities. It provides a set of solutions where the connected vehicle is believed to create the biggest impact for LeasePlan’s business, it’s market position and in meeting its ambition to shift towards a zero emission fleet by 2030. The automotive industry is at the beginning of a transition in response to the Paris Agreement and with ever greater demands in society for cleaner mobility. At the same time, the Internet of Things is one of the leading trends that is expected to rapidly transform the automotive industry, by introducing the connected vehicle. With LeasePlan’s total fleet of 1.8 million vehicles and soon a comparable amount of private charge points, LeasePlan has a significant influence on the development of sustainable transport systems. LeasePlan sees the growing request from its clients for expertise and guidance within fleet electrification. Clients try to find solutions to meet the rapidly increasing demand for charge infrastructure and to reach cost and footprint optimisation, while drivers deal with the inconveniences around electric driving. This study has identified how LeasePlan can use the connected vehicle to provide clients support in the zero emission transition and to deliver a desirable electric vehicle driver experience. The resulting strategy consists of the following four main elements, recommending LeasePlan to: 1) Provide Parking Support and Priority Load Balancing in the near term to increase efficient chargepoint occupation, to enhance efficient usage of charge capacity and to accommodate tailored advice on infrastructure expansion based on the real fleet behaviour. With Parking Support, drivers will be supported in their charge and park plan to enable fair chargepoint sharing. With Priority Load Balancing, smart capacity division increases charge flexibility for the fleet. This all results in minimum infrastructure investment for clients. 2) Introduce ‘Smart Charging’ in the second term for further reduction of the carbon footprint and energy costs for both clients and drivers by: automatically altered charging sessions and guidance for the driver to charge during the moments when the most green electricity is available and when the energy prices are low. 3) Develop a car-sharing system for a Connected &amp; Electric Shared Pool, in the third term to realise optimal fleet efficiency, to create cost optimisation and to contribute to livable and cleaner urban areas. 4) Utilise the lease fleet to store renewable energy in the longer term. This realises energy self-sufficient offices and this brings profit for the customer when he plays with the fluctuations in energy prices during energy storage, while he contributes to the broader zero emission transition of its neighbourhood, region or even country. The strategy is presented in the format of a roadmap and the short term solutions are further conceptualized. The next steps for LeasePlan within each element are: further identify the market potential and monetary value, establish a profitable revenue model, build the partnerships and start the test and pilot phase to improve the design interaction. With this innovation strategy, LeasePlan becomes the reliable zero emission fleet accelerator, who takes the responsibility to contribute to a healthier environment and cleaner cities, while occupying a unique market position with its own expertise in fleet electrification, with the focus on its clients’ fleets and with the connected vehicle as its asset.","Internet of Things; Connected Vehicle; Electric Vehicle; Vehicle-to-grid; Roadmap; Innovation Strategy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

The RI contains only oblique shocks while the MI has a quasi-normal shock segment, known as the Mach stem. MI configurations generate larger total pressure losses, which is specially relevant for the design of supersonic inlets and rocket nozzles. The study was conducted in the TST-27 transonic-supersonic wind tunnel at Delft University of Technology, which allows a variation of the Mach number during a run through a flexible nozzle system. The wind tunnel model was built using two full span wedges that deflected the freestream flow to generate a shock-shock interaction. The minimum vertical distance between the wedges was kept constant throughout the runs. The Mach number was determined through continuous pressure readings in both the settling chamber and the test section. Schlieren and Focusing Schlieren systems were used to visualize the shock wave pattern. For all cases, the wind tunnel runs were initialized in the RI domain after which the Mach number was slowly decreased to the MI domain, thereby traversing the whole dual solution domain. The process was then inverted to reach again the RI domain in order to investigate a possible transition hysteresis. The Focusing Schlieren setup was capable of eliminating three-dimensional effects that contaminated the images obtained with the Schlieren visualization system. It also revealed that the main three-dimensional effect in the setup was a boundary layer detachment at the sidewalls. Schlieren visualization was used as the main quantitative flow diagnostics tool, allowing a clear view of the shock pattern and revealing the absence of any hysteresis effect. A custom built image processing software was used to obtain accurate measurements of the Mach stem height (MSH) evolution and detect transition. The MSH measurements confirmed the nonexistence of the hysteresis loop and an increase of the rate of change of the MSH with the Mach number as the deflection angle was decreased. The detected transition points between RI and MI showed a very good experimental repeatability and revealed that transition always occurred at the von Neumann condition regardless of the initial shock configuration. These results suggest that flow perturbations present in the TST-27 wind tunnel may prevent a RI from existing within the theoretical dual solution domain and thus suppressing any hysteresis loop. Further experiments and simulations are required to characterize these perturbations and fully understand the physical mechanism that triggers premature transition.","Supersonic; Shockwave; Interaction; Transition; Schlieren; Focusing Schlieren; Aerodynamics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

This causes pressure loading on the impeller. When acoustic resonance occurs, i.e. the frequency of acoustic wave excitation matches with the structural natural frequencies of the impeller, high fatigue and vibrations are encountered, which can lead to structural failure. Centrifugal compressor applications like turbocharging and process engineering require an advanced understanding of the aeroacoustic excitation mechanisms as these have been suspected of playing a significant role in structural failures. Given that the current state-of-the-art analysis methods are incapable of explaining various instances of structural failures, a novel Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) based approach is explored. For the first time, aerodynamic and performance predictions, along with aeroacoustic amplitudes from the LBM based approach will be compared with a conventional Unsteady Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes (URANS) based approach as well as test rig data. This will assess the feasibility of the LBM model for analysing forced response behaviour of a centrifugal compressor operating at conditions of acoustic resonance. The research compressor has been chosen based on an aeromechanic test campaign where high impeller blade trailing edge vibrations were measured. The computational domain consists of full compressor wheel including the hub and the shroud cavities. An attempt will be made to quantify the resonant amplification factor by simulating off-resonant conditions. The findings from this research would result in the development of a numerical framework for assessing the physics and severity of resonant excitations in centrifugal compressors. It will also highlight the importance of accounting for aeroacoustic mechanisms in the aeromechanical design of centrifugal compressor stages.","high-cycle-fatigue; Tyler-Sofrin modes; acoustic resonance; triple-coincidence; impeller loading; vibro-acoustic resonance","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-11-27","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Catheters are generally used to access the heart through the blood vessels. The previously developed steerable Sigma catheter at Delft University of Technology, tackles cable related challenges of conventional mechanically controlled catheters by an improved tip and shaft design. With its two finger-controlled joysticks, the handle allows full actuation of the four degrees of freedom catheter tip. However, this input control method is not specifically designed for optimal user experience. Therefore, the aim of this research is to design an input control method for the Sigma catheter tip and shaft design to improve task performance while reducing workload for the interventionist. Methods – A theoretical framework was composed and analysed to form design requirements. After detailing the functional and geometrical design, a functional prototype, the Epsilon catheter, was fabricated. To evaluate the proposed control method, an experimental setup was prepared and the control method of both catheters were compared. Six participants were asked to conduct the task, which consisted of contacting targets with the catheter end-point. Target-to-target times were measured and a self-report questionnaire was conducted. Results – The theoretical analysis was divided in the interventional environment, the interventionist who controls the catheter, and the instrumentation. A functional design was made, including catheter control through combining multiple fingers and the wrist using positive input-output coupling. The geometrical design achieved these functionalities through bending flexures and a 180° bended shaft. Data analysis of the experiment showed differences in target-to-target times and self-reported measures. Conclusion – The Epsilon prototype showed to fulfil on the requirements in a functionality test. The prototype allows steering the catheter tip in five degrees of freedom, single-handed in a handheld design. In the experimental setup, participants using the control method of the Epsilon catheter, performed the targeting task faster than using the Sigma catheter with reduced workload. Significance – Allowing the interventionist to control all manoeuvrability of the catheter tip single handed, may change the operational procedure during interventional cardiology. A single interventionist could perform extended treatment using two individually controlled multi-steerable catheters. Further developments will be towards design optimisations to further improve user experience and evaluation of the fifth degree of freedom.","Steerable heart catheter; Interventional cardiology; Catheterization; Multi-steerable instruments; Manoeuvrability; Medical device design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-12-31","","","","Mechanical Engineering | BioMechanical Design","",""

It was shown that using an optimized S890 plate girders compared to hot rolled section made also from S890 steel, could reduce the use of steel by more than 80%.<br/>After the parametric studies showed increasing capacity, the geometry used to numerically model the plate girders, was critically addressed, using small scale numerical studies using FEM-software. These tests showed that not only the slenderness of the web was a factor in the bending moment capacity of a plate girder, but also the flange geometry plays a significant role. It was shown that increasing the length of the tested part of the girder, the failure mode could change from flange yielding to an instable mode in which the flange rotated around its longitudinal axis, resulting in a much lower bending moment capacity.<br/>An extra investigation in using a hybrid steel composition resulted in showing the potential of this optimization.

The design adds indications for the limits in airspeed, load factor, angle of attack and angle of bank to a standard Airbus primary flight display (PFD). The indications not only show the limits of the flight envelope, but also indicate the magnitude and direction of the cues given by the haptic feedback. Fifteen professional Airbus pilots and one Airbus sim instructor participated in an experiment in the SIMONA Research Simulator at Delft University of Technology. In the experiment several approaches in three different scenarios were flown with the old and new PFD while haptic feedback was always enabled. The objective results do not show a clear improvement with the new display, although the time spent outside the flight envelope is slightly reduced. Subjective results indicate a preference, however, for the new display as well as an increased understanding of the haptic feedback. Further research is recommended and should focus on improving the design by removing unused indications and setting up an experiment with a bank scenario that allows the use of the actual bank limits rather than artificially reduced limits.","Flight envelope; Haptic feedback; Flight deck design; SIMONA; Pilot behavior and performance; Human-machine interaction; Cockpit","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-05-29","","","","Aerospace Engineering | Control & Simulation","",""

This network infrastructure supports and improves Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) applications, related to positioning, navigation, tracking and (deformation) monitoring. This project focuses on what IM is with regards to the SiReNT infrastructure, and how the current methodology can be improved so that its output is easier to interpret/understand for its users. This research consists of two parts, a theory study, and a data study. The theory study is aimed at developing a fundamental understanding of GNSS and integrity, and the need for an IM component, as well as what comprises IM around the globe. The data study, which includes IM data processing, is performed to develop an understanding of the stability and performance of the SiReNT infrastructure itself, and its sensitivity to several degrading factors. For this the IM displacement data of a period of up to 5 months is analysed, in combination with the atmospheric information, and the number and geometry of tracked satellites. The Trimble method, with its default thresholds, has been applied to this IM displacement data, in order to determine what percentage was supposedly reliable, and inside these thresholds. It was also investigated whether these thresholds are performing adequately, if applied, and whether they have any impact on simultaneous recorded Rover data. The latter was assumed; the IM displacement data is thought to be usable to control the Rover data. When it comes to positioning solutions, the quality parameters include, integrity, accuracy, precision, availability, reliability, continuity, capacity and redundancy. These quality parameters are affected by several degrading factors. At the moment the Trimble Pivot Platform (TPP) is used to perform the network processing, as well as the integrity monitoring of the Continuous Operating Reference Stations (CORS) of the SiReNT infrastructure (and with that the impact of several of these degrading factors). This method is an example of the so-called external monitoring method. ‘External’ as the monitoring does not take place within the receiver itself, such as in the other method available; Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (RAIM). The external monitoring method and RAIM can either be used individually and/or independently, or in some sort of combination, complementing each other. In several other countries, namely the Netherlands, Australia (Victoria), Hong Kong, and Malaysia, variants of the external monitoring method are applied in performing IM of their GNSS infrastructures. Usually this includes baseline and coordinate processing/comparison, both in real-time and through post-processing (often using the Bernese GNSS software). All of them have backup systems in place. When it comes to IM visualization, even though there are similarities, the approaches differ per country. Some only visualise as much as the status of their reference stations, others visualise the real-time positioning solution of their IM stations, or have a complete dashboard visualising a number of parameters. From this research can be concluded that the integrity (in terms of CORS’ stability and positioning solution quality) of the SiReNT infrastructure is actually quite good. Of the IM displacement data which was supposedly reliable (following from the applied method), over 99% was within the set thresholds, for all CORS. The default thresholds (therefore) are iv <br/><br/>considered to be quite a good trade-off; they filter out most of the main disturbances (especially the ones which are assumed to be related to sudden severe fluctuations in the Ionospheric activity), while minimizing the amount of data loss. There is room for improvements however; as a start, the (overall) redundancy should be increased, making the SiReNT infrastructure more robust and increase its reliability. The method in which the IM is currently performed could be improved in several ways as well. This could for example be done by tracking more constellations/signals, constructing additional CORS and backup systems, and using multiple different hardware brands for the equipment that is used in the SiReNT infrastructure. Also, the SiReNT infrastructure should be monitored with respect to surrounding IGS stations, rather than using a CORS that is part of the SiReNT infrastructure itself as a reference. An important addition to the IM component could be the feedback from the Rover data and performance (the initialization time, and positioning solution quality). Currently made assumptions related to that do turn out to be erroneous, however. Any threshold applied to the IM displacement data cannot be used to control the Rover data. The way in which the output resulting from this IM is visualised, should be more intuitive/easy to interpret. For this a dashboard is to be developed (in design following the example of the dashboard of the Dutch Cadastre), which homepage should be visualizing several parameters, all in real-time. This would enable the (end-)user to see what is the current status with regards to all these parameters, in one view. One would however also be able to access further information related to these parameters, by selecting the one of interest. These parameters are to be the number of tracked satellites, the number of connected users, an indication of the Ionospheric delay, the predicted geometric error, and the Rover performance. The content of the information presented to the public should be kept to a minimum (only the necessary), where the content presented to the system administrators can be more elaborate. The conclusions of this research point towards the need for further research into how the applied methods/algorithms and thresholds (as well as the other available options) can be utilized in order to improve the IM procedure in Singapore. On top of that, the impact of interference should be identified and monitored. Being able to do this, will improve the (integrity of the) infrastructure and the information provided by it.<br/><br","GNSS Positioning; Integrity Monitoring; Singapore Satellite Positioning Reference Network","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These bridges are prone to high cycle fatigue due to traffic loading. Early onset of fatigue cracking is a serious issue in both old and recently built bridges. To prevent this a number of different cross section have been suggested. Sandwich Panel is one of the suggested alternative that has become more feasible to produce due to advancement in Hybrid Laser Arc Welding (HLAW) technology. One type of sandwich panel with corrugated core was investigated in this thesis. Ease of manufacturing, stronger welds, reduced complexity of welding and improved transverse shear stiffness are some advantages of sandwich panel over conventional orthotropic decks. The aim of this thesis is to apply J-Integral based local approach for fatigue assessment of sandwich panels subjected to lateral loads. J-Integral represents a way to calculate the strain energy release rate and is a measure of crack tip elastic-plastic field. It has already been used successfully to quantify fatigue performance of web core sandwich panels and is therefore used in this thesis. A second aim of this thesis is to justify the use of foam filling in sandwich panels by comparing fatigue performance of empty and foam filled sandwich panels. For validation, bending behaviour of panel was first investigated using Finite Element Analysis (FEA). The model developed for dual stake laser welded panel accurately estimated response parameters (compared to experimental results of Tan et al. [33]) like maximum deflection (2.2% difference), critical stresses in transverse direction (9% difference) for top and bottom face plates etc. For verification of Contour Integral technique of Abaqus/CAE, J-Integral at notch tip of ASTM CT specimen was calculated. Compared with empirical solution the FE estimate showed 16% difference with FE estimate being more conservative. Seven different types of foam were considered as filling in sandwich panels. The foams were of polymeric type - H45, H60, H80, H100, H130, H180, H200, and H250 (Unit weight of foams - 48 to 250 kg/mኽ and Young’s Modulus - 45 to 250 MPa). Based on two stage 3D FEA on empty and foam filled sandwich panels, it was observed that J-Integral value at critical tensile notch decreased consistently as stronger foam fillings were used in the panel (83.8% reduction observed between empty panel and H250 foam filled panel). Cycles to failure for panels were calculated using regression equation derived from existing research on web-core sandwich panel. Between empty and H100 foam filled panel an increase of 171 times was observed in cycles to failure. This increase justifies the use of foam filling.","Sandwich Panel; Corrugated core; J-Integral; Local Approach; Fatigue; Foam filling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The project concludes the master program Design for Interaction at the Delft University of Technology. SWKGroep asked for an innovative child care tool for children of 10-14 years old. The project description offered the designer much freedom. The initial design goal was formulated as follows: “Design a location and time independent form of after school day care for children (10-14 years old) that relieves parents, where children experience both affection and freedom and that adds value for SWKGroep.” The project is divided in three chapters: Orientation/Research, Ideation/Iteration and Evaluation/Demonstration. See Figure 1 for the overview of this project. The first chapter of the project, Orientation/Research, describes the internal and external analysis that gave more insight in the context of after school day care and the rules and regulations by the Dutch government. Interviews with parents and generative research sessions with children gave insights in the latent needs and desires of the users of the product. With the insights of the first chapter the design goal was further specified as follows: “Design a location and time independent form of after school day care for children (10-14 years old) where: children experience affection, freedom and guidance, while it relieves parents during work without losing control, that fits the business operations of SWKGroep and adds value.” In the second chapter, Ideation/Iteration, ideas to reach the design goals where generated. To guide this process two interaction visions are developed. They formed the inspiration for new ideas and used to test whether ideas where still on track of solving the design goal. Two initial design concepts where developed and assessed during a co-creation session with employees of different layers within the organisation of SWKGroep. Together with the analysis of an weighted objectives method the decision is made to develop a chosen concept that uses the strengths of both initial concepts: TEQ TIME Coach. In the last chapter: Evaluation/Demonstration the chosen concept is tested and evaluated with parents and potential coaches. These user tests gave the insights which made it possible to develop the chosen concept into a final design. This design is presented in paragraph 3.2 at page 90. This project can be seen as the first part, research and ideation, of developing an innovative child care tool for children of 10-14 years old. The second part, implementation, will be a project for the future. This project ends with a implementation plan for this second phase.","After school daycare; Childcare; Children; Co-design; Co-creation; Generative research","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

In recent times the scale of dredging and awareness of potential environmental impact of dredging have increased drastically. An often used dredging vessel is the trailing suction hopper dredger (TSHD). A TSHD pumps up a sediment-water mixture from the bed into a hopper. In this hopper the sediment is given time to settle and the process water is spilled overboard, often through a vertical shaft called the overflow. The spilled process water will contain some suspended sediment which has not deposited yet and this forms a turbid plume. Increased turbidity and deposition at the bed of the suspended sediment from the overflow dredging plume can have negative environmental impact. Identify the factors which create the surface plume and testing a solution to improve this is done in this thesis. Initial mixing of the overflow dredging plume under/near the TSHD is not well understood. Although the plume starts under the keel of a TSHD, it has initial downward velocity and it is denser than the ambient water, sometimes a part of the plume flows up- ward and reaches the free surface right behind the TSHD. This so called surface plume can stay suspended for long periods and is therefore important for the potential environmental impact. This thesis reports on laboratory experiments in still ambient water and numerical modelling with a crossflow. Specific attention is given to the change of overflow shape, from round to rectangular, which is tested in the laboratory experiments. Firstly, all influence factors which create a surface plume are investigated to see which factors have the highest influence. Based on the wish of a passive solution and the ability to do laboratory experiments, the change of overflow shape is chosen to investigate further. The analytical background of plume dispersion with different shapes is investigated to find the differences between them. The laboratory experiments where conducted at the dredging lab at the Technical University of Delft. In this lab, a 25m³ tank filled with water where at the top a frame is positioned which holds the overflow pipe. By adding two type of nozzles (different rectangular aspect ratio) onto the pipe, the outflow shape is changed to see if a rectangular outflow shape improves the plume path in still ambient water. This is done by measuring the concentrations at the bottom and measuring the angle of the plume. Results of the experiments show less entrainment and higher concentrations in the middle of the plume when having a rectangular outflow shape. To say something about the improvement of the plume path in real live, the plume is modelled by adding a crossflow. The information from the experiments is used to create a plume trajectory of the round outflow shape and rectangular outflow shape which are then compared with each other. Practical values are then scaled and used in the model. Results of the model show similarity from the experiments, with a deeper plume trajectory when having a rectangular outflow shape.","Dredging; Plume; Turbidity; overflow losses","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-05-28","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

Neural networks have emerged as a popular modelling choice due to their proven ability to learn complex nonlinear relationships between inputs and outputs of any given system. Moreover, they are capable of generalizing on data that they have not been trained on. The downside of modelling with neural networks is that they do not provide any insight into the dynamics of the system they model. This limits the application of neural networks in carrying out fault diagnosis of mechanical systems to just the fault detection and isolation (FDI) tasks. While in some applications this may be sufficient, sometimes alongside FDI, it is also desirable to carry out a fault identification task in order to determine the necessary adjustments to bring the faulty system back to its normal operating condition. This thesis explores the possibility of carrying out a fault identification task alongside an FDI task for a mechanical system that has been modelled by a neural network. Traditionally, the weights of a trained neural network represent the strength of a connection between the two neurons they connect. The possibility of an existing correlation between the weights of a neural network and the properties of the mechanical system being modelled is a concept that has not been fully explored yet. This study considers that such a relation exists, implying that the change in certain properties of the mechanical system due to the occurrence of a fault can be related to a change in the corresponding weights of the neural network modelling the system. Consequently, the change in weights of the neural network could give an insight into the fault occurrence in a mechanical system. Taking this idea forward, two fault diagnosis algorithms have been proposed in this study - a fault detection algorithm using adaptive threshold, and a fault isolation &amp; identification algorithm based on sparse Bayesian learning framework. The proposed algorithms were tested on (hypothetical) faulty linear and non-linear systems. The results show that the adaptive threshold based fault detection algorithm was successful in detecting the occurrence of faults in the linear system. For the non-linear system, although a simplistic neural network was used to model the system, the fault detection algorithm was still successful while returning few and sparse false positives and negatives. The fault isolation &amp; identification algorithm was also successful in isolating and identifying all the changed weights in the neural networks modelling the system for both linear and non-linear cases. Although the algorithms proposed show promising results for the experiments conducted, further research is needed to establish the suitability of using them in real world applications.","Fault Detection; Neural Networks; Sparse Bayesian Learning; Fault Isolation; Fault Identification","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

To find the optimal time and path-trajectory to move from one target to another during a race, this study analyzes how the wind determines the optimal time-path of Lasers, one of the smallest sailboats that compete during the summer Olympic Games.<br/>To answer this question, this study uses four wind models in an algorithm developed in MATLAB to find the optimal time-path. The wind models were forecasts and wind measurements for the area of race R1 from the World Cup Series 2018 at Hyères, France. One of the wind models used were a Weather Research and Forecasting model (WRF) with a grid resolution of 1km, a time step of 10 minutes. On the other hand, the most basic model was a constant and uniform wind field.  The race R1 has three lines, limited by two buoys, and one point(buoy), one line and one point define a leg. R1 has five legs and two of them are against the wind. The results, time and path-trajectories, of each of the wind models, were compared with the results of the top 10 winners of the race. They showed that the legs sailed against the wind are also characterized by the location of the sailboats on the start line. The times of these legs using the WRF wind model and the race-time had an error of less than 5%. For the prediction of the start location, it was the same as the winner of the race. However, the direction of the paths was not predicted accurately for these legs. Using the constant and uniform wind scenario, the percentage error of the race-time respect to the winner is about 7%. However, the direction of leg 2 is not even similar to the winner. To review the effects of the heights of the waves this study proposes to model the sailboat in 3-dimensions including the X-coordinate of the sail-man position. In addition, a 3D model allows the analysis of how the center of effort (CE) on the sail is affected by the current and waves.","Sailing; time; Optimization; Laser; Wind","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | BioMechanical Design","",""

(graduation committee); Schoutens, Pieter (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","In situations with spatial limitations where a bridge is desired, a skewed bridge is a solution. The bridge deck of a skewed bridge has the shape of a parallelogram, in which the angle that remains in the acute corners is deﬁned as the skew angle. This thesis focuses on the design of reinforced concrete skewed slab highway bridges that are simply supported on discrete bearing pads. A parametric tool is created which, based on a set of values for input parameters, generates and analyzes bridge models created in a ﬁnite element method (FEM) software program. After analysis, results are summarized, which allows for a parametric study. The goal of this study is to develop knowledge for decision-making in early stages of projects. The inﬂuence of main geometric parameters (skew angle, bridge span length, bridge road width) on the load distribution in a skewed bridge is investigated, as well as the inﬂuence of FEM mesh element size, applied plate theory, traﬃc load conﬁguration and support conﬁguration. Another important parameter, being the bridge deck height, is set to be dependent to the span length at ﬁrst. Skewed slab bridges tend to span from support to support in the shortest direction. This means that loads will concentrate in the obtuse corner. Resultant quantities, mainly bending moments and shear force in the obtuse corner, are studied on their relation with the diﬀerent parameters. The obtuse corner load concentrations can require the bridge height to become larger than desired. A powerful measure is to add additional triangular sections (ATS) to the side of the bridge, which increases its width. This way, the road skew angle no longer equals the bridge skew angle. Load concentrations in the obtuse corners are reduced, which can result in a lower deck height, less reinforcement, or both. The eﬀect of ATS addition on resultants is studied: great reduction is observed, even for relatively small ATS addition. In order to relate the bridge deck height to bridge geometry, a reinforcement study is conducted. A procedure is described for a certain cross-section, in which the resultants are known from models generated by the parametric tool. Starting point is the longitudinal bending reinforcement based on the crack width criterion, which is usually governing in bridge design. Next, required shear reinforcement is calculated. Following, the ultimate bending moment capacity is checked, which is found to be always suﬃcient for crack-width-based reinforcement design. Finally, optimization (diﬀerent bar diameters, add or remove a reinforcement layer, deck height reduction) is investigated and applied if possible. Using the procedure described above, a case study is conducted. A highly skewed bridge (road skew angle of 20◦) is taken. Starting with 0◦, ATS is added in steps of 5◦. For each geometry, a model is created with the tool after which resultants are used for the reinforcement design. For a bridge span of 13.7 m and a road width of 8.3 m, the ﬁrst bridge (no ATS, skew angle of 20◦) was found to lie beyond the limits of reinforced concrete. Two layers of 40 mm bars required fatigue-sensitive couplers, while detailing and proper anchorage would prove to be unconstructible. Increasing the cross-section also increased governing moments due to concrete self-weight and therefore is not an option. Addition of a 5◦ ATS resulted in a 900 mm high bridge deck, which seems possible to construct. Addition of 10◦ resulted in a 750 mm high deck, 15◦ into 600 mm and further ATS addition reduced deck height even more. Although it should be noted that ATS addition increases deck surface, a signiﬁcant reduction in deck height can be obtained. ATS addition is shown to be a powerful measure. Depending on project situation, it can provide optimization and cost savings; the parametric tool is proven to be useful in investigating this.","Skewed slab bridge; Reinforced concrete; Parametric model; Highway bridge; Finite Element Analysis; Parametric study; Additional Triangular Segments; Finite Element Method","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering","",""

Such floors are realised with large areas without dilations, the shrinkage reduction is therefore restrained causing cracks to arise at the top surface of the floor. The control of cracking is the governing design aspect for jointless ground floor and is done by a top reinforcement mesh combined with the addition of steel fibres in the concrete mixture. Alkali-activated concrete is a concrete realised without cement and has a reduced CO2 footprint, it can show some beneficial material properties, making it a potential concrete for a more sustainable floor. A parametric study is done and an optimised floor realised in alkali-activated concrete is considered. Crack-width calculations of increased accuracy are performed via bond-slip calculations. These are performed analytically and by finite element analysis done with DIANA. Comparisons show that the so called direct method and DIANA underestimate the crack-widths relative to the more accurate analytically computed results. Additionally, it is found that the improved bond strength of alkali-activated concrete results in smaller crack-widths. It follows that with alkali-activated concrete a jointless floor can be realised in a thinner cross-section and with less steel necessary to control the crack-widths. As a result alkali-activated concrete is suitable to construct more sustainable jointless ground floors.","Alkali-activated concrete; Jointless ground floors; Elastically supported concrete floor; Geopolymer concrete; Parametric study; Optimisation; Crack-width calculations; Finite element analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering","",""

Linear models describing behavior in such tasks can therefore be directly based on the human perception of the visual scene, although it is currently unclear how this perception guides control behavior. In literature, occlusion experiments have investigated this connection by artificially restricting the field of view and measuring the difference in driver performance compared to full-visual driving, but never managed to describe changes in underlying driver control dynamics. Therefore, in this MSc thesis project a human-in-the-loop experiment was performed in the SIMONA Research Simulator in which drivers steered along a curved road under varying occlusion conditions, showing either a single, or two separate, horizontal slits (1-deg vertical view angle) of the visual scene at varying vertical positions in the visual scene. The measured steering behavior was analyzed using a recently developed parametric model of driver steering, including the estimation of the driver Frequency Response Functions (FRFs). This model explicitly captures drivers’ individual responses to road preview, lateral position and heading angle information. Complementary, the eye gaze is measured and compared to the estimated driver model parameters. For the first time, insight is obtained in the behavioral changes under various occlusion conditions with respect to full-visual behavior, directly in relation to where drivers look. The experiment shows that drivers adapt their modelled aim points and eye gaze to the available road geometry if only a single occlusion slit is present. For double-slit conditions, drivers place both the gaze and aim points between the occlusion slits, effectively interpolating the available visual information while still responding to a single metric. In contrast to earlier reported findings in literature, these results show a strong adaptability to the visual scene and provide no indication of often-suspected two-level driver control.","manual control; Lane keeping; Visual occlusion; system identification; eye gaze","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-05-27","","","","Aerospace Engineering | Control & Simulation","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","With the rise of globalisation, countries have become more connected financially and global cross-border investment flows have become more common. FDI is an important form of cross-border flow which is responsible for the spread of technology across countries and is the main source of external finance for emerging countries. In the last two decades, FDI has increased tremendously. But this has been accompanied by fears about outward FDI taking away production activities and jobs away from the home country. I look at how outward FDI affects home country investment. One can intuitively understand that a dollar of money spent abroad means a dollar less to invest in the domestic economy. Based on the theory of the financially constrained firm, I hypothesize that outward FDI reduces domestic fixed capital investment and R&amp;D spending. I also develop a theoretical framework to distinguish the varying effects of outward FDI on domestic investment across traditional and R&amp;D-intensive industries.By using industry-level panel data for 18 OECD countries covering the period 1995-2009, I regressed the shares of Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF) and R&amp;D spending separately on the share of outward FDI both for all industries as well as specifically for traditional and R&amp;D-intensive industries. While, outward FDI had a negative effect on domestic capital investments at the aggregate level, it did not have any significant effect while looking at specific industry types. This could be because of the reduced sample size in the individual types. Outward FDI had a negative effect on domestic R&amp;D spending at the aggregate level and for R&amp;D-intensive industries, but it had a positive effect for traditional industries. Thus, while fears about outward FDI taking away domestic fixed capital investments are valid, outward FDI can have both a positive and negative effect on R&amp;D expenditure, depending on the type of industry. These results can help MNCs make strategic investment decisions taking into account their effect on their home country industry. It can also help policymakers formulate tax and industrial policies to promote home country investments.","Outward FDI; domestic investment; traditional and R&D-intensive industries","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

For this purpose a steady state model is used, based on the Airbus A320. It is concluded that the implemented EECS architecture has the potential for fuel reduction, due to 50% less energy demand during cruise compared to a conventional architecture. With an estimated retrofit weight increase of 200 kg, fuel burn is reduced by 0.4% to 1.4% for the baseline case depending on range. On fleet level, this translates to 0.50% through flight frequency statistics.

Conventional heavy doping CSCs are subject to a few drawbacks such as significant Auger recombination, parasitic absorption, complicated processing and relatively high fabrication cost. An alternative approach is by using transition metal oxides (TMO) where nm-thick metal oxides are introduced with easy and cost effective processes to realize the asymmetric conductivity for charge carriers. In this project, we investigated the passivation property and carrier selectivity of two types of TMOs, namely MoOx as hole transport layer (HTL) and TiOx as electron transport layer (ETL).<br/><br/>The performance of MoOx based HTL is characterized at device level. By optimizing the metallization process, interfacial (i)a-Si:H layer thickness, textured surface pre-treatment and annealing conditions, an ultimate PCE of 17.60% is achieved, with Voc being 655 mV, Jsc being 38.36 mA/cm2 and FF being 70.40%.<br/><br/>The passivation quality of TiOx based ETL is characterized both by symmetric test for the passivation properties and at device level. First, the passivation property of single TiOx layer and NAOS-SiO2/TiOx stacks are investigated. With the optimization of layer thickness and FGA conditions, a Voc of ~680 mV is obtained in both cases. After which, we investigated the passivation degradation caused by changing a new TiO2 source material. We conclude that the passivation degradation is mainly attributed to the non-uniform TiOx coating resulted from the reduced free mean path of evaporated TiOx due to TiO2 outgassing during deposition. Meanwhile, we also studied the influence of different interfacial layer between c-Si and TiOx such as (i)a-Si:H thin layer where a Voc of ~660mV is achieved by using new TiO2 source. Eventually, all optimized ETL structures are tested in FBC solar cells with p+ poly-SiOx at the front side as HTL. The results demonstrate that all cells are showing similar passivation quality (Voc=~575 mV) and the champion cell of 14.21% efficiency is achieved in c- Si/TiOx stack, with Jsc being 30.53 mA/cm2 and FF being 74.97%.<br","Carrier selective passivating contacts; transition metal oxides; TiOx; MoOx; Passivation; Solar cells","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The regulatory energy performance gap is found to deviate by +34% with an SD of 55% based on 62 case buildings. In certain cases, the energy performance gap due to occupant behaviour was 300%. This is attributed to factors such as - climate, indoor design criteria, building energy service systems, building envelope, building operation maintenance and occupant behaviour.

Accounting for it is challenging. Typical human interventions like heating/cooling, opening/closing windows, use of sunshades, hot water used, number of electrical appliances, lighting and cooking (gas/electric) play an important role in predicting the actual energy usage. Over-simplification and negligence of these interventions during the design phase is responsible for the energy performance gap. <br/>This study aims to study the impact of occupant behaviour on the energy consumption of three Dutch residential dwellings with an emphasis on data-informed decisions and predictions.

In addition to higher energy consumption and material wear for delivering the targeted depth, spillage can lead to a variety of environmental issues. As of yet, no analytical model exists in literature that can estimate spillage rates for a given set of cutting parameters. This thesis presents the Sand-Rock Cutting Spillage Model (SRCSM), an engineering model that is particle size-agnostic and makes use of cutting parameters that are all available to the dredge operator.<br/>Prediction accuracy of 5 percentage point is achieved with a two-disc potential flow model complemented with empirical closing relationships. A triad of forces governs flow in the cutter head for typical cutting conditions: a centrifugal, suction and gravitational force are considered. For the centrifugal pump effect, and centrifugal pump effect only, the flow inside the cutter is considered steady, non-gravitational, inviscid and non-axial. This allows for the derivation of a pressure-discharge affinity law from the Navier-Stokes. The axial pump effect is governed by the mixture velocity at the suction mouth. It is hypothesized that the pressure difference over the discs drives an inflow at the disc closest to the nose. Centrifugal advection and rapid redeposition spillage are considered the two most significant spillage types out of the six classified. Centrifugal advection can be determined by identifying the onset of radial outflow at the disc near the cutter ring. The magnitude of rapid redeposition flow and its concentration depend on mixing effects that are proportional to the ratio particle settling velocity and the mixture velocity squared. The model is calibrated with three coefficients. User input parameters are the cutter geometry, cut-type factor f<sub>d,type</sub> (-1 for under-cut), bank slope angle ξ, cutter inclination angle λ, bank height h, step size l<sub>step</sub>, rotational velocity ω, settling velocity v<sub>ts</sub>, swing velocity v<sub>s</sub>, mixture velocity v<sub>m</sub> and material densities. <br/>Spillage=f(D<sub>ring</sub>,D<sub>nose</sub>,D<sub>pipe</sub>,b,f<sub>d,type</sub>,ξ,γ,h,l<sub>step</sub>,ω,v<sub>ts</sub>,v<sub>s</sub>,v<sub>m</sub>,ρ<sub>q</sub>,ρ<sub>b</sub>,ρ<sub>w</sub> )<br/>For calibration, an inverse flow number θ<sup>-1</sup> is used that is proportional to the ratio of centrifugal flow over mixture flow. Spillage rates from SRCSM are in high agreement with reference data for sand (Miltenburg, 1983) and rock (Den Burger, 2003) in an under-cut swing. A sensitivity analysis suggests that most cutter head dynamics are adequately incorporated. The model is less reliable for (non-typical) inverse flow numbers of  θ<sup>-1</sup>= 6 [-] and higher due to a mixture velocity that drops below zero. In addition, the model is calibrated for a relatively high cutter inclination angle of 45 [deg] and bank angle of 45 [deg]. Caution should be observed with the results. It is also suggested that mixing effects related to the swing velocity are incorporated more explicitly in the model. For typical sand cutting conditions, the highest spillage reduction (-4.6%) is achieved by a 1 [%] smaller step size. For rock, the highest spillage reduction (-0.63%) is achieved for a 1 [%] decrease in swing velocity. Spillage appears to follow the theorem of Ellington (1934): it don’t mean a thing if it ain’t got that swing.<br","Rapid Redeposition; CSD; Spillage; Dredging; Centrifugal Advection","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

KiloHertz Frequency Alternating Current (KHFAC) stimulation can block signals that are travelling through the body; applying this type of stimulation at the pudendal nerve could inhibit the pulses that lead to contraction of the urethral sphincter, and restore voiding ability. In order to design a successful KHFAC block therapy for the pudendal nerve, it is necessary to understand what impact different stimulation parameters have on efficacy, safety and power-efficiency. This thesis will therefore test earlier researched KHFAC stimulation parameters against a new quality measure, study the impact of new waveform alterations, and study how bipolar electrode design can improve KHFAC therapy. By utilizing the theory behind the mechanism of the KHFAC nerve block, a new block-determination model was developed that is over thirty times faster than the classic model. The McIntyre-Richardson-Grill model was chosen as the implementation of the axon model, and the bipolar electrode was modelled as an electric dipole. The simulation experiments revealed that the charge per phase of the KHFAC signal at block threshold could be reduced, without increasing the amplitude of the signal, by introducing interphase delays to the waveforms and by creating asymmetric charge-balanced waveforms. Triangular waveforms were shown to also require less charge per phase than a regular square wave to block, albeit with a higher amplitude. A correctly aligned bipolar electrode set-up with an interpolar distance that was about the same as the electrode-to-axon distance was shown to result in reduced block thresholds. Overall, this thesis has shown how stimulation parameters can be chosen to develop an effective KHFAC block therapy for the pudendal nerve.","KHFAC; KiloHertz Frequency Alternating Current stimulation; High-frequency stimulation; nerve conduction block; pudendal nerve; interphase delays; charge-balance; asymmetrical charge-balanced wave; stimulation parameters; design considerations; urinary retention; MRG Model; bipolar stimulation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-05-24","","","","Electrical Engineering","REValUE",""

They want to investigate the possibility of sorting aluminium in a robotic system. Aluminium is one of the most used materials worldwide. Demands for aluminium are ever increasing. Recycling scrap is needed to keep up with the demand. An important step in the recycling process is the separation into different alloys, as sorting aluminium creates added value. Currently, the only way to sort the scrap is to have it done manually in low-wage countries such as China, Pakistan or India. This thesis describes the analysis of the problems which may occur implementing such a system. Three idea directions were generated based on the analysis executed. It was found that using a robotic arm with a robotic gripper would unwantedly increase the complexity of the sorting system. Simply pushing the scrap off a conveyor belt was found to be the best design. Based on this finding three different concepts were created, of which one, the concept in which material is fed into the system in a line, was selected. A pusher, perpendicular to the conveyor belt, pushes the material off the belt. Material is classified using a camera and a line scanner. The scrap is stored in a bunker under the sorting installation. In the last phase of this project the gripper was detailed. It was important to maximize the quality of sorting. Besides this, the reliability of the complete system needed to be maximized, while the cost per tonne should be minimized. The final design is a gripper which gives the pieces of scrap a parabolic trajectory before they land in the bunker for storing. The gripper is constructed out of steel and is 250 by 125 [mm].

On March 11, 2011, a highly destructive earthquake induced tsunami hit the north-eastern part of Honshu island, causing enormous damage to numerous small towns along the coast. Since 2011 various studies have been completed to better understand this historical event and explain the nature of tsunamis. However, some researchers have noted the inability of tsunami models, using only an earthquake as a source, to reproduce the timing, frequency and wave heights recorded along the Tohoku coast in March 2011. The differences are especially striking for the Sanriku coast – a relatively small area north of Sendai plain characterised by a ria-type coastline. D. R. Tappin et al. (2014) suggested that a secondary source is required to explain the deviating model results and locally higher tsunami waves, such as a submarine landslide. In low-lying coastal areas, tsunamis are an unavoidable hazard to human lives. A common way of addressing natural disasters of this scale is with timely warning and evacuation, which in turn requires appropriate techniques for prediction of an upcoming disaster. While earthquake induced tsunamis provide a sort of a warning signal, tsunamis generated by a submarine landslide can be much more difficult to predict. Landslide tsunamis are usually concentrated in local areas and do not propagate far, as they are more dispersive than earthquake tsunamis. However, the source of landslide tsunamis is often located on a continental slope near the coastal line. As a result, waves reach the shore in a very short period of time and run-up heights can reach extremely high levels (Harbitz et al., 2006). Thus, landslide generated tsunamis pose a serious hazard to densely populated coastal areas. Within the scope of this thesis, a number of experimental simulations on submarine slope failures were conducted in a so-called static liquefaction tank – a unique testing facility for large scale experiments at the Geo-Engineering Laboratory of TU Delft. To improve the understanding of tsunami generation, this study focuses on the moment of onset of a submarine slope failure and wave generation, linking the processes within failing soil mass to initial characteristics of waves. This study illustrates the connection between these two processes that are usually only considered individually from either a geotechnical or hydraulic perspective.","Physical modelling; Submarine landslide; Tsunami; Wavelet transform; Liquefaction tank","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-05-17","","","","Geo-Engineering","",""

Batteries have always been the main power source of these devices. Batteries have some drawbacks, the biggest one being the replacement of IMDs with fully discharged batteries. In this thesis a wireless power transfer system, with a receiving power conversion system with a maximum volume of 10 mm3, is proposed for IMDs implanted at more than 10 cm deep.<br/>Ultrasonic wireless power transfer to IMDs could enable scaling down the devices to dimensions less than 1 cm. Compared with the electromagnetic far-field and near-field wireless power transfer methods, the power throughput to the IMD is much higher. Piezo-electric elements could be used to perform the acoustic to electric energy conversion. With the Butterworth-Van Dyke modeling technique, the ultrasonic wireless power transfer link could be characterized. Maximum acoustic intensity at the receiving piezo-electric element is assumed because of the high efficiency and the possible methods to focus the waves from the transmitter at a certain point in the human body. An electrical storage element is assumed because of fluctuations both in received and used power.<br/>As the piezo-electric receiver outputs sinusoidal voltage and current waveforms, and the electrical storage element requires DC voltage, the signal requires significant processing for maximum power transfer. A perfect complex conjugate match between the piezo-electric receiver and the power conversion circuit is required for maximum power transfer as well. Two different methods which are used in prior art to achieve maximum power transfer are presented in this thesis, and one new method is developed. The standard method, which is used often in literature, does not include any special processing by means of impedance transformations and is therefore only efficient around one power level operating point. The varying frequency method varies the frequency so as to vary the piezo resistance and match it to the power conversion systems resistance. The piezo inductance varies with the varying piezo resistance, and is canceled out by tunable capacitor banks. A DC boost converter is required for high efficiency to the electric storage element. This method has many drawbacks, among which the continuous communication back to the transmitter to close the loop, which is consuming power and adding delay. The newly proposed method is the AC boost method. The AC voltage of the piezo-electric receiver is transformed into a pulse width modulated square wave voltage, so all power could go through the rectifier and into the storage element. A continuous resistive match is made between the AC boost converter and the piezo-electric element, ensuring maximum power transfer. This new method is validated by performing electric circuit simulations. Circuits are designed for the simulations that are comparable because of using the same piezo-electric element, rectifier, and storage element. The simulations show that it is the most efficient method for a wide load power range of 10 µW to 5 mW. The standard method is as efficient but only at a small range at high power level. The varying frequency method is much more complex and has, therefore, lower power efficiency at high power levels whereas at low power levels it has the same power efficiency.","impedance transformation; implantable medical devices (IMDs); maximum power transfer; resistor emulation; ultrasound; wireless power transfer; AC boost","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering","",""

These adjustable steering systems have led to an improvement in traffic and road safety and decrease in driver’s workload. A previous study concludes that driver steering behaviour is significantly dependent on vehicle speed and road curvature (number and sharpness of bends). Interestingly, variable steering ratio systems often depend on speed but not on road curvature. Variable steering ratio dependent on road curvature possibly influences driving behaviour and might be desirable for safety and driver acceptance. The goal of this research is to investigate driver acceptance and driving behaviour for two separate steering ratios (1:12 and 1:40) and two different road profiles (i.e. specific curvatures straight highway and curvy country road) at a constant speed. We hypothesize that on a curvy country road low steering ratio (1:12) leads to higher safety margins and subjective ratings, whereas on a straight highway a high steering ratio (1:40) leads to higher safety margins and subjective ratings. Therefore we conducted a within-subject driving experiment (N=24) in a fixed-based passenger vehicle simulator at constant speed. The results show that on a country road a vehicle with a low steering ratio increases time-to-line- crossing (TLC) safety margins and increases self-reported subjective ratings compared to the high steering ratio setting. Likewise, on a highway, a vehicle with a high steering ratio leads to higher safety margins and comfort rating compared to a low steering ratio. Thereby it can be concluded that steering ratio variable to the road profile improves safety and acceptance. These results provide promising evidence to make steering systems adaptable to road profile (e.g. steer-by-wire and active rear wheel steering).","Driver acceptance; steering ratio; Driving simulator","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Vehicle Engineering | Human Factors","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","A main challenge port engineers had to tackle in recent years is wave penetration inside a harbour, as it determines vessels’ safe sailing and mooring, possibly causes unwanted vessel movements, and unequivocally regulates the execution of port operations. A physical scale model can describe wave penetration in a complete way. However, the construction of a physical scale model is expensive and time consuming. For this reason, nowadays several numerical models are used to describe wave penetration in ports, affected by multiple processes such as diffraction, partial reflection, etc. In this study, the simulation of wave penetration with the non-hydrostatic model SWASH is examined. To validate the numerical model, output of an open benchmark dataset of Deltares (Deltares, 2016) is used, consisting of physical scale model tests of schematic port layouts. As wave penetration is a summation of physical processes, each process should be described accurately by SWASH. This thesis focuses on assessing how SWASH models wave penetration per wave process, first separately by means of simplified models and then combined in a model describing the full harbour layout resulting to the final wave field inside a port. The main topics of interest of the formulated research questions are the ability of SWASH to simulate wave propagation, wave celerity and the effect of two dominant wave processes: reflection and diffraction. As the amount of processes influencing wave penetration increases for higher layout complexity, the research was targeted at the simplest port layout considered in the benchmark dataset (Deltares, 2016). Moreover, only regular waves were taken into account, as in this case the differences between the measurements and the computational results are most easily identified. To better understand the influence of reflection the waves, two simplified one-dimensional SWASH models were designed. The first model simulated reflection in front of a gravel slope, located outside the harbour basin, and the second model reflection in front of the harbour basin end, consisting of a gravel slope and a concrete quay wall behind it. The results suggest that outside the basin the reflection off the gravel slope has a minor effect in comparison to the reflection off a vertical quay wall. Inside the harbour basin, wave reflection played a dominant role on the resulting wave field there. The SWASH models were proven to be robust as the wave height in the computational domain did not change considerably for an increase or decrease of the porosity of a gravel slope by 10%. It should be emphasised that the standing wave heights were altering fast within a short horizontal distance. Therefore, the precise wave height values were strongly influenced by the exact location of the output points examined. The importance of diffraction inside the harbour was demonstrated by a simplified two-dimensional model, in which reflection off the harbour end was not included. The information that could be obtained from the measurements about the wave height changes due to diffraction was limited. However, the initial trends due to diffraction were also identified in SWASH. From the comparison of the wave height in the SWASH model, influenced only by diffraction, to the respective measured value, it was confirmed that the total measured wave penetration inside the harbour was significantly influenced by diffraction. The comparison of the measurements to the results of the final SWASH model, which included the full version of the simplest physical model, showed that the overall wave field pattern is in agreement. The numerical model was able to reproduce the diffraction and reflection patterns observed in the measurements. At many output locations in SWASH the measured wave height values were simulated with high accuracy. On the downside, at other locations the measured and the modelled wave height deviated significantly. The large deviations can be explained by the fact that the standing wave patterns change within a short distance and thus the wave height can vary significantly at the area close to a specific output point. It may be possible that the measured wave height at a specific point can be identified in SWASH in the region close to the exact point coordinates. All in all, it was concluded that for non-breaking, relatively low waves, with wave height to water-depth ratio lower than 0.2, the accuracy of SWASH in modelling the wave processes of reflection and diffraction is sufficiently well for engineering purposes. For relatively high waves and/or breaking waves, numerical instabilities were detected. It is assumed that the numerical instabilities can be attributed to the relatively low number of grid cells per wave length. This study advances our understanding of the wave penetration simulation in SWASH. The approach followed allows investigating the ability of the model to simulate, separately and combined, two wave processes which predominantly contribute to wave penetration in harbour: reflection and diffraction. With further validation to guarantee the model stability, the strategy of this thesis can be a useful tool to understand the performance of SWASH in modeling wave penetration per wave process and in combination. The knowledge obtained enlightens the possible reasons leading to deviations between the measurements and the model outputs. This can be valuable assistance in the course of further improving the model accuracy.","wave penetration; port; wave modelling; SWASH; Reflection; Diffraction; Harbour","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","",""

The increasing height of wind turbines results in higher layers of the atmosphere being reached, where other phenomena than the surface-based ones can be of importance. One of these phenomena that can affect the wind energy production is a ramp up or a ramp down; a sudden increase or decrease in wind speed. One of the causes of a ramp down is a Frontal Low Level Jet (FLLJ), a jet stream which forms just ahead of a cold front. When the front has passed, the wind speed suddenly drops. It is yet unknown how well frontal Low Level Jets (LLJs) are simulated by a numerical weather prediction model. For this research, case studies of occurrences of FLLJs were determined based on Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) observations, synopticmaps and coarse-resolutionWeather Research and Forecasting (WRF) simulations. The chosen case studies were simulated with WRF using a finer resolution. These simulations were compared with surface observations from weather stations, wind profiler observations, LiDAR observations and observations from a wind farm. From these comparisons it was concluded that the WRF model performed relatively well in general. The general development and dissolving of the FLLJ were simulated correctly, but the timing and magnitude of these simulations can be improved.","wind energy; WRF; low level jets","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

While CMOS device suffers from high static leakage, reduced reliability and manufacturing complexity; conventional computing architecture suffers from high power consumption with memory access and performance bottlenecks. Non-volatile and CMOS-compatible emerging memristive device technology with extremely compact memory structures offers in-memory computing solutions. However, research lacks quantitative benchmarking of memristor-based primitive logic designs. Moreover, the arithmetic and functional circuit design solutions are inefficient and hence incompetent to replace the state-of-the-art.The thesis first covers device level physics of different memristive devices, elaborating their basic structures, working principles and behavioural analyses using Verilog-A models. Building on single device behavioural analyses, a comprehensive exploration and quantitative benchmarking of all existing primitive gates is provided, thereby concluding that scouting logic design technique is the optimal logic gate to perform in-memory computing. Going forward, using scouting logic as the building block, the work presents efficient arithmetic and functional circuit designs that outperform previously proposed in-memory computing solutions and attempts to make a strong case to challenge the current CMOS-based state-of-the-art computing paradigm.Different flavours of a novel circuit design are proposed to tackle limitations common to circuits implementing primitive arithmetic operations and complex multiply-accumulate (dot-product) operations supporting data-intensive applications. The proposed circuit deploys in-built sample-and-hold and two bit-wise weighting techniques to enable pipelining and self-timing-path to improve accuracy against variations. As compared to 4-bit adder utilising integrate and fire circuit (IFC) that is optimised for area/power, the proposed design improves the speed, area, and energy consumption by 4X, 2.5X, and 11X, respectively. Incorporating additional components such as high-gain differential amplifier and modified IFC provides a highly accurate, linear, power efficient dot product engine with significant improvement in memristor endurance. To perform 64_4 dot 64_1, the proposed dot product engine improves the speed, area and energy consumption by 2X, 3.5X and 54X, respectively, as compared to area-efficient IFC-based engine, while also extending the range of operands operated in parallel by &gt;3X. Compared to highly accurate SAR-ADC(current sense amplifier) based dot product engine, the proposed design improves the speed, area and energy by a factor of 0.4X(1.2X), 200X(6X) and 260X(108X), respectively, with comparable accuracy. Read endurance is significantly improved as &lt; 0.1V is maintained across the memristors during the dot-product operation, as opposed to &gt; 1V endured using prior proposed designs.

Many scholars blame traditional management approaches for cost overruns and delays occurring in current projects. To find solutions, project managers introduce tools from various sectors that have coped with similar problems before, such as the IT and manufacturing sectors. Scheduling has been found to be a main reason for delays and cost overruns. Traditionally, scheduling is done before projects start. Predictions are made for durations, costs and required resources. Project managers impose schedules on subcontractors and apply pressure to prevent delays or cost overruns. This method is characterized by a reactive approach to problems. Short-cyclic scheduling is more appropriate for complex projects than traditional scheduling. Short-cyclic scheduling tools allow operational personnel to schedule their own tasks. This gives them the flexibility to detect problems quickly and act proactively. Besides, recent knowledge from the work floor is applied directly to the schedule. Furthermore, A benefit of short-cyclic scheduling is the possibility to proactively cope with changing top-down requirements and circumstances. Most short-cyclic scheduling tools originate from the IT and manufacturing sectors. However, construction projects during the realization phase differ from IT and manufacturing projects. Which raises the question if construction projects during the realization phase are appropriate for short-cyclic scheduling. Scholars have investigated implementations of such tools but have not clearly formulated criteria for short-cyclic scheduling in ongoing projects. To find these criteria the following research question is formulated: What determines the appropriateness for short-cyclic scheduling of construction projects in the realization phase? The determination of a project’s appropriateness started with a literature study on short-cyclic implementation in construction projects. The literature study resulted in theoretical conditions for appropriate short-cyclic implementation. The theoretical conditions were used as a framework to observe scheduling sessions and to interview project members in two construction projects. The theoretical conditions were a means to structurally investigate problems and success factors in the two projects. The case studies resulted in a list of critical project factors for appropriateness, depicted in Figure 1. These critical factors can be considered the tipping point for a project’s appropriateness. If a project does not possess these factors it is unrealistic to expect a successful short-cyclic implementation.","Scheduling; Agile; Last planner; construction; Realization; Implementation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-05-12","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

The exoskeleton envelops the paraplegic’s waist, legs and feet. When the user gives the command to start walking, the exoskeleton’s robotic legs start a cyclic walking motion. The user, aided by crutches, follows this fixed cyclic motion, shifting their weight to the stance leg to allow the other leg to swing. A current challenge in exoskeleton development is to give the user more freedom and autonomy in the interaction with the exoskeleton. This study focuses on allowing the user to control step length in an intuitive manner. It is known from many previous studies found in literature, that during gait the center of pressure in the feet follows a distinctive pattern. Moreover, this pattern correlates with gait parameters such as step length. The goal of the current study is to explore the potential of using this pressure pattern to control step length in exoskeletons for paraplegics. The pressure pattern consists of three temporal parameters: the x- and y-coordinates of the center of pressure (CoP X and CoP Y) and the total force acting perpendicular to the sole (Fz). Preliminary experiments were performed, in which three participants traversed a walking track with steps indicated on the floor. Halfway the track step length transitioned from short to long or vice versa. To approximate exoskeleton gait subjects used crutches for balancing while walking. The participants wore sensor shoes that recorded the pressure pattern while they walked. Results indicate that the pressure pattern can be used to distinguish steady state long steps from steady state short steps. This was shown for both an extreme difference in step length, as well as for a moderate difference in step length. Respectively eight and five metrics were identified that showed a likely difference (no overlapping boxes in box plots) between these step groups for all three subjects. Examples of successful metrics include ”peak Fz value” and ”CoP X value at 0% of stance phase”. Only three of these metrics showed a likely difference between steady state steps and the transition step; i.e. it is harder but possible to gather from the pressure pattern, that a transition in step length is taking place. Results did not, however, indicate any potential in predicting an intended change in step length before the actual transition takes place. This makes the potential of controlling step length by manipulating the pressure pattern questionable but not out of the question. Testing with more participants would likely bring more clarity, as well as studying the capabilities of paraplegic exoskeleton users to manipulate the pressure pattern with upper body movements while walking.","pressure pattern; center of pressure; gait; exoskeleton; step length","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | BioMechanical Design","",""

The context of this project is the 2ndSKIN project, which refurbishes houses to become zero energy. Zero energy houses are more airtight as a result of improved insulation, therefore ventilation becomes increasingly important. Yet, residents struggle to integrate the new balanced ventilation system into their practices. Residents use the system different from how it is intended. This does not only impact energy goals (Behar &amp; Chiu, 2013) but can also result in decreased comfort and unhealthy situations. Hence, the aim of the project is to support residents to transition their practices in zero energy homes. The project first described the practice of maintaining indoor air quality to identify points that hinder a transition of the practice. Insights show that the lack of feedback of the ventilation system makes residents insecure and makes it hard to understand the system. Besides, associations that mismatch the new material make residents reluctant to use the balanced ventilation systems. In the concept phase, I generated ideas to improve feedback and foster desirable associations with the ventilation system. Through the iterations, I learned feedback on functioning and on the systems’ activity helps residents. It helps them to trust the system is working, understand what the system is doing and develop appreciation for it. The final concept is the feedback fan. This add-on to ventilation valves spins on the supplied air. In a natural way, it provides residents with feedback. An evaluation proved that with increased feedback, residents are able to incorporate the system in their daily routines and even align their own actions to the systems’ activity. Future steps are to make a solid prototype and develop the service around it. Besides, future design projects can continue on other identified points that hinder the transition of practices. Moreover, insights about feedback of the ventilation system and the practice of maintaining indoor air quality will be valuable, when designing future ventilation systems. In conclusion, both the final design and the insights of the project can contribute to a transition of residents’ practices zero energy homes.","practice-oriented design; ventilation; User Experience; energy transition; Design research; User-centered design; zero energy; Indoor air quality","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","2ndskin",""

In contrast, if the cell experiences temperature variation under light, which is more realistic for outdoor conditions, even after rest in night, the efficiency does not fully recover.

However, as for humans, creating an optimal negotiation strategy is difficult and sticking to the same strategy regardless of the negotiation setting is a bad idea (e.g. cultural differences). In this thesis, we automate the process of strategy configuration for automated negotiation agents to improve negotiation strategies with less human effort. In contrary to past attempts on this topic, the scale of the problem size and the applicability are vastly increased. We also automated the creation of multiple complementary strategies to exploit differences between negotiation settings and pick successful counter strategies. We show that we are capable of finding better strategies through automation and that switching between strategies based on the setting improves negotiation pay-off.","Automated Negotiation; Algorithm Configuration; Algorithm Selection; Opponent Modelling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution); Universiteit Leiden (degree granting institution)","2019","This research aims to provide a method for large-scale commercial electricity consumers to procure towards 100% hourly matched renewable electricity. A problem with the current electricity balancing system is that the energy produced by Variable Renewable Energy sources (VRES), such as wind and solar PV, has a weather-dependent production profile and is thus non-controllable and intermittent. The balance between the total energy demand of the large-scale electricity (LSE) consumer and the production of electricity from VRES in their contract is only based on a yearly scale and not on an hourly scale. At moments when there is little wind, mainly coal &amp; gas- powered plants need to be dispatched to secure uninterrupted power supply. Procurement of renewable energy is realized with the use of Guarantees of origin (GOs). GOs are an instrument that tracks the origin of electricity generated from renewable resources on a yearly basis but does not differentiate in hourly production profile. Therefore, this system will not be able to address the challenge of balancing VRES and demand on an hourly scale. In the future, with the ambition of moving towards substantially higher proportion of RES, the balancing on hourly base is needed to decrease the dependency on the conventional plants as backup. Therefore, with the current setup with yearly tracked RES, companies are limited in their role in the energy transition. This research aims to provide a novel method for large-scale commercial electricity consumers to procure towards 100% hourly matched renewable electricity. In this thesis, a techno-economic analysis was conducted to examine possible hourly-matched renewable energy portfolio for Dutch LSE consumers. First, an analysis was conducted of the production and storage technologies that could potentially be used for the application of hourly matching. Secondly, a methodology was developed to analyse the match between an LSE consumer’s demand and the production profile. The degree to which these profiles are matched was defined as the green score. The higher the green score, the higher the percentage of the demand that is covered by the portfolio on an hourly base. The demand profile is kept consistent, and a comparison is made of scenarios of different portfolios containing production and storage technologies. Third, using a Levelised Cost of Portfolio (LCOP) the cost per MWh for the whole portfolio is compared for different scenario’s. This study shows that the hourly match measured using the percentage green score can be significantly increased by adapting the LSE consumer portfolio, however a 100% hourly match is not shown. Much of the research to date has focused on national-scale scenarios, but only provides limited incentives and insights into the role that large companies can play. This study provides a tool which is suitable to perform a techno-economic analysis to increase the hourly match of LSE consumers using various electricity production and electrical energy storage technologies. The insights found on the impact of different combinations of technologies in a portfolio can be used to understand a further possible role of these companies in the energy transition.","Renewable Energy; Energy Market; Large Scale Electricty Consumers; Guarantees of Origin, Renewable Energy Portfolio; Renewble Energy systems; Energy Storage; Electricity Market; Hourly Matching","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-05-22","","","","Industrial Ecology","",""

Decision making for public transport projects usually involves long term forecasts of travel demand. Future development of factors that influence those forecasts and hence the expected net societal benefits of the investments are uncertain. Decision makers may want to account for uncertainty by incorporating flexibility in project designs, which makes it possible to adapt the project to developments of uncertain factors. Real options theory offers a method to assess the flexibility. While real options analysis is proven to be useful in many sectors involving irreversible, high investments, it has not been applied to the development of urban public transport networks. In this study, the usefulness of real options analysis in the design and evaluation of tram and BRT systems in combination with bike sharing systems is investigated. One of the options to include flexibility is decision tree analysis. This approach, in combination with societal cost benefit analysis, is used in a case study. It was found that flexible investment strategies perform better compared to inflexible ones in every tested scenario, resulting in improved net present values of up to 70 million euros. Nevertheless, both flexible and inflexible investment strategies were economically inefficient in the case studies. The clear difference in outcomes for flexible and non-flexible options that the case showed still indicate that the real options approach results in useful information for decision-making. Recommendations for further research to include flexibility even better are to test the method for cases in which the quality of the current public transport system is lower, include other real options such as delay, include cheaper direct investment options, include more welfare effects, and include other uncertain factors, such as shared mobility and technological development.","real options analysis; urban public transport; public transport investment; decision tree analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Transport, Infrastructure and Logistics","",""

The macrostability assessment and design of the dike is examined for two cases. In the first case the dike is assessed based on the in-situ conditions (Green dike) whereas in the second case a cantilever sheet pile wall is used in the design (Blue dike) to strengthen the dike. Prior to the analysis the interpretation of the available laboratory data that were executed according to the new protocol (WBI 2017) and the parameter determination of the necessary input parameters of the considered constitutive models (SHANSEP NGI-ADP, Hardening Soil, Soft Soil models) is established. The undrained shear strength (su) of the SHANSEP NGI-ADP model is based on the SHANSEP concept and the normalised su (S (NC, OC)) and the strength increase exponent (m) parameters are needed. For the HS and the SS models the effective strength parameters φ and c are required. <br/>The FoS is determined with the use of the strength reduction method. Moreover, the CSSM framework is coupled with the SHANSEP (Stress History and Normalized Soil Engineering Properties) concept enabling the incorporation of the effect of stress history and the stress path characterizing the undrained shear strength in the design. The CSSM framework is applied in the design by determining the strength parameters of clays from an axial strain level equal to 25% under triaxial compression whereas for peats at 40% shear strain level under direct simple shearing conditions. In this study the strength parameters were additionally determined from the service conditions strain levels which are the 2% and 5% strain levels for clays and peats, respectively. The necessary strength parameters for the constitutive models are determined in the considered strain levels exposing their influence for both clays and peats. Moreover, the study includes the examination of the constitutive models at a single element level conducted in the Soil Test facility available in PLAXIS. When it comes to the design analysis, it was found that the SHANSEP NGI-ADP model fits properly the su determined from a cone penetration test. The HS and SS models based on the effective strength parameters may result in an undrained shear strength profile which deviates from the su that the soils exhibits in the field. <br/>The study points out that both the strain level dependency of the strength parameters and the selection of the constitutive model at critical loading influence the results in terms of the developed failure plane and the FoS, especially in the case of Green dikes. The study also elaborates the response of the models in regard to the design requirements for the calculation of displacements and the structural forces. Finally, this study answers the knowledge gap regarding how the strain level influences the strength of the examined soils and how this should be translated in the design along with the explanation on the effects of the selected constitutive model on the results.<br","Macrostability; POVM 2018; Plaxis 2D; SHANSEP NGI-ADP; Hardening Soil; Soft soil; WBI 2017; Blue dike; Green dike","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geo-Engineering","",""

(mentor); Kalkman, R. K. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","In cochlear implantation surgery, the appropriate placement of the electrode array into the cochlea is vital. Suboptimal placement of the electrode array may lead to reduced hearing performance and speech recognition after the surgery. Currently, there are methods to confirm the electrode position post-operatively (e.g. through a CT scan), but it is not possible to monitor the insertion intra-operatively. This, combined with the fact that there is difference in surgical precision and insertion technique between surgeons, leads to great variability in electrode placement and in some cases to electrode malpositioning issues. One of the more problematic issues that may arise is folding of the electrode tip. Folding of the tip causes the electrode array to not reach deep enough into the cochlea, and it is likely to cause trauma due to the increased pressure on cochlear walls and membranes. On top of that, you effectively have “less” contacts to work with because contacts can be positioned very close to eachother due to the folding. Folding of the electrode array also disrupts the tonotopic organization of the cochlear implant (the contacts near the end of the array no longer correspond to the lowest frequencies). The effectivity of the treatment is thus reduced in patients with tip fold-overs. However, many modern day cochlear implants possess telemetry features. These are primarily used to check the implant’s proper functioning, but may also be helpful in monitoring the insertion of the electrode array. The telemetry features of a cochlear implant make it possible to measure the intracochlear electrical potential. The measured current spread is related to the electrode array’s shape and position, and thus may provide a way to detect folding of the tip. This can be done post-operatively, but can possibly also be done intra-operatively to monitor the insertion in real time. This application could be a useful tool to aid surgeons and clinicians. When used post-operatively, it may provide a cost-free method to detect tip fold-over. When used intra-operatively, it may provide a way to detect and prevent both fold-over and trauma to the cochlea.","Cochlear; Implants; Fold-over; Electrode; Array; Tip; Insertion","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

Workforce was pulled away from agriculture industry when bauxite became an important export product which mines got exhausted recently. Nowadays, mining of minerals such as oil and gold is important for the economy of Suriname. The economy is therefore very sensitive for global price fluctuations resulting in instability, raising a relevant question on searching for more sustainable resources fort he economy to built on. Tourism has proven great potentials to contribute to a growth of economic development for countries. Cruise tourism is one of the fastest growing components of the tourism sector and is expected to continue even further. Due to its geographic position, pleasant climate, cultural and ecological attractions, Suriname has great potential to cherry-pick from the benefits of the rising popularity of different cruise tourism markets. The government has the ambition to increase the number of annual tourists by investing in many projects such as the improvement of infrastructure and river dredging, but currently has no sufficient port facilities to accommodate potentials of the growth in cruise passengers. Therefore, the objective of this study is to determine a feasible and socially desirable way to develop a cruise port in Paramaribo. From this study, it is concluded that a cruise port in Paramaribo may be feasible and contribute to a more stable economy in Suriname. The port could be positioned at best near the city centre. It is estimated that the significantly large investment needed to build on shore facilities are not directly earned back from passenger onshore expenditures, but expenditures of cruise operators for on-board provisions and other indirect or induced benefits are very promising. The design is made for a convertible terminal lay-out, which incorporation may add value and contribute to other urban projects increasing the tourism potential for Paramaribo as a whole. The successfulness of this project is dependent on the execution of other urban projects, such as dredging of the Suriname River to be able to include cruise ship handling for ships with deeper draughts, infrastructural improvements to prevent traffic congestion and urban rehabilitation projects to increase attractiveness for cruise passengers and encourage them to revisit Suriname. The willingness from cruise operators and residents, investments and governmental participation is also crucial, in which fund raising and further specification of a project plan timeline and a more detailed analysis of costs estimations are considered as the next step after this research.","Surinam; Paramaribo; Cruise Port; Cruise Tourism; Cruise Terminal; Social Impact; Area Development","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","MDP284","5.832394, -55.158662"

DGS enables sensing of single electron tunneling events in a mesoscopic system by measuring a reflected Radio Frequency (RF) signal from a resonator capacitively coupled to one of the system’s gate electrodes. From the resonator’s perspective, the system is modeled as an effective ‘parametric capacitance’ [3]. Motivated by its viability for qubit readout and control, we measure transport characteristics of a semiconducting-superconducting hybrid charge island system using this method. Doing so, we observe a spin degeneracy modulation of interdot tunnel couplings resulting from hybridization of a dot orbital with a subgap state of the superconductor, measured entirely within Coulomb blockade. Without DC measurement, we also track a subgap state’s energy via voltage intervals between island charge states as a function of field. Subsequently, we attempt to correlate changes in the resonator’s internal dissipation with coherence of tunneling into the superconducting island. In particular, we collapse a superconducting island’s lowest energy state to the Fermi level by applying a magnetic field. Contrary to expectations, internal dissipation in the resonator did not change dramatically with field, in fact decreasing at charge degeneracy points at all field strengths. We corroborate measurements with existing theory, augmented by simple analytical and numerical models demonstrating that coherence factors of superconducting quasiparticle states and the degeneracy of dot orbitals modulate parametric capacitance. A master equation model of finite temperature interdot tunneling is solved, agreeing with experimental evidence that Sisyphus dissipation is negligible when a dot orbital is hybridized with multiple independent quasiparticle states. To be employed in quantum computers, a full understanding of all phenomena contributing to a DGS signal in these hybrid systems is critical. Hence, these results mark a step towards unambiguous readout of Majorana parity in topological qubits [4].","Quantum dots; Nanowire; topology; superconductivity; Reflectometry","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Physics","",""

In this work, we aim to understand which mechanisms select for them in open cultures and how N2O affects cellular metabolism. Two continuously-fed stirred-tank membrane reactors (CSTMR) were run at 20 °C, pH 7 and low dilution rate (0.14 d-1) under either acetate- or N2O-limiting conditions. Denitrifying activity could not be completely washed out from the reactors. Yet, a ten orders of magnitude increase in clade II nosZ gene abundance, often associated with specialists, was found under N2O limitation. Moreover, cultivation under N2O excess resulted in 30-50% lower biomass yields and a 25% higher maintenance coefficient as compared to N2O limitation. Lastly, polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) consistently accumulated (up to 20 wt%) under both acetate and N2O limitation, and the possible biochemical mechanisms are discussed.

This thesis shows that the infrastructure occupation can drop from 84% to 66,7% when implementing ERTMS/ETCS Hybrid Level 3. Reducing the amount of trackside train detection to the minimum and transitioning from track circuits to axle counters can result in a decrease of track unavailability related to train protection systems of over 40% compared to the existing configuration.","Blocking times; Railway Capacity; train protection systems; ERTMS; ETCS; microscopic simulation; signalling systems; case study","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

Stemming from the necessity to quantify and exploit the potential of modern design tools applied to supersonic aircraft design, this work partially fills the gap in previous research by investigating RANS-based aerodynamic<br/>optimization for both supersonic, transonic and subsonic conditions. The investigation is carried out with the state-of-the-art, gradient-based MDO framework \textit{MACH}, developed at University of Michigan's MDO Lab - which hosted the author for the 14-month research stint. Details of the tool and a brief overview of supersonic aircraft design and modern aerodynamic optimization strategies are reported in the first part of this manuscript.<br/>After circumscribing the research niche, I perform single and multi-point optimization to minimize the drag over an ideal supersonic aircraft flight envelope and assess the influence of physical and numerical parameters on optimization accuracy and reliability. Leading and trailing edge morphing capabilities are introduced to improve the efficiency at transonic and subsonic flight speed by relaxing the trade-offs on clean shape optimization. Benefits in terms of drag reduction are quantified and benchmarked with fixed-edges results. It is observed how the optimized airfoils outperform baseline reference shapes from a minimum of 4\% up to 86\% for different design cases and flight<br/>conditions. The study is then extended to the optimization of a planar, low-aspect-ratio, and low-sweep wing, using the same schematic approach of 2D analysis. I investigate the influence of wing twist alone and twist and shape on cruise performance, obtaining a drag reduction of 6\% and 25\% respectively as the optimizer copes with both viscosity and compressibility effects over the wing. Results for 3D multi-point optimization suggest that the proposed strategy enables a fast and effective design of highly-efficient wings, with drag reduction ranging from a minimum of 24\% up to 74\% for cruise at different speeds and altitudes, including edge deflection. Ultimately, this work provides an extensive and, to the best of author knowledge, unprecedented insight on the optimal design solutions for this specific aircraft configuration and the challenges of the optimization framework. The benefits of RANS-based aerodynamic shape optimization to capture non-intuitive design trade-offs and offer deeper physical insight are ultimately discussed and quantified.

Undirected phylogenetic networks can be oriented to become a directed network. In this manuscript the authors come up with multiple algorithms for orienting phylogenetic networks meeting different characteristics. A network is built up of reticulation vertices (where lineages merge) and tree vertices (where lineages separate). A network can be binary, meaning every node in the body of the network has a degree of three or a network can be non-binary, meaning there are no restrictions to the amount of edges a vertex can have. <br/>When a network is binary, an algorithm is described that given the location of the root as well as a set of reticulation points, is used to find an orientation (Algorithm 1). If a network is non-binary, an algorithm is described that given a location of the root as well as the indegree of each vertex, is used to find an orientation (Algorithm 2 ). Once an orientation is found for a certain undirected network this orientation can be checked to see whether it meets the characteristics of a certain network class. Three network classes are considered. First of all an orientation can be tree-child, meaning that every non-leaf vertex has a child that is not a reticulation. Secondly an orientation can be stack-free, meaning that no reticulation has a child which is a reticulation. And last, an orientation can be valid, meaning that it is stack-free and deleting a single reticulation edge and suppressing its endpoints does not give parallel arcs. When we either did not find an orientation in the class we wanted or want to know all the orientations for a certain network in a certain class, we use Algorithm 3 or 4. The location of the root and the set of reticulation points were necessary input for Algorithm 1; whereas Algorithms 3 and 4 do not require this information. Algorithm 3 returns you the first found orientation in the class you wanted and Algorithm 4 returns you a collection of all orientations in the class. All orientations found by the program are returned in an output format that can be read by a network visualisation website.","Optimization; Phylogenetic network; Orientation model","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics | Optimization","",""

Difficulties within the collaborative relationship are likely to arise for example due to culture or language differences, but also factors such as how to communicate and exchanging information are considered to be influential on collaboration. In other words, all these organisation have their own (unique) organisational structure that encompasses the way how the organisation provides relief. This research illustrates that the presence of different organisational structures do have an effect on the relief effectiveness in areas with a high risk of natural disasters. This effect can be positive due to the diversity of different organisational structures. This diversity also includes a diversity in strengths that makes it possible for this chain of organisations to cope with changing and complex environments. However, problems within communication and information exchange between the organisations can lead to mistrust which effects the collaboration and therefore a negative performance of providing relief could occurred.

The music industry has always been capricious. However, the densely dispersed Dutch pop venue landscape is being faced with a contemporary challenge. A lot of Dutch pop venues are balancing between the public and private sector, have a big heritage weighing down on their shoulders, have complex business models with various stakeholders stuck in their silos and often lack a coherent vision. The world around them however is changing fast and vastly. The digitalization of the music industry has shifted medium sized artists’ reason for performing from creating awareness for an upcoming album to their main source of income. Resulting in a more demanding artist and less power for the pop venues. For pop venues to succeed, they either have to be the biggest or the most specialized. The Effenaar at this point is neither of those two. Based on these challenges the following research question is formulated: “How can a Dutch pop music venue, in a co-creative manner, ready itself for and position itself within the vastly changing pop music industry of 2028? – a case study of the Effenaar, Eindhoven.” A 2028 worldview was created by using the ViP method. Conducting research and interviewing key stakeholders resulted in numerous context factors. These context factors created a storyline from which three main consequences for the Effenaar could be concluded. The disconnection between artist and audience in combination with visitor’s increasing demand for multi-sensory stimulating and layered experience results in the first consequence for the Effenaar; ‘Artists need help connecting to their audience’. Secondly, the digitalization of pop culture will be almost fully completed in 2028. This presents a whole range of new pop culture artists. The online realm possesses a vast array of new pop stars. These new groups could benefit from a medium sized offline stage in Eindhoven. This resulted in the second consequence; ‘Music no longer the main relevant form of artistry in pop culture’. Finally, the digitalization of pop culture results in another consequence. Online available data will put the control in the hands of the artists. Due to qualitative and quantitative data of their followers, artist can among other things decide at which pop venue or festival they want to perform. This results in the last consequence; ‘Artists decide if the Effenaar is suitable. In-house bookers will become obsolete’. Through the narration of short stories, the worldview, its consequences on the Effenaar and a glimpse into a possible reaction are illustrated. These stories depict the consequences of the 2028 future on the Effenaar, its artists and visitors. Three main ingredients are formulated for the Effenaar to respond on the 2028 worldview. This thesis proposes that the Effenaar embraces its physicality, shifts their focus from solely musical artists to the broader spectrum of digitalized pop culture and introduces a digital platform for the instigation of multi-layered collaborative experiences. These collaborations are between 2028’s pop culture and the regions technological artistry. Capitalizing on the Effenaar’s position within the Brainport region. This thesis proposes that the Effenaar takes certain steps in order to become a less rigid platform by including new forms of pop culture stars and by creating an online platform. It consequently suggests that without ignoring the inevitable digitalization of pop culture the Effenaar should embrace its physicality instead of aspiring to become another tree within the vast digitalized forest.","Pop Culture; Vision in Product; Effenaar; Future Relevance","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

These frost events occur during clear-sky, low-wind nights in which a thermal inversion builds up from the surface. The machines work by mixing and transporting warm air from aloft downward which consequently erodes the thermal inversion. Various studies have been conducted regarding this frost protection method, which have resulted in empirical regression models that relate affected area and temperature enhancement (i.e. the performance) with inversion strength. In this study, we assessed heightdependent temperature responses and the sensitivity of wind machine performance to various physical processes. Both of which have not been studied thoroughly in earlier works. In this regard, a large field experiment was conducted and experimental analysis was augmented with sensitivity studies using turbulent resolving Large Eddy Simulations (LES). Experimental observations showed that the temperature response strongly depends on the radial distance to the fan and the height above the surface. In agreement with previous studies, the wind machine was able to achieve rotation-averaged temperature increases of up to 50% of the inversion strength (≈3 K) in an area of 3-5 ha at 1 m height. Furthermore, it was observed that low-speed ambient winds (&lt;1 m/s) can cause strong upwind-downwind asymmetries in the protected area, the downwind area being larger. The LES model, inspired by the field experiment, showed similar spatial temperature responses as compared to observations. Sensitivity studies using a simpli_ed case showed that the a_ected area strongly increased for slower axial rotation times (ranging from 3 to 6 min) while the temperature enhancement stayed relatively constant. Furthermore, variation of the horizontal tilt angle showed that, in our model, temperature enhancement was maximized between 8º and 16º. Presumably, those angles, corresponding to near horizontal ow, are very effective in generating strong shear layers which in turn generate Kelvin-Helmholtz like instabilities. These processes increase mixing and vertical transport of heat. Finally, analysis on the ambient wind showed that, in agreement with observations, strong upwind-downwind asymmetries in the affected area exist.","Frost protection; Fruit forst; Wind machine; Inversion; Agriculture; CFD; large-eddy simulation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-07-01","","","","","",""

It is not always clear beforehand what type of contract a client should choose for his project. The goal of this study is to solve this problem by advising clients which type of contract to use for moveable bridge projects. Therefore, the following research question will be answered: How does the model look like that predicts which type of contract is best for a moveable bridge project? In order to answer this question, literature is studied and interviews are conducted to show which parameters and characteristics are of influence for this contract decision. This information is used to set up an initial model which advises what type of contract to use. This initial model is verified with the use of case projects in order to get the final model. Due to the wide range of building projects, this master thesis is focused on moveable bridges in the Netherlands only. Moveable bridges are multidisciplinary projects which makes the decision for a specific type of contract ambiguous. Making it the a perfect type of project to test the model. The literature and interviews highlighted eleven criteria that are of influence for the types of contracts incorporated in the model. The contract types that are included in this model are: RAW-bestek, Design &amp; Build, Design, Build &amp; Maintain and Turnkey. The decision to incorporate these four contract types is based on the fact to include traditional and integrated contracts. RAW-bestek is the traditional contract type that is common to use for moveable bridges in the Netherlands. The choice for an integrated contract form for moveable bridges is bigger. Therefore, integrated contracts with different ranges of integration are included. Starting with Design &amp; Build as a conventional integrated contract form followed by Design, Build &amp; Maintain as a more integrated contract form and Turnkey as totally integrated contract form. This initial model is verified with the use of four moveable bridge cases. For three of the case projects the model advised well. These projects went according plan and the advice from the model matched the contract that was actually used or the model highlighted the main headings for which the different incorporated contracts match the actually used contract. For example, case A used the contract type Engineer &amp; Construct, this type of contract is not included in the model. The initial model showed exactly on which statements the Design, Build &amp; Maintain contract and the RAW-bestek scored well for this case project. The statements on which they scored well are exactly the items for which an Engineer &amp; Construct type of contract would be suited. If Engineer &amp; Construct as a contract type would have been incorporated in the model, it would most likely be advised by the model. The verification of case B was not a match between the used type of contract and the advice from the initial model. The project did not went according to plan, but the advised type of contract would probably not have improved the situation. Several improvements are suggested based on comparison between this case and the other case projects. It is concluded that the model is functioning, based on the cases. However, it is recommended to extend the model with more types of contracts, such as the contract type Design &amp; Construct, Engineer &amp; Construct and Bouwteam. The second recommendation comes from the ambiguity concerning the benchmark score for the criterion complexity. The positive correlation between complexity and flexibility was stated in literature, meaning that when the complexity of the project increases the need for more flexibility also increases. However, other literature contradicted this; it was unclear which viewpoint should be preferred. Therefore, the decision was made to adopt the positive correlation for the initial model. After verifying this initial model, the benchmark scores for complexity were adjusted in order to be in line with the other literature. The advice from the initial model and the initial model adjusted for complexity were compared. However, based on this comparison no firm conclusion can be made about which viewpoint is preferred over the other concerning complexity. Therefore, it is recommended to further verify the model for the criterion of complexity. Furthermore, it is recommended to verify this model with more moveable bridges and cases for other types of projects in order to increase the validity, usability and applicability of the model.","Procurement; contracting; integrated contracts; contract model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Having a phantom model has a great beneficial value for numerous reasons. Phantoms are, among others, used in research centres, to validate new equipment, to develop biomechanical models or to test new treatment methods. They are representations of organs or tissues made from tissues that mimicking the desired properties of the organ. This thesis research is performed in collaboration with Philips Healthcare research department. They benefit from having a brain phantom for the development of a new endoscopic tool that incorporates virtual reality images in the view. Existing phantoms are usually expensive and are not meant for destruction by needle interventions or endoscopic interventions, or are a very rough representation of reality. For this study, it was the aim to develop an anthropomorphic brain phantom containing the hollow space of the ventricles of the brain, with the correct mechanical and optical characteristics. From a digital 3D mesh brain, moulds were made to assess different ways to produce a brain phantom with ventricles. From literature, the tissue mimicking material (TMM) PVA was selected to use for the production of the phantom. After evaluation of the different approaches to fabricate a phantom, it was decided to produce the hollow spaces of the ventricles by using 3D printed soluble PVA, to be removed out of the model after casting. This was done by 3D printing a brain mould in which a 3D printed PVA ventricle could be inserted. A solution of 6% PVA as tissue mimicking material was used. After the mould and production principle of the model was finalized, the imaging part was assessed. In order for the phantom to be used in CT imaging, barium sulphate was added to the PVA solution as a contrast enhancing material. Two phantoms were made with 1% and 2% barium sulphate. Finally, to assess the shape and the quality of the ventricles in the phantom, the phantom was scanned with a CT scan at Philips Healthcare in Best, the Netherlands. The CT files were evaluated using RadiAnt and 3D slicer to assess the ventricular shape and position. 3D slicer was also used to segment the ventricle shape out of the designed models to compare with the originally developed ventricle structure. This study functions as a proof of concept for the development of a PVA brain phantom containing ventricles produced with 3D printed soluble PVA. All in all, the overall evaluation of the prototypes have shown to be promising models for the development of a brain phantom using PVA and ‘homemade’ fabrication techniques. The use of 3D printed soluble PVA is a novelty in this field of application. It makes the design easy to develop and easily adjusted to patient-specific cases as personalized models can be made.","Brain; Phantom; Ventricle; PVA","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-05-17","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

In light of this, an extensive study was conducted at the Ministry of Education, Culture and Science. This study entailed an ethnographic study of nine months during which six policymaking cases were studied as well as a four month experimental study was conducted. The six policymaking cases served to identify an opportunity to enhance policymaking with design, whereas the experimental study served to further investigate this opportunity. Based on these endeavours, and in light of the identified opportunity a design intervention was developed and evaluated. <br/>The six policymaking cases were studied from the perspective of balancing exploration and exploitation through methodological congruence; policymaking practices need to appropriately balance between utilizing existing knowledge and means - exploitation - and generating new knowledge and means - exploration - according to the determinacy of the problem at hand. However, it was found that policymaking predominantly possesses exploitative traits and, more specifically, is remarkably non-experimental. As such, it was argued that current policymaking practices may best be enhanced with experimentation throughout the policymaking process. In light of this, it was found that the systematic, deliberate way designers experiment may be helpful in policymaking as well. As opposed to policymaking, in which an experiment is typically the final piece of the problemsolving process, in design, several ‘safe to fail’ experiments serve as points of departure, initiating a progressive iterative process of working towards a solution. As such, it was found worthwhile to find a way to apply this particular way of experimenting in policymaking as well. However, this particular way of experimenting does necessitate a particular disposition that is not found in policymaking in which ideas are nipped in the bud, taking decisions is postponed, intended solutions and measures are kept abstract, there is hardly any room for intuition and making mistakes, and learning and having to change course are seen as politically risky. Hence, it was argued that the context and dynamics required for this way of experimenting may only be found outside of the political system; ‘safe to fail’ experiments may be conducted most effectively and efficiently by policy implementers themselves - that are given sufficient discretion - rather than policymakers. In order to see how this can be done, the abovementioned experimental study was conducted. This study clearly showed that these ‘safe to fail’ experiments cannot simply be delegated; it requires taking into account the commitment, capacity and capability of policy implementers to conduct ‘safe to fail’ experiments and responding accordingly. <br/>In order to enable policymakers to do so, guidelines were developed and tested. Although the guidelines do not directly help in making policies in a more experimental manner, they do help minimize the risk associated with experiments, increase the chances of successful execution and contribute to the process of having policy implementers conduct ‘safe to fail’ experiments As such, they may help smooth the way towards making policies in a more experimental manner.","Experimentation; Prototyping; Design methodology; Societal Impact; Policy Development; Problemsolving","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

In this thesis, the possibilities for museums as inspiration for fashion retail are explored on a strategic level.

Reputation is defined as the emotional bond between a company and its customers. Based on insights he following interpretation is established. Reputation is built through experience and trust. By delivering the expected customer experience a trustworthy relationship is developed, resulting in a high reputation. This reputation is maintained when expectations are exceeded, by providing unexpected elements and room for serendipity in explorative retail spaces. Based on an online customer research, performed in context, two reasons for the reputation gap between retail and museums in Rotterdam can be described: museums meet the expected customer experience and museums have a bigger impact on society. This impact is related to their contribution to heritage, education and entertainment. Therefore, applying a purpose-driven strategy. Defining purpose as the fundamental reason for existence. Inspired by museums, retailers are able to increase reputation and create a meaningful customer experience by adopting a purpose-driven mindset. Even though a purpose itself does not change, it encourages change by setting an unreachable goal. Striving to reach this goal, retailers need to make decisions guided by their purpose. Not only does purpose create the foundation for a trustworthy customer relationship, it also increases internal alignment and motivates employees. As a result, the Purpose Paradigm is introduced. A strategic model that identifies the steps towards implementing a purpose-driven mindset in retailers. Aiming at behavioural change inside the company that leads to employee engagement and facilitates decision-making. In return, creating a genuine and meaningful customer experience. Being purpose-driven is a long-term and sustainable approach for retailers reacting to the changing retail environment. The implementation of the Purpose Paradigm for a fashion retailer is illustrated in a fictional case. ","Retail; Museums; Purpose-driven; Strategic model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

Four validation runs and six simulations to map the sensitivity are compared with data from two physical experiments conducted in the Delta Flume. The comparison proved the correct working of the model. Then, another 16 simulations with the cobble revetment featuring a variety of porosity, thickness and shape have been completed. The model results show interesting relations when compared with each other. The idea is that a part of the volume of the overtopping wave run-up tongue is sinking into the pores of the cobble revetment and does not overtop. The wave overtopping volume is thus reduced by the total volume of the pores that can be infiltrated over a cycle of a wave. This relation is best captured in a new dimensionless quantity proposed by the author, called the relative pore volume number: n * Rc * sqrt (1+cot^2 (alpha) \ ( Tc/ Hm0^2 ) which accounts for the total accessible pore volume above the waterline. The relative pore volume number has an logarithmic relationship with the dimensionless overtopping rate q / (g*Hm0^3)^0.5 for the parameter space considered in this research. The volume of pores per area above the mean water level is thus related to a reduction in overtopping volumes. The influence factor for roughness of the general formula for predicting the mean overtopping discharge on a slope in EurOtop 2018 by is modified by comparing a fit through the reference curve of all the numerical and physical experiments. The roughness factor can now be predicted as a function of the relative pore volume per area.","OpenFOAM; Overtopping; OceanWave3D; Sand; cobble; Maasvlakte 2; Coastal defense; dynamic rock slope; dynamic breakwater; Sand-cobble interaction; Porosity; Infiltration; Delta Flume; cobble revetment; Roughness factor","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-05-16","","","","Civil Engineering","Maasvlakte 2",""

And if there’s no space to expand on land, why not create land in the sea? That is exactly what The Netherlands did by creating Maasvlakte 2. The construction of Maasvlakte 2 started in 2008 and was officially completed on May 22nd , 2013. This research focused on the morphodynamics in the domain between the cube reef and cobble beach at the hard flood defence, which is named ""the lagoon"". Over the past 5 years a large sand volume propagated into the lagoon. The current sand volume (after 5 years) in the given domain is about four times larger than the predicted value by PUMA. The processes behind the sand layer formation were not fully understood.<br/>This research started by creating a conceptual model with all processes that could contribute to the formation of the sand layer. All processes are divided into hydrodynamic or aeolian transport, whereby hydrodynamic transport is divided into overtopping over the cube reef and transport through the cube reef due to tidal currents. We performed field experiments at Maasvlakte 2 to measure the flow velocity in the lagoon and to measure the aeolian transport capacity. From a sediment budget analysis we observed a sand layer increase during winter periods. This increase is justified with the fact that sand transport towards the lagoon depends on extreme events, which happen mostly during winter periods. Based on the estimated transport volumes we concluded that the main mechanisms that contribute in the formation of the sand layer are overtopping over the cube reef and aeolian transport, whereby overtopping is the largest mechanism. Our estimates indicate a total maximum sand layer volume of 51,000m3 (whereby transport by overtopping = 25,000m3, tidal currents = 8,700m3 and aeolian transport = 17,300m3). Which leaves 20,000m3 of sand unaccounted for compared with our estimated 71,000 m3 volume of sand in the lagoon. The accuracy of each calculation is analysed in order to explain the missing volume compared with the total sand layer volume. Based on this analysis we concluded that only the uncertainty in the overtopping calculation can explain the missing volume of 20,000m3. High wind speeds and high waves will cause for sand transport towards the lagoon. Aeolian transport will always happen if there is a supply of granular material and atmospheric winds of sufficient strength. Moreover, the source for aeolian and hydrodynamic transport is the, southern located, soft protection. Since nourishments are necessary to secure the safety of the soft protection, the supply of sediment will remain. Sand is transported in northern direction along the hard protection by longshore transport. Currently, the water depth northwards of KP2700 is too deep to stir the sediment up and transport it into the lagoon by overtopping. Depending on the foreshore migration in the northern direction, the sand layer will also increase in northern direction.","Conceptual model; Overtopping; Aeolian transport; Sand transport; Cobble beach; Maasvlakte 2; Coastal defense; Cube reef; Transition zone","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-05-16","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","Maasvlakte 2","51.987801, 4.006424"

The literature pays little attention to the traffic flow efficiency effects. Although some literature introduce some of these traffic flow efficiency effects, no detailed research has been done. This Additional Graduation Work contributes to this knowledge gap by introducing the potential traffic flow efficiency effects of permitted conflicts. In a simulation study, in which the gap acceptance behaviour of the simulation model Vissim is briefly tested, it is found that permitted conflicts (i) reduce the cycle time, (ii) reduce the queue length, and (iii) reduce the delay experienced by various road users at the signalised intersection. However, this comes at the cost of reduced saturation flow. Also, it is hypothesised that there is some turning point in terms of traffic flow volumes, and the distribution of volumes per approach at which the traffic flow efficiency effects become negative. This relates to the various traffic safety conditions that must be met at the signalised intersection with permitted conflicts as well, to ensure a safe conflict handling, which include that the traffic flow volumes may not be too large. Nonetheless, the traffic flow efficiency effects, in terms of intersection throughput and capacity, queues, and travel times and delays, of implementing permitted conflicts, as opposed to implementing protected conflicts on signalised intersections, are positive, in that sense that it resulted in shorter cycle times, less delay, and shorter queues on average. For signal groups with priority, the number of stops also decreased. Although there is a risk of oversaturation, the overall conclusion is that the traffic flow inefficiency effects are positive on average. In short, this comes down to that fewer protected conflicts, equals a higher traffic safety risk, but also a more efficient traffic flow, on average, hence the title of this research.","Traffic Signal Control; Traffic Flow Efficiency; Permitted Conflicts; Protected Conflicts","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Transport and Planning","",""

Everyday items can be a result of crystallization, e.g. snowflakes being formed in cold weather and sugar that is obtained from glucose-water solutions. Crystallization follows from the process which is called nucleation. This phenomenon is explained in two different theories: classical nucleation theory and two-step nucleation theory. Also, two different ways of crystallization can be distinguished: heterogeneous nucleation, which is nucleation that evolves from external surfaces and homogeneous nucleation, which obviously evolves without the help of external surfaces. Methods to perform crystallization, based on aforementioned mechanisms, are useful for production scale facilities as it is a very useful method to separate chemicals in manufacturing processes. However, large scale crystallization processes are known to be hard to control and energy intensive, something that does not fit into today’s society. To keep up with the global demand for sustainable production novel crystallization methods need to be established. A promising finding, 20 years ago, consisted of laser-induced nucleation. By means of a laser, Garetz et al.[1] were able to induce crystallization, calling it non-photochemical laser induced nucleation (NPLIN). Up to this date, it is not known what mechanisms underlie the observed behavior. Because the phenomenon was only observed at the milliliter range, it is important to understand the mechanisms before further upscaling can be done. Over the course of the last decade, 4 mechanisms have been proposed: Optical Kerr effect, Isotropic electronic polarization, nano-impurities, and shockwaves. During the discovery of NPLIN, it was found that the wavelengths and power intensity were incapable of creating a photochemical effect on the compound used. For this reason, the LIN was ascribed to nonphotochemical behavior. In this research, more detail is provided on this presumed non-photochemical effect. An experimental build is established to perform multiple experiments for detecting radicals and obtain consensus on the attributed name. Initial tests revealed that there is no particular interaction between the solute and laser electric field. Throughout the research, several factors were found to play a role in observed NPLIN behavior. Over the course of this project, glycine samples started to turn yellow due to the degradation of glycine. pH was found to be an important factor for polymorphic control, however, it was constant for all samples since glycine acted as a buffering agent. Future research with new chemicals should keep track of the pH together with polymorphism. Glass geometries tests showed that container curvatures are affecting the polarization of the laser and thus the outcomes for polymorphic structures. At last, the effect of impurities on NPLIN was elaborated. Doping samples intentionally with nanoimpurities resulted in higher crystallization probabilities. On the other hand, reducing the impurity levels also decreased the nucleation probability. It is concluded that impurities are highly correlated to nucleation performance. Moreover, the laser-interaction volume is also affecting the nucleation probability in significant amounts. Supplementary research is required to obtain a set of operating parameters that have an effect on NPLIN behavior. With such a model, NPLIN can be controlled and a state of the art production scale laser induced nucleation unit becomes the new standard.","NPLIN; Non Photochemical Laser Induced Nucleation; Crystallization; Glycine; laser","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Chemical Engineering","Non Photochemical Laser Induced Nucleation",""

In 2017, their separation rate was only 28,4%. Household waste separation is important to enable the recycling of resources. For high-rise buildings, the challenge is the biggest: high-rise buildings produce an average of 150 kg more residual waste per year compared to low-rise buildings. The City of Rotterdam’s plans to build more high-rise buildings in the coming years makes it urgent to look for a solution. Separation at the source currently is more effective than mechanical post-consumer separation. However, the success of separation at the source depends entirely on the waste separation behaviour of high-rise residents. Therefore the main research question is: <i>How to facilitate for high-rise residents the desired behaviour of waste separation at household level, in high-rise buildings?</i><br/>From human behaviour theory, behaviour can be explained as a combination of one’s motivation, ability, and opportunity. When one’s motivation is low, a low ability needs to be sufficient to trigger action. A change of environment can support a behaviour change. The many influencing factors for waste separation found in literature show the complexity of the behaviour. The factors are supported and complemented by interviews and generative research. <br/>Understanding high-rise residents’ mindset towards household waste separation, reveals four different groups of people: the Enthusiasts, the Potentials, the Skeptics and the Conservatives. The Potentials are closest to following the Enthusiasts in practising waste separation. However, they currently lack a (physical and mental) system for doing so. When considering starting this behaviour, the required effort for creating a system outweighs their medium level of motivation. The proposed solution is <i>Schone start</i>. <i>Schone start</i> supports high-rise residents with the creation of a waste separation habit in the first month after moving, by providing the means to set-up a system for waste separation. The mail delivery package contains a Waste guide, Waste map, small waste bin, medium waste bag, large waste box, stickers and suggestions for use. All essential information to start waste separation is actively provided and in accordance with the circular ambitions of the City of Rotterdam. <i>Schone start</i> is evaluated with six recently moved high-rise residents in Rotterdam. Generally <i>Schone start</i> is positively evaluated by the test participants regarding helpfulness with household waste separation. The Waste guide and Waste map were highly appreciated. The waste facilities were partially used, but can be optimised. The ease of disposal of the separated waste stays a critical boundary condition.<br/>To implement <i>Schone start</i>, its design should be optimised for appearance and size to maximise the percentage of citizens making use of the product. It is recommended to evaluate the long-term quantitative effect (the household waste separation rate) and qualitative effect (awareness of the household waste separation practice) of <i>Schone start</i> in a large scale pilot over six months. In this way, more insights can be gained regarding the potential impact of <i>Schone start</i> for different target groups and contexts.<br","Household waste; Waste separation; Behaviour change; High-rise buildings; Behaviour; Behavioural change","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

However, these are not standardized solutions but all one of a kind systems designed for a speciﬁc vessel or ﬂeet. Which of these is the best solution is not easy to determine and strongly depends on the vessel characteristics and the operating environment. To supply the expected increasing demand for electric vessels, a guideline is developed which will help the engineer to ﬁnd a suitable charging and mooring mechanism and to decrease the selection time for this system. The will provide Damen a strategic advantage towards other shipyards in vessel tenders since both the development costs and delivery time is lower.<br/>This guideline is developed based on the knowledge gained during a case study for a 81m Ropax ferry, sailing in the surroundings of Vancouver Island. For the case study an engineering design method was selected from literature and applied to this case, for which Damen had a hard time ﬁnding a charging and mooring mechanism. First thought was to combine both into one mechanism, but this is difﬁcult due to conﬂicting functionalities of both systems. Due to the limited time available for the research, the design of the mooring mechanism is not taken into account for the case study. Setting the requirements for the charging mechanism is complex due to the range of different ﬁelds of interest that should be taken into account. However, the requirements of these various aspects are often related in some way to one another. This makes it easy to lose sight of the structure of all requirements. Comparing the functions that the charging mechanism should fulﬁll within these requirements and the existing charging mechanisms, it can be concluded that no suitable system is available yet. The gap between these is deﬁned as a set of three functions; to compensate the tidal difference, deal with misalignments between the vessel and the shore and to provide ﬂexibility for vessel motions. A new design was made which covers this gap. Additional research was done to ensure sufﬁcient ﬂexibility from the power cable, since this proved to be critical in the state of the art systems.<br/>From the knowledge gained during this case study, the guideline is developed. The guideline provides insight in the inﬂuential factors while selecting an mechanism. This should offer the engineer a structure to set the requirements and ensures that no aspect is left out of the requirements. An overview with the already existing mechanisms is provided which should be consulted multiple times during the process, to check whether a suitable systems exist, if the requirements should are too tight or if the project is not proﬁtable at all. The structure of the requirements is designed such, that the relative easy requirements are set ﬁrst. This prevents from doing demanding calculations or going on expensive business trips, while it could have been seen earlier that a project is not feasible or proﬁtable at least. The guideline is validated while selecting a charging mechanism for a different type of vessel. This validation proved to decrease the selection time for a charging mechanism signiﬁcantly compared to previous projects within Damen. After the test, a charging system was found which is preferred for the vessel. This charger is now further discussed with the supplier of the system.<br","Electric ships; Charging Station; mooring system; Guideline; Ferry","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-12-31","","","","Marine Technology | Transport Engineering and Logistics","",""

The core part of this method is expressed as the risk-based approach, which considers the flood risk from the aspects of the probability and the consequence. Different climate and socio-economic scenarios are developed to represent the uncertain environment for policymaking resulting from long-term changes. An urban water balance model is applied to produce the novel empirical performance indicator for the effectiveness of adaptation measures as the critical input to this assessment. Sell-by dates of adaptation actions<br/>are computed based on the assumption that, once a policy action reaches the perspective-based socially acceptable risk, it is said to encounter an adaptation tipping point thus requiring additional interventions. With the computed sell-by dates, the adaptation pathways maps are assembled under certain rules that exclude illogical sequences. Robust adaptation pathways that can succeed over various future scenarios are outlined from the pool of pathways. The developed adaptation pathways map provides the policymakers with a range of possible options.

Using WiFi signals as the technology to compute the position of the target device is one of the most extended and researched techniques. WiFi Access Points are extensively deployed in all indoor environments where WiFi indoor localization has a potential application. Several of these indoor localization techniques use the Received Signal Strength (RSS) to compute the location of the device. However, the accuracy of the methods that use this parameter is usually low, in the meter range. Eight years ago, the new advances in wireless communications allowed to retrieve the phase of an incoming signal from a commercial chipset, and not only its strength. With the phase, we can use the physical and mathematical principles of signal transmission to compute the distance to a device. In the long term, it can contribute to having a more robust and long-lasting method to perform indoor localization if we can overcome the challenge of obtaining a delay-free phase measurement. For indoor distances, a small delay in the time estimation can be translated into a significant error in the ranging result. In this work, we re-implement the ranging technique of the paper Chronos: Decimeter-Level Localization with a Single WiFi Access Point. This well-known research work explains how to obtain an accurate phase measurement from a WiFi chipset and the technique to compute the distance to the target. We provide a guide of the installation and implementation of the hardware and software required for a system like this, indicating the critical points to allow future researchers a quick set up of the equipment. We revisit the procedure of Chronos to obtain a delay-free phase measurement and show how to re-implement it from scratch. Finally, we perform a validation of the system in four different steps, from the use of ideal data to progressively introducing the real distortions of indoor wireless data. The evaluation of the performance of the system leads us to present the finding of a non-linear delay that can produce significant distance errors.","WiFi; Indoor Localization; Channel State Information; CSI; Phase","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Embedded Systems","",""

Model results for spatially uniform and non-uniform currents showed that the evolution of the wave height over the domain was approximately constant. Validation results of the vertical structure of the flow were in general poor except at the boundary. However, the model is capable of producing qualitatively the same trends as observed in measurements of the horizontal structure of the flow.

This master graduation project deals with the reproducibility of ship propulsion system model by different computer simulation tools. The MATLAB/Simulink model will be provided by Maritime Technology (MT) Department. The target is investigating and assessing the reproducibility of the ship propulsion model in python.<br/>During the pre-study, the stiff problem occurs due to many differential equations in the ship propulsion system. So, the initial python model could use the wrong method to solve the stiff problem and the initial python model cannot use variable time step to simulate the model. Even if the model cannot reproduce some experiments. The project should find a new reproducibility assessment method in python.<br/>The new reproducibility assessment method is first to analyze the model. This step can help us to know whether the simulation model is a stiff system or not. The report introduces a time-step test method for the stiff system with physical verification. At present, there is no exact definition of the stiff system. This method tries to find an effective way to test the stiff system.<br/>Next, introduce two Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) solver methods. One is the explicit method; the other is the implicit method. Previously, published research has found that the implicit method can solve the stiff problem effectively. Therefore, the ODE solver is the key to the propulsion system model.<br/>Finally, the python modelling method needs to be improved, because the initial version model in python only uses fixed-time step. The new modelling method can apply a variable time step for the propulsion model. It will help to test the stiff system and save more computation resource.<br/>Once the new python model is finished, by comparing these two methods in MATLAB/Simulink and python, the plot presents the simulation result which is accurate and close to the reference result. The verification use Mean Squared Error (MSE) to indicate the reproducibility result. Each sample point of the two simulation tools is compared. The error plot will present what the difference between the python model with MATLAB/Simulink model. If the MSE value is close to zero, the reproducibility result will be successful.<br/>Finally, this graduation project gives the solution for the reproducibility assessment method in python.

The effects of passive flaps on two dimensional airfoils have therefore been studied extensively, however, research on their application to Horizontal axis wind turbine blades (HAWT) is lacking and scarce. This research is a part of ongoing efforts at the Delft University of Technology to fill this missing gap. The blade of a HAWT is generally divided into three different regions for aerodynamic analyses. The region closest to the rotational axis is defined as the root region (r/R=0 - 0.3) . This region experiences the lowest rotational speeds and requires higher structural strength, resulting in a thick airfoil section. Although this section does not contribute significantly to the power generation of the whole turbine, the flow from this region does however effect the performance of the rest of the blade. Improving the aerodynamic flow characteristics of this region, therefore increases the performance of the whole turbine. For this research, passive (i.e. stationary) flaps were considered to enhance the flow at the root region and experimental analyses carried out at the Open Jet Facility (OJF) wind tunnel of TU Delft. An LM388 wind turbine blade (of Nordex N80 wind turbines) was used as a reference to create a scaled blade. The Analyses consisted of load (power and thrust) measurements and calculations for various flap configurations on a scaled wind turbine model.

Heavy equipment, large cutting forces, high wear rates and large amounts of required energy are common challenges when cutting rock. Traditionally, rock cutting is based on a linear motion of the cutting tool. However, a significant improvement on the cutting performance is expected when using non-linear cutting techniques. Non-linear cutting can be achieved by using an actuator to create a vibrating or oscillating motion on top of the linear forward motion of the cutting tool. The focus in this paper is on the oscillating undercutting disc cutter. This disc attacks the rock like a chisel or pickpoint, aiming at a cutting process dominated by tensile failures. Although the discrete element method has been successfully used for various rock cutting processes, all these processes are based on linear rock cutting tools and most of these researches are based on 2D simulations. The use of a 3D approach is necessary to enable the simulation of oscillatory rock cutting tools. This paper utilizes discrete element method in 3D to investigate non-linear cutting processes, especially the effects of the design parameters such as frequency, velocity and eccentricity of the cutting tool. To resemble rock-like materials the particles are placed in a dense particle assembly and they are bonded together through perfect brittle elastic bonds. The bonds can fail in shear and in tension, allowing the dominant failure mechanisms, i.e. shear and tensile cracks, to occur. After failure of these bonds, particles can still interact through collisions.<br/>The simulation results show the effect of the tested design parameters and are compared with analytical models and actual experiments of oscillating undercutting discs.","DEM; non-linear; cutting; rock","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-07-31","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

Rebellious behaviour is often referred to as going against the norm and derives its value from breaking rules. Previous academic research (Gielen &amp; Van Leeuwen, 2013), on the subject, has provided suggestions and techniques to design for this. However, there has been no clear or obvious conclusion as of yet, whether or how rebellious play can be promoted and supported through design.Therefore the brief for this graduation assignment was to “ re-think the bangerik &amp; develop the Bangerik concept and investigate the occurrence of rebellious behaviour during play. As secondary goals; gain insights in designing and researching for rebellious play.”X-eo builds upon the bangerik concept developed during the compulsory DFI master‘s course Interactive Technology Design (ITD) during the 2013/2014 academic year at the faculty of IDE at the Delft University of Technology. Bangerik is an interactive free-flowing game that encourages children to be rebellious in a playful context. It consisted of a wearable worn on the wrist, where the goal of the game to raise their opponent‘s heart rate by scaring them and then steal their lives by tapping their wristband. The project is broken down into four distinct phases: Understand, Ideate, Make and Evaluate. Understand: The “understand“ phase was an immersion into the terminology behind the assignment through literature, an investigation of the original concept, online research of current rebellious concepts and potential technology that could be integrated into the final design to be tested at the end of the project. A definition of rebellious play was created and defined as “Where children can actively challenge what is in place and explore their behavioural boundaries, without having to face or endure any serious or lasting consequences“ This definition accompanied by a model of rebellious play was used to support the start of the ideate phase. The phase concluded with the establishment of research gaps to be investigated during the next stage of the project.Ideate: The “ideate“ phase consisted of 2 iterative design loops to find information that could not be obtained from traditional research methods such as literature reviews and interviews. Ideation focussed on the following research gaps, with prototypes created for each aspect and tested with children at a local school:How to play tag with Bangerik?How to attach something to the body?Where to place the tagging locations on the upper body?How to raise and lower heart rate during play and should this aspect remain in aspect?The video data from the testing sessions were analysed with the following conclusions established: The upper arms and chest are the most suitable tagging locations on the upper body. A garment is best to accommodate the tagging areas on the upper body. The heart rate aspect was a vital element and should be integrated into the final design. Feedback should be integrated into the final design to indicate when the players the heart rate is high and when they have lost a life. Make:The “make“ phase consisted of finalising the concept design and establishing aspects to be examined during the pilot study. Aesthetics, prototype behaviour and functions were finalised.From this point onwards the Bangerik concept evolved into the X-eo concept, a wearable garment tag game that offers the children the opportunities to steal lives from each other by raising other player’s heart rate. The tagging, heart rate and visual behaviour aspects of the concept were selected to be embodied into minimal viable prototypes for the pilot study. Evaluate: The “evaluate“ phase brought a close to the project with the prototypes being tested during the pilot study. The main focus for the pilot was whether the prototype provoked the occurrence of rebellious play behaviour and recommendations for design and research activities with the prototypes in the future. The following sub-questions were operationalised to determine conclusions to the overriding research questions:What strategies do the children implement during gameplay and are they rebellious?Do the children understand the visual feedback when their heart rate is high, when their lives are stolen, when they are out of the game and when their lives are reviving?A hierarchy of rules framework was created, so rebellious tendencies through the children‘s strategies could be identified and classified based on the rules they violated. In conclusion, rebellious behaviour was present during the testing session with all rules within the hierarchy framework being violated, with contextual and societal rules being the most popular. However it cannot be defined whether these behaviours were directly provoked due to the prototype, the context or the motivational state the children were in before completing the test. The hierarchy framework was a useful tool for classifying rebellious play behaviour. The report concludes with an evaluation of the research methodology applied, research &amp; design recommendations and reflections with regards to conducting future research with the X-eo concept and on rebellious play behaviour.","Rebellious Play; Wearable; Design for children","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

However, more insight is required on the complex physical processes due to wave-vegetation interaction in order to predict the amount of wave damping. Past research found that these processes are dependent on both flow conditions and vegetation characteristics. Therefore, reliable quantification of these vegetation characteristics is<br/>of importance to understand these processes and thus to improve predictions for wave dissipation due to vegetation. This study aims to gain insight on practical methods for quantifying relevant vegetation characteristics<br/>for wave damping. Data is used from full scale physical experiments conducted in the Delta Flume at Deltares, with 40 meters of willow forest. The vegetation characteristics are quantified in this study both by manual measurements on the willow trees and by executing Terrestrial 3D laser scans (TLS) of the whole forest. The frontal area of vegetation is found in literature to be a relevant parameter for determining the wave attenuation, therefore the focus in this study lies on schematizing this parameter over the vertical, which is seen as representations of the average willow tree. This schematization is referred to in this report as “tree model”. In this study, four tree models are obtained. The four tree models include: tree model 1a (manual measurements on the primary branches, excluding side branches), tree model 1b (branching method based on Strahlers ordering scheme, including side branches), tree model 1c (adjusted branching method) and tree model 2 (from terrestrial laser scanner). The reconstructed area from the TLS point cloud is determined by using Matlab built-in alpha shape function. The tree models are compared in terms of frontal area distribution over the vertical and of their effect on the corresponding wave attenuation. The latter comparison is achieved by using the numerical wave model SWAN and confronting the results with the measured wave attenuation from the physical experiments. With regards to the manual measuring methods, the frontal area of the average tree from tree model 1a serves as a lower limit, while tree model 1b gives the upper limit. The TLS outcome (tree model 2) underestimates the frontal area as computed by the other tree models. In particular, the underestimation is 70% when compared with tree model 1b, and 30 % when compared to tree model 1a. Adjustments on tree model 1b leads to tree model 1c. This tree model accounts for the tapering form of the branches and results in a total frontal area in between tree model 1a and tree model 1b. In this study, the representative area for the willow trees can be best captured with tree model 1c. This tree model results in a drag coefficient (CD) of 1.15 averaged over the tests with leafless willows and showed a negative correlation with the Keulegan-Carpenter number (KC). However, the capabilities of the TLS should be analyzed further and this study encourages to use a larger data set of trees in order to find a relation between the laser penetration and corresponding mismatch. Gathering of vegetation parameters by hand is in fact not economically attractive forwoody riparian vegetation, as these trees are characterized by complex canopy structures and high elevations. The TLS can serve as a practical tool for obtaining these relevant vegetation parameters for applying willows in hybrid solutions.","Woody; SWAN; Measurements; Frontal area; vegetation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-05-20","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","WOODY project",""

However in order for any of these missions to be realized in a long-term and sustainable way, the spacecraft will require propulsion systems. This thesis describes the design, construction and testing of a miniature iodine-fed Advanced Cusped Field Thruster (μACFT) engineering model (EM) for the 3U+ CubeSat platform. With a dry mass of 280 g and a volume of 180 cm3, the iodine μACFT EM is designed to fit inside of the tuna can extension of the 3U+ CubeSat structure. This form factor makes it incredibly small relative to other iodine thrusters. The measured thrust of the iodine μACFT is 227 - 254 μN, with a total system power consumption of 8.3 - 11.6 W. The small size and low power consumption make the μACFT the best suited iodine thruster candidate for the small 3U+ CubeSat platform.<br/><br/>Multiple distinct topics related to development of the μACFT engineering model are also explored in this the thesis. The fluidics of the two-stage iodine feed system are studied to create a thermodynamic model which can be used to predict the mass flow rate of the propellant as a function of temperature. A resonant DC/DC converter is designed and tested as a candidate for the power processing unit of the engineering model. The converter demonstrated inadequate performance, with respect to the power output and conver- sion efficiency which is linked to the simultaneous requirements on for a high voltage gain and low power consumption in the thruster. Lastly, a tungsten thermionic emitter cathode is verified as an effective option for neutralization of the exhaust plume.","CubeSat; electric propulsion; thruster; iodine; cusped field; electrodynamic; resonant converter; thermionic cathode; miniature","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

This all with the objective to develop a sustainable city. This project answers this question on an integrative level tackling multiple seemingly conflicting developments within the urban realm of Amsterdam Zuid-Oost; the energy-transition, urbanization and water-protection. Since Amsterdam is facing an increasing urbanization, the directly related resulting increase of hardened area and waste-water will require an increase of water storage and hence an intelligent water network in order to tackle the simultaneously increasing flood risk caused by multiple factors such as climate change and soil subsidence. Simultaneously, an increasing demand for energy storage as a result of a transition towards renewable energy sources (since renewable energy sources imply an imbalance between the energy demand and the energy generation) require flood-proof energy-batteries. Since water and its energy storage capacity has currently been introduced by multiple scientific sources as a sustainable (flood-proof etc.) alternative for the ion-based battery the idea of integrating a water-battery within the urban fabric where water storage will be highly needed has hence been introduced as an answer to the problem in this report. Hence, allowing water to flow through the highly urbanized urban fabric of Amsterdam Zuid-Oost in 2050 and using both its kinetic and chemical energy capacity (salinized ground-water; blue energy) to store energy. The height difference caused by the introduction of an elevated park near the area around Bullewijk station could hence be used in order for the water to flow down and extract its gravitational energy. The resulting architectural composition which incorporates a water-battery system, sport-, cultural- and educational facilities hence embodies a calming atmosphere in a vibrant city allowing currently segregated socio-economic groups to meet and hence inspire one another.","Water battery; Urbanization; Blue Energy; Water storage; Energy storage; Amsterdam Zuid-Oost; Future; Amsterdam; Salinization; 2050; Bijlmer; Smart City","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","","52.303608,4.956773"

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","Today, a vast majority of big data processing platforms are implemented in JVM-based languages such as Java and Scala. The main reasons for the popularity of the JVM are: the write once, run everywhere paradigm through the use of platform independent bytecode, automatic garbage collection, bytecode interpretation for fast start-up, JIT-compilation of hot code paths for fast JVM warm-up and runtime code optimization. While these features are well suited for traditional Java applications in embedded systems, application servers and enterprise middleware, the characteristics of big data processing applications force us to examine the efficiency of existing JVM features. Modern big data platforms dwarf the size of the user programs that implement the actual application requiring the loading of 1000s of framework classes per JVM to run a task. Furthermore, these applications instantiate mostly the same identical classpath over and over thus multiplying the time required to load the classes and the memory required to store the class metadata in the JVM. The overhead due to classloading is particularly large when the task length is small, which is common in big data processing pipelines. The issue of classloading overhead is partly addressed by the introduction of OpenJDK Class Data Sharing (CDS), a technique to persist the metadata of classes loaded during the execution of an application in a memory mapped file, so that any subsequent run of the application can simply map this file into memory and reuse the loaded classes. We propose two approaches for utilizing CDS in Hadoop and Spark: BestFit CDS and Classpath CDS representing the two extreme possibilities for sharing. BestFit CDS provides minimum classloading time and potential duplication while Classpath CDS provides zero duplication at the cost of higher classloading time. We show that per-JVM classloading overhead in Hadoop can be as high as 49% for small tasks and further show that the use of BestFit CDS can provide a 30% to 50% improvement in JVM execution time. Further, we identify the key limitations in the current implementation of CDS and propose Modular CDS to improve the scalability and modularity of sharing. With the use of synthetic workloads, we show that the speedup due to Modular CDS lies between that of Classpath and BestFit CDS while at the same time achieving minimum archive size and no duplication of across archives.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Heat pumps are one of the technologies that can contribute to energy savings of industrial processes, for example by heat recovery from waste water streams. The focus of this research is to improve the performance of these heat pump systems. <br/>The compression-resorption heat pump (CRHP) can be distinguished from a traditional vapor-compression heat pump (VCHP) by operating with non-azeotropic mixtures and an incomplete evaporation in the desorber. The working fluid enters the compressor as a two-phase mixture. This type of compression is known as wet compression. The efficiency of the wet compression process has significant influence on the performance of the complete heat pump system. Ammonia water mixtures are often used in this type of heat pump systems. A new mixture, NH3-H2O-CO2, has been proposed in order to increase the performance of CRHPs. However this improvement can only be reached if the compressor efficiency is not negatively influenced by the addition of CO2. <br/>A wet compressor model operating with NH3-H2O-CO2 is developed in order to predict the efficiency of the compressor. The model indicates improvements on the isentropic efficiency of the compressor with NH3-H2O-CO2 compared to ammonia water up to 3.5 %. With the compressor model heat pump applications can be investigated by taking into account the efficiency of the compressor, predicted with the model.

Its reputation is, however, sullied by high costs not yet competitive with conventional energy resources. The Delft Offshore Turbine (DOT) attempts to radically reduce the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) of offshore wind by utilising a seawater-hydrostatic transmission from individual wind turbines to a central power station, where power is generated collectively. Recent theoretical research on the DOT employed variable displacement pumps in the wind turbines interconnected through a collective pipeline. A variable displacement pump does not yet commercially exist and leaves the implementation of a fixed-displacement pump more viable in the near future. Recent practical research implemented a fixed-displacement pump with an individual pipeline. To benefit from the economy of scale however, a collective pipeline is preferred. The DOT wind farm considered in this thesis incorporates fixed-displacement pumps interconnected through a collective pipeline. The difficulty herein arises from the combination of an equal hydraulic torque but varying aerodynamic torque throughout the wind farm. The combined effect results in the inability to control individual rotor speeds, which inevitably leads to suboptimal individual rotor efficiency. This research explores a novel control strategy that obtains the best suboptimal performance when the wind turbines are controlled through a collective pressure.","Offshore Wind; Hydraulic Wind Turbine; Renewable Energy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-05-10","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

Governments have signed climate agreements and are obliged to decrease their level of exhaust gasses. This change in attitude regarding the environment led to an upcoming market for renewables. A significant part of the demand for renewable energy is covered by the wind industry, both on- and offshore. Especially the offshore wind market holds huge potential, due to stable wind conditions and growth opportunities. A side effect of the evolving industry is that turbines are increasing in size and are being installed in deeper water depths. It is expected that the methods of installation, currently used in the offshore wind market, will no longer be suitable for the installation of new generation turbines. In this research, installation of offshore wind turbine towers using a heavy lift vessel (HLV) is opted as an alternative to the current installation methods (jack-up installation). The major benefits of floating installation, when compared to jack-up installation, are the independency on both soil conditions and jacking operations. A challenge of floating installation, however, is the introduction of vessel motions resulting in excitation of the tower. The main objective of this research is to find the most efficient way to control the motions of the tower during installation using a HLV. To fulfill this objective, first, a conceptual design study has been conducted, which focused on developing concepts for the safe installation of offshore wind turbine towers using a HLV. Safe installation was assumed if the displacements of the tower bottom maintain within limits, as specified in a list of design requirements and criteria. Before examining any concept in more detail, the response of the tower and the effect of applying a form of motion compensation has been examined in a general way. To test the response of the tower in the crane in a general way, with and without motion compensation, the tower in the crane has been represented by a double pendulum system with a moving support point. Then, using the numeric model, the response of the tower in the crane has been computed for certain sea-states in both frequency- and time domain and for both the free hanging- and the motion compensated case. The motion compensation system has been represented by a virtual spring damper system, of which, by changing the simulation parameters, the optimal configuration (position, stiffness and damping) has been determined that minimizes the tower response. From the results, it can be concluded that a significant reduction of the tower bottom displacements can be achieved under the application of an active motion compensation system, the requirements for safe installation, however, are not yet fulfilled.","floating; wind turbine; installation; heavy lift vessel","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-05-17","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

For gait applications, extrapolating control inputs from the arm swing may be worthwhile, since arm oscillations naturally occur during human locomotion. A similar method would be unaffected by severe impairments of the lower limbs, and there is evidence suggesting enhanced results of gait rehabilitation when arms and legs exercise together. In this thesis, we propose a control algorithm to drive online a lower limb exoskeleton through the arm swing. Contrary to a previous EMG-based approach by La Scaleia et al. (2014), our algorithm exploits shoulder kinematic data to mimic “single swinging”, a natural mode of human interlimb coordination which is characterised by each arm swinging in-phase with the contralateral leg. Our proposed control architecture relies on two major modules: an Arm Observer and a Gait Generator. The Arm Observer consists of an adaptive frequency oscillator which extrapolates the frequency and phase of the arm swing by receiving online measurements of the angular shoulder position in the sagittal plane. This data is used by the Gait Generator to compute lower limb trajectories, based on regression models from a previous study by Koopman et al. (2014). We validated our controller through human-subject experiments, involving three participants walking on a treadmill with and without a lower limb exoskeleton, the Lopes II. When feed by data associated with natural walking, our adaptive frequency oscillator could very precisely replicate the arm swing frequency, stride cadence and timing of shoulder flexion peaks when walking faster than 0.5 m/s. When wearing the exoskeleton, our algorithm allowed the participants to cope with constant and variable treadmill velocities in the range of 0.5-1.25 m/s. As such, the results of this thesis show that our proposed approach can extend the applicability of arm-based control to walking speeds suitable for gait rehabilitation and assistance.","interlimb coordination; lower limb exoskeleton; arm-based control; wearable robotics control","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | BioMechanical Design","",""

(mentor); Lauppe, Joost (mentor); Galjaard, Salomé (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","The re-use of building components and structural elements is an underdeveloped practice which could be an important strategy in the global paradigm shift towards a circular economy. Steel is one of the most important structural building materials which combines incredible strength, favourable mechanical properties and excellent durability characteristics. It is practically infinitely recyclable and raw materials required for the production of steel are abundantly available in the Earth’s crust. This makes steel one of the most interesting sustainable engineering materials. However, the production process requires vast energy investments and produces considerate environmental pollution. To make steel an increasingly sustainable material and a frontrunner in the global transition towards a circular economy, significant investments and process improvements are necessary. The global environmental challenges of the 21st century demand rapid and far-reaching changes from the steel industry but it also poses opportunities for creative thinking and development of alternative strategies. The re-use of structural steel elements could offer great potential in reducing both the embodied environmental impact of construction works as well as the vast waste streams that result from demolition. There is general consensus on the technical feasibility of this circular alternative across academic literature and the idea enjoys widespread scientific support. Actual implementation is however limited, presumably due to the existence of several multi-level barriers. A diversity of actors along the value chain have indicated that various attitudinal, financial, structural, operational, technological and legislative barriers are preventing widespread adoption. Although some of the identified issues are of a practical nature, various perceived barriers have been identified which were found to be rather subjective. It is to be expected that providing additional information on the risks and opportunities, and by quantitative demonstration of the potential benefits of re-use, several of these perceived barriers could be alleviated. This thesis aims to integrate the potential use of circular steel elements in the structural design process for steelworks as a sustainable alternative to the use of new steel. The developed method allows structural design &amp; engineering professionals to assess the environmental impact of structural steel frameworks with increasing accuracy. Furthermore, it improves the current practice by making the design process reuse-inclusive. It thereby provides design professionals with a tool to assess and communicate the possibilities of improving a design with regard to their inherent sustainability. It was found that the currently prescribed ‘fast-track’ LCA method, aimed at quantifying the embodied environmental impact of building structures, is highly sensitive and the current method could be leading to large inaccuracies and spread of misinformation. Two dominant national LCIA methodologies have been extensively compared and a sensitivity analysis has been performed for a variety of data resources. It could be concluded that the prescribed national data for steel products contained in the NMD is unverifiable and inconsistent with other resources. This raises serious concerns with regard to the accuracy and reliability of currently used ‘fast-track’ LCA methods for the Netherlands. It was calculated that the specific LCIA method used and the selection of modules included in the assessment can cause deviations of the estimated shadowprice up to approximately 424%. Subsequently, a tool was developed based on the CML methodology to validate the potential deviations that could arise from selecting a specific data resource. The application analyses and evaluates structural steel frameworks with regard to their inherent environmental impact. Furthermore it allows the engineer to select and substitute new steel elements with remanufactured counterparts found in a circular steel database. A case study was performed for four different scenarios. Both the LCIA method as well as the considered modules were consistent for all scenarios. From the results it could be concluded that the estimated shadowprice is also highly sensitive to the specific data considered. It was indicated that the input data can lead to deviations of the shadowprice of up to approximately 281%. Furthermore, it was calculated what the potential benefits of reuse would be. It was calculated that substituting 25% of the required steel could lead to reductions of approximately the same magnitude by eliminating the required process for production and cutting the transportation requirements. From the results of this thesis it could be concluded that there is serious inconsistency and limited transparency among the various data resources used for quantifying the environmental impact of steelworks. It is to be expected that the actual shadowcosts deviate significantly from the estimations provided by current assessment methods used in the Netherlands. Failure to accurately quantify the impact of primary building products could lead to significant errors as these materials have a relatively large contribution to the total impact of a building structure. Subsequently, this could lead to misinterpretation of LCA results thereby providing a misleading message for policy- and decision makers. However, it was also illustrated that the remanufacturing and reuse of structural steel profiles could offer significant environmental benefits and has the potential to significantly cut the environmental impact of structural steel framework constructions.","Circular economy; steel reuse; structural steel; Life Cycle Assessment; Environmental impact; circular design strategies","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Building Engineering","",""

Simultaneously, the established energy resources are being depleted and contribute negatively to the climate. The necessity for a sustainable and inexhaustible energy source, to deal with the increasing energy demand in an ecological friendly approach, will play a key role in the 21st century. One of the most predictable and inexhaustible renewable energy sources is the Sun. Nevertheless, changing weather conditions, like rain and clouds, winter and summer, result in daily and seasonal fluctuations. A reliable stand-alone solar system requires a profound storage method to tackle the daily and seasonal fluctuations that can potentially result in deficit or dumped energy.<br/>Generally, a battery bank is adopted in stand-alone solar systems, but the low energy density makes a battery bank not suitable as a seasonal storage method. A seasonal storage method can be implemented by the production and consumption of the chemical product hydrogen. Hydrogen has a high energy density compared to batteries (142 MJ/kg vs 0.95 MJ/kg), but the low round-trip efficiency prevents implementing hydrogen as a daily storage method. For a highly reliable and optimal sized stand-alone energy system, a combination of both a battery bank and the chemical product hydrogen are used as a profound storage method. The combined storage method can be used in times<br/>of excess and deficit energy. This results in a so called stand-alone hybrid PV-Electrolyzer-Battery-FC energy system. In this final thesis project a stand-alone hybrid PV-Electolyzer-Battery-FC energy system is modelled and optimized to determine the current and future feasibility, both technologically and economically, for residential utilization. A simulation model of the hybrid energy system is designed in TRNSYS. The model is optimized by minimizing the loss of load probability (LLP) and levelized cost of energy (LCOE) for the stand-alone hybrid PV-Electolyzer-Batter-FC energy system at residential level in TRNOPT. Several cases are optimized based on the electrical, heat and mobility demand. The used optimization method is a combination of particle swarm optimization (PSO) and Hooke-Jeeves optimization algorithms implemented by GenOpt.<br/>It is established that the proposed stand-alone hybrid PV-Electrolyzer-Battery-FC is technically feasible for the fulfillment of the annual electrical demand of a typical Dutch household. The feasible system size consists of 19 PV modules, battery capacity of 25.5 kWh and a tank volume of 1.24 cubic meters for a LCOE of 1.04 /kWh. If the future prices of the main components can be reduced to 0.01 €/Wp for PV, 0.01 €/Wh for battery and 0.01 €/W for electrolyzer and fuel cell the hybrid system can potentially reach a LCOE of 0.28 €/kWh. Reduction of the prices can be realized by large scale production, large scale implementation and technology maturity. In the end, a LCOE of 0.17 €/kWh can be realized by renewable energy systems if these future prices are realized and the following conditions are met: (1) fully covered roof area by PV modules and (1) the production, consumption and storage of hydrogen should be centralized to scatter the infrastructure costs over all the consumers. This can induce a so called hydrogen economy in the future, whereby the hydrogen gas can be the sustainable link between the increasing energy demand and the depleting fossil fuels.","Solar-Battery-Hydrogen System; Alkaline Electrolyzer; PEM fuel cell; Autonomous; Hybrid; optimization; Hooke-Jeeves; Particle Swarm Optimization; Residential; Netherlands","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

This study is part of the IWACA-TECH project, which is an abbreviation for “Improved Water efficiency Control based on remote sensing TECHnologies. The goal is to increase water efficiency and crop yield without increasing the consumptive use of water, using remote sensing and Model Predictive Control (MPC). The structural water scarcity in the region points out the relevance of the IWACATECH project and with that this study. The research, carried out by students of Delft University of Technology, is of importance for both the company Tongaat Hulett and all inhabitants who are direct or indirect dependent on the water of the Incomati river. The study area on the plantation in Xinavane copes not only with inefficient irrigation water use but also suffers a sugarcane yield decline in recent years ??. Therefore, the overall aim of this report is to improve water efficiency and crop yield within Tongaat Hulett. To achieve this from a multidisciplinary perspective several research questions have been formulated. Although they all contribute to the overall aim, they do so from different angles and in varying degrees. Therefore, to increase the readability of the report, the research questions have been divided into three sections: (1) Irrigation Practices, (2) Field Assessment on Yield Variability and (3) Decision Support System. Fieldwork was conducted over a five week period in order to gather data. Groundwater levels were measured, water quality of irrigation, ground- and precipitation water samples was analysed and soil moisture content was measured. This led to further research of soil types and quality. Soil profiles along the edges of both fields were made revealing a shallow aquifer in the bad-performing field. Irrigation water quality seems to form no hazard, but ground water quality analyses revealed significantly high electrical conductivity levels and a high sodium adsorption ratio in areas without growth. These findings, combined with an analysis of the digital elevation map and socio-technical data revealed that evaporation of irrigation water seems to be a large contributor to the impaired crop growth. When excess water cannot run off, puddles are formed. When these puddles evaporate, salts can be taken up by the soil once the thickened irrigation water infiltrates. This process is strengthened by the clay soil layer and the shallow aquifer, which prevent water from infiltrating deeper into the ground. Results concerning remote sensing prove the relationship between soil moisture content and precipitation for meteo-station XNA-20. Combining spatial and temporal variability of soil moisture content with remote sensing can play an essential role in managing irrigation practices. For the decision support system, and in specific the controller part of the system, measurements have been done. It can be concluded that storage area and delay times can be considered insignificant, and that canals do not have to be modelled. This makes the controller significantly easier and thus more time and effort can be spend on other aspects of the controller.","sugarcane; water efficiency; over-irrigation; soil quality; remote sensing; decision support system","en","student report","","","","","","","","2021-05-10","","","","","MP277","-25.0429, 32.781"

The proposed 2020 version of the Eurocode 3 part 1-8, still under discussion at the time of writing of this thesis, covers steel with yield strength up to 700 MPa. This standard has recommended high material reduction parameter for joints with steel grades above S355 to S700. This is done to consider the low deformation observed for steel between 450 MPa and 460 MPa, to include the insufficient knowledge of the material properties of HSSs and the impact of these properties on the current standards. Secondary bending stresses are omitted for the static design strength of mild strength hollow section joints. But for high-strength joints rules regarding these stresses need to be re-analyzed, since the impact of HSS on hollow section joints may be different. Goal: In this study the main goal is to investigate the level of the secondary bending stresses in hollow section joints made of high-strength steel using numerical analyses. Furthermore, the magnitude of the material reduction factors recommended by the proposed 2020 version of the Eurocode 3 part 1-8 are evaluated. An attempt is made to validate the FEM against test data. The commercial finite element program ABAQUS® is used to build the FEM. Roughly good agreement between the test and the FEA is obtained. A parametric study is performed on an isolated gap K-joint. The joint geometries, boundary and loading conditions are taken from the literature. To study the impact of the material parameters on the secondary bending stresses in RHS joint, various parameters including material properties, gap size, brace width to chord width ratio and weld type are varied. These parameters influence the stiffness, strength, stress distribution and secondary bending stresses. A total of 32 gap K-joints is analyzed in this research. Also, an attempt is made to obtain the ultimate load resistance using the yield line theory. As results, valuable information about the joint behavior of high-strength hollow section joints is obtained. It is found that secondary bending stresses cannot be neglected when high-strength steels are used.","Rectangular hollow section; High-strength steels; Ultimate load; secondary bending stress; material reduction factors; yield line","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

Due to the intermittency of wind energy this poses new problems and challenges for the future electricity system in the Netherlands. The objective of this report is to identify the challenges for the electricity supply of offshore wind farms and to research how energy storage and alternative wind turbine design can aid in these challenges. The problems experienced and possible solutions are first identified by conducting a literature review and data analysis. Subsequently a Matlab model is constructed to simulate an offshore wind farm and energy storage system. This model is used to determine the most cost-efficient storage technique and the impact of this technique on the future electricity system. <br/>Of the challenges for future offshore wind farms do the short-term profile effects have the most influence. These effects negatively affect: 1. the security of supply in the electricity system, 2. the stability of the load on the high voltage grid and 3. the market value of the produced electricity. The impact of these effects is intensified by the strong correlation in power production between the connected (future) onshore and offshore wind farms. To reduce profile effects energy storage is used, the optimal configuration of the storage system has a power capacity between 0.23 and 0.27 times the rated power of the wind farm. For the optimal energy capacity, however, no optimum is found, and the design depends on the desired impact of the system. An analysis on the impact of an optimal design has shown that an offshore wind and energy storage system does not result in an economical feasible system. Short-term profile effect reduction with energy storage, however, is shown to be essential in a future electricity system that is dominated by wind and solar power. The short-term profile effects of wind energy production are correlated too much and will have a too high impact on the system if no energy storage is included in offshore wind electricity production.","Energy Storage; Offshore wind energy; Offshore Technology; Energy integration; Electricity market; Electricity market design; wind energy integration; Offshore energy storage; wind turbine design; renewable energy systems","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-05-10","","","","Mechanical Engineering","2974",""

Industries are moving circular to reduce environmental impact. The kitchen industry has to change. CIK (the Circular Kitchen) is a research project that develops a circular kitchen: a product-service system for tenants in social housing in the Netherlands. The product is aimed to be market ready in 2022 and should have significantly less negative environmental impact. The partners in this project are material suppliers, part suppliers, a kitchen manufacturer, a contractor, housing associations and tenants. For a functioning and viable design, all stakeholders must cooperate. This graduation project started with investigating what tensions the circular kitchen might bring for social housing tenants and finds a solution for this. With an integral approach, the life of the tenants in the kitchen was researched along with the changes that the circular kitchen brings. All aspects of design were taken into account: technology, business and people. The approach for this project, an ‘iterative representation of the basic design cycle’, is combined with methods from service design and user-centered design. This project is divided in three consecutive cycles. Every cycle contains different phases: framing, envisioning, realisation and validation. In each cycle the design is iterated and refined. The assignment and problem definition form the basis and starting point for analyses. CIK, the stakeholders, and the background of the problem are researched. ‘Design A’ is evaluated in user research. The context of the problem was investigated by using literature studies and context-mapping with tenants. The context-mapping sessions provided a holistic view on the life of the user in the kitchen. It appeared that tenants differ in their perception of the kitchen. Their kitchen has an emotional or functional role and their activity in the kitchen are either individually or socially focused. These findings are visualised in a framework that shows four types of social housing tenants (Figure 1). Additionally, shared values were found among this research group (Figure 2). <br/>In cycle B new knowledge that was retrieved from user research is framed to start refining the design. The service- side of CIK needed development: new insights were translated into an integral service concept that tackles conflicts that can arise between circular interest and the tenants. The input of the evaluation of the design with the major stakeholder - the kitchen manufacturer - resulted into the introduction of a new partner that drives the organisation as a whole: Het Keukencollectief. An intermediary that guides all stakeholders and is the key to a successful and fertile business. Cycle C is focused on detailing the intermediary (Het Keukencollectief), the service, and the front-end of the service (digital web-app). Research demonstrated that the business should focus on both the basic kitchen and on upgrade possibilities. This formed the basis of a newly created digital platform. A final evaluation of the front-end design of the service showed that the design was attractive for the tenant and functioned as envisioned. To conclude, this report describes a user-centered design process in multiple iterative cycles resulting in a design proposal for a service system to facilitate a circular kitchen for social housing in the Netherlands. The most important addition to the current project is the design of the intermediary ‘Het Keukencollectief’ with the front-end service design.","Social Housing; Circular Kitchen; Tenant Behaviour","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","the Circular Kitchen",""

Although, house owners are becoming increasingly aware of the fact that problems (and thereby costs) can be prevented if remedial measures are taken in time. Monitoring of the foundation can possibly give insights in the remaining capacity of the foundation. In this thesis, research is performed into monitoring of foundations. The main research question is: Which methods can be used to monitor a foundation and to what extent are these useful and adequate? To answer this question, five different monitoring methods have been investigated: InSAR (Interferometric Synthetic-Aperture Radar), measurement bolts, a subsidence sensor, a groundwater level sensor and a tilt sensor. Other methods have not been considered and are beyond the scope of this research.<br/>First, InSAR data has been compared to subsidence data gathered by measurement bolts in two different cases, one in Zaandam (Netherlands) and Amsterdam (Netherlands). Measurement bolts are used as golden standard in this comparison. The comparison of measurement bolts with INSAR data resulted in a maximum error margin of ± 0,86 mm/year for Case Study Block A and ± 1,31 mm/year for all measurements for the testcase in the Case Study Block B within a 95% confidence interval. Secondly, the measurement bolts method has been qualitatively compared to InSAR data. Also, the pros and cons have been discussed. Measurement bolts have a better precision (0,3-0,5 mm) than InSAR data (2-3 mm) for individual measurements. Possible errors that can influence the accuracy of this method are: personal errors, instrumental errors and natural errors. InSAR and measurement bolts both have their strengths and weaknesses. Prescreening is an easier application for InSAR but highly accurate measurements in a specific location is more reliable if measurement bolts are used. In a way, these methods complement each other rather than measuring the same way. The datasets collected by the subsidence, groundwater level and tilt sensors is made available for this research project by KennisCentrum Aanpak Funderingsproblematiek (KCAF) which is an independent knowledge and network organization funded by the government of the Netherlands. Generally, several factors can add noise to the signal. It is unknown if the signal of the sensors is calibrated to measure the right quantity. This research project has shown that the data showed a similar trend of the groundwater level as local monitoring wells. Therefore, it can be concluded that the sensors are adequate to measure the groundwater level if they are calibrated and referenced to NAP. Moreover, the groundwater level sensor can possibly be used to measure how long dry periods are and how much wood is exposed to air, in order apply measures well in time.<br/>Tilt sensors are currently not used for monitoring of foundations. The factors that can be considered when a tilt sensor is used to monitor a foundation are investigated with a literature study and with expert opinion. As the results show the measured rotation can be related to the stiffness of the wall where the sensor is mounted on. As for all sensors, it has to be made sure if they are calibrated to actually measure what they observe. Further research could usefully explore how viable a system of sensors is. In general, classification or a prediction of the remaining service life of a foundation can be challenging. Further research might explore how useful it is when big dataset are combined to be able to give better judgement.","foundation; monitoring; InSAR; sensor; measurement bolts","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Building Engineering","",""

Furthermore, the designed micronozzles are fabricated and the ground work is laid for experimental testing of these nozzles.

This water is called extraneous water and is the result of unwanted discharges in the sewer system. This could be groundwater infiltrating leaky sewer pipes, or pumped from construction sites directly into the sewer. Or it could be surface water flowing in from wrong illicit connections. In the Netherlands, all this extra water account for a quarter of all the influent that enters the treatment plants.<br/><br/>This thesis studies the effect of a reduction of extraneous water in the influent on the workings of the treatment plant. For this two cases are studied: the treatment plant of Dokhaven in Rotterdam and Willem Annapolder in Kapelle. Dokhaven is a high loaded treatment plant with an A-B configuration that treats the wastewater from the center of Rotterdam in which it is located. Willem Annapolder is a low loaded treatment plant with biological phosphor removal and pre-denitrification and treats the wastewater from different cities and municipalities in its surroundings connected by long pressure mains. Both cases are known to receive a lot of extraneous water in their influent.<br/><br/>Two models were made for each case study: one that simulates the dynamics of the influent concentrations and another that describes the water treatment processes in the treatment plant. After calibration, the models of the treatment plant were run with a different influent in which the extraneous water was reduced.<br/><br/>Previous studies have indicated that a reduction in extraneous water leads only to small changes in the effluent concentration, but due to the reduced flow leads to significant reduction in the effluent load. In the case of Dokhaven the models show similar results. In the case of Willem Annapolder, the effects of the pressure mains was also taken into account. This caused the resulting effluent ammonia concentration to increase when extraneous water was reduced. The reduction in clean extraneous water increases the dry weather concentration of the pollutants in the pressure mains. When a rain event occurs, this water with high concentration is pushed towards the treatment plant with increased flow, which causes increased peak loads at the start of every heavy rain event. <br/>Although the overall nitrogen load on the effluent was also decreased at Willem Annapolder when the extraneous water was reduced, the pressure mains resulted in a much lower decrease than in the case of Dokhaven. This thesis thus shows that it is important to take into account the sewer system when evaluating the effects of reducing extraneous water.","Extraneous water; wastewater treatment; sewer network; model; BioWin","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

A graph-based approach is applied to allow for efficient assignment of vehicles to requests. The model is tested on an experiment representing an urban context. It was found that ride-sharing potential is strongly dependent on the willingness to share and somewhat less strongly on the delay tolerance. The expected level of service is poorer when sharing preferences vary across the population. Implementation of a ride-sharing service is most successful when directionality in demand is low, while ride-based discounts can be effective in maximizing its societal benefits.","Ride-sharing; Willingness to share; Delay tolerance; Demand distribution; Pricing mechanism; Heterogeneity","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Transport, Infrastructure and Logistics","",""

This increase is caused by anthropogenic emission, predominantly fossil fuel combustion. There is sufficient capacity in the oceans to take up to 70 to 80% of this amount, however, due to the large time scale of this process it can take several hundred years to reach this value. The response of these sinks to a changing climate are important to predict the future behaviour of the carbon cyclewith increasing emissions. Space-based observations of column averaged CO2 dry air mole fraction (XCO2) with near-global coverage can be used to better quantify the fluxes of small- scale sinks and sources. The current data set can be significantly extended by performing XCO2 retrievals for measurements above cloudy ocean scenes as proposed by [Schepers et al., 2016]. This method is based on a full physics retrieval algorithm called RemoTeC, which has been used to retrieve XCO2 and XCH4 from GOSAT land and glint measurements. In this study the cloudy retrieval method is performed on a larger scale and an analysis of the data yield and increased spatial coverage of XCO2 over the oceans is done, a quantitative comparison is made with GOSAT XCO2 retrievals obtained from TCCON, clear- sky land and glint ocean measurements and the influence of cloud climatology on the retrievals per- formance is assessed. The cloudy retrieval was done for GOSAT L1B spectra frommeasurements obtained between 2009 and 2013 for several areas of interest: North-America, South-America, East-Asia, Oceania and a strip of Pacific Ocean.

Another company (Thales, the agent) has been hired to maintain all these resources on behalf of NS (the principal). In this paper, qualitative and quantitative research into the current maintenance process has been carried out. This research shows that various inefficiencies occur in the current maintenance process. The most important ones are unnecessary process steps for the mechanic at Thales, multiple Work Order Tasks to solve single incidents and the difficulty to plan efficiently due to the many fatal failures. Additionally, this study shows that collaboration between the principal and the agent is an essential factor which can undermine efficiency. An important example of inefficiency due to poor collaboration is the occurrence of repeated failures. This is caused by a lack of transparency on past maintenance of particular resources. In this case study, four crucial improvement directions are identified. In no particular order, these are a different maintenance strategy, the prevention of unnecessary and repeated processes, transparency in data and demand-driven failure prioritisation. Generalisation of this research is difficult, but this study shows that in complex maintenance situations problems can be solved with both technical and procedural adjustments, as well as by improved cooperation between the party that commissioned the maintenance and the party who then performs the maintenance.","Electronic Registration Systems; Public Transport; Process Optimization; Maintenance Strategies; Economic Relevance; Principal-agent cooperation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-05-09","","","","Transport, Infrastructure and Logistics","",""

The importance of the transition to an energy-efficient built environment is underlined by the increasing Dutch and European regulations regarding energy efficiency within the real estate market. As a result, the market for energy-efficient buildings has grown considerably in recent years. Therefore, office buildings increasingly have various voluntary and mandatory energy certificates. Since 2008, the energy label has been the measure of the energy performance of a building in the Netherlands and is therefore included as a test unit in this study.Problem analysis Most studies in this field have been conducted in the United States, primarily because CoStar has an extensive database of commercial real estate. As the Netherlands does not have such a centrally organized database, research into this subject is made more complex. Over the last couple of years, there has been growing interest in the financial performance of energy efficient buildings. However, the relatively large deviation and sometimes improbable contradictions of the identified price premiums in the various hedonic price studies might indicate that in some cases the models suffer from misspecification. It is possible that this results in an over- or underestimation of the rental price premium of energy efficiency in the Netherlands. This research presents a refined model to better isolate the effect of energy efficiency on the willingness-to-pay from the overall building quality, and therewith to determine the realistic rental premium for energy efficiency in the Dutch office market. Aim of the study This study aimed to determine the rental premium for energy efficient office buildings at the level of an office unit in the Randstad. An office unit is the office space that is included in a lease contract. In addition to the economic factors, location, and building characteristics, it was particularly important to include building and facade aesthetic features in the analysis, because such a control was missing in most comparable studies. It was expected that by controlling for aesthetic building and facade features, the rental premium for energy-efficient office buildings would be lower because the effect of energy efficiency on the rental price would be better isolated. Relevance Previous research in this field has shown that tenants are prepared to pay for energy-efficient office buildings. However, that research rarely controls for aesthetic building and facade features, which VII creates a gap in academic knowledge. By operationalizing and quantifying building and facade features, it is possible to control for these features. Therefore, the added academic value of this research is the more in-depth control of the aesthetic building and facade features. This research into the rental premium of energy-efficient office buildings in the Randstad contributes to the knowledge of stakeholders such as investors, developers, researchers, real estate agents, urban planners and policymakers. They need insight in the dynamics and influence of the energy efficiency of office buildings on the various office markets. This research offers the possibility of a practical application for the price characteristic as a benchmark within the valuation process. Methodology The aim of this research is to determine the rental premium of energy-efficient office buildings. The research wanted to give an accurate description of the actions that must be taken to achieve the goal of the research (Figure 2). Step 1 describes the reason and defines the problem statement by analysing the current context of the research field. Step 2 relates to the theoretical basis for regression analysis. Significant rental determinants within previous research have been identified to create a theoretical basis for the regression model. In step 3, data is collected for the multiple regression analysis and the mathematical specifications of the model are formulated. In step 4, the collected data is analysed and the regression model is formulated and designed. Different models are constructed and investigated. Step 5 concerns the interpretation of the model results. The re-evaluation and improvement of the content in an earlier phase resulted in an integrated design process in which the definitive regression model of this research was constructed. Results and conclusions The Research shows a positive rental premium for energy-efficient office buildings. The estimates of the predictive model indicate a rent price premium of 8.4% for energy efficient office buildings (label A-C) versus energy inefficient office buildings (label D-G). The research has also shown that different rental premiums are paid for different energy labels. The regression shows that when controlling for all other variables related to the macro, meso and micro levels, tenants are willing to pay substantially higher rents for office buildings with a B and or C label than for buildings with energy label A. Furthermore, tenants pay substantially lower rents for buildings with energy label E than for those with label A. No substantial differences have been demonstrated in the rent for the other energy labels. Perhaps, the lack of significance for buildings with a D, F or G label is the result of the small samples size in this research, so significant results are more difficult to achieve. In addition to the usual control of economic, location and building factors in rental premium research, this research has added a control level of building and facade aesthetic features. This control was missing in almost all comparable studies. If the control for aesthetic building and facade features is left out of consideration, the rental premium for energy-efficient office building would have been 13.5%, about 5% higher than the proven rent price premium of 8.4%. The addition of the level of control with regard to aesthetic building and facades features therefore has a significant effect on the rental price premium. This result was expected. The effect of energy efficiency on the rental price of office buildings is positive, but this is weaker than in previous studies because the effect of energy efficiency is better isolated through the extensive control of aesthetic building and facade features and was therefore determined more precisely.","Energiezuinigheid; Energielabels; Betalingsbereidheid; Esthetische waarde; Architectonische kwaliteiten; Nederlandse kantorenmarkt","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-05-09","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Management in the Built Environment","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","Aircraft fuel efficiency, noise, and emissions are some of the most important aspects being addressed in the research of novel aircraft configurations for meeting the future requirements of the aviation industry. One concept which has the potential for improving the aircraft fuel efficiency is called the boundary layer ingestion (BLI). Modification of the boundary layer flow using a power supply for favorable aerodynamic and/or propulsive effect, in general, could be called boundary layer ingestion. This method is especially possible when a propulsor is tightly integrated with the airframe which allows the partial recovery of power which is otherwise lost in the wake flows. A tube-wing aircraft fuselage with a boundary layer ingesting propulsor in the aft is a good candidate for the study as the fuselage is the body with the highest length in the streamwise direction resulting in a large potential for power recovery.<br/>The present work involves the numerical assessment of the aero-propulsive performance of tube-wing aircraft fuselage with a boundary layer ingesting propulsor in the aft. This consists of the use of computational fluid dynamics with power balance and exergy analysis methods to analyze the various aspects of the flow in BLI configurations. The study focuses importantly on the design space exploration for analyzing the effect of axisymmetric fuselage geometry and flight conditions on propulsor (modeled as an actuator volume) power consumption. The effect of aircraft wings, propulsor blades, propulsor nacelle, and empennage are not included in the present study. The results are driven more towards understanding the effect of fuselage design on BLI, especially in transonic flights. The exploration is followed by constrained design optimization of axisymmetric fuselage geometry for obtaining least fuel burn.","Boundary layer ingestion; Power balance method; Exergy analysis method; surface dissipation; surface anergy rate","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-05-10","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Wet clutch control is key to achieve smooth and fast clutch engagements. Optimal control of a wet clutch is not trivial because of the complexity of the system due to nonlinearities, hybrid dynamics and changing dynamics over time due to changing temperatures and wear. Nowadays simple parametrized feedforward controllers are used in industry. The parameters of the control signal are tuned by hand and updated over time by an operator to account for the changing dynamics. Several solutions to the wet clutch control problem exist in the literature, however the structure of the solutions is fixed beforehand and they rely on expert knowledge of the system. Another challenging aspect of wet clutch control is model uncertainty, currently robustness of performance is considered by running a finite number of experiments, but no hard guarantees can be given. In this thesis a method is developed to automatically synthesize controllers for a wet clutch which are robust to model uncertainties. The method uses Genetic Programming (GP) to automatically synthesize controllers. Using GP controllers for a wet clutch can synthesize without fixing the structure beforehand and in a multi-objective way. Robustness is considered by optimizing the worst case performance. To be able to give a guarantee on the worst case performance of a controller a method, that is able to formally guarantee a lower bound on the worst case performance using reachability analysis, is developed. This method is to costly to incorporate into GP and instead a use cheap estimation of the worst performance in practice.<br/>This method was able to find robust controllers which outperformed a hand tuned baseline controller, but in order to compare this method to other methods in literature, real life experiments are needed.","Genetic programming; Wet clutch control; Reachability Analysis; Robust control; Nonlinear control; Hybrid Systems","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-05-08","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

Multiple studies showed this influence of retail lighting (e.g. Baker et al., 1992; Quartier et al., 2014b). However, existing research into the influence of lighting on product perception is somewhat insufficient, therefore the goal was to gain more insights into this influence in the online retail context. Physical qualities of light can be measured (e.g. illuminance, colour temperature), however, the actual effect of lighting on the perceiver determines if a lighting concept is successful. Kelly (1952) first described a series of functions that lighting had to meet to serve the needs of the perceiver, and distinguished three functions: ambient, focus, and brilliance. This perception-based design approach still forms the principle of qualitative lighting design, and formed the basis for the conditions in this current study. Diffused lighting (ambient), directed lighting (focus), and a combination of both examined the influence of diffuseness. A fourth condition examined the influence of luminosity/brightness (the diffused and directed condition was brightened).<br/>Product perception was measured as perceived product value, which can be distinguished into expressive (aesthetic and symbolic value) and utilitarian values (functionalities, ease of use, and perceived quality). Oh et al. (2016) found a positive relation between processing modes (global vs local) and lighting (holistic vs focus). It was expected that the ratings of expressive values and perceived quality would increase in diffused lighting, as these values are generally processed more ‘holistically’ and consumers will focus on the products’ global impression (perceived quality is a more utilitarian value, yet it is generally processed more ‘holistically’). Besides, it was expected that utilitarian values would increase in directed lighting, since these are generally processed more analytical as consumers will focus on product details. Based on literature about product perception, kitchen scales were selected as stimuli, and four specific scales were chosen based on a form study, collages, and a morphological chart. They were divided into more hedonic/expressive and more utilitarian scales, and all varied, among others, in form, buttons, material(s), and glossiness. This study was a 4 (products) x 4 (lighting conditions) mixed experimental design, and 113 participants were assigned to one of the conditions. Via an online questionnaire, participants gave product evaluations based on statements corresponding with the value dimensions, which were derived from literature. Besides, the HED/UT scale of Voss et al. (2003) measured hedonic and utilitarian value dimensions towards this product category. Two significant main effects were found between conditions. Perceived quality was evaluated most positive in the diffused and directed condition, and ease of use in the ‘brighter’ condition. This indicates that a combination of diffused and directed lighting was preferred in the perception of these value dimensions. Nowadays, (online) retailers often use professional light boxes/lighting solutions for photography, which often only create diffused lighting. Directed lighting is needed to make glossy objects look shiny, creates highlights and shadows, and makes details more clearly visible. Generally, it is recommended to use diffused and directed lighting for product photography.","lighting; product perception; retail design; consumer research; lighting design; product appearance","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

This is called prepayment. In the case of a prepayment, the bank who issued the loan earns less interest than ini- tially agreed. It is therefore essential to build accurate models for predicting prepayment behavior. In this thesis, machine learning models called artificial neural networks are used to predict conditional prepayment rates. In particular, the possibility to quantify the model uncertainty is studied. It is important to acknowledge that the accuracy of a model is not constant over its domain. Most ma- chine learning methods do not provide information about the uncertainty regarding a prediction and, unfortunately, methods that do so are often computationally expensive. This thesis studies uncertainty estimates generated by a neural network with dropout applied. Dropout is a method that randomly drops out neurons in each layer and has been suggested to prevent overfitting. We will see that this method can also be used to extract a measure of uncertainty regarding the prediction of a neural net- work efficiently. This method is used first to evaluate uncertainty for three simple functions under different distributions of the train data. Then the uncertainty estimates are evaluated for a neural network that predicts conditional prepayment rates. It will be illustrated that the uncertainty estimates provide an accurate indication of regions of the domain where predictions are inaccurate. Moreover, using a different model in the regions identified as uncertain can result in higher model performance.","Artificial Neural Networks; Dropout; Uncertainty; Mortgages; Conditional Prepayment Rate","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics","",""

A complete end-to-end interplanetary mission from an Earth-bound orbit to a stable science orbit around Mars (in this case, an areostationary orbit) has been conducted using this concept. Sets of initial conditions leading to ballistic capture are generated for different epochs. The influence of the dynamical model on the capture is also explored briefly. Specific capture trajectories are then selected based on a study of their stabilization into an areostationary orbit. This stabilization uses a combination of a brief high-thrust maneuver at periapsis and a low-thrust control law that spirals down to the final orbit. The captures selected are then targeted from the sphere of influence of the Earth with a low-thrust heliocentric transfer that is optimized using direct transcription and non-linear programming theory. An arrival-departure date grid is constructed with fuel-optimal transfers obtained for all epochs considered. <br/>Finally, a simple study of the escape from Earth is performed for completion. A strategy to quickly escape Earth and avoid radiation damage in the Van Allen belts is defined using high-thrust chemical propulsion, including the computation of gravity losses due to the use of finite burn maneuvers. The result is the preliminary mission design of a mission concept to Mars using a 16-Unit CubeSat that employs ballistic capture and dual chemical-electric propulsion to reach an areostationary orbit. Estimations of the time of flight and fuel consumption for each stage of the mission are obtained.","Astrodynamics; Mission design; Trajectory optimisation; space mission; CubeSat; Mars; Ballistic capture; Low-thrust transfer","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-12-31","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

For users this means that they no longer have to do large investments while still having access to transport. They can perform door-to-door journeys in a way that suits their needs at a specific time. Transport providers can use this integrated system to create e network that serves the required area and its travellers in a more efficient way. Society can benefit from MaaS as it is centred around transport modes that have a lower negative impact on the urban environment, and use less space. RET is currently looking to introduce a Mobility as a Service-system in the Netherlands. They are working to create the technical requirements for such a platform, and to develop partnerships with other stakeholders like access based mobility providers and societal partners. They however were unsure of who to develop for and what these users want from a MaaS-system. Thus, this thesis focuses on that question. MaaS-journeys should be fast, flexible, reliable, and seamlessly usable. This requires having a high speed, high capacity backbone of trains, metros and lightrail services, supplemented with flexible access based mobility services like shared e-bikes, steps and scooters, and other public transport modes. These journeys should be doable in an easy way: the platform and infrastructure supports a seamless travel experience. There is still a long way to go before a fast, flexible, reliable, seamless MaaS-experience can be realised. Therefore a long-term approach must be adopted by using a design roadmap. This provides the opportunity to work towards the full potential of a MaaS-system by keeping the future in focus. Users should firstly become interested in MaaS and access based mobility through the integration of public transport and other access based mobility services. This creates a more fast and flexible journey. Then, MaaS should work towards providing for routine journeys, and finally towards covering daily urban mobility needs.","design; strategy; roadmap; public transport; MaaS","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

Airbus Defence and Space Netherlands B.V. (Airbus DS NL) aspires to anticipate on this transition and has initiated New Product Development (NPD) of optical ground stations. Nonetheless, the existing approach to innovations does not meet the needs of the transitioning market. Therefore, the objective of this thesis was to constitute a recommendation for a redesigned NPD process for optical ground stations, which supports the realization of competitive advantage and meets the needs of the transitioning market. A design approach was applied to achieve this objective, first examining the requirements of a redesigned process, second generating a conceptual process design, third empirically testing this design and fourth establishing the implications of the results for a recommended process design. Ultimately, three requirements were derived from examining the existing NPD process of Airbus DS NL, consulting academic literature and performing participatory research. The three requirements are that the redesigned process needs to focus on the make, buy or ally decision, needs to manage complexities of NPD and incorporate the focus on industrialization and definition of the customer needs. These requirements were validated with the client. Based on these requirements a conceptual process design was generated, embodying workshops which run concurrent to the existing NPD process of Airbus DS NL. These workshops enact openness, protection of core-values, progress and substance and focus on five subjects, including the definition of customer needs, risk assessment, product design specifications, competitive analysis and lessons learned. With a case study this conceptual process design was empirically tested. Overall, the workshops have shown to generate many new insights and substantive data for continuation of NPD, especially revealing many more risks need to be assessed than earlier anticipated. Without the workshops these would not have been assessed, majorly affecting NPD outcome. Nonetheless, the empirical research has also established four recommendations for an improved workshop process. The recommended NPD process is the first step for Airbus DS NL to adjust to the changing stability in the market. Subsequent to this study, many adjustments still need to be researched as the continuation of NPD redesign is believed to be vital for ensuring competitiveness of the firm in the years to come.","NPD; new product development; NewSpace; airbus; complexity; Process design; Workshop","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

One example of a research project that aims to develop vehicles that are capable of reaching the highest level of autonomy in driving, is the WEpods project. The goal of this research is in line with this aim, having the thesis objective defined as follows: let the WEpods continue driving in autonomous mode more often than is currently the case.<br/><br/> The WEpod shuttles are not yet completely able to drive autonomously due to their inability to handle unexpected behavior (terminology: faults). Currently, such faults need to be detected and solved by a steward, who will manually initiate a safe stop if necessary. The localization module, which is responsible for localizing the vehicle on a map, sometimes generates unreliable location estimates. This poses two challenges. First, the fact that there is a mismatch between reality and the sensor outcomes of the localization module that needs to be detected. Second, the question of how to prevent the system from showing behavior that is different from what is desired (terminology: failure) in case such a fault is present (terminology: fault tolerant contol). Fault tolerant control can be performed in either a passive or an active manner. The passive approach ensures that either the faults are prevented or the system is able to mitigate them by anticipation in the design. The approach evolves from passive to active fault tolerant control when an on-line adaptation of the system control is made. For applications in autonomous driving, it is apparent that it is important to handle not only anticipated faults, but also to be able to deal with unexpected faults in an on-line manner. This on-line fault tolerant control approach involves two fault diagnosis steps that lead to solving the first challenge: detection and isolation.<br/><br/> A so-called model-based fault diagnosis approach turned out to be most suitable, as it has been used for similar applications in the past. However, a model-based fault diagnosis approach has not yet been implemented for detecting and isolating faults in a localization module of autonomous driving, indicating the scientific relevance of this research. In the model-based approach, kinematic and dynamic equations of the research vehicle (WEpod) are used to build a computational model. This model is then subjected to an observer, that is able to compare the model outcomes with the actual measurements in an off-line way. A residual is drawn up by taking the difference between the model outcomes and the measurements. A threshold is computed based on noise on the measurements to compare the residual with. When the residual exceeds the threshold, an alarm is raised. This way, the system itself has been enabled to detect faults when they occur internally.<br/><br/> Inclusion of the suggested fault diagnosis approach in an on-line manner into the system is a big step towards fully autonomous driving of the WEpods, and therefore the goal of this research is met.<br","Autonomous Vehicles; Fault Detection; Localization; model-based","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-05-01","","","","","",""

A parametric design is crucial for this thesis to perform a variation study. Different shapes of the facade are simulated with a custom made genetic algorithm to optimise the shape of the facade. First of all, the cost can be influenced by minimising the amount of material by altering: cross-sections, beam distances, etc. Secondly, by changing the shape of the facade a more aerodynamic building can be created. When the curvature increases, the wind load can be reduced which can make the structure more efficient. The wind load on the facade is determined with the computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The part about building physics focusses on ventilation. A ventilation system is designed which emphasises the importance of integrating the ventilation system with the second skin. The design builds upon the results of the CFD simulation and the structural model. The performance of the system is quantified by determining the usage of natural resources.","parametric design; structural optimization; shape optimization; natural ventilation; optimisation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Building Engineering","",""

To date, few studies have focused on the provision of sub-national accounts at the NUTS2 level of detail and never production-based accounts have been compiled for the European NUTS2 level of detail. The first approach described as the bottom-up approach uses TNO’s MACC emission inventory for the year 2010 which compiles spatially explicit emission data at the source for 9 different pollutants across Europe with a 0.1àx 0.05à longitude-latitude resolution for over 250 source sectors. The second approach described as the top-down approach uses NAMEA data from EUROSTAT by disaggregating it to the regional level following a linear approach based on the regional economic output of a sector compared to the national economic output of the same sector. The two differ- ent approaches for the compilation of environmental extensions are compared both at the production-based accounts and the consumption-based accounts level mapping the existing relative difference across sectors at the national and regional level. The level of heterogeneity in the magnitude of the relative difference of the accounts increases proportionally with geo- graphic detail underlying the fact that a bottom-up construction is able to better grasp the regional scale. This is ever more prominent when looking at particular sectors such as the utilities sectors ss2 and ss5. Of the analysed NUTS2 European regions, the carbon footprint of 74% of the regions presents an upwards deviation of more than 4% compared to the bench- mark study with footprints ranging from 2 to 46 tCO2/cap for Umbria (IT) and Souther Finland (FI) respectively. The obtained results highlight the advantage of the bottom-up approach for more accurate distribution of the emissions at the regional scale from industries to the consumers resonating with similar conclusions from other authors. Despite this, several recommendations are made to improve the quality of the bottom-up approach with possible future applications.","EEIOA; input-output analysis; GHG emissions reduction; regional development; Climate Change; Environmental Impact Assessment; Environmental Sustainability; Industrial Ecology; environmentally extended input-output analysis; environmental accounts; EUREGIO","en","master thesis","","","","","","The Master's programme Industrial Ecology is jointly organised by Leiden University and Delft University of Technology.","","","","","","Industrial Ecology","",""

The single sided butt joint is a common structural detail in marine structures like steel catenary risers and a specimen has been designed for testing using the hexapod in order to ensure fatigue induced failure at the required location.<b>Fatigue design of double sided welded longitudinal attachments using a Total Stress criterion<br/></b>The recently developed total stress concept considers both the weld notch and far field characteristic contributions. The total through-thickness weld notch stress distribution has been adopted to establish the total stress fatigue damage criterion and corresponding fatigue resistance curve. Thanks to a semi-analytical formulation, it is easy to determine the total weld notch stress distribution. The involved weld load carrying stress component is a characteristic one and unique for each weld notch location. A double weld element beam model has been developed to replace the original single weld finite element beam model in order to capture correct estimates for the double sided longitudinal attachments. Alternatively, a parametric has been established as well. The weld notch angle has turned out to be a governing parameter. Evaluation of the fatigue resistance of the welded double sided longitudinal attachment using the Total Stress concept shows a better accuracy in comparison to the nominal stress, hot spot structural stress and effective notch stress concept results. A governing factor for double sided longitudinal attachments is investigated which is the base plate thickness <i>t</i><sub><i>b</i></sub>. Although, the IIW classifies the longitudinal attachment based on the attachment length <i>l<sub>a</sub></i>, the base plate thickness <i>t<sub>b</sub></i> is much more dominant. <b>Fatigue testing of single sided butt joints using a Hexapod<br/></b>The riser system forms a significant part of the development costs for floating offshore oil production facilities. The SCReen joint industry project aims to optimise the fatigue design and maintenance costs for Steel Catenary Risers (SCR’s). Generally, published fatigue resistance data of SCR welded joints are performed using resonance bending tests, which have two major limitations: a very high mean stress state and unrealistic variable amplitude loading. In order to obtain realistic fatigue resistance data, the SCReen project plans to do the fatigue tests with the Hexapod. A dedicated specimen containing the critical single sided butt joint has been designed  in order to obtain fatigue failure at the required location, involving two girth welds at the flange-pipe connection and the single sided butt joint at the middle of the specimen. With a post welding improvement, fatigue failure at the intended weld root location can be obtained.","Fatigue resistance; Welded joint; Marine structures; Offshore structures; Hot spot stress; Total stress concept; S-N Curves","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

So far mainly small-scale tests have been performed to quantify wave attenuating properties of vegetation. To quantify the effect of more extreme wave conditions (high-water levels and wave heights), full scale tests are required. In the Delta flume of Deltares large-scale physical model tests with a willow forest of 40 meters in front of a dike are conducted. Three different measuring methods: visual measurements, terrestrial laser scanning and video imaging, are used to quantify the wave run-up and wave-overtopping on the dike. This is the first time a ‘Machine Learning algorithm’ is used to obtain the wave run-up heights on a dike from video footages. It is also new that the wave overtopping volumes are determined by a laser scanner without using a wave overtopping tank, which was initially used to collect and measure the real overtopping volume.<br/><br/>Results by the laser scanner show an overestimation of the overtopping discharges at high water level for higher crest freeboards, making these results less reliable. However, more research and a thorough validation are required to confirm the accuracy of this method. <br/>From results obtained by flume experiments can be concluded that remote sensing: laser scanner and video imaging, are accurate methods to measure the run-up on a dike. Thus, the camera in combination with Machine Learning is an accurate, simple and low-cost technique, to measure the wave run-up on a dike. Results from the camera not only give the run-up height, but also give new insights in the variations of the wave run-up over the dike. <br/><br/>It can also be concluded that a willow forest of 40 meters causes a significant reduction in the wave run-up and overtopping, for both willows in summer and winter state. Further research is needed, so these significant reductions can be implemented in the design and assessment of dikes.<br/><br/>The most commonly used models for designing a dike are the TAW (2002) and EurOtop. Comparing the obtained results, show that the determined wave run-up from the experiments are underestimated by the TAW (2002). The TAW is an empirical formula, based on a large data set of mainly small-scale experiments. Therefore, the difference between the test results and the TAW could likely be attributed to scale effects. However, more measurements at full scale are needed to confirm this.<br","Vegetation; Storm conditions; Dike height; Run-up; Overtopping; Remote sensing; Camera; Machine Learning; Laser scanner; Run-up reduction; Large Scale; Flume experiments; TAW (2002); Delta Flume; Willows; Nature based flood defence; Woods versus Waves","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-04-29","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","WOODY",""

This is an enormous challenge considering that over 90 percent of the houses and service sector buildings in the Netherlands are currently heated by the local combustion of natural gas (Hans Ariëns, 2018). The objective of this policy measure is in line with the European climate targets to mitigate the effect of climate change (Klimaatberaad, 2018a). Moreover, it helps to facilitate the Dutch policy to stop the natural gas extraction from the largest natural gas field in the Netherlands (Klimaatberaad, 2018a). To achieve the enormous objective in 2050, the Dutch government is choosing a gradual approach and formulated a first clear policy target for 2030. The CO2 emissions of the buildings induced by space heating and domestic water heating need to be reduced by 3,4 Mt compared to the 1990 levels (Klimaatberaad, 2018a). Sustainability measures in the service sector should lead to a reduction of 1 Mt and phasing out natural gas in 1.5 million houses in combination with insulation measures should cover the remainder of 2 Mt (Klimaatberaad, 2018a). To adequately meet the demand for space heating and domestic water heating in 2030 and beyond, alternative heating technologies need to be integrated in the energy infrastructures to provide the desired energy demand to the buildings. Natural gas is currently distributed by means of an extensive gas infrastructure. There is a potential to use the existing infrastructure to distribute and store sustainable gasses such as biomethane or hydrogen (Dodds &amp; McDowall, 2013). Alternative energy infrastructures can also replace the natural gas infrastructure in the satisfaction of the energy demand. Possibilities are the electricity infrastructure and a district heating infrastructure. Energy can also be produced locally from renewable energy sources as biomass, geothermal energy, solar energy, and wind energy","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

Allseas’ Tog Mor is a shallow water pipelay barge capable of laying pipes up to a water depth of 25 meters. Currently, Tog Mor is more than forty years old and is due for replacement. Therefore, Allseas has considered to replace Tog Mor with a new shallow water pipelay barge. However, it is unclear whether the current barge is optimised for pipelaying since it is designed for crane supported purposes. The aim of this research is to give insight into vessel properties which determine the pipelaying performances and to define a set of design requirements for the new shallow water pipelay barge, Tog Mor 2.0. To define the requirements of Tog Mor 2.0, the principles of Systems Engineering are followed. Based on the operational analysis, the performances of Tog Mor can be improved by a reduction of the theoretical peak cycle time, optimisations of the pipelaying process and a reduction of downtime. The output of the operational analysis in combination with the principles of pipelaying results in potential bottlenecks. Those performances and potential bottlenecks were the input of the functional definition of Systems Engineering. The aim of this functional definition is to allocate functions to systems and to prioritise the design focus point in terms of functions. Those functions were translated into hardware components and integrated in the total design. Due to the inversely proportional relationship of the number of production days and corresponding production costs, an increased number of stations and lay speed do not have an advantage in terms of costs. In order to reduce the theoretical peak cycle time, the specifications of the functional equipment are improved and the need of buoyancy modules is reduced. Less need of buoyancy modules is achieved by the increased capacity of the tensioner (two tensioners of 100 ton each) and an inner stinger. The pipelaying process is optimised by free deck space, a higher level of redundancy of the functional equipment and new technologies of equipment. The level of redundancy in combination with the improved workability results in a reduction of downtime. Those improvements results in a final concept design which proposes a barge with an off-centre firing-line of five stations (three welding stations, one testing &amp; grit blasting station, one coating station). As a result of an improvement of each individual function and the interactions among those functions, an improvement of 30% in terms of theoretical minimum peak cycle is achieved by an optimisation of the pipelaying process and potential bottlenecks. A reduction of the peak cycle time, an optimised pipelaying process and a reduction of downtime percentages results in an improved overall performance of Tog Mor 2.0 compared to the current Tog Mor.","Shallow water pipelay barge; Ship design; Systems Engineering","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The simulated re-entry data is used to determine what optical instrument is needed to track or detect these objects. The calculations take into account the reflected sunlight, Earth’s thermal irradiance and atmospheric transparency, and the requirement of a sufficient signal-to-noise ratio and signal-to-background ratio. The investigated meteors, with a minimal absolute magnitude of -2.9, and the two investigated Hayabusa and Stardust re-entry capsules can be tracked from GEO for at least 3 consecutive observations with a sub 1 meter aperture diameter optical instrument. A 2 to 5 second tracking time of the investigated meteors requires aperture diameters between 0.1 m and 0.87 m. For 20 second tracking of the re-entry capsules a 0.1 m aperture diameter is needed, which increases to 0.27 m when tracking for 50 seconds.

In the installed simulations, the propeller was first modelled as an actuator disk, and afterwards with a full blade model. The results indicate two main disadvantages of square ducts.

The result of this research was a process framework together with a workshop for validating a blockchain use case’s strength and potential.<br/><br/>In recent years, blockchain technology has gained tremendous popularity. The Bitcoin craze of 2017 has led many people and companies to explore the core technology behind it: blockchain. This has resulted in a large influx of capital into the industry, as many companies are now looking to reap the widely speculated advantages this technology might offer.<br/>However, with the rise of its popularity there were also challenges that arose for companies experimenting with blockchain. First, the technology itself is still rather immature. There are no product archetypes which are considered to be industry standard. For some, Bitcoin is still the ‘perfect use case’ of blockchain, but many disagree. This has led to many projects trying to reinvent the wheel. To do this, significant expertise and manpower is required. This has led to a strong rise in demand for blockchain knowledge, in particular blockchain developers.<br/><br/>GoBlock, a blockchain consultancy startup based in Amsterdam, recognizes this need and views it as opportunity. With a strong development department, they are looking to cater to the need of blockchain expertise. After all, a lot of money has been poured into the industry, and with milestones not being hit and succesful product launches being extremely rare, the pressure is on for these companies.<br/><br/>This thesis hence aims to provide GoBlock with a way to structure their blockchain consulting process. The goal was to do this in a way that would result in the creation of succesful products (i.e. products providing value), as this is lacking in the industry.<br/><br/>Initial findings showed that the blockchain industry, and with that blockchain projects, are largely dominated by engineers and developers. This results in a technology-centered approach to blockchain development. Research showed that a multidisciplinary and design-driven approach can benefit blockchain development, both on a product level and on an innovation level.<br/><br/>An analysis of current consulting practices was conducted. It was found that the industry leader (IBM) utilizes Design Thinking methods in parts of their consulting process. However, it was concluded that the majority of competitors apply the technology-centered approach. Hence, herein lies an opportunity for GoBlock to distinguish themselves from the competition, while better addressing market needs.<br/><br/>Additionally, a company analysis was conducted. First, a case study was done to study goBlock’s previous processes. This showed that there was a fundamental lack of structure in GoBlock’s process. Moreover, the case study brought forward three main challenges that hinder the success of a blockchain product. These are:<br/>1. Blockchain technology is used for cases in which the technology does not need to be used.<br/>2. The strategic impact of a blockchain use case is not evident for the customer’s business. It is not always clear how business value will be created, if at all.<br/>3. Stakeholder needs (i.e. user values) are left out of the equation. By not taking into account user needs and values, products are created that might never be adopted.<br/><br/>Therefore, this thesis proposes the addition of a validation step in GoBlock’s process. GoBlock can play a key role in assessing the validity of blockchain use cases before engaging in a development project with their customer. This can not only benefit the technology’s reputation, but applying user-centered approach to blockchain use case development allows GoBlock to distinguish themselves from competition.<br/><br/>To achieve this, a process framework is designed based on literature research and findings from expert interviews. This process framework contains two overall phases: validation and creation. In the first phase, GoBlock sits with the customer to assess the validity and potential of the customer’s use case. In this phase the use case can be reshaped and finetuned. This, in order to make sure that when the project reaches the development phase, an actual valuable product is developed, rather than just a pilot.<br/>The goal of the workshop is to spark awareness about blockchain’s actual strategic impact, and that people in the blockchain industry should look beyond the technological realm to determine whether a use case is good or not. If mass adoption is to be reached, a user-centered approach is needed. This is where Design Thinking can be of value.<br/><br/>The framework and workshop were validated with students and the company, leading to recommendations for further development.","Blockchain; Blockchain Use Cases; Consultancy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

The long-term crew planning problem aims to optimally plan the supply and demand for pilots as well as methods and strategies for closing the gap between these. The demand is determined by the number of pilots required at each crew position based on the demand for the flight schedule, training requirements, contractual agreements for holidays and off-days. The supply, on the other hand, is determined by the current pilot workforce and changes over time by factors such as retirements and illness. Finally, the inevitable gap between supply and demand can be closed by planning transitions for pilots to different crew positions and by recruiting new pilots. This project addresses the cockpit crew transition planning problem. This is an optimisation problem that aims to optimally assign transitions for pilots with the goal to minimise the shortages and surpluses in the supply of pilots, constraint to for example contractual and governmental agreements and capacity limitations. A heuristic local search method has been developed to plan and evaluate transitions for pilots between different crew positions. A tree search method is then used to select, at each iteration, the transition with the highest potential. In an experiment on various configurations of the model, the results are compared and recommendations are made on the best method to model the cockpit crew transition planning problem.","Airline; Crew; Optimisation; Transition; Planning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-05-03","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

This change is often expressed in a vision which should engage and involve all stakeholders. However, implementing change successfully turns out to be a challenge since two in three change processes stall. Ink Strategy is a visual consulting agency that helps organisations to formulate their vision. They use visual thinking to create a shared image of the vision, with a tangible visualisation as concrete output. This is accomplished in co-creation sessions with their clients. While vision formulation is important, Ink aspires to extend their service to later phases of the change process. They want to offer a more holistic solution to their clients and collaborate on longer projects. However, Ink’s clients approach them as visualisers and not change consultants. To overcome this, Ink needs to discover the needs of their clients and develop their service accordingly. Therefore, the aim of this research is to investigate how Ink can extend their visual thinking services to add value in later phases of the process of organisational change. To reach this aim, literature research, internal and external analysis, observations and client interviews were performed to find the strengths and weaknesses of Ink and the challenges their clients face in the change process. Ink’s strengths and their clients’ challenges were matched to form opportunities. The most promising opportunities for Ink Strategy are:<br/>Planning the change;<br/>Translating vision to daily work;<br/>Training ambassadors;<br/>Training and activating people;<br/>Sharing results;<br/>Changing daily work routines.<br/>These opportunities provide a general answer to the aim of this research. The opportunity “Changing daily work routines” was developed into the new service “Redesigning Routines” to show more specifically how Ink can extend their portfolio. Redesigning Routines is a service that follows Ink’s services on vision formulation. The aim of the service is to translate the abstract vision to concrete, daily work, help people to understand the values that drive their behaviour and give them direction on how to change. This is achieved by a workshop with a co-creative, visual approach. The workshop provides a safe space for reflection, helping people to make their values explicit and formulate concrete steps for change. The end result of the workshop is a visualisation of a newly designed work routine, that is in line with the new vision, and a concrete list of actions to ensure people will start to experiment with desired behaviour. Eventually, this should result in behavioural change among employees, to accomplish the company vision. The service connects well to Ink’s current portfolio since it bridges the gap between an abstract vision and concrete, daily work that needs to change. The service mostly helps to empower people: it helps them to understand underlying values that drive behaviour and to gain direction on how to change. This approach might be rather unique: consultancy firms do provide services on change activation, but they do not consciously take into account the underlying needs of employees.","organisational change; organisational routines; visual thinking; change; routines; behaviour; values","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

The GPU-Resident Atmospheric Simulation Platform (GRASP) was used to simulate the atmosphere around the Cabauw experimental site for atmospheric research (CESAR) in the Netherlands. Large-scale boundary conditions were provided by coupling the simulation to a general circulation model (GCM). Radiative tendencies were calculated using two di_erent implementations of the Rapid Radiative Transfer Method for GCMs (RRTM-G): one runs in advance of the simulation using pre-calculated atmospheric _elds, the other employs dynamically updated _elds during the simulation. Both con_gurations generated simulations of every day in 2016, which were compared to each other and validated using observations from the Baseline Surface Radiation Network (BSRN). This study revealed that the implementation of interactive radiation altered cloud representation in the simulations, in most cases causing clouds to rise. This process correlated with an increase in turbulence kinetic energy of up to 2 m2/s2 locally. The clouds that were raised tended to break up more often between 5 and 7 km altitude, leading to a decrease in average cloud fraction and increase in short-wave down-welling radiation. The results suggest that the implementation of interactive radiation enabled the development of cloud top entrainment instabilities, which could be responsible for the cloud breakup in these cases. Regardless of the chosen implementation of the radiative transfer method, large errors are made in the prediction of surface solar radiation. GRASP produced root mean squared errors (RMSE) of 122.4 W/m2 and 115.7 W/m2 using prescribed and interactive radiation, respectively, while the large-scale model used to provide the initial and boundary conditions to the simulation produced an RMSE of 87.3 W/m2. The large error in GRASP's prediction of surface solar radiation can partly be attributed to conversion errors made during GRASP's initialization of the thermodynamic state, which lead to erroneous diagnoses of the liquid water content in the atmosphere.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Physics","",""

The goal of this research is to find out if it is possible to estimate the bicycle tyre behaviour in terms of vertical stiffness, cornering stiffness and camber stiffness based on known parameters like the inflation pressure, tyre width, rim width, vertical load and the rubber compound using a tyre model. An important part of this thesis are tyre models. The measurement data will be analysed using various tyre models. The first used tyre model is the brush model. This model uses a single material parameter and it turns out that this is too less to be able to extract clear relations between the tyre behaviour and the known parameters like inflation pressure, tyre width and rim width. The second tyre model that is used is the enhanced string model. This model is an extension of the brush model. This model has three material parameters for the vertical direction and also three material parameters for the lateral direction. Investigating this model shows that there is reasonable suspicion to assume that one of the model parameters represents the inflation pressure. In order to find the material parameters for every tyre, inflation pressure and normal load combination a parameter optimisation is required. The results from this parameter optimisation show that the suspected model parameter is actually not related to the inflation pressure. When the obtained model parameters from the optimisation are put back into the tyre model interesting results are acquired, because the model output agrees fairly well with the measurement data. This is unexpected because the model parameters were differing a lot depending on how they were obtained, e.g. obtaining the parameters from cornering stiffness or from camber stiffness. The answer to the research question is no. In order to extract relations between the model parameters and the tyres behaviour depending on their measurable properties, a lot more complete measurements are needed. The whole idea was to be able to estimate tyre behaviour without the need of extensive testing. This still might be possible, but in order to to that a lot more measurements are needed first. These measurements should create a baseline of model parameters which can be used to estimate the model parameters of unmeasured tyres.","bicycle tyres; tyre models; bicycle tyre measurements; bicycle tyre behaviour; bicycle tyre properties","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

Worldwide, this technology is in the lift and enabling the exchange of information through voice interactions. As a result of the growing popularity of this technology, companies fanatically started with the designing of their own skills and/or actions. But although, this over-enthusiasm, leaves the ‘why-question’ unanswered. This is the result of a technology push: the technology is leading, putting human needs in its shade <br/>What is actually the problem that a VUI is solving? And is this really better compared to existing solutions? How do we make sure the integration of voice technology simplifies and enriches our lives? How do we design voice interactions that matter? Human-centered voice design is the answer. <br/>Therefore, the central aim of this research is to enhance designers in the creation of meaningful voice interactions. The research has been divided into a theoretical background part and an exploratory research part, with methods including case studies, interviews and observations. The insights gathered through this research are boiled down into a condensed framework showing how designers could incorporate human-centered VUI design in their processes. The argument put forth in this research is that context factors and human-centered values determine to what extent a use case is meaningful, in relation to one’s job to be done. The proposed human-centered values are enlarging accessibility, enhancing convenience and/or enhancing experience. Building on this argument, a toolkit has been developed, turning the theory into a hands-on product to incorporate in every VUI design project. The toolkit includes a canvas to discover and validate human-centered VUI use cases and a card deck which both clarifies the canvas’ elements as well as triggers the designer’s VUI imagination with inspiring examples. With the canvas, you decide step-by-step if voice technology provides the right solution for the fulfillment of a job to be done, putting the needs of the human central to the modal. In chronological order these steps include: Framing the Job to be done, checking the context factors, ensure human-centered value and ranking the use case’s feasibility. The card deck with examples of contexts, target groups and specific types of interaction in which a VUI could be of extra value stimulates the creative process and hereby enhances the creation of meaningful voice use cases. Finally, the design approach and toolkit have been evaluated during a cooperative creative session with Valsplat and KPN online. Recommendatory insights gathered during this session create a revised version in the shape of a workshop. This set-up enables Valsplat to help organizations in creating voice solutions based on customer needs. With the results followed from this project, they want to initiate a new movement: putting humans in the center of the voice revolution, towards a world with voice interactions that are worthy of humans’ precious time!","Voice; VUI; human; centered; design; process; toolkit; card; canvas; humanvui","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""
