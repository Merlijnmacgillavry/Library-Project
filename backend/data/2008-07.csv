(mentor); Ligthart, L.P. (mentor)","2008","In this thesis, image processing algorithms are applied to 3D GPR images, in order to improve the detection capabilities of a radar system. Detection based on the magnitude of the reflected signals may miss weak targets. On the other hand, an analysis of the texture properties of a target, i.e. the repeating pattern all over the surface, which is independent on the signal intensity, discriminates it better from the clutter. The texture analysis algorithm applied to 2D and 3D radar images is called Texture Feature Coding Method (TFCM). It highlights neighboring volume pixels (voxels) with high correlation and it has been applied iteratively to global and local volumes of the 3D image, in order to improve the detection of weak targets. The measurement of the correlation between neighboring voxels is based on a tolerance value, and an threshold algorithm to automatically detect this value has been customized. Image visualization is performed with automatic threshold selection, extracted from the histogram of the 3D images. The algorithm has been applied to images of landmines or mine-simulant objects laying on the surface, giving remarkable results. The method is successfully able to detect the targets and to highlight their edges, allowing a realistic visualization of the shapes of the targets. Further research in this direction is suggested: tests on buried targets should be performed in order to validate the algorithm. A degradation of the results is expected when buried targets are used, however, texture features can be extracted and object classification techniques can be used in order to discriminate between clutter and targets.","gpr; imaging; texture; feature","en","master thesis","TU Delft, Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science, International Research Centre for Telecommunications and Radar (IRCTR)","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","","","","",""

(mentor)","2008","Fingerprint identification or verification is used more often in civilian applications. In the near future, Automatic Fingerprint Identification Systems (AFIS) can be found on mobile phones or smartcards. Most AFIS are however computationally intensive, and are designed for execution on large systems such as PC's. The main bottleneck is the minutiae extraction part. In this thesis a solution is presented to perform this part on a FPGA. The solution consists of a modified version of the MINDTCT system, designed by NIST. It runs on an open-source micro-controller called LEON2, that is created by Gaisler. Both the software and hardware are modified to form a well operating minutiae extractor. The software is stripped and fixed-point conversion is performed. Also some algorithms are modified to enhance performance. For the LEON the right configuration needed to be found. The most time consuming parts of the software are accelerated by using co-processors. They where connected to the micro-controller, by using the CPI interface. This project shows it is possible to run a fingerprint minutiae extractor on a FPGA, while using limited resources. Because the software is very computationally intensive, it takes an average of 60 seconds to complete one fingerprint. The accelerators will speed-up the system by almost 40%. The solution is based on the System-on-Chip (SoC) principle and therefore provides a perfect basis for a low-power fingerprint chip.","fingerprint; soc; fpga; leon","en","master thesis","TU Delft, Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science, Building Technology","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","","","","",""

Due to material wear down, trains can break down and stop functioning. To prevent this from happening, modern technology can used be for condition monitoring to recognize material wear down and thus allowing trains to be mended in time. The Dutch Railways approached Logica to come up with a solution that performs condition monitoring inside a train environment. Logica's solution is the implementation of a wireless sensor network (WSN), where powered sensor nodes will be mounted as a linear array in a train compartment. These nodes will be used as a backbone network for data transport of certain train application sensor network, where data transport reliability is of major importance. This thesis project shows how a reliable sensor network can be established. This report discusses relevant terminology on sensor networking, presents background information and quantifying models on data transport reliability and introduces relevant data transport reliability protocol solutions. Based on the train applications that will use the backbone network, this report shows what the relevant requirements are for establishing such a reliable data transport network. Based on these requirements, protocol solutions are selected that improve data transport reliability. Finally, the reliability and performance evaluation of a sensor network shows how the selected protocol solutions perform and in which way they contribute to data transport reliability.","wireless; sensor network; EMC; reliability; commuter; train; Logica","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2009-05-08","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Computer Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Steenhuisen, J.R. (mentor); Roos, C. (mentor); Kluit, P.G. (mentor)","2008","Transportation problems are common, but complex. Therefore, it is not surprising that much effort is put into finding solving methods which generate high quality solutions in little time. Some of those solving methods are developed as planning systems and tested at the Artificial Intelligence Planning Systems (AIPS) or International Planning Competition (IPC). Others are developed as (rich) Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) solvers and tested against some benchmarks. It seems that developers of planning systems considering transportation problems and developers of VRP solvers are actually working on some similar, if not the same problems. Yet, it seems that cooperation between them is scarce. This can be explained by the different general goals they have. The Artificial Intelligence (AI) community focuses on creating general planners which can handle general, domain independent planning problems, while the main focus of the Operations Research community concerning transportation problems is solving a specific class of problems, which are based on Linear Programming, optimally. Nevertheless, the solutions sought for VRPs and some transportation planning problems are often solutions which are minimized in the number of movements, or the length of the movements, and in computation time. To show that some of those AI transportation planning problems and VRP variants are similar, we will show that a transportation problem used in the AIPS competitions can be written as a rich VRP. We will compare the AI planners used in the mentioned competitions with a specific rich VRP solver and a Mixed Integer Program (MIP) solver. This will show that, considering the quality of the plans, the best results are generated by the rich VRP and the MIP solvers(1), followed by the AI planners FF and SGPlan. It will be shown that especially the rich VRP and the MIP solver are quite slow. Hence, for rapid results, the AI planners, especially YAHSP, are to be preferred, although the price is less plan quality. We will also show that when a decomposition method is applied to the AI planner YAHSP, the loss in plan quality will be considerably reduced, which causes it to be comparable to the plan quality with the other planners and the VRP solvers. (1)Under assumption that the results of 50% of the tested problem instances, which are quite small, are nevertheless, representative.","logistics planning problem domain; artificial intelligence","en","master thesis","TU Delft, Electrical Engineering, Mathematics, Computer Sci, Information and Communication Technology (ICT)","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","","","","",""

EnerPlug is een stekker die tussen een apparaat en een stopcontact geplaatst wordt om zo het energieverbruik te meten. De EnerPlug verstuurt de meetgegevens naar het EnerStation die deze bewaart. De gebruiker kan met de EnerView software de meetgegevens ophalen van het EnerStation. Omdat natuurlijke bronnen steeds sneller uitgeput raken is het noodzakelijk dat consumenten zich bewust zijn van onder andere hun energieverbruik. Dit is meestal niet zo en vaak komt de jaarlijkse energierekening dan ook als een onaangename verrassing. EnerSense wil consumenten helpen om zich bewust te worden en ontwikkelt daarom het EnerBox meetsysteem. Deze thesis heeft in de eerste plaats tot doel om de ontwikkeling en de werking van de EnerPlug uiteen te zetten. Voor een uiteenzetting over de andere onderdelen van de EnerBox wordt de lezer verwezen naar de twee andere thesissen van onze werkgroep, (Jabri, 2008) en (Hosseini, 2008). De belangrijkste functie van de EnerPlug is het meten van het energieverbruik van het op de plug aangesloten apparaat. Voor het meten van het energieverbruik van een apparaat is het nodig om de stroom en de spanning te meten. Met deze twee meetgegevens wordt door middel van enkele berekeningen het energieverbruik van het aangesloten apparaat bepaald. Deze berekeningen worden met een microcontroller gedaan. Een microcontroller kan dit nauwkeurigheid, is flexibel, betrouwbaar en instelbaar. Verder beperkt het gebruik van een microcontroller het aantal onderdelen en de kostprijs. De informatie wordt verzonden worden naar het EnerStation. Hiervoor wordt een signaal via het lichtnet verstuurd, wat het EnerStation kan ontvangen. Dit kost weinig energie, heeft voldoende bereik en bespaart op de installatie- en aanschafkosten. De informatie wordt eens per minuut naar het EnerStation verstuurd. Zo kan het energieverbruik van een apparaat snel genoeg gevolgd worden, terwijl toch binnen de beperkte beschikbare bandbreedte van het signaal op het lichtnet wordt gebleven. Zodoende kunnen er 250 EnerPlugs tegelijkertijd op een EnerStation worden aangesloten.","vermogen meting; energie verbruik","nl","bachelor thesis","TU Delft, Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science, Electrical Power Engineering","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","","","","",""

This change has most manifested itself in the form of ongoing coastal erosion, which now has reached a level that essential infrastructure is at risk. The clay cliffs south of the beach are eroding at a rate of 1 m a year, while the erosion along the sandy beach is even greater. To counteract this erosion, 12 rock groynes were constructed at the northern part of the beach. To determine the possible causes of this erosion, the hydraulic conditions are analysed. In the wave analysis, offshore wave conditions are obtained from WAM simulations. After a statistical analysis, these conditions are transferred to the shore using the program SWAN. This SWAN model computes the nearshore wave climate. The flow conditions and tide-induced sediment transport are analysed with a 2-dimensional flow model constructed with Delft3D. In this flow model, different scenarios are simulated. This makes it possible to determine the influence of the harbour and the reclamation on the flow conditions and tide-induced sediment transport. The actual sediment transport capacity resulting from the computed wave- and flow conditions are calculated with UNIBEST-LT. With defined cross-shore profiles along Rosslare Strand, these capacities give valuable information about the sediment balance of the beach.","erosion","en","master thesis","TU Delft, Civil Engineering and Geosciences, Hydraulic Engineering","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","","","","",""

PURPOSE: Bacteria detection after a colon surgery is an essential tool to prevent infection of the patient. With this aim we are developing an efficient miniaturized optical measurement sensor to detect bacteria in an early stage. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A near-IR Led emitting at a spectral range around 1950nm is driven by a pulsed current of 160 mA. This pulse is generated with 20% duty cycle and frequency of 400Hz. The optical intensity is detected by a Photodiode which is sensitive in the mid-IR spectral range from 800nm to 2400nm. Between the Led and Photodiode we place a sample holder which consists of 2 beta cells made of CaF2. The distance of the Led and Photodiode is 1 cm. The beta cells are 0.5cm thick each and the ring separator is 0.01cm thick. The generation of the photocurrent is converted to voltage with 100.000 amplification. This voltage output is signal processed by LabView software and the display is the monitor of a PC. The absorption by the biofluid material in the sample is related to the bacteria density. RESULTS: The sample that is used to imitate plasma is water with salt solution. We created an amount of liquid volume with equal distribution. The difference in peak-to-peak voltage measurement is measure of absorption that is caused by the content of the sample. CONCLUSION: This optical measurement system provides the ability to do an early bacteria detection real-time. The components are installed in a compactly mechanical box which gives the ability to use this measurement setup bedside of the patient.","near-infrared; led; photodiode; bacteria; anastomosis","en","master thesis","TU Delft, Electrical Engineering, Mathematics, Computer Sci, Microelectronics","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","","","","",""

Het idee voor dit systeem is ontstaan binnen de vakgroep Wireless and Mobile Communications (WMC), onderdeel van de TU Delft. WMC ontwikkelde in 2007 een testopstelling voor driedimensionale positiebepaling die gebruik maakte van akoestische golven. Een groep van vijf studenten heeft dit idee in 2008 verder uitgewerkt door een businessplan en twee thesissen op te stellen. De hieruit volgende systemen kunnen detecteren of een badgast in een noodsituatie verkeert. Bij detectie slaat het systeem alarm. Dit helpt de toezichthouders het zwembad veilig te houden. Om te kunnen detecteren of een zwemmer in een noodsituatie verkeert, bepaalt het systeem de positie van de zwemmer. Het systeem bepaalt aan de hand van deze positie of de toezichthouder gealarmeerd moet worden. De betrouwbaarheid van het gehele systeem hangt daarom nauw met de betrouwbaarheid van de positie samen, een betrouwbare positie is dus essentieel voor een betrouwbaar antiverdrinkingssysteem. Het doel van deze thesis is een systeemontwerp en de stappen daartoe te presenteren. Dit systeem maakt deel uit van een antiverdrinkingssysteem en bepaalt de positie van zwemmers in zwembaden. Gegevens zijn verzameld door middel van experimenteel onderzoek en literatuuronderzoek. De randvoorwaarden en uitgangspunten waarmee bij het ontwerp rekening is gehouden, zijn gebruiksvriendelijkheid voor de zwemmer, betrouwbaarheid en een eenvoudige installatie van het systeem. De ontwerpresultaten zijn als volgt. Er is besloten om het apparaat dat de zwemmer draagt klein en simpel te houden en dit apparaat enkel als zender te configureren. Het hoofdsysteem heeft de taak om dit signaal te ontvangen en de positie te bepalen. Voor communicatie in water is na onderzoek besloten om het systeem te baseren op akoestische golven. Er is gekozen om Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS) modulatie toe te passen gecombineerd met Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA). Door middel van Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA) en het iteratieve Gauss-Newton algoritme wordt de positie van de zwemmers bepaald.","positiebepaling; onderwater; zwemmers; Bluewatch","nl","bachelor thesis","TU Delft, Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science, Telecommunications","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","","","","",""

(mentor)","2008","Because many errors still exist in information systems for organizations, professional companies like CEPO are needed for testing information systems on their fit to the organization. To do so, one usually applies a testing framework. The existing (CEPO-way) framework is the result of ten years of experience. The DEMO methodology (Dietz [1]) is a methodology that has proven itself successful in modelling organizations. DEMO is a powerful tool for identifying all important transactions of an organization (as well as communication with external actors). From this point of view, it could be possible to use DEMO as an aid to check the completeness of an information system, i.e. whether it covers the essential business processes. Note that the coverage need not be full; in particular for small and medium-sized enterprises it may be partial. The existing CEPO-way framework is based on the DEMO methodology, but on only one model. In this study two models were added. The new, so-called DEMO-way, framework was discussed and one test case was used to demonstrate the added value. The new framework is supported by a tool that was built by the author, DEMO-way Script Creator (DSC tool). This tool is a valuable addition to the derivation of testing scripts, because the process model as well as the state model can be placed into the scripts with little effort. Several criteria were determined at the start of this study in order to evaluate the use of extra DEMO models in the framework: development time, walkthrough time, understandability, reproduction possibilities and lacking functionality / error detection. Ultimately, the DEMO-way scored better for many of these criteria, especially the detection of lacking functionality / errors in information systems. Although the DEMO testing script encompasses more testing instructions than the CEPO testing script, the testers did not spend more time walking through the scripts, due to more detailed navigation. Therefore, the recommendation is to start using the two extra DEMO models in combination with DSC tool.","testing; information systems; process modelling","en","master thesis","TU Delft, Electrical Engineering, Mathematics, Computer Science, Computer Science","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","","","","",""

The construction of city have merely provided an active frame, but the spatial content and the intention are moving the most direct factor with the crowd. If I defines the crowd's activity and movement as a language pattern on a physical stratification plane, then whether should redefine the construction body and city infrastructure, which as the basic composition of city structure? How about the relation between the crowd flowing and the state of city? Whether these mamade solid states are merely our language carrier in cities? Perhaps they have exchange ability similarly, which is not in one obvious vague way but keeps transmitting human society's running status. Returns to the topic of language, we know bases on the most basic sound language of human, we grows more ways to go to more direct transmission on some domains of information. It includes the sign language, the flag indicator, radio signals, photoelectron signal, even the popular language in network today. We may create the language patterns in an unlimited extent, but they finally still might be by translated between each other or reduced back to the most basic languages of Vision and sense of hearing. In this design, I see the artificial movement and city construction as a pair of translation code of language. Through definition and judgment to some basic morpheme which are neglected but actually the most direct city relations: Crowd's movement and city information flowing. Train station. What worth mentioning is, in the language of city construction, we may see equally the clear language structure and the division of labor, which is similar to our noun and the verb, but as a whole, the instructions transmission also can form the linkage similarly as what the network effects.In this design, I choose Rotterdam Train station to take the location, according to some qualities which the transportation constructions have; they may be regarded as environmental translator of this city language, sender and regulator. Characteristic: 1- Instantaneity: The crowd's movement can be regarded as the driving force of language system in this design. The human individual is basic simple exchange member in the information flowing. But as the transportation facility, the station is an ideal `air zone, the primitive information carrier cannot be disturbance by extra information space and the time dragging. 2- Concentricity: When crowd in the station is in collection, or the divergence, it is easier to observe and reorganize, especially for process of divergence is the key link to actuate the city space activities of language 3- Record: As a result of spatial need from station itself, often in access place, collection and distribution spatial location will be placed, but this also has provided the condition for the information recording and the induction. Design process The entire design may by regarded as an inference process, it starts from analyzes and comparisons between a pair of ancient East and West checkerboard games, to the summary on rules of crowds movement, thus establishes the integrated exchange relations in between two stratification language planes, again arrives the running rules establishment for main body construction, until final design to construct the main body and the city interaction model. the principle is how to select the cross points between two language patterns throughout the whole design, thus get the determination for translation way, and expresses it with the building and spatial methods.","super-conductive-surface(scs); predomination; calculation unit; loop trace; disorder degree","en","master thesis","TU Delft, Department of Architecture, Architecture","","","","","","","","Architecture","","","","",""

(mentor)","2008","Op optiemarkten en beurzen wordt gehandeld in aandelen en opties. Er zijn heel veel verschillende soorten opties, de bekendste zijn waarschijnlijk de Europese calloptie en putoptie. Dit zijn opties die de houder de mogelijkheid geven om op een bepaald tijdstip in de toekomst aandelen te kopen, respectievelijk te verkopen, voor een van tevoren vastgestelde prijs. In dit bachelorproject wordt vooral gekeken naar de calloptie en een combinatie van de call- en putoptie. Het model van Samuelson voor het verloop van de aandeelprijs geeft een manier om een faire optieprijs te berekenen. Dit leidt tot de bekende Black-Scholes vergelijking. Dit model gaat er echter vanuit dat er geen grote sporadische sprongen in de aandeelprijs voorkomen. In praktijk blijken deze sprongen wel degelijk voor te komen. We zullen bekijken hoe we een model kunnen opstellen voor het beschrijven van de aandeelprijs met sprongen. Dit leidt tot het model van Merton. Vervolgens kunnen we aan de hand van dit model een partiele integro differentiaal vergelijking opstellen voor het prijzen van de opties. Deze vergelijking kan numeriek worden opgelost. Na het prijzen van de opties gaan we het hedgen van opties onderzoeken. Er volgt nu een korte voorbeeld over was hedgen inhoudt. Wanneer je alleen putopties bezit, loop je het risico dat de aandeelprijs omhoog gaat en je verlies lijdt. Je wilt geen groot risico lopen en kunt door ook aandelen te kopen ervoor zorgen dat de totale waarde van de putopties plus aandelen niet heel veel stijgt of daalt als de aandeelprijs verandert. Dit heet hedgen. Het is het combineren van aandelen en opties om ervoor te zorgen dat het risico vermindert. We zullen onder andere onderzoeken hoe goed we kunnen hedgen wanneer de aandeelprijs sprongen vertoont en of het zin heeft om met meer verschillende soorten opties te hedgen. De opbouw van dit verslag ziet er als volgt uit. In hoofdstuk 3 staat een introductie over aandelen en opties. Daarna gaan we de aandeelprijs onder de loep nemen. In hoofdstuk 4 wordt gekeken naar het model van Samuelson voor de aandeelprijs zonder sprongen en het model van Merton met sprongen in de aandeelprijs. Ook staat er beschreven hoe we deze aandeelprijspaden kunnen simuleren. De processen waarmee de aandeelprijs zich in de twee modellen beweegt zijn Levy processen. Deze processen en eigenschappen ervan worden ook in hoofdstuk 4 besproken. In hoofdstuk 5 beginnen we met het opstellen van een hedgeportfolio. Hiermee leiden we vergelijkingen af voor de optieprijs. Uit de Feynman-Kac stelling volgt een manier om deze optieprijs te berekenen. Hiervoor wordt een Fouriertransformatie-methode gebruikt en een snel algoritme dat hierbij wordt gebruikt is het FFT-algoritme. Een foutschatting voor deze methode voor het prijzen van opties staat aan het einde van dit hoofdstuk. In hoofdstuk 6 zullen we verder ingaan op hedgeportfolio's. We zullen verschillende hedgestrategieen testen en beoordelen. Ook willen we weten wat de voor- en nadelen zijn van hedgen met sprongen in de aandeelprijs. Tenslotte volgen in hoofdstuk 7 een conclusie en suggesties voor verder onderzoek.","options","nl","bachelor thesis","TU Delft, Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science, Delft Institute of Applied Mathematics","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","","","","",""

(mentor)","2008","Unit testing is generally accepted as an aid to produce high quality code, and can provide quick feedback to developers on the quality of the software. To have a high quality and well maintained test suite requires the production and test code to synchronously co-evolve, as added or changed production code should be tested as soon as possible. Traditionally the quality of a test suite is measured using code coverage, but this measurement does not provide insight in how tests are used by developers. In this thesis we explore a new approach to analyse how tests in a system are used based on association rules mined from the system’s change history. The approach is based on the reasoning that an association rule between two entities, possibly of a different type, is a measure for the co-use of the entities. Case studies show that analysing all the resulting rules allows us to uncover the distribution of programmer effort over pure coding, pure testing, or a more test-driven practice. Another application of our approach is that we can express the number of tests that are truly co-evolving with their associated production class.","software testing; co-evolution; software maintenance; datamining","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Software Technology","","Software Engineering","",""

(mentor); Kleinsmann, M.S. (mentor)","2008","Royal Haskoning BM (healthcare department at Hoofddorp)* operates actively in the healthcare market, designing and consulting within care housing projects. Anticipating changes in the healthcare sector, Royal Haskoning foresees a strategic value that could profit the contractor by involving hospital stakeholders (employees, visitors and patients) in the early stage of the design phase of hospital building projects. User participation in architecture has been implemented but to a limited extent. Compared to user participation in product design, the involvement has many shortcomings, e.g. the user group of patients and visitors has never been involved, the stakeholders were only involved in the evaluative end phase of the building design process and there was often a mismatch in communications between hospital stakeholders and architects. In order to enable the design team (the architects) to benefit from the hospital stakeholder involvement, a common language must emerge which facilitates the design team to access stakeholder experiences and use these experiences for information and inspiration in the early phase of the hospital building design process. This common language should be a commonly shared design language that hospital stakeholders and the design team use to communicate verbally and visually. The common design language is the foundation of the Hospital Stakeholder Participation Method and includes both conventional design research methods (observation and interviewing) in order to obtain observable and explicit stakeholder knowledge, and generative techniques (group session, sensitising and generative tools) in order to obtain tacit and latent knowledge. Implementation of this method in an early stage of the design process would expose fully the hospital stakeholders’ experiences that contribute to an optimal hospital environment. *Since 2009: 4Building b.v.","Participatory design; Contextmapping; Healthcare; Housing; Architecture","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","","",""

Nowadays, these areas are still being rebuilt. Communication and transport infrastructures like ports are considered of vital importance for the regional development given that they facilitate the re-construction works, the distribution of goods and the passenger flow. The port of Meulaboh (Sumatra, Indonesia) was placed 200 km far from the place where the earthquake epicentre took place and was practically destroyed by the tsunami waves. After the catastrophe a jetty was built by the Singaporean Red Cross as a temporary structure. Presently it forms part of the UNDP recovery programme which intends to build a port to replace the facilities that used to be before the December 2004 catastrophe. For that reason the present situation of Meulaboh port is identified and its boundary conditions analysed in order to plan several possible layout alternatives according to the minimum requirements. The most suitable alternative for the port is identified by a Multi-Criteria Evaluation which takes into account the safety against future tsunami events. Once the most promising alternative has been selected it is developed in further detail given conceptual designs of the hydraulic structures and a detailed design of the protection works: a land-connected rubble mound breakwater. Also some tsunami mitigation and protection measures that can be applied to this layout are included. Finally some conclusions and recommendations for further studies about the project are given.","port; Indonesia; masterplan; tsunami; general cargo","en","master thesis","TU Delft, Civil Engineering and Geosciences, Hydraulic Engineering","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","","","","",""
