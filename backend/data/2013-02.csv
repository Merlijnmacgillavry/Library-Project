(mentor)","2013","Coastline modeling with UNIBEST: Areas close to structures In the world of coastline modeling there are several ways to predict coastline development. One of those is with the use of single line modeling software. This kind of modeling is rather basic, straight forward and fast, but it lacks some detail of different processes taking place. Processes that can have significant impact on the coastline development. This study aims at providing insight in approaches that can be used to model coastline development near structures. The focus of this study will lay on the use of UNIBEST-CL, a single line coastline modeling package, developed by Deltares. Creating a coastline model in UNIBEST-CL is rather user friendly, but if structures are present some extra work needs to be done to get reasonable output from the model. The standard approach of modeling structures in UNIBEST needs extra calculations of local wave climates in the shadow zone of structures. This can be done by hand, using formulations of Kamphuis and it can also be done by using a second modeling package called SWAN. Both these methods result in a more labour intensive calculation. Therefore, a third approach is developed. An automated module is integrated in the package of UNIBEST-CL. This approach uses the same Kamphuis formulations mentioned earlier. The main difference is that it calculates the local wave climates at every cross-shore ray of the UNIBEST model. Within an average model this will generate more local wave climates compared to the manual approach, resulting in more input information. To compare these three different approaches two kinds of models are created. First a theoretical study is carried out. Secondly, the results of the theoretical study are used to be verified in a field case situation. The theoretical study is based on two questions:  How does the Automated Kamphuis approach perform compared to Manual Kamphuis calculations and SWAN calculations?  Which modeling approach is suitable for what kind of conditions? To investigate these questions, a simple, straight coastline is created with three shore normal groynes. This configuration is tested with several changeable parameters, like different bottom profiles, wave conditions (height, period and direction) and cross shore locations of the local wave climates. After the calculations, the results are assessed by using a classification of the width of the transport zone divided by the length of the groynes. Using this classification, the results of all the runs are compared by looking at the resulting transport magnitude and the coastline shape. This leads to a final table that can be used as a recommendation on which approach to use in what kind of situation. The results of the theoretical study are used in a second calculation, to hindcast the coastline changes in a field application case at the beaches of Sitges, Spain. During the field case testing not all variants of the three approaches are used. Only one SWAN approach (50% groyne length) and the Automated Kamphuis are compared. While running this coastline model multiple adjustment of the Automated module were needed. Some programming code in the software needed to be adjusted during the calculations. Finally, the field case resulted in satisfactory results for both approaches. Some conclusions that can be drawn from both the theoretical and the field case study are:  The automated approach functions well compared to the manual approach with local climates at the shoreline. (The module in UNIBEST-CL works properly)  Using a classification ratio of width of transport zone divided by the length of the groyne one of the approaches can be chosen that will give the most optimal result in the specific situation.  If the ratio is very small (e.g. a small width off transport compared to the groyne length) the best approach will be the SWAN approach, because the most processes are taken into account in this situation.  With a larger ratio, Kamphuis, and therefore the Automated approach, will give better results, because it takes the effect of the structure into account, better than the SWAN approach.  The result of the field case shows that the Automated approach also works well in real situations, compared to the outcome of the SWAN approach.","Diffraction; UNIBEST; Coastline Modelling; Structures","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Coastal Engineering","",""

(mentor); Van Rijn, L.C. (mentor); Tonnon, P.K. (mentor); Van der Schrieck, G.L.M. (mentor); Walstra, D.J.R. (mentor)","2013","Problem definition The city Mar del Plata has one of Argentina's largest ports and biggest seaside beach resort. After the construction of the port, a steadily growing sandbank appeared in the port entrance and considerable erosion occurred on the northern beaches. To warrant the accessibility of the port, frequent maintenance dredging is needed, but no measures have been taken to prevent/reduce shoaling of the port access. After numerous unsafe situations for vessels, large shipping companies have decided to stop berthing at Mar del Plata. Improvement of the accessibility for large ships will significantly lower the (transport) costs and results in more income and new investments in port activities and infrastructure. Objectives The main objective of this M.Sc. study is to identify the most promising feasible measures that improve the accessibility of the port and reduce the costs of maintenance and to quantitatively evaluate the effects and costs of these measures to support further detailed morphodynamic and design studies. Methodology Available literature and data is studied and reviewed to gain insight in the local system. During a field trip in the province of Buenos Aires data is collected by performing field measurements and different meetings took place with local experts and stakeholders. To identify and quantify the physical processes influencing the accessibility of the port, a Delft3D-FLOW model of the present area around Mar del Plata is set up and validated using present and historical data. Due to the lack of (reliable) near shore wave data, the nearshore wave climate in the model is derived from offshore wave data, wind data, and bathymetric data using a Delft3D-WAVE model with a larger scale. Various theoretical measures are evaluated. The most feasible, durable, and efficient type of measures are selected and quantitatively evaluated. To estimate the effects of these measures, with a focus on sediment transports, each measure is simulated in the Delft3D-FLOW model. From the resulting sedimentation rates in the port entrance, the quantity of needed maintenance is estimated for each measure. To be able to compare the measures, the total costs of initial investments and future maintenance is estimated. Conclusions  Maintaining the original port access, without taking additional measures is not economic (total costs  2.5 to  5.4 million/year) and leads to frequent disturbance of the ship traffic. The irregular and uncertain circumstances are not attractive for companies and investors in the port and lead to higher transport costs.  Maintaining the original port access and construction and maintenance of a sand trap along the southern breakwater strongly reduces the maintenance need (and the disturbance for the ship traffic) inside the access channel with 90%. The maintenance of the sand trap can be executed on a regular base (without disturbance for other ship traffic) and the dredged material can be used to regularly nourish the eroding northern beaches. However, by applying this measure the expected reduction of total costs is 6% percent.  Maintaining the original port access and construction of an eastward groin at the tip of the southern breakwater appears to be the most economical solution with 80% reduction of the total costs. The groin deflects sediment to deeper water outside the navigation area and prevents the port access from shoaling, but this can also lead to a decrease of sediment supply to the northern beaches and thereby increased beach erosion.","sedimentation; accretion; shoaling; shoal; sand bank; port access; navigation channel; Mar del Plata; Buenos Aires; Argentina; drifter tracking; sediment sampling; sediment analysis; depth survey; field measurements; sedimentation study; NWW3; wave modelling; input reduction; reduced wave climate; evaluation of measures; sand trap; groin; hydrodynamics; initial sediment transports; Delft3D; cost estimation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Hydraulic Engineering","","-38.037, -57.517"

(mentor)","2013","In de geneeskunde wordt het gebruik van wiskundige modellen en computersimulaties steeds belangrijker. Zo kan steeds beter voorspeld worden hoe complexe systemen in het lichaam reageren op externe factoren zoals medicijnen. Een toepassing hiervan vindt men in kankeronderzoek. Cellen in het menselijk lichaam kunnen op twee manieren worden aangezet tot beweging. Actieve migratie wordt veroorzaakt doordat cellen elkaars aanwezigheid voelen en naar elkaar toe bewegen. Passieve migratie ontstaat als twee cellen tegen elkaar aan komen te liggen en door een afstotende kracht uit elkaar gaan bewegen. De fysieke eigenschappen van de cel en zijn omgeving beïnvloeden de mate waarin deze vormen van migratie plaatsvinden. Cellen maken ook een cyclus van groei en deling door, waarin een passieve ""pauzestand'' aan kan worden genomen als weefselgroei niet gewenst is. Als er een teveel aan cellen is, kunnen individuele cellen overgaan tot geprogrammeerde sterfte, de zogenaamde apoptose. De kansen dat een cel overgaat tot deling of sterfte worden beïnvloed door de mate waarin aanliggende cellen druk uitoefenen. Bij tumorcellen is dit mechanisme, dat ervoor zorgt dat cellen bij het juiste weefselvolume in ""pauzestand'' raken, ontregeld en gaan ze als gevolg hiervan ongecontroleerd en snel delen. Hierdoor wordt gezond weefsel weggedrukt en kan dit afsterven. Als een tumor zich uitbreidt naar ander weefsel spreken we van uitzaaiingen en lijdt het betreffende organisme aan kanker. In dit project is de manier waarop cellen elkaar onderling aanzetten tot migratie, groei en sterfte gemodelleerd en zijn de beginstadia van de ontwikkeling van een kolonie tumorcellen geïmplementeerd. In het bijzonder kijken we hierbij naar eenlagig plaveiselepitheel, zoals dat zich in de longblaasjes bevindt. Dit is gemodelleerd als een celkweek van een laag dik dat zich bevindt op een substraat dat ingekapseld is door een weefselwand. De beweging en groei worden beide met een Euler voorwaartse methode geïntegreerd. De nadruk is gelegd op een realistische en tijdsefficiëntie implementatie. Dit heeft geleid tot een model dat klaar is voor verder gebruik in onderzoek naar de eerste stadia van de ontwikkeling van een tumor.","celmigratie; celdeling; tumorvorming","nl","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Applied mathematics","","","",""

(mentor); Scholten, V.E. (mentor); Van der Voort, H.G. (mentor); Van Beers, C.P. (mentor)","2013","Because of the risks involved in financing in new high-tech, high-growth ventures, one of the few funding sources available is venture capital. Venture Capital firms are businesses that are owned and managed by venture capitalists (VCs). Within these firms the VCs manage Venture Capital funds, one VC or Venture Capital firm can manage multiple funds. The money in these funds is supplied by external investors. VCs have certain experiences and educational backgrounds (human capital) that leads them to implement a certain investment strategy which influences the returns of the funds. Historically the returns for Venture Capital funds have been very low. This threatens the supply of capital to future technology start-ups. One of the reasons for the low returns may be because VCs lack the necessary human capital related to the investment strategy they implement. The problem is that it is currently not known how the strategy of a Venture Capital Fund and the knowledge and experience of the managing VC influence each other. Earlier research has found that there is a relationship between a top management team’s human capital and their ability to execute a strategy. And additional research has shown that a VC’s human capital and the returns of the funds he manages are related. However, it is not known how these relationships work. Institutional investors limit the risk of their investment through diversification. VCs limit their investment risk through specialization. A VC that is specialized in a specific sector and invests in that sector should in the long run perform better than a VC with less sector specific human capital. This exploratory research investigates the relationship between VCs´ human capital and the investment strategies of their funds. Using a multiple case-study approach, several VC funds have been investigated by interviewing partners of the managing firms. This research did not look at the extended relationship between VCs’ human capital and the returns by their funds. The results show there is a strong relation between the specific industry experiences of VCs and the investments they make. When a VC starts at a VC firm the human capital that a VC has matches the investment strategy of the firm/fund they join or start. VCs do not change their investment strategy easily. On the one hand this appears to be by design of the Venture Capital system where a VC is limited by his Limited Partners from modifying his investment strategy significantly. On the other hand this appears to be because of a self-reinforcing cycle, where a VC invests in a specific market according to a specific strategy and by doing this gains more experience and social capital in that market. This helps him make better investments in that market in the future, which leads to more human- and social capital in that specific market. This self-reinforcing cycle (lock-in) makes it difficult for a VC to move to different markets. This is not a problem when the market a VC is specialized in offers a lot of good investment opportunities. However, when the market does not offer good investment opportunities, the VC is limited by his experience, reputation and legal obligations from investing in different markets or according to different strategies. The most important management implication of this research is how VCs can change their strategy over time. Several of the interviewed VCs have changed their strategies by using their social capital to internalize new human capital. The strategy formation process can be characterized as highly emergent but deliberately confined.","venture capital; vc; human capital; strategy; entrepreneurship; investing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Technology, Strategy & Entrepreneurship","","Management of Technology","",""

(mentor); Mooij, S.C. (mentor)","2013","Arrivals is for many airports and airlines quite an underdeveloped area compared to the other processes during a passenger’s journey at the airport. This also counts for in the current arrival process of KLM passengers at Schiphol Airport. Therefore the aim of this project was to develop a vision for arrivals in 2020, design concepts and create a strategic roadmap in which all the projects that needed to reach this vision have been balanced. Different methods have been used to develop the vision. Throughout the project observations were made of the arrival process at different times during the day. I accompanied the operational staff during their shifts and had discussions with managers of various departments (baggage, marketing, procurement, product development etc.). Besides a literature study an internal and external analysis and a questionnaire were carried out to map the current situation. All this served as input for more extensive consumer research with premium passengers. The method contextmapping was used for this research to gain deeper insights into the future needs of this target group. All the research led to the following vision of the passenger in the arrival process of 2020: “The passenger wants to be connected, in control and timely supplied with relevant information in a seamless arrival process.” The current arrival process has some bottlenecks which prevent the (premium) passenger from having a seamless experience. These are the three most important bottlenecks in relation to the final concepts and strategy (others can be found in the chapter Goals): Queues at the KMAR (royal military police) during peak moments (no premium lane available) Inaccurate information on the baggage status at the screen near the baggage belt Long (unnecessary) wait for delayed baggage The first concept is My Journey, a communication channel that will send a push notification to the passenger in case his baggage has not arrived at Schiphol yet. Via this notification the passenger is led to a prefilled SSPIR (Self Service Property Irregularity Report). By checking and filing this report the baggage tracer system will immediately have the information on where to forward the delayed baggage. The added value of My Journey is that by means of timely communication the passenger saves time and remains in control over the process. The key resources and activities to realize My Journey are to make the data on baggage and passenger compatible in order to be able to generate an update and SSPIR. The communication channel can be an integrated ‘My Journey’ component in the KLM application. This component will provide flight details as it does nowadays and will be able to send the push notification by using the personal information captured in this application. For future upscaling other channels are worth considering to be able to reach all passengers. So not only the ones with the KLM application. The second concept is Hand Baggage Fast Lane, a bypass from non Schengen to the off airport area, dedicated to premium passengers who frequently travel with hand baggage only. This concept is less evolved as My Journey, but worth considering regarding the renovations of Schiphol during CSNS (Central Security Non Schengen). The fast lane will offer the premium passenger an efficient process and a desired premium product for arrivals. A suggestion for the location was at the ticket office in departure hall 2, because here a premium entrance to the gate area was also suggested. A combined fast lane for departures and arrivals will add more value to the entire journey of the premium passenger. The transformation to a seamless arrival process in which the passenger is connected, in control and timely supplied with relevant information needs to be supported by existing and new projects. In the very short term the second bottleneck can already be dealt with by improving the usage of the fibag labag button (first bag, last bag on the belt) in the baggage basement, because the inaccurate pressing of this button affects the baggage status and so the information for the passengers. Training or just a sticker with a reminder might be solutions The projects KLM Hub Control and Agent of the Future will support the implementation of My Journey. Both projects are aimed at empowering the agents to become mobile agents. KLM Hub Control will provide an overview of the real time status of the passengers, KLM touchpoints and filters in the operation. This initiative for the application is focused on departures and transfer, but in light of this new vision, arrivals will need to be incorporated as well. Agent of the Future also investigates other tools to empower the agent, in order to be able to offer an experience of highest efficiency to the passenger. By empowering agents and passengers they are able to act quickly and efficiently during small (one delayed suitcase) or severe disruptions. My Journey will be a project with a lot of possibilities for expansion. Two possibilities concerning the arrival process are elaborated further. The first possibility would be the communication of changed transfer information by means of a push notification and a new boarding pass for the next flight. In case this flight is on the next day, hotel vouchers will be included in this message. Second possibility, a tailor made advice for the transportation after the flight, completely tuned according to the next destination and chosen means of transport. Such a message could be pushed stand-alone as soon as the passenger lands or be retrievable in the My Journey component of the KLM application. The baggage and transfer updates will improve the service recovery process of KLM, by making it pro active and problem solving in one stop. A tailor made transport advice could become a competitive advantage and a reason for business to choose KLM or to remain loyal. Finally, for arrival services this vision will mean that the agents in the baggage hall will transform to mobile agents with an all-round knowledge and all-round skills. The current arrival service desk will gradually disappear out of the baggage hall. It is recommended to accomplish this via intermediate stages, in which the desks are equipped with self service kiosks and agents with mobile devices.","arrivals; Schiphol","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

The procedure entails a dialogue, which may be phased, with the aim of developing one or more suitable alternatives capable of meeting its requirements. Due to changing legislation several issues will influence the policy for the application of the competitive dialogue. This changing legislation takes the form of a proposal for a new Directive on public procurement by the European Commission and a new Dutch procurement law. This anticipatory research poses the question: To what extent is the competitive dialogue implementable in an economically viable manner? To answer this question the research analyses the aforementioned changing legislation. In addition, the current policy of Rijkswaterstaat is reviewed and a cross comparison with the new legislation is performed to see what policy adjustments must be made. The research finds several chances for improvement on the implementation of the competitive dialogue procedure. These chances are translated into scenarios and their effect is analyzed using a Multi Criteria Analysis. Finally, these effects are measured against cases where the competitive dialogue has already been implemented. The report concludes that the competitive dialogue procedure is economically viable under the current form of implementation by Rijkswaterstaat because it leads to the expected value on a project’s Critical Success Factors. When the new Dutch procurement law comes into effect the current form of implementation of the competitive dialogue procedure remains economically viable because very little policy adjustments are necessary. However, in both the current and upcoming legislation there is room for improving the cost-effectiveness of the procedure by limiting the gold-plating effect, this effect is the addition of burdens by national legislation or policy in contrast to the minimum demands stemming from European guidelines.

(mentor)","2013","Instruction scheduling aims to reorder instructions in such a way that it covers the delay between an instruction and its dependent successor(s). As a result, the length of schedules are shortened while the processor utilisation increases. This is accomplished by exploiting Instruction Level Parallelism (ILP). The rearrangements made by instruction scheduling plays an important role in achieving the peak performance of a processor, especially for the ones which do not support out-of-order execution. Optimal scheduling to minimise the number of cycles under an arbitrary pipeline constraints is an NP-complete problem. Hence, most schedulers rely on heuristics in order to arrange the instructions. Although these heuristics are widely used and frequently lead to a fairly good solution, there still might be another instruction order which is better. In this work we bring randomisation to the GNU Compiler Collection GCC) list scheduler to explore the area of possible orders beyond the heuristics. Our core approach involves swapping the priorities of instructions, which does not totally discard the scheduling heuristics. It starts exploring the search space from a fairly good solution obtained by these heuristics. Moreover, as a result of using randomisation in the scheduler, some other problems have been tackled, such as: which part of the search space to explore in a limited amount of time, getting an approximation of how much of the search space is explored, how to fill the delay slots more effiently, etc. We evaluated our algorithms in compilation of programs for a Very Long Instruction Word (VLIW) processor called Embedded Vector Processor (EVP) from ST-Ericsson. Since EVP is used as an embedded Digital Signal Processor (DSP) in mobile devices, it is crucial to have a simple architecture to save power. Which is why, EVP is a non-interlocked exposed pipeline and is highly dependent on the compiler to exploit ILP.","instruction scheduling; compiler; gcc; evp; embedded vliw","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2016-02-01","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics & Computer Engineering","","CE","",""

Especially interest based multi issue negotiation proved to generate better results for all the parties that are involved. Despite its importance, many people are not effective in negotiation. Therefore Negotiation Support Systems (NSS) are designed to aid users. The Pocket Negotiator (PN) is an example of such a system. The current version of the PN uses hard coded interests and interest-issue links to provide support for interest based negotiation. However, interests and interest-issue links are inherently subjective and therefore they should be customizable by the users. In this thesis we propose a Visual Tool (VT) for enabling users to enter their personal interests to the existing PN and to customize the links between interest and issues. The design and evaluation of such a VT is not trivial. For the design part, factors such as unpredictable use, background, and needs of its users make the system requirements difficult to elicit. A user centred approach tackles such design problems by involving end users in the design. Although it is claimed that user involvement in early design process leads to development of more usable products, encouraging creativity and participation in user sessions are challenges acknowledged from the literature. Evaluation of such systems also offers its own sets of challenges. The support that PN provides to its users is based on a shared mental model (SMM). Although we used our VT to elicit the preference model of the users, universally accepted ways of directly measuring the effectiveness of an elicitation do not exist. The main contributions of this thesis are (1) a VT that extends the PN to enable its users to effectively share their preference models with the computer, (2) a set of recommendations on material, group composition and facilitation for encouraging user participation and creativity in user sessions and (3) a list based comparison method to measure the effectiveness of preference model elicitation methods.","preference elicitation; negotiation; design; participatory design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Computer Science/ MKT- Track","","Interactive Intelligence","",""

Since September 2011 Traffic Management Scenarios are applied to the A15 highway in the Port of Rotterdam Area. Traffic Management Scenarios are the most advanced Traffic Control methods that are applied in practice. The current state of art in Traffic Control is Model Predictive Control, an adaptive method that calculates the optimal control signal and adjusts it to changing traffic states. In this study this method is compared with the current implemented Traffic Management Scenarios for the A15 highway eastbound. Since this highway has a high share of freight traffic from the port, traffic is divided into two user-classes and a multi-class variant of Model Predictive Control will also be compared. The goal of this study is: To make a quantitative comparison based on economic costs among Traffic management Scenarios, Single-class Model Predictive Control and Multi-class Predictive Control. To be able to make this comparison a literature review is done on traffic control, including the two control methodologies that will be compared in this thesis, and multi-class traffic management measures. A categorization of control methodologies will be made to illustrate how Traffic Management Scenarios and model Predictive Control relate. Here will be shown that Traffic Management Scenarios are adaptable methods but that Model Predictive Control is even more adaptable. The traffic management measures that can be controlled by both control methods, ramp metering and route guidance, will also be described. Only route guidance is applied by the current Traffic Management Scenario Since the used Traffic Management Scenario was created based on experience and Model Predictive Control does not exist in practice yet there is described how both methods should be compared. First some requirements have to be set. These requirements are that the both methods should use the same network, control the same signals and that these control signals will be determined based on the same input data. To analyze the results of both methods, they should produce the same sort of output data. The easiest way to do this is performing a simulation experiment where both Traffic Management Scenario and Model Predictive Control use the same traffic model with a control module in it. The control module then can be replaced by either the Traffic Management Scenario, the Model Predictive Control or remain empty. BOS-HbR is a framework that fulfills these requirements and is therefore used for this study. It uses the A15 highway as its network. BOS-HbR consists of a estimation and prediction component. In the estimation component the input data retrieved from loop detectors is converted to a traffic state which serves as input for the prediction component. The prediction component uses multi-class model Fastlane to predict the traffic state and predict the results of the control method which will be inserted here. The Traffic Management Scenario used for the current study is the ‘A15 Haven Uit’ scenario developed by Regiodesk. For the current study a Traffic Management Scenario is created within BOS-HbR with the same (de)activation triggers as ‘A15 Haven Uit’. The Model Predictive Controller used in BOS-HbR will use the Matlab function fmincon as its optimization algorithm. The simulation experiment will be executed for three cases: a heavy peak hour, a regular peak hour and a severe accident. For each case a validation will be done to check if the model predictions for Fastlane matched reality. Also for each of these cases the experiments will be done with 5 demand levels - 90%, 95%, 100%, 105% and 110% of the original expected demand - to measure the robustness of the control methods. For the Traffic Management Scenario the conditions for the rerouting signal at Spijkenisse to be turned on will be described and there will be explained that road users will only comply with this signal if the off-ramp to the alternative route is congestion-free. The variables to be adjusted for the Model Predictive Controller are control interval, control horizon and prediction horizon. The results of these experiments are discussed basis of the following performance indicators: Total cost, average travel time per user class and robustness. In the cases of the heavy peak hour applying single-class Model Predictive Control shows double the improvement Traffic Scenarios achieved. In the regular peak hour this improvement was less and in the accident case the relative differences were minimal. In all cases single-class Model Predictive Control performs better than Traffic Management Scenarios, which shows a good improvement over the situation where no traffic control is applied. Multi-class Model Predictive Control has small improvements over single-class Model Predictive Control especially when looked at user-class specific travel times. The multi-class controller reroutes exclusively passenger car traffic and keeps the trucks on the main road. All control cases show an equal sensitivity to demand fluctuations. Overall it can be concluded that Model Predictive Control shows approximately the same improvement over Traffic Management Scenarios as the latter does over a situation where no traffic control is applied. Since Traffic Management Scenarios performed well in this study it is recommended to apply Traffic Management Scenarios with route guidance to more locations in the Netherlands where this is possible. It can also clear the road for a future implantation of Model Predictive Control. The Traffic Management Scenarios currently used are designed based on experience, it is interesting to see how Traffic Management Scenarios that are designed and optimized with a traffic model will perform. Rerouting the traffic multi-class showed good results for the Model Predictive Controller, therefore researching rerouting multi-class with a Traffic Management Scenario could also be interesting for the Port Area. Some interesting topics for further research following from this study are applying other traffic management measures except rerouting in the Port area and a behavioral research on how traffic responds to the DRIP signals that guide it, because in this research assumptions on compliance to these signals were made.","Model Predicitive Control; Traffic Management Scenarios; A15","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-03-01","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Transport & Planning","","Transport & Planning","",""

(mentor); Mihajlovic, V. (mentor)","2013","Electroencephalograph (EEG) is used in various applications such as diagnosing patients suffering from epilepsy or seizures. Motion artefact is the noise recorded together with the desired biopotential signals. It is mainly introduced by the relative motion between the measurement electrode and the human scalp. Dry electrodes are preferred in long term monitoring because gel is not required, although dry electrodes are more vulnerable to motion artefact. The frequency range of motion artefact overlaps with the frequency range of the EEG. Thus it is dif?cult to deduct motion artefacts from recorded signals. In imec, a low power wireless headset has been developed for long term EEG acquisition. Since motion artefact introduces signi?cant signal distortion, ?nding a suitable signal that can help in locating these artefacts is of utmost importance. In order to ?nd the most appropriate signal for the motion artefact detection and possibly also prediction and removal, the relation between EEG, impedance, force and acceleration were investigated. We analysed the in?uences of external forces, head movements and daily activities on the EEG and electrode-skin impedance magnitude. 11 subjects participated the experiment. Cross correlation coef?cient analysis was done to indicate the linear correlations between EEG and impedance, EEG and force, EEG and acceleration, impedance and force, and impedance and acceleration. The results demonstrate that the EEG, the impedance and the force are highly correlated when only external force is applied on the electrodes. However, when body movements are involved the cross correlation is lower due to the non-linearity of the signals. Both positive and negative correlation could be observed between the impedance and the EEG. The relation between the impedance and the EEG varies across the people and due to the motion. In conclusion, impedance is the best candidate for motion artefact detection in EEG compared with force and acceleration.","EEG; impedance; force; acceleration; dry electrode","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2014-02-25","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","BME","",""

According to the International Civil Aviation Organization airports are an essential part of a country’s economy within which they are situated. They can be considered as engines of growth for their local, regional and national economies. Airports, as any other type of organization, must be able to collect satisfactory revenues in order to finance investments and operations and as a result being able to contribute to the economy. Airports around the world started to face a more competitive environment as a result of the liberalization and deregulation process that started in the United Kingdom under the Margaret Thatcher administration, this period was a benchmark for all the international privatization processes. During this period the privatization of the English airports acquired by the Spanish group BAA led to a series of worldwide privatization processes like in Mexico, Argentina, Italy and Greece. These changes led to the emergence of diverse governance forms due to the apparent benefits they seemed to bring. As a result a series of questions regarding the contribution or efficiency of ownership forms started to emerge. Ownership form contributes to the better performance of airports? May this have a direct impact over the economy? Over the organization, region or country? This analytical study further develops these questions and analyses the performance of the main four ownership forms in French airports: public, majorly public, private, majorly private.","airports; ownership forms","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Technology, Policy and Management","Management","","Economics and Management of Network Industries EMIN","",""

To determine whether soil freezing is a viable option for underground construction in densely built up areas a case study has been performed for the North-South Line in Amsterdam. With the help of current developments found in the field of artificial ground freezing four different options of constructing a station were developed and compared. The most suitable of these options was modelled in Plaxis. To obtain the correct input parameters the processes occurring as a result of a freeze-thaw cycle were studied. Most important processes are the creep behaviour of the frozen soil, heave as a result of formation of ice lenses in low permeable soils and changing soil parameters due to the freeze-thaw cycle. It was concluded that an alternative design for one of the stations of the North-South Line using artificial freezing would be technically feasible. Also the financial aspects of the design were evaluated. Although the freeze design is more expansive then the currently executed design, the freeze design can compete. Costs are not two or three times as much with respect to conventional techniques as is often thought. In complex situations therefore ground freezing is a technique which should be taken in to account!","ground freezing; grondbevriezing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","Underground Technology","",""

(mentor); De Jong, P. (mentor); Pasterkamp, S. (mentor)","2013","The current building stock for offices is very large, and is too large for the demand out of the market. Currently there is a total vacancy of 14.1% in the Netherlands, which is equal to 6.795.000 m2 of office space. In Amsterdam there is a total of 700.000 m2 which is structurally vacant and is considered hopeless in terms of fulfilling its function. In order to maintain their European and Worldwide tourism position and fulfilling their wish for an “Amsterdam Topstad” Amsterdam needs around 7500 new hotel rooms until the year 2015. Bringing the vacant office supply together with the demand for hotels is the scope of the thesis. Transformation of current vacant office buildings in Amsterdam to hotels could be a solution to a number of vacant office buildings. Setbacks of transformation projects are the technical and financial feasibility. Technical feasibility includes the state and dimensions of the current structure. The financial feasibility includes the difference in building value between developer and owner and the financial insecurity of transformation projects. The Master thesis is the result of researching the supply of vacant office buildings in Amsterdam and brings that together with the demand for hotel rooms. This will be done in two parts, the first being a modular room solution and the second one being a calculation tool to compare vacant office buildings to each other in their potential to transform to a hotel. The first handed solution in order to bring the vacant office supply with the hotel demand together is the design of the modular rooms; timber frame rooms with a low weight and a fixed price that can benefit the transformation into a hotel. The building speed will increase, fewer handlings on the building site will benefit risk management and the fixed price of the units will take away financial insecurity of transformation projects. The downsides to the modular element method lie in the transport and assembly of the units and the fact that using this solution implies that the façade needs to be replaced is a large financial factor. The set sizes of the elements make the solution somewhat inflexible and sensitive to loss of space. The Transformation Performance Coefficient is a calculation tool that will bring the current state and location of the building together with the future demands of the hotel. By adding a score to each of the 69 characteristics a coefficient will result from the program that can be used to compare different buildings on their potential to transform to a hotel function. The downsides of the tool are that the tool needs a second layer of scoring making one characteristic (such as the location of the hotel) more important than the other (such as the floor height) that are now of the same importance and that the program doesn’t take connections between characteristics into account.","hotel; vacancy; vacant; office; transformation; modular; calculation tool; Amsterdam; prefabrication","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Pasterkamp, S. (mentor); Van Mierlo, R.J.M. (mentor); Hanea, D.M. (mentor)","2013","Fire compartmentation is an important aspect in the design of buildings. Buildings need to be divided into one or more fire compartments, which are intended as the maximum extension area of the fire. Compartmentation systems are designed to prevent fire spread to adjacent compartments. The performance of compartmentation systems depends on many different factors with many uncertainties. Moreover, the implementation of these systems in practice is vulnerable for mistakes and weaknesses. Also it is not clear what is actually achieved by the current legislation and policies for compartmentation in terms of safety of people and protection of property. Little research has been carried out on the performance of compartmentation systems in actual building fires. In the Netherlands, some research was carried out on the performance of compartmentation during a research on high-damage fires in 2001 by Nibra and NCP. It was found that compartmentation was in approximately 35% of the high-damage fires was not sufficient to prevent fire spread to other compartments in the building. Whereas it is often difficult to determine the causes of fire spread to adjacent compartments and to determine the quality of the compartmentation before the fire started, shortcomings are often mentioned as main reasons in case of premature failure of compartmentation systems. Shortcomings are in this case defined as elements in a compartmentation system which are not built in accordance with the applicable legislation and standards, elements which are not correctly used or elements which are not properly maintained. To get insight in the presence of shortcomings in buildings, some inspection reports have been analysed. It turned out that many shortcomings are present in the analysed buildings and that these shortcomings have a strong influence on the performance of fire compartmentation. Especially shortcomings related to doors, ducting and piping are frequently found in buildings. The presence of shortcomings is more or less similar in the analysed buildings; no clear relation can be distinguished with the function of the building (meeting, office, industrial) or the age of the building based on the inspection reports. Most shortcomings (±70%) in fire compartmentation occur during construction and/or maintenance/modification works in the building. Also a lack of maintenance is an important cause of shortcomings. A lack of awareness among stakeholders about the importance of proper compartmentation is probably the main source of these shortcomings. Although the quality and performance of compartmentation is often worse than intended, fatalities are generally not attributed to bad performance of compartmentation, especially not in office, meeting and industrial buildings. In building fires where fatalities occurred, (insufficient) performance of fire compartmentation was generally not appointed to be decisive. For the prevention of casualties it seems therefore generally not necessary to improve the quality of compartmentation systems in these buildings compared to the modern day standard. If significant improvements in prevention of fire damages by fire compartmentation are envisaged by building-owners and/or insurers, more attention should be paid to good implementation and maintenance.","compartmentation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","Structural Design","",""

Through actively involving problem owners in the iRoom their understanding and perception of the design task is enlarged. However, the method can further develop by providing more guidance in the application for individual project managers.

After analyzing the current condition indexing process, the process steps which have to be optimized are investigated. These process steps contains shortcommings such as lack of guidelines, categories with ambiguous interpretations and dependancy on experience. The process steps which should be optimized are: the assessment of the visual inspection, the determination of the condition of the asset, the interpretation and subdivision of the condition levels and the determination of the time intervals for the condition indicators. A model is designed in order to minimize the subjectivity of the assessment of the visual inspections. The model includes guidelines such as questions, answers and a transformation matrix. Furthermore, a strategy is constructed for the determination of the condition of the asset by including the weighting of the condition indicator. The weighting of each condition indicator is determined based on the failure frequency, failure impact and detection chance. Afterwards, a strategy is determined for the determination of the optimal maintenance time interval. In this strategy the result and the weighting of the condition indicator are included. Finally, a case study is performed in order to analyze the new strategy for the determination of the time intervals.

(mentor)","2013","The Potgietersus Platinum mine is an open pit mine in the Bushveld Complex in South Africa. During the mining different rock types are mined, some of these are detrimental. The goal of the research done in this project is to assess the feasibility of Dual Energy X-ray Transmission (DE-XRT) to distinguish the detrimental ore types from the rest of the ore. There are two types of rock that contain the most platinum and Platinum Group Elements (PGE's): pyroxenite and pyroxenite B. The detrimental rock types are serpentinite, norite, calc- silicate and oxidized material. Detrimental rock types cause a lower recovery of the processing of the minerals. By removing the detrimental rock types the recovery could increase. DE-XRT is a sensor based sorting method based on density differences of the materials that have to be distinguished from each other. Samples of the different rock types have been scanned with a DE-XRT scanner and the pictures of these samples consist of pixels. Of each pixel the High Energy Absorption (HEA) and Low Energy Absorption (LEA) are known. With this data a color is allocated to each pixel. Ratios of these colors are plotted in graphs. From these graphs it can be concluded that a seperation can be made by using the ratio between the number of green and blue pixels. By using the green/blue ratio more than 60% of the calc silicate, 30% of the norite, 100% of the oxidized material and 60% of the serpentinite are removed. There is no loss of pyroxenite and pyroxenite B. It is recommended to do further research on other software or to improve the now used software. Also large scale experiments have to be conducted to find out if this method can be used in the mine itself. And a feasibility study has to be performed to see if a large enough percentage of the detrimental rock is removed to make the investment profitable.","DE-XRT; platinum ore; x-ray; sensor; sorting technology; Bushveld complex","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","Resources Engineering","",""

(mentor)","2013","Modern aircraft tend to be light and slender. The high aspect ratio reduces the induced drag, increase fuel efficiency, and provide enough lift a low speeds. Therefore such wing types are used for long endurance unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV). A drawback of these wings is that they are more vulnerable for aeroelastic phenomena like divergence, aileron reversal, and flutter. To increase the dynamic pressure, at which one of these phenomena occurs, the stiffness of the wing needs to be increased leading to an increase of the wing weight. Instead of increasing the wing weight, the flexibility of the wing can be used to change the shape of the wing to optimize flight performance or to control the rolling motion of the aircraft. This research area of Active Aeroelastic Wings has grown in the recent years. With this concept, very little control surface motion is used to employ the energy of the airstream to achieve the desirable wing twist. In this thesis work, an Active Aeroelastic Wing is designed, built and tested in a low-speed wind tunnel. After testing, the possibility to predict the performance accurately with a state-of-the-art modeling tool is verified. First, a qualitative background overview is given about the three most important aeroelastic phenomena. These phenomena are torsional divergence, control reversal, and classical flutter and are described to understand the effects of the different wing parameters on the deformations. Secondly, an overview is given of the techniques that have been used to change the shape of the wing. From these concepts, the sweepable spar method has been chosen. This method uses the ability to change the position of the elastic axis, so that the twist deformations can be increased or decreased. Based on this method, a test article has been built that has similar planform shape as the Global Hawk. Instead of ailerons for roll control, the test article is equipped with an aeroelastic outer wing segment that can change its elastic axis. With this aeroelastic outer wing part, the wing is able to provide a rolling moment. Afterwards, its performance has been tested in the Open Jet Facility of the TU Delft. The results of the bench tests showed that the moveable spar is able to change the position of the elastic center at the wing tip. With the main spar at different positions, a change in the torsional stiffness of the wing has been observed. During the wind tunnel test the influence of the sweep angle on the rolling moment has been analyzed. The results did not clearly indicate a beneficial effect of the sweep angle on the rolling moment coefficient. Therefore the wing configuration is set to sweep angle of zero degrees to continue the testing. For this configuration, the main spar moved aft on the left and forward on the right wing, the maximum achievable roll helix angle is similar to that of a Boeing 747-200 during cruise. However, the roll performance of the Global Hawk is about five times larger than the test article. Note that aeroelastic effects have been neglected for the Global Hawk, which reduces the aileron control effectiveness. Finally, the results of the wind tunnel experiments are compared with the simulation results of Proteus. Proteus is an analysis and design framework that uses a non-linear beam model combined with lifting line theory to determine the aeroelastic effects. To analyze the test article some structural and aerodynamic modifications have been made in Proteus, to integrate the effects of a sweepable elastic axis and cambered airfoils. With these modifications the predicted rolling moment coefficient was about 40% smaller compared to the wind tunnel results. Therefore it is concluded that Proteus is currently not able to predict the results accurately.","Aeroelasticity; Active Aeroelastic Wing; Roll Control","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Flight Performance and Propulsion","","","",""

(mentor); Keetels, G.H. (mentor); Laboyrie, H.P. (mentor); Sloff, C.J. (mentor)","2013","Sedimentation in reservoirs is a consequence of constructing a barrier in a flowing river, which results in a decrease of the transport capacity of the river. The storage capacity of the reservoir decreases due to the accumulation of sediments and the river downstream starts to erode due to the disturbance of the sediment balance. Water Injection Dredging can be an interesting option in order to counteract these processes. This method injects water in the bottom of the reservoir, creating hereby density currents which are capable of transporting large amounts of sediment. The sediment can in this way be transported towards the dead storage of the reservoir or be sluiced out of the reservoir through the bottom outlets of a dam, which will increase the storage capacity of a reservoir considerably. Because the density current uses gravitation and the natural slope of the reservoir, this method is a relative cheap and quick way to transport sediments. The dredging installation is also relatively simple and basic. If the sediments are sluiced through the dam, the disturbance of the sediment balance in the river can be counteracted. It is however necessary to investigate whether or not the river is capable of dealing with the increased sediment load in the river downstream of the dam. The high production rates of Water Injection Dredging results in high sediments peaks, which the river should be able to transport. Case studies done in the scope of this thesis show that the method can be a competitive and feasible method that can be used to counteract sedimentation problems in reservoirs, if some specifications of the investigated reservoirs were different. If these specific requirements for Water Injection Dredging in reservoir are met, the method can restore the reservoir capacity in a cheap and effective way. More research and testing the method in practice will be necessary however.","reservoir; sedimentation; Water Injection Dredging","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-04-30","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Dredging Engineering","",""

This better understanding is achieved by confronting the technology field with the applied technologies existing within a firm through the use of a matrix representation.

(mentor); Goossens, R.H.M. (mentor)","2013","When spontaneous breathing of a child is interrupted, support can be given via mechanical ventilation. This support can be applied either invasive (with a tracheostomy) or non-invasive (using a mask). The use of invasive ventilation in children brings plenty of risks and challenges including possible damage of the (often still vulnerable) throat, an increased risk of airway infections, the need for surgery and a high demand of patient care. These challenges are significantly less in non-invasive ventilation (abbreviated as NIV). (reference) Non-invasive ventilation requires an interface (mask) to connect the ventilator to the respiratory system of the patient. A suitable patient interface is very important, as it has been shown that this often determines the success rate of NIV therapy. (Rooyen and Soltész, 2010) Especially in young children the interface can be seen as the major limiting factor for success or failure. (Fauroux et al, 2003) Currently some paediatric interfaces are on the market, comprising nasal masks, nasal pillows, helmets and a total face mask. The centre for home ventilation in Rotterdam, specialized in the treatment of paediatric children that require home mechanical ventilation, has indicated to have difficulties in finding a suitable full face mask (covering both nose and mouth) for their young paediatric patients. The currently used full face masks are designed for adults and do often not meet the required fit and comfort level for paediatric users. To solve this problem a PhD research is being conducted by ir. Lye Goto, aiming to develop a suitable full face respiratory mask for paediatric patients aged between one and six years old. An additional goal is to collect and process currently lacking data on anthropometric measurements of the face and setting up a database. Although this graduation project should be seen independently from the PhD research, it is aspired to contribute to the goals of the PhD research and improve the successfulness of the paediatric mask to be developed. A first goal within this graduation project was to collect and understand user and context information, aiming to reveal user needs and possible challenges. Translating these insights into requirements and preferences for the mask to be developed should function as guidelines during the design process. The final result of this project should be a design of a user-friendly respiratory mask for children between one and six years old, aiming to improve the experienced comfort during use. Project approach Research In order to develop a paediatric mask that suits to needs of its different users, part of the goals within this graduation project was on collecting, and understanding the context and users of paediatric respiratory masks. Literature research was done in numerous topics including procedures around NIV treatment, currently available masks and their different features and user experiences with the different masks. Next to this, information was gathered concerning the paediatric patients, their possible diseases and symptoms and general mental and physical development stages of children between one and six years old. To even better understand the different users and context of NIV treatment, context mapping has been used as a method to map the different use scenarios and conditions in which respiratory masks are being used. The combination of literature research and context mapping has provided insights concerning user needs and possible challenges related to mask use. Challenges, including both physical and mental aspects of mask wearing were researched in more depth to be able to find proper solutions within the mask design. Main physical challenges found were the risk of skin damage and air leaking due to poor mask fitting. Mental challenges included anxious, claustrophobic and negative feelings towards mask wearing, influencing the acceptation of wearing the mask both in paediatric users and their carers. As acceptance of the mask is an important condition for successful use, the mask to be developed should consider both the physical and mental experience of the user. The conscious and unconscious user needs and preferences found during the research phase were translated into requirements and wishes which the mask to be designed should meet. Design Inspired by the gathered insights, ideas were created to solve the various challenges and to improve the experience of mask use. Numerous solutions were created and explored to understand their potential in solving the problems and increasing the user comfort. To verify and test certain findings and ideas, (potential) users and various experts were consulted and met on a regular basis. This iterative design process brought new insights and inspiration, resulting in many and diverse ideas. In consultation with the client and the supervisory team the ideas were reviewed on the stated requirements, leading to a selection of ideas that were later developed into concepts. A combination of the concepts was used for the final product proposal. Product proposal The final product proposal aims to increase comfort during use by its various users, covering both physical and mental aspects. As the product should meet the needs of very diverse target group, the idea is to create a modular system, having different components that can be combined in various ways. The aim of this modular system is to allow users for customizing and adjusting. This solution will hopefully enable the product to meet the needs of the different users within the target group. Within this project, one complete set of components was developed, fulfilling the goal of developing a full face paediatric mask. However, in the future additional components could be designed and developed to even increase the user satisfaction and expand the use scenarios. The mask components are designed to minimize the risk of skin damage and give the user freedom to move and perform certain activities when wearing the mask. One of the components that was developed within this project provides a solution to increase mask fit and prevent pressure ulcers based on a light weighted silicone structure. To support the (young) child in feeling comfortable, a component was added that functions as a pacifier and can be used during mask wearing. To increase the mental comfort, a feature has been integrated which gives the user the possibility to quickly remove part of the mask in case of (perceived) emergency or other interaction or communication needs. For both paediatric patients and their carers this feature increases the feeling of control and safety. Furthermore it brings the possibility to connect a child to the ventilator when it is asleep, which requires less cooperation of the paediatric patient. Another solution that is integrated in the design to increase mental comfort and acceptance by the child is the possibility to adjust and influence mask appearance in a playful way, having certain fictive characters that should be connected to a storybook. To increase a feeling of comfort in parents or carers, the nose and mouth section of the mask was made transparent and free of components to allow for easy checking on the child’s condition. Use cues were integrated to optimise the interaction activities. Results As stated in the introduction, the aim of this project was to both gain insights and understanding of the context, use and user needs related to a respiratory mask for paediatric patients and to translate these insights to product requirements, resulting in a product proposal that is suitable for the intended target group. The results meet the project goals and the gathered context information, user needs, product requirements and product ideas will hopefully contribute to the successful development of a respiratory full face mask for paediatric patients.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2014-07-02","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Integrated Product Design","",""

(mentor); Coimbra Cardoso, C.M. (mentor)","2013","While the interest in high quality tea is increasing, a lot of foodservice establishments still serve low quality tea. This doesn’t provide the customer with a very positive experience, and the establishments are ignoring a great opportunity to differentiate themselves. The lack of high quality tea in these establishments provides an opportunity for the company Simon Lévelt. If Simon Lévelt can provide these establishments with a way to serve their tea in a convenient and efficient manner, Simon Lévelt can increase their B2B market share and generate more interest for high quality tea in general. The Simon Lévelt company has a lot of experience and knowledge concerning tea, but they’re relatively small in the B2B market and franchise stores often do not have enough resources to pursue the B2B market next to their retail efforts in the consumer market. Internal research shows that consumers are willing to pay significantly more for high quality tea. This increases the confidence that a new approach can achieve increased revenue for foodservice businesses as well as increased customer satisfaction. The foodservice market is very big, and not all market segments will be suited for the introduction of a high quality tea concept. The “green restaurant” market is chosen as the initial market for a product introduction, as it is assumed that the people in this market will more readily accept the benefits of using high quality natural ingredients, such as the tea sold by Simon Lévelt. After exploring several directions, the final concept includes a teapot and a special tea menu. These will be provided for free or for a reduced price when an establishment signs a contract, appointing Simon Lévelt as their sole tea supplier for a given period. The teapot was chosen because of the extra value it provides for the customer. This teapot incorporates a few innovations however, to keep the process efficient and easy. An integrated timer helps the customer prepare the tea, to prevent a tasteless or bitter beverage. A silicon top acts as a mechanism that lowers the filter into the water and lifts it up when the tea is ready. This solution prevents the hassle of removing a wet filter from a cup or teapot, which can cause annoyances such as spills or burnt fingers. Extra features include removable parts for easy cleaning and an ideal 2-cup size for the foodservice market. The tea menu helps the customer in deciding between different kinds of tea that are possibly unknown to them. To do this the menu uses a flavor rating system which especially helps in comparing similar teas, such as two types of green tea.","tea; foodservice; simon lévelt; restaurant","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design","",""

(mentor); Van Gaal, R. (mentor)","2013","This thesis presents the graduation project ‘Play on Your Way’, in which play route concepts have been researched and designed by using child participation. The project was committed by the National Youth Fund Jantje Beton, who aims to create and retain a public space where children (age 6-12) feel free and encouraged to play and be active in. They do this by devising, financing and organizing projects that contribute to reaching this goal. Project scope: A problem with current projects is that most ideas are generated from an adults point of view, and therefore do not meet with the wishes of children. The project’s scope is to design play concepts for the public space, starting with thoroughly researching what the target group wants and needs and including them in the process. This way, an example can be set for the approach of generating solutions for play opportunities in the future. Play routes were chosen as an example case. Shortly put, a play route is a route with play elements, enabling children to play (safely) on their way from point A to B. Analysis: First of all, the project scope was specified further by researching for which age group and type of location the public space is least accessible and encouraging for play. It was found that children in grade 3-5 (about 6-8 years old) and living in urban areas face the most restrictions when it comes down to playing in the public space or getting somewhere. Next, a short literature study on the target group’s characteristics and behaviour was done, giving some insight in what the target group is like and how to execute research with them. The target location was analysed further as well, which made clear that the most urban areas of the 5 most urbanized municipalities of the Netherlands mainly exist of ‘urban, stacked residential streets’. This concluded in a list (and examples) of characteristics of this type of street that could be important in the design phase. Finally, the rules and regulations for play elements were analysed to get familiar with the basic restrictions for designs. Research: The research phase was where the child participation mainly took place. To find out what the experiences and wishes of the target group are concerning the public space (focussing on routes and playing), contextmapping and co-research was executed. During the contextmapping, 20 children of the target group filled in a sensitizing booklet with short assignments about routes and playing, and 15 children (groups of 3) participated in generative sessions about these topics. Five couples participated in the co-research, where the children walked a route of their choice and made assignments on their way. General conclusions about playing were for example that the target group likes competition/challenges, climbing/clambering, games like tag, hide and seek and hopscotch, and playing together. The most common route is from home to school and back, followed by routes to friends, sports, music lessons, playgrounds/parks and the swimming pool. Nature and art is liked on a route, and traffic and vehicles are associated most often with negative experiences. Some children already play along these routes (for example by doing a bicycle race). The specific examples that came out of the research were clustered into inspiration sheets. These quotes, drawings or pictures appeal to one’s imagination much stronger than a general list of conclusions, and make child participation such a powerful method. Design: In the design phase, ideas were generated from the inspiration sheets (backed up by the general conclusions and findings of the analysis phase). Since the inspiration data was not clustered yet when the very first ideas were generated, these ideas were more often based on general conclusions than on unique remarks of children. It became very clear that the remarks gave much more inspiration than the general conclusions, and thus what the use of child participation can be. In the end, about 25 ideas were documented as examples of the project’s output. A range of the ideas was evaluated by a group of the children that participated in the research, and some adults. This showed that the children felt connected with the ideas and both the children as the adults were enthusiast about most of them. The evaluation also resulted in some suggestions concerning function, safety, appearance and maintenance that should be taken into account when developing the ideas further. Tool: To make sure that Jantje Beton can communicate the process and results of this project as an example of why child participation should be used more often, a tool was made. The tool is a fan with 17 sheets, summarizing the process step by step. A general explanation is presented on the front side of each sheet, with a specific example of this project on the back. The tool is mainly meant to inspire and enthuse municipalities to apply child participation more often. An evaluation took place with two adults with little to no experience of child participation. It showed that the information was clearly put and the fan inspired and enthused the readers with the presented examples and possibilities of child participation. Recommendations: The tool that resulted of this project is a way to make municipalities enthused about child participation, but more information and training should be provided before they can actually get busy. It is recommended that the tool is completed with a range of workshops, or a program for setting up and executing child participation. Additionally, the tool is now based on only one example project. For the tool itself this is not necessarily a problem, but more examples should be documented to show in general that child participation works. Lastly, testing the ideas in practice will give additional insights in the results of using child participation, and shows where this method still needs improvement.","contextmapping; co-research; child participation; design; play; children","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor)","2013","Commissioned by the Dutch Railways Operation (NS Reizigers) research has been conducted on the possibilities to better incorporate energy-efficient train operation into the timetable. The motivation for this research is based on the fact that energy-efficient operation is not yet optimally included in the timetable design. This is because of the fact that the running time supplement is not optimally divided. Running time supplement or slack time is the running time above the minimal running time between two timetable points. The objective of the research is to develop a model which determines the optimal coasting point and the optimal cruising speed for trains and the associated running time supplement distribution; taking into account the desired robustness, the possibilities for energy-efficient operation and the desired punctuality during the execution of the timetable. The behavior of a train is described by four driving regimes: acceleration, cruising, coasting and braking. With these driving regimes this study considers two driving strategies: time optimal and energy-efficient. The time optimal driving strategy requires a train to drive as fast as possible from A to B using the driving regimes acceleration, braking and possibly cruising. The energy-efficient driving strategy requires a train to drive also from A to B using as less as possible traction energy given the available time from the timetable. The coasting regime is an important part in this strategy. The energy-efficient driving strategy is determined by the optimal control theory. The algorithm which is applied in MATLAB determines the energy-efficient driving strategy by calculating the optimal coasting point and the optimal cruising speed given the time from the timetable. The model has been applied on the section Utrecht Central – Rhenen for sprinter train series 7400. The results of this research show that there are yearly energy savings possible of almost  26.400 if the energy-efficient driving strategy is used instead of the UZI (‘Universeel Zuinig rijden Idee’) method of NS Reizigers. Moreover the results show that using a uniform distribution of the running time supplements leads to extra energy savings and an improvement for the punctuality compared to the method of tightening the timetable. Tightening the timetable means that the running time supplements are placed as much as possible short before stations where the punctuality is measured. These yearly extra savings which are possible by the uniform distribution instead of the current slack time are almost  44.000 for the energy-efficient driving strategy and are almost  27.500 for the UZI method on the total section.","railway operation; energy efficient operation; timetable; optimal control","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Transport & Planning","","Transport & Planning","",""

De eerste optie biedt geen representatieve cijfers voor de uiteindelijke prestatie in de boot en de tweede optie is enkel weggelegd voor professionele roeiers. Het Roei Informatie Center moet een prestatiemeting in de roeiboot voor de amateur roeier bieden. Belangrijke eisen zijn het gebruiksgemak, compatibiliteit met alle roeisituaties en een lage prijs. Het ontwerp van dit complete systeem moet aan veel specificaties voldoen. Dit onderzoek concentreert zich voornamelijk op de meting van de hoeksnelheid van de riem om in combinatie met de buiging van de roeiriem het vermogen van de roeier te kunnen bepalen. Een tweede punt van aandacht is de weergave van deze informatie aan de roeier. Om het product compleet te maken, wordt ook voor alle andere specificaties kort een oplossing voorgesteld. Met behulp van een prototype, gebaseerd op een Arduino i.c.m. een Android smartphone, wordt geconcludeerd dat meting van de hoeksnelheid van de roeiriem over een dynamisch bereik van 30-240 graden /s met een onnauwkeurigheid kleiner dan 2,1% mogelijk is. Wegens het ontbreken van concrete meetresultaten van de buiging van de roeiriem is het niet mogelijk om vast te stellen of aan de eisen voor vermogens meting voldaan kan worden.

(mentor); Lousberg, L.H.M.J. (mentor)","2013","Summary Since the implementation of the new European allocation rule on the 1st of January 2011 only the households with a lower income are covered within the primary target group of the housing associations. Each year at least 90% of all available social dwellings should be allocated to this income group. The group of tight housed large families in Amsterdam is since then divided in families with a lower income and families with a middle income. The large families with a lower income still have a housing problem, but they may get more suplly. Nowadays the tight housed large families with a middle income are dependent on the commercial rental and owner-occupied market in Amsterdam. Different studies did however show that these houses are not affordable for the middle income families. Despite the major change that has taken place, within the working field of the housing associations in Amsterdam because of the new European rule, the specific housing situation of the large families and their possibilities have not been investigated before. The housing situation asks for the answer of a number of questions that are answered in this study. The aim of this thesis This research is aimed at gaining more knowledge about the housing position of the tight-housed large families in Amsterdam. A deeper study has been conducted to understand the situation that has arisen and its significance for the success rate of these households who are searching for an appropriate dwelling. This can be seen as the other aim of this research. Other aims of this study are in general to explore which possibilities can improve the success rate and the housing situation of these families and then choose the most appropriate ones in the working field of the housing association Rochdale. The main objective is to make recommendations which measures, possibly in modified form, may be the most suitable for Rochdale to accommodate this target group. Research Question The main research question that this study will answer is as following: What are the consequences for the large middle income families in Amsterdam of the way the EU policy has been implemented by the Amsterdam housing associations and how can the possible negative effects and consequences in Amsterdam (through new policy strategies) within the EU frameworks be prevented or limited? To answer the main research three sub questions have been formulated, which made it possible to answer the main research question. - What is the problem in Amsterdam? - Which solutions are available? - Which solutions are the best and why? The three sub questions are answered in the following three parts. The first part starts with the housing situation before the implementation of the European allocation rule in 2011. This new allocation rule is then treated in relation to the working field of the housing corporations in Amsterdam. The section is concluded with an analysis of the current housing situation and the possibilities of these tight housed families. For this part of the study interviews with parties from the social housing sector in Amsterdam have taken place and a literature study with quantitative data mainly obtained from annual reports, notes and researches (eg Aedes, AFWC, WZS, O + S) has taken place. In the second part the possibilities, which may prevent or reduce the problem of tight housing for large middle income have been discussed. These possibilities have been derived from the literature, or were discussed or applied in practice. For this section a literature and field study have been conducted. In the case of the practical study interviews have taken place and 'participation /field research' by doing an internship at Rochdale, a housing association in Amsterdam. In the third part, the results, the possible measures from the previous section are analysed and assessed. Therefore from the possible measures that are applicable in the working field of Rochdale employable the most interesting ones are chosen. For this first selection various criteria are used in relation to the organizational and financial capabilities of Rochdale. The selected measures are then assessed to see which are within Rochdale best suited to serve the large middle-income families. For this purpose the measures are, after consultation, assessed on Effectivity, Efficiency and Support. The results are then used to draw conclusions and make recommendations. Results Sub-question 1: What is the problem in Amsterdam? Problem before 2011 In Amsterdam a housing problem of tight-housed large families existed for years. These large families are mainly low-income families, but the ones with a slightly higher income, the middle incomes, are also part of the problem. 83% of the group tight housed large families lives in a social rented dwelling and of this group 9% has a middle income, representing 880 families (O+S 2012). When we focus on the total number of large houses in Amsterdam it can be stated that numerically there should be no problem, however, there still exists a shortage of supply. The shortage, ie the mismatch, has partly to do with the fact that large houses are inhabited by small households, the distribution of the large houses does not match the dispersion of the large families (location problem) and the affordability of the large houses. The problem of tight-housed large families can mainly be found in Amsterdam-West district and particularly in the former districts Bos en Lommer, de Baarsjes and Geuzenveld-Slotermeer. In recent years the municipality of Amsterdam and other housing parties including the housing associations designated this target group as a focus group in their housing policy in the hope to dissolve their housing problem more effectively. This has not resulted in improvement of their situation, mainly due to the fact that the objectives are often not ambitious enough and even if they are they often have not been achieved. Responses in the form of more specific policy and reports that explicitly address the improvement of the housing of this group have also been little effective in preventing of limiting the already existing problem. Problem after 2011 In the general housing policy and in the policy targeted at large families all large families are included regardless of their income, but from 1 January 2011 the housing associations have to deal with a new European regulation that divides this focus group within their working field into a primary and a secondary group. Since the implementation of this allocation rule households with an income above  34.229 can not be offered social rented dwellings anymore. For tight-housed large families with a middle income this means that they now are no longer part of the primary target group and are no longer covered by the additional policies that are deployed to limit the problem of tight housing. The tight-housed large families with a middle income are now dependent on the commercial rented and owner-occupied market. Because of the tight housing market in Amsterdam and the related high prices these opportunities offer little chance in finding a suitable dwelling. To meet the demands of these families a suitable dwelling must be qualitative and affordable. With the income of a large middle-income family, it is not possible to find a suitable dwelling as the houses with four bedrooms (Dutch; 5 kamer woning) are usually offered are namely offered in the higher commercial rental and sales classes. In recent years the chances of success are also reduced because of the economic crisis and the related problems. The numbers of completed and planned housing projects decreased and it became difficult to obtain a mortgage. The fact that these large families do not have rehousing possibilities to move (up) results in a delay of the already limited flow on the tight housing market in Amsterdam. The tight-housed large families decide, how tight their housing and distressing situation might be, less often to move to another dwelling. This slow movement and housing situation that has been observed by the housing associations and WoningNet (Woningnet, 2012) might get worse and result in more social and societal problems. These problems can be segregation and various types of nuisance at different scales. Sub-question 2: What solutions are there? In the literature and in practice, including the working field of Rochdale, various measures and policies are discussed that can be deployed to increase the success rate of the middle income and also of the large families. These measures are mostly focused on smaller households with a middle income or focus on the housing of large families with the lower incomes. To increase the success rate of the large middle income families there are no specific measures available. An inventory of what measures may contribute to the better serving of the large middle-income families suggests that, in theory, the following measures can contribute and are therefore interesting. These are the measures that are selected from literature, practice or have been designed by the author. The measures are compared on the basis of criteria derived from the working field of Rochdale in order to determine which are the most interesting to be assessed on suitability. Six measures turned out to be interesting. After this selection some of the selected measures have been elaborated before they are assessed. It has also been decided to add the measure Flexible Rents to the assessment. The most interesting measures for the assessment ultimately revealed to be the following: - The use of the 10% to allocate large families with a middle income. 10% of the available social dwellings may be used for households with a income higher then 34.229. This space is partly used for urgent cases, for example elderly and handicapped . This remaining percentage within the 10% space can be used for allocating the tight housed middle income families - Flexible rents To use deregulated rents that are annually indexed on the basis of income of the households. The income of the households will therefore annually be checked and the rent for the following year will be determined in order to have rents that match better with their income and living situation. - 15/25 WWS points and 100% maximum reasonable (limited commercialization) Using the liberalization opportunities to increase the supply for this middle income group. Available dwellings can be added 15/25 WWS points in order to have more then 163 WWS points and therefore able to be deregulated. - Conversion to 4 bedrooms In contrast to 4 bedroom houses there are more 3 bedroom houses that get available. To increase the supply of large houses these large 3 bedroom houses should be converted so they will be suitable for the target group. Sub-question 3: What measures are most suitable and why? The assessment of the measures by means of the Effectivity, Efficiency and Support has shown that the measures have some potential to improve the housing situation of the large middle income families socially. The differences between the selected measures in suitability can be found in other assessment criteria. For example, this assessment showed that the differences can be found in size and delivery time of the supply that can be realised by the measures and also differences in the affordability for the target group. Also in the assessment criterion support there were many differences, which can be explained by the ‘financial’ criterion. Thus, as expected, the measures which require a high financial investment for the fast realization of a large supply were reviewed positive by the residents, and as not feasible by Rochdale. An attempt was made to find a measure that takes these various interests of the parties involved into account. Looking at all the assessment criteria that are used for the assessment it was finally concluded that for Rochdale, under the current circumstances and looking at the support from both parties, the measure '15 / 25WWS and 100% maximum reasonable ' is the most suitable. Interviews have shown that a previously used measure could theoretically improve the moving flow. This so called ‘from Large to Better’ measure means that a small household, under reasonable conditions moves, from a large dwelling to a smaller one. However, Rochdale has negative experiences with the implementation of this measure. But the interviews have shown that under more reasonable conditions more participants can be found. In that case the implementation of this measure may improve the moving flow and increase the supply of large houses. Discussion and recommendations During the first analysis in which a selection was made of the most interesting measures for further assessment it was revealed that in some cases it is possible to merge measures and thus to combine the positive characteristics of various measures. This combination possibility was a remarkable and interesting one, so it was decided to use this one also as an important criterion. It was also noted that small adjustments in both the measures and the constraints within which they must be used are able to make a measure more suitable. Therefore in general the recommendations made to Rochdale are to investigate internally the possibilities to adjust in the organisation to implement these adjusted measures for the benefit of the large middle income families. Both the most suitable and the other measures are partly dependent on the moving (up) flow that make the required large dwellings available. The assessment has showed that the possibility to combine the measures varies, with the measures '15 / 25WWS and 100% maximum reasonable' and 'Conversion to 4 bedrooms' as the most suitable. An ideal combination proved to be one in which these measures can be used with a measure to stimulate the moving flow. Interviews have shown that the measure ""From Large to Better ', despite the negative experiences of Rochdale with this measure, may potentially be very suitable in the case it is used under adjusted conditions. This measure has been previously used by Rochdale where it primarily was used for exchange between two social rented dwellings. Combinations of the following measures are therefore considered as the most suitable in the main recommendation. - 15/25WWS and 100% maximum reasonable - Conversion to 4 bedrooms - Additional promotion of moving Combination of ‘15/25 WWS and maximum reasonable’ and ‘from Large to Better’ The large social rented dwellings that now become available are being liberalized by the use of the liberalization policy of Rochdale. The additional 15/25WWS points are used. This policy can also be used in combination with the measure ‘From Large to Better’ by which an exchange between a large house ‘to liberalize’ and a smaller ‘convert to social rent’ house can take place. The use of this combination measure on reasonable conditions for the current residents makes it possible to increase the supply of large houses. It has been found that Rochdale financially loses little or nothing since there is a financial compensation that can be created by liberalizing the large house. It should also be noted that by doing nothing it also wont be possible to create additional income as there is little moving flow and few houses can be liberalized. Combination of ‘15/25 WWS and maximum reasonable’ and ‘Conversion to 4 bedrooms) Also the use of a combination measure that includes the measure 'conversion to 4 bedrooms’ has the potential to increase the supply of large houses. Strong aspects of increasing the supply through the use of this measure are the size and distribution through the city of the potential supply, namely the 4 room houses. The large 4 room houses that become available after mutation may, if structurally possible, be adapted and offered to large middle-income families. It requires a combination of this measure with the '15 / 25WWS and 100% maximum reasonable 'measure in order to liberalize the dwelling and offer it to a large middle-income family. Main recommendation ; Combination of all three measures Within Rochdale a follow-up study should be conducted to gain insight in how much organizational and financial space there is for adjustments of the measures as discussed. One may start with a general assesment of the options to deploy the adjusted measures separately. The project ‘Form large to Better' must be evaluated again, especially with respect to the conditions that are related to participation in this project. In this exchange it should be made possible to have an exchange between a social rented dwelling and a commercial rented dwelling whereby the '15 / 25WWS and 100% maximum reasonable ""measure is used. This project ‘Form Large to Better’ has the potential to better serve the large middle income families. This will be possible if the potential supply of large houses for this project is being sought in the 3 bedroom houses. Rochdale should therefore do a follow-up study to gain insight in the possibilities to use the ‘Form Large to Better)’ project and ‘15/25WWS and 100 maximum reasonable’ in order to get more large houses available and thereby the increase of this potential exchange supply by the use of the ‘Conversion to 5 rooms’ measure.","grote gezinnen; Amsterdam; EU-beleid","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-02-01","Architecture","Real Estate & Housing","","Housing:Policy, Management and Sustainability","",""

The Mekong Delta is responsible for producing half of the national food volume for Vietnam. Socio-economic and agricultural development in particular, have encountered several restrictive factors though: decreasing amount of agricultural land, flooding of the Mekong River, acid sulphate soils and acid water movement, shortage of fresh-water and salt-water intrusion from the East Sea during low-flow discharges. The Dutch Delta Commission has been asked for advise, and the Commission recommended closure of the Cung Hau, Co Chien and Ham Luong branches of the Mekong River, all present in the Tien River estuary. The recommendation of the Commission has not been substantiated yet. It is expected that closure will have a positive influence on the salt-water intrusion and fresh-water availability, but also severe erosion in connecting channels and increasing flood water levels upstream might be occurring. In this report, the project goal is therefore determined as: “To determine and design the preferred type of closure of the Cung Hau, Co Chien and Ham Luong branches, that reduces salt-water intrusion in the Tien River estuary, minimalizes erosion of the connecting channels and prevents unacceptable increases of flood water levels”. The preferred type of closure is determined by means of the effects on salt-water intrusion, morphological changes and flood water levels.

One concept of such an aircraft is a hybrid helicopter that uses highly efficient diesel engines and electrical propulsion motors. The feasibility of this concept is greatly determined by the feasibility of its main propulsion motor. The very challenging specifications of such a motor means that new technologies have to be used. One of these possible technologies is superconductivity. In this thesis a first technical feasibility study on a direct drive superconducting propulsion motor for a hybrid helicopter concept is performed. Superconductors are special materials that have virtually no electrical resistance when cooled down below a certain critical temperature. This property makes it possible to build high field and low weight coils for electrical machines. A helicopter’s electrical propulsion motor requires a very high torque density. Conventional electrical machines like permanent magnet designs are too heavy for this application. Superconducting motors may achieve the required torque densities, because of their high performance at low weight. In this thesis, first a literature study of superconductivity is presented. After that the machine is designed in three parts: The armature design, the superconducting field windings design and the cryostat design. After that all the results are combined and the complete machine parameters, like the power density, are defined. Finally a conclusion is given on the feasibility of the superconducting propulsion motor and recommendations are given for future work.","superconduction; superconductivity; propulsion motor; electrical motor; helicopter; YBCO","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-01-31","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Electrical Power Processing (EPP)","","","",""

Als gevolg hiervan is het bouwcollege afgeschaft en is in 2012 een nieuw financieringsstelsel ingevoerd. Deze wijzigingen gaan gepaard met forse bezuinigingen in de zorgsector. Door de wijziging van financieringsstelsel worden de zorginstellingen zelf verantwoordelijk voor de risico’s van het vastgoed. De houdbaarheid van instellingsterreinen staat hierdoor onder druk. Door afwezigheid van prikkels om efficiënt met vastgoed om te gaan is een groot deel van het vastgoed in de GGZ functioneel verouderd en sluit het niet meer aan bij de behoeften van de cliënt. Het ruimtegebruik op de meeste instellingsterreinen is niet efficiënt. De transformatiebehoefte van GGZ instellingen is groot. Deze behoefte is urgenter geworden door de wijzigingen in het financieringsstelsel. Met de invoering van de integrale kostprijs is strategisch sturen op vastgoed belangrijker geworden. De rol van vastgoed in relatie tot het zorgproces wordt belangrijker. Het creëren van waardecreatie bij de herontwikkeling van GGZ instellingsterreinen wordt belangrijker. De zorgomgeving kan een verschil maken in hoe snel een patiënt hersteld of zich aanpast aan chronische ziekten dit wordt healing environment genoemd. Duurzame gebiedsontwikkeling kan bijdragen aan het realiseren van een omgeving die ondersteunend is aan het primaire proces van een zorg instelling. De bouwsector verandert naar duurzamere vormen van ontwikkelen. Financiële krapte leidde tot het stilliggen van veel bouwprojecten. Het traditionele verdienmodel van verkoop van gronden om de nieuwbouw te financieren werkt niet meer. Er wordt gezocht naar duurzamere vormen van gebiedsontwikkeling. Er ontbreekt kennis over de implementatie van duurzame herontwikkeling van GGZ instellingsterreinen. Het onderzoek richt zich erop of duurzame aanpak kan bij dragen aan de herontwikkeling van instellingsterreinen. Probleemstelling “Er ontbreekt kennis over de implementatie van duurzame herontwikkeling van GGZ instellingsterreinen naar een healing environment.” Doelstelling Dit onderzoek heeft tot doel inzicht te krijgen in enerzijds het creëren van waarde bij de herontwikkeling van GGZ instellingsterreinen en anderzijds het verbinden van de belangen van zorg en vastgoed. Doel van het ontwerp is het ontwikkelen van een procesinstrument dat stuurt waardecreatie in de zorg met vastgoed. Het onderzoek beoogt een bijdrage te leveren aan het bevorderen van de implementatie van duurzame gebiedsontwikkeling in de zorg en het opgang brengen van de benodigde cultuurverandering van kosten denken naar prestatie denken als gevolg van de invoering van prestatiebekostiging. Het onderzoek operationaliseert het concept healing environment. Onderzoeksvraag Op welke wijze kan bij de herontwikkeling van GGZ instellingsterreinen gestuurd worden op het creëren van een healing environment, waarbij een duurzame win-win situatie van zorgkwaliteit en financiële haalbaarheid bereikt wordt? Onderzoekaanpak In het eerste deel van het onderzoek word ingegaan op de context van zorgvastgoed en duurzame gebiedsontwikkeling. Het beschrijvende onderzoek gaat daarom dieper in op beide onderzoeksvelden zowel vanuit de theorie als vanuit de praktijk. Door middel van interviews en case analyses wordt meer inzicht verkregen in de veranderende zorgmarkt en de mogelijkheden van duurzame gebiedsontwikkeling en healing environment. Deze fase wordt afgesloten met twee stellingen als uitgangspunt voor de ontwerpende onderzoeksfase. Op basis van de uitgangspunten uit het eerste deel van het onderzoek wordt in de ontwerpende onderzoeksfase getracht door middel van ontwerpen een oplossing te ontwikkelen voor de problematiek rondom de GGZ instellingsterreinen. Het doel van deze fase is bij te dragen aan de herontwikkeling van GGZ instellingsterreinen door middel van duurzame gebiedsontwikkeling. Figuur 1 geeft de aanpak schematisch weer. Veranderende rol vastgoed door financieringswijzigingen GGZ instellingen moeten nu strategisch gaan sturen op vastgoed om, om te gaan met risico’s van het vastgoed. Bij de herontwikkeling van instellingsterreinen wordt de waardecreatie belangrijker. Het vastgoed dient toegevoegde waarde te leveren aan het zorgproces. Middels een healing environment draagt een instellingsterrein bij aan het zorgproces. Vanuit de praktijk wordt met de interviews onderstreept dat de financiële houdbaarheid van de instellingsterreinen onder druk staat door de wijzigingen. De huidige staat van de meeste instellingen terreinen wordt omschreven als slecht en de transformatiebehoefte is groot. De herontwikkeling van deze terreinen ligt stil onder andere door de forse bezuinigingen, door lastige externe financiering en politieke onzekerheden. Bovendien blijkt uit de interviews dat veel GGZ instellingen zijn overgestapt op strategische vastgoedplannen. Het vastgoed had door gegarandeerde bekostiging financieel geen belang bij de zorg. Door de integrale kostprijs dient het vastgoed het zorgproces kwalitatief te ondersteunen. Middels een healing environment draagt een instellingsterrein bij aan het zorgproces. Helende omgeving in de zorg Duurzame gebiedsontwikkeling kan bijdragen aan het realiseren van een healing environment in de zorg. Uit de interviews bleek dat de meerwaarde van duurzame ontwikkelingen in de praktijk nauwelijks erkend wordt. Het zorgproces is primair. De holistische aanpak van healing environment spreekt daardoor wel aan, maar de geïnterviewde hadden moeite met concreet invullen van het concept. Bij een duurzame ontwikkeling ligt de nadruk op waarde creatie op de lange termijn. Een sturingsmethode om te komen tot een duurzame ontwikkeling is fusie van belangen. Middels gebiedsontwikkeling nieuwe stijl wordt fusie van belangen in de zorg weergegeven als de belangen van zorg, vastgoed en duurzame ingrepen. Vergelijken we de aanpak van de geanalyseerde voorbeeldcasussen met de fusie van belangen dan kan geconcludeerd worden dat bij alle drie de casussen de zorg (people) wordt verbonden met het vastgoed (profit) door middel van duurzame ingrepen (planet). Fusie van belangen Fusie van belangen is een sturingsmethode op basis van belangen. Het doel van de methode is het behartigen van de belangen van mens, milieu en economie. Waarbij gezocht wordt naar het snijvlak waar deze belangen elkaar raken (overeenkomen). Er ontstaan win-win situaties door het fuseren van belangen naar een gemeenschappelijk belang. Op basis van deze methode worden eerst de belangen van zorg en vastgoed geïdentificeerd. Het belang van de zorg bestaat uit het bieden van zorg aan psychische cliënten en hun welbevinden te bevorderen. Het belang van vastgoed bestaat uit het bijdragen aan het zorgproces. Deze belangen worden in het concept healing environment verenigt. De omgeving ondersteunt het zorgproces. Duurzame ingrepen verbinden de belangen van zorg en vastgoed. In de Geestelijke gezondheidszorg is het belang van een healing environment groter doordat kwetsbare groepen gevoeliger zijn voor stimuli uit de omgeving. De financiële haalbaarheid van healing environment ontstaat door de vastgoedexploitatie te koppelen aan de zorg waardoor een integrale business case ontstaat. Met de invoering van de prestatiebekostiging wordt deze koppeling bevordert. Bij een healing environment draagt de omgeving bij aan de zorg en levert daarmee een besparing op de behandelkosten op. Er is een win-win situatie ontstaan. Er zijn nog geen concreet meetbare resultaten over de effecten van gebiedsingrepen op de zorg. In het conceptuele model zullen aannames gedaan worden over mogelijke financiële effecten. Resultaat: Healing environment Doel van dit onderzoek is om op basis van de bevindingen uit voorgaande hoofdstukken (een, twee en vier) een conceptueel model te ontwikkelen. Dit onderzoek operationaliseert het concept healing environment voor GGZ instellingsterreinen. Healing environment is geconcretiseerd aan de hand van zes thema’s. Het concept is geoperationaliseerd middels het ontwerpen van eenendertig gebiedsingrepen. Daarnaast is een workshop ontwikkeld, waarin de belangen zorg en vastgoed op een duurzame manier fuseren. Het creëren van healing environment is het gemeenschappelijk belang van zorg en vastgoed. De workshop beoogt een eerste stap in de benodigde cultuurverandering te bereiken. Een verandering die nodig is om te anticiperen op de invoering van integrale kosttarieven. De producten (model, ingrepen en workshop) zijn getoetst bij GGZ Centraal middels een diepte case studie (hoofdstuk zes). Concretisering healing environment Healing environment geconcretiseerd met behulp van duurzame gebiedsontwikkeling. Healing environment is onderverdeelt in de volgende zes thema’s: Gebiedsmanagement, Welzijn, Toekomst rendement, Ruimtelijke ontwikkeling, Bronnen, Gebiedsklimaat. De thema’s zijn uitgewerkt in eenendertig concrete duurzame gebiedsingrepen die toepasbaar zijn op GGZ instellingsterreinen. De ingrepen zijn in hoofdstuk 5.5 gepresenteerd. Financiële effecten healing environment Het verdienmodel van healing environment bestaat uit meerdere aspecten. Draagt het vastgoed bij aan het zorgproces dan is er sprake van een healing environment en verdienen de investeringen in het vastgoed zich terug door besparingen in de zorg. Duurzame ingrepen leveren besparingen op voor de langere termijn.. De drie toegevoegde waarde voor een healing environment zijn productiviteit, winstgevendheid en onderscheidend vermogen (van der Voordt, 2011). Deze waarde zijn verder onderverdeeld in mogelijke effecten vaneen healing environment bij een GGZ instelling. Workshop Om cultuuromslag in de geestelijke gezondheidszorg op gang te brengen van kosten denken naar prestatie denken is een workshop ontwikkeld op basis van fusie van belangen. De waaier kan tijdens de werkvormen ingezet worden om healing environment te operationaliseren op lokaal niveau. Doelstellingen van de workshop zijn inspireren met duurzame gebiedsingrepen, agenderen van de mogelijkheden van een healing environment, stimuleren van cultuuromslag om te anticiperen op de invoering van integrale tarieven het bevorderen van de samenwerking tussen zorg en vastgoed binnen een GGZ organisatie. De handleiding voor de workshop is uitgeschreven in paragraaf 5.6. Toetsing GGZ Centraal Door middel van een workshop tijdens een diepte case studie is het conceptuele model getoetst. Uit de beoordeling van de posters blijkt dat alle ingrepen geschikt zijn voor de psychiatrie. Gedurende de workshop ontstond er een gemeenschappelijk belang doordat beide disciplines met elkaar in dialoog en onderhandeling kwamen, waarbij uiteindelijk moest worden samengewerkt. Dit gemeenschappelijk belang kan door GGZ Centraal gebruikt worden om draagvlak te creëren voor de herontwikkeling van de instellingsterreinen. Vanuit de toetsing van het model kan geconcludeerd worden dat het model Healing Environment aansluit bij de belevingswereld van de deelnemers en dat beide belangen behartigd worden door het concept Healing Environment. GGZ Centraal kan healing environment hierdoor gebruiken als gemeenschappelijk belang. Eindconclusie Het onderzoek legt een eerste basis voor het fuseren van de belangen vastgoed en zorg tot het gemeenschappelijke belang healing environment. Duurzame gebiedsingrepen verbinden de belangen van vastgoed en zorg. Met het onderzoek is healing environment geconcretiseerd. De thema’s van healing environment zijn: gebiedsmanagement, welzijn, toekomst rendement, ruimtelijke ontwikkeling, bronnen en gebiedsklimaat. Hiermee ontstaat een gemeenschappelijke taal voor zorg en vastgoed. Healing environment is geoperationaliseerd aan de hand van duurzame gebiedsingrepen. De meerwaarde van een healing environment bestaat vooral uit de nieuwe rol van vastgoed in het primaire zorgproces. Effecten die hieruit ontstaan zijn: productiviteit, winstgevendheid en onderscheidend vermogen. Uit het onderzoek blijkt dat healing environment bruikbaar is bij de herontwikkeling van GGZ instellingsterreinen. Healing environment bevordert de samenwerking tussen zorg en vastgoed. Aanbevelingen Omgevingspsychologie in relatie tot vastgoed Met vastgoed worden beslissingen gemaakt die invloed hebben op de leefomgeving van mensen. Kennis van de relatie van mensen met de bebouwde omgeving kan waardevolle inzichten opleveren. De combinatie van vastgoed en omgevingspsychologie blijkt toegevoegde waarde te hebben en dient als aanbeveling voor verder onderzoek. Meetinstrument van financiële meerwaarde Om de effecten van gebiedsingrepen financieel inzichtelijk te maken is een meetinstrument nodig, waarmee de effecten van een healing environment bepaald kunnen worden. Het meetbaar maken van de effecten van een healing environment draagt bij aan de implementatie van een kwalitatieve duurzame omgeving. Om de haalbaarheid te vergroten is het belangrijk gebleken om de financiële waarde inzichtelijk te kunnen maken. Opbrengsten kunnen pas echt met een investering meegenomen worden als de meerwaarde ervan concreet uitgedrukt kan worden. Het meetbaar maken van de effecten van healing environment draagt hier aan bij.","GGZ; instellingsterreinen; care; healing environment; zorg; vastgoed; gebiedsontwikkeling; duurzaamheid","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-02-01","Architecture","Real Estate & Housing","","Urban Area Development","",""

(mentor); Meijers, A.V.M. (mentor)","2013","All over the world containers are used for transporting cargo; in a safe and protected way from sender to receiver and vice versa. On average 20% of the containers on sea and 40% of the containers on land are transported empty (1). Holland Container Innovations (HCI) has developed a steel foldable maritime 40ft high cube container, the 4FOLD, it can save costs and space during handling and transport. The 4FOLD complies with ISO-standards and the International Convention for Safe Containers (CSC). A bundle of four folded 4FOLDs has the same external dimensions as one unfolded 4FOLD and requires no special handling or transport. Bundling four 4FOLDs requires an interlocking device. Regulations dealing with handling multiple containers at once prescribe that when the total mass of a hoisted bundle is above 20tons an interlocking device must be an integral part of the container (2). A bundle of 4FOLDs is 24tons, therefor HCI wants an interlocking device integrated and certified with the 4FOLD, to obey regulations and prevent the interlocking device from getting lost or being replaced by an uncertified and/or unsuited devices. Integrating an interlocking device is already being done in flat racks and platform containers; the industry standard is the double twistlock, attached to the container via a linkage. The double twistlock needs a ‘large box’ in the roof reducing the cargo space and when damaged or corroded it can dismantle from the container. The objective of this study is to focus on how and what kind of interlocking device can be integrated into the 4FOLD. Resulting in the following research question: Can an interlocking device for bundling folded containers be integrated into a foldable container?","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-02-01","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Marine and Transport Technology","","Transport Engineering and Logistics","",""
