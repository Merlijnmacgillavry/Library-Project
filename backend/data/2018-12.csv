Firstly, through literature studies and iterative design process a prototype seatpan was designed and developed using spring-foam technology. This was then tested against standard aircraft seat pan for comfort and discomfort; 22 participants were asked to sit in each seat for 90 minutes while filling out comfort and discomfort questionnaire every 15 minutes. At the end of each seating session, pressure map was taken of the seatpan. The results showed prototype seatpan having significantly higher initial comfort (~0 min.), and at the 35 and 50-minute mark than standard seatpan. Pressure map data showed pressure distribution of the prototype seatpan was found to be significantly closer to an ideal pressure distribution opposed to the conventional seatpan. In addition, the prototype seatpan had a significantly bigger contact area and lower average pressure suggesting a higher comfort. The seat-cushion weighs 20% lower than conventional seat-cushion. The study indicates that a seat pan design using spring-foam technology can be lighter and more comfortable than conventional foam cushion materials.","seat pan; pressure distribution; comfort; aircraft seat; ideal seat contour","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although many different solutions for wave energy conversion (WEC) are being developed and financial support schemes exist, commercially extracting this energy seems however to be rather challenging. Major troubles are over-priced first projects and incapability to endure year-round oceanic conditions. While the costs are expected to reduce once a successful WEC-device enters large scale production, it is unclear what device type would be the most viable. This study presents a combination of available methods and tools that together allow to assess viability of WEC-devices in early stage of development. Prior to including economic factors, the most important aspect that defines viability is power performance. Comparing simulated power performance of different concepts for WEC is complicated by their different level of optimization of control strategies. Renowned studies that compared the power performance of various device types have been extended by calculating the viability for one particular promising device type: the quasi-rigid, submerged pressure differential device. This device appears promising being protected by its submerged position, while performing as if it was placed in the high intensity waves at the surface. The diffraction software tools commonly used for hydrodynamic calculations, could not be applied to calculate quasi-rigid (volume-changing) objects. For this problem a method is suggested which adds the functionality of panel selection to exclude surface areas of a body design for hydrodynamic calculation. In this thesis both the average power performance in time-domain simulations and the maximum power limits were calculated in order to compare the submerged pressure differential device to other point absorbing WEC-devices. The suggested methods contribute to defining a generic way of comparing future concepts for WEC to converge towards a single approach and select WEC-devices for investment.","Wave energy; time domain; Viability; point absorber; excitation; RAO; conversion; heave; power performance; power matrix; panel selection; Diffraction; AQWA; WECSim; Hydrodynamic; hydrodynamic forces; Analytical approach","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore a rating curve is often used to estimate the river discharge. Limited measurements under extreme conditions result in extrapolation of the rating curve for high flow conditions. This induces uncertainties and errors in the stage-discharge relation. Recently there has been a gradual shift to more physically based rating curves, where the geometry of a river is included and no extrapolation is needed. This seems to be a promising shift to improve traditional river rating. However, the challenge now is to accurately determine the parameters bed roughness and hydraulic slope. The aim of this research is to develop and evaluate a method to better estimate the hydraulic parameters bed roughness and hydraulic slope.

Comprehensive multi-year simulations of shoreline changes and forecasts are feasible with process-based models. However, these detailed and computationally expensive numerical simulations do not always lead to increased predictive skill in comparison to simpler shoreline models (Davidson et al., 2013). ShoreFor (Davidson et al., 2013) employs the concept of (dis-) equilibrium of shoreline location following Wright and Short (1985). In this research, the current ShoreFor model (Splinter et al., 2014) is used as baseline. ShoreFor seeks for an optimum decay factor that best describes the morphological response of a coastal system to the corresponding hydrodynamic forcing. This parameter is measured in days and effectively controls the shoreline response timescale. Currently, the ShoreFor model provides a single value for φ, representing a single dominant shoreline response timescale. As morphological systems can contain multiple dominant timescale responses, a new approach to multi-timescale shoreline change modelling is proposed. Three video-derived datasets are used to improve the model towards a generally applicable one which incorporates multiple temporal scales: Narrabeen (Australia), Nha Trang (Vietnam) and Grand Popo (Benin). Each dataset has different hydrodynamic- and morphological characteristics. The storm timescale is a dominant mode of shoreline response for Narrabeen, whereas for Nha Trang and Grand Popo the seasonal timescale is the most dominant. Furthermore, all sites are subjected to more modes of shoreline response such that the application of a single memory decay factor will hamper shoreline modelling. The existing model is improved using 3 steps.In the first step, the raw wave- and shoreline signals are filtered to distinguish temporal scales. Then filtered temporal scales in shoreline position are forced with the corresponding scales in the wave signals. For each temporal scale, a distinct memory decay factor φ is found. In the second step, the effect of small temporal scales in wave forcing on larger temporal scales in shoreline position is accounted for. The improved model takes this effect into account using the envelope of the filtered wave signals. The envelope is used to force the model and to calculate shoreline change with the same timescale. In the third and final step, the effect of large temporal scales in shoreline position on smaller scales in shoreline response is accounted for. The efficiency with which waves induce cross-shore sediment transport can be dependent on the large scale shoreline variation. A time varying response factor c is introduced that controls the efficiency with which waves induce cross-shore sediment transport. The dynamic response factor varies over time with the shape of the larger scale shoreline signal: it represents the effect of the large scale shoreline variation on the smaller scale shoreline response.","Coastal Engineering; Shoreline change modelling; ShoreFor; Multi-timescale","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","",""

One of the major challenges is using waste as a resource. Midwaste, a cooperative association that manages waste streams and covers around 130 municipalities for the plastic waste dossier, is contributing in working towards a circular economy. As the client of this project, it requested looking into creating a valuable product out of the leftover mix fraction out of domestic plastic waste.<br/>Municipalities in the Netherlands are separating domestic plastic waste, PMD, from residual waste. After collection, it is separated further into mono streams to bring these back in the circle. However, not all the plastics can be separated yet, which results in 25% leftover mix fraction, consisting out of polyolefins and impurities. The composition and quality of the mix fluctuates, which makes it a challenging material to work with. Half of the mix is still burned and half of the mix is recycled into new products. However, there still is variety of possibilities and challenges for implementing the mix into products. <br/><br/>The initial goal in this project was to develop a valuable product with the mix to show its potential value. It appeared that the mix was not processed with rotational moulding yet. By doing some tests with agglomerate, both with producing powder out of agglomerate and rotomoulding this powder, the potential of this material using rotational moulding has been proved. The characteristics of this material processed by rotomoulding are still unknown. The biggest challenge in further development is producing suitable powder out the agglomerate that is made by the recycler. The impurities are challenging, both in damaging the grinding system and constipating the sieves of the machinery. Besides the impurities, there is another challenge in finding the right additives for this material to improve the characteristics. <br/><br/>Besides proving the potential of the leftover mix using rotomoulding, CirculEm has been developed. CirculEm is a small rain barrel, partially made out of the mix, that responds to two aspects regarding a circular economy. First, using waste as a resource, and secondly CirculEm responds to climate adaptation on a local level. The outside layer of the barrel is made out the mix that shows the expression of the recycled material. The inside layer of virgin PE provides strength and stiffness to the product. However, it is discussable to blend the mix with virgin material regarding to the end of life aspect of CirculEm. When characteristics are known, this multilayer construction could be optimised. <br/><br/>Research showed that products made out of the mix tell a good story. Combining ‘using waste as a resource’ with creating products that respond to other aspects that work towards a circular economy, like climate adaptation and energy transition, makes this story even stronger. The municipality of Breda and Rotterdam, seem interested in CirculEm, because they are looking for solutions regarding water management on private area. CirculEm might be the missing link between municipalities and the commonality by starting the collaboration in tackling climate adaptation on private areas. <br","Recycling; Plastic domestic waste; Agglomerate; Rotational moulding","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

As a consequence, automated driving technologies are becoming increasingly popular. Research on comfort for autonomous vehicles, however, is still limited and unexplored. Some researchers address the comfort issue in path planning by velocity profiles, which regulates the instantaneous values of vehicle acceleration and jerk. Meanwhile, the actuator response to external disturbances and the inaccurate following can result in the violation to the pre-designed path, and therefore causes an uncomfortable driving experience. In order to tackle the passenger comfort issue from the perspective of path following control, this study proposes a frequency shaped model predictive control scheme that is (1) robust under external disturbances and (2) able to optimize passenger comfort by regulating the vehicle lateral acceleration with respect to its corresponding frequency. The frequency is selected based on the comfort evaluation criteria proposed in ISO 2631. Further, the proposed controller is tested in three simulation scenarios, compared to three baseline controllers with respect to tracking accuracy and driving comfort. Finally, our analysis shows that the FSMPC controller can improve driving comfort, especially at the velocity higher than 60 km/h.","Path Following; Passenger Comfort; Model Predictive Control; Disturbance Rejection","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

The sensors’ response to a known pulse needs to be tested in order to give a pass/fail indication of the sensor quality. First, different ways of testing the sensors are investigated. Based on the results of the investigation, a final test setup is chosen and characterized. The test system developed in this thesis is based on a pneumatic setup, using a solenoid valve to control well-defined air pulses directed towards the sensors. Due to the addition of a reference load cell with custom designed read-out electronics, the device is able to test all six sensors one at the time and provides detailed feedback about the individual sensor quality. The test is performed using GUI-based software written in MATLAB, connected to a microcontroller. The software offers a broad variety of settings and can be configured according to Momo Medical’s wishes. After configuration, the test can be performed at the click of a button.

In the upcoming years, an increasing number of offshore wind farms is expected. Over the past years, all the 'best spots' are taken and the new locations in tougher soil conditions or even rock have to be overcome. The conventional pile driving technique is a less attractive solution here, because there is a significant chance to pile buckling. Drilling is an alternative method which is able to complete these installations successful in tougher soils and rock. Furthermore, in certain regions, the rules with respect to maximum noise levels during pile driving become stricter these days and the use of noise mitigation measurements can significantly increase the costs of the installation. Drilling can be an alternative method which decreases the noise generated during the installation. The drilling phase plays a crucial role in the total drilling process, which can easily take up more than half of the total pile installation time. For installing a large amount of foundation piles, it is important, especially during the tender phase of a project, to have a good prediction of the drilling rate.<br/>Currently, the available drilling rate models are mainly empirical and therefore tend to be specific to a certain drilling method in a particular type of rock. The goal of this thesis is to give a better prediction of the drilling rate, which is applicable for various amount of large diameter drills. In order to predict the drilling rate, a theoretical based model is developed. The model consists of an excavation and a transportation part, which can both limit the drilling rate. The excavation model determines the excavation limit of the drill. It makes a distinction between cutter heads that consist of pick points and cutter heads that consist of rollers cutters, which can be further distinguished into tooth, button or v-shaped discs cutters. In order to calculate the drilling rate, a literature study is done towards the excavation process of rock, where the existing cutting and indentation models are reviewed and incorporated within the model. The transport model determines the transportation limit of the drill. The rock chips, generated by the excavation process, need to be transported in order to continue the drilling process. In most cases, transportation of cuttings takes place by the use of an airlift system. To model the limit of an airlift system, the momentum balance over the length of the airlift pipe is solved, which defines the maximum quantity of solids that is able to be transported. The model shows a good resemblance with experimental results obtained from the raise boring industry. Furthermore, a similar trend is observed between the model and values obtained from offshore drilling manufacturers. It is now possible to give a theoretical based prediction of the drilling rate for the installation of drilled foundation piles, which is applicable for a wide range of large diameter drills.","Drilling; Linear rock cutting theory; Rock excavation theory; Airlift model; Drilling model; Offshore and dredging; Indentation; Roller bits; Offshore foundation piles; Offshore wind; Rate of penetration","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-12-11","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

PJI is a complication that follows total joint replacement and is devastating for the patient. It causes physical and mental strain and the patient's health never returns to close to what it was prior to the complication. It furthermore lays a financial burden on hospitals and society. The assignment for this thesis is initiated by Zimmer Biomet, the leading manufacturer for orthopaedic medical devices and joint prostheses. It is expected that providing services and tools that aid in the management and prevention of PJI cases will become a future strategy of Zimmer Biomet. The research in this thesis defines that the biggest problem concerning the management and prevention of PJI cases is the presence of a knowledge gap between guidelines defined by experts and appliable knowledge by staff. The multidisciplinary team (MDT) dashboard is a solution to this problem. This dashboard aids in the diagnosis and decision for treatment method of PJI cases. It is used both prior to and during the MDT meeting, which is a meeting during which a team of physicians from varying disciplines discuss PJI cases to arrive to a just diagnosis and optimal decisions for treatment methods. The dashboard provides visual aids, to help all members communicate their substantiation and to ensure that every aspect is discussed. It furthermore gives a non-binding advice, based on the patient data and guidelines developped by PJI experts. A digital prototype of the dashboard and a strategy are also presented. After validation of both these elements, further elaboration is given on the technical and organisational implementation of the dashboard, into hospitals. It is concluded that the dashboard is feasible, desirable and viable and that it will aid in the management and prevention of PJI cases. Next to aiding surgeons and MDT members, it will improve patient outcome and will serve an economic and societal goal. It is therefore recommended that Zimmer Biomet continues the development and pursues the implementation of the dashboard.","Healthcare; Design; Innovation management; Implementation; Service design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

Often research activities are based on L1b data; in this thesis, a new Cryosat-2 SARIn FBR-to-L1b processor is developed to evaluate whether elevation measurements improve when we reconstruct a L1b product from the FBR data. The L1b-to-L2 processing is performed by means of Swath Processing, by which an increase in amount of measurement points is achieved with respect to the amount in conventional L2 products. The analysis is limited to the Petermann glacier, located in the North-West of Greenland, which is known for its large calving events. The results are verified by comparing them to the ESA products. It is shown that the resulting elevations following from the FBR-to-L1b processor agree; we detect significant variability in topography as present in the Petermann Glacier region that can induce data gaps in the raw FBR data; with consequences for the L1b- and L2 products.

Transition theories state collaboration between stakeholders is the most important factor to transition successfully, and within the construction and infrastructure sector, partnering is seen as the ultimate form of collaboration.

Some elements of partnering contribute to the transition, others hamper it. Also, partnering triggers a motor of change in the transition, which acts as a flying wheel to accelerate the transition. Therefore, partnering plays a role in the circular economic transition both directly as well as indirectly.<br/>Knowledge of the concept of partnering and the benefits it can bring can be highly positive for projects with a circular economic ambition, therefore, project team members as well as the client of such infrastructure projects should be knowledgeable about this topic. Furthermore, the current focus on the Iron Triangle in infrastructure projects is seen as a threat to the transition to a circular economy; something which will need to change radically, but can only be influenced slowly but steadily.<br","Circular Economy; Infrastructure; (Multilateral) Partnering; Circular Economic Transition; Transition Theory; Single Case Study","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

While startups create disruptive and incremental innovations with their technical and creative expertise, many lack the financial resources to grow their company. VC funds provide this needed finance – in addition to business acumen – in exchange for an equity share of their company, with the hope that this risky investment will produce a significant return. Though the importance of adequate VC stimulation in the startup community is well discussed and agreed upon by many studies, as a theoretical concept, ecosystems of VC remain underdeveloped, making it difficult to comprehend how a VC ecosystem works, and more importantly, how to improve one. Nations hope to improve their VC activity and therefore their global competitiveness, by consulting the current VC literature and other comparative VC publications (scoreboards, case studies and regional benchmarks), but these do not approach VC from an ecosystem perspective, which might explain the discrepancy in their results and conclusions. The absence of an ecosystem perspective in VC literature, results in a lack of a holistic understanding of the mechanisms of a venture capital ecosystem (VCE). Consequently, this shortage of comprehension might explain why current studies do not provide the reasons for the shortcoming of the Dutch VCE.

Move on is designed to stimulate adolescents to be more physically active. This stimulation is done by gamification, which therefore can be considered as serious gaming product. This thesis starts with a literature analysis of the decreasing level of childrens’ physical well-being. Added to this analysis, is a literature research on the increased digitalization among children to see if there is a connection between their increased screen-time and the decreasing level of fitness. A relation between digitalization and emotional behavior, and digitalization and social relationships, has also been taken into account. <br/>It seems that there is no clear proof of the coherency between the increasing digitalization and decreasing physical activity. Which was a positive result, since the advantages of the digitalization could be taken into account when designing a product for children. After finding out that the adolescents, of all children, spend the most time stuck to their screens, the target group for the ideation phase was determined. A target group analysis and a market analysis eventually lead, together with the previous insights, to a full program of requirements and therefore the end of the design brief. The design brief created the base for the next phase: the synthesis phase. Within the synthesis phase of the product development, some concept directions were found. These concept directions lead to some iteration steps which eventually resulted in the embodiment phase of the Move on. The embodiment phase describes the final concept with regard to its materials, production method, and price estimation. An important part of the Move on, is that it is able to recognize the user motion. This motion will be converted to a reward, which the user can use in their favorite game. Since this motion recognition plays a big role in the product, a basic machine learning validation is executed. Data from walking and running sessions is used to actually predict if the user is walking or running. This validation succeeded with a hit rate value of 96 percent. The end of the thesis will describe recommended steps fur future development of the product, together with a project and a personal evaluation.","Physical Activity; Gamification; Children; Machine Learning; Stimulation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-12-21","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

Due to the curvatures of shell structures, shell can carry the distributed load as membrane forces instead of bending moments. Due to the small thickness, shell structures are highly sensitive to imperfections. As the loads are carried by membrane forces, buckling failure often govern the design of shell structures. The buckling load could be predicted accurately by performing a nonlinear finite element analysis. However, performing a nonlinear finite element analysis is very time-consuming and expensive as a lot of computational efforts required. The currently used design formula of shell structures can lower down the requirement of computation in a great degree while the accuracy is not very satisfying. Different from other types of structures, shell buckling often starts locally, therefore, an assumption is made that shell buckling is a combination of membrane forces and curvatures. Thus, an improved buckling formula is proposed. In this report, the proposed formula is verified and optimized. In addition, the shell behaviour before buckling has been illustrated by a series of figures that show the deformation and stresses at several load steps.","","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

This results in the exploration of innovative vertical extension projects, such as the ’De Karel Doorman’ case in Rotterdam. However, demanding the construction method to be extreme light-weight revealed an unexpected normative serviceability phenomenon. The reducedmass did not dissipate enough vibrational energy induced by human activities such as walking, leading to an excessive and disturbing perception of vibrations. This caused nuisance for both the home situation where the motion takes place as for the neighbouring floor fields. The critical motion-related limit state has to be satisfied to create a comfortable living environment. This thesis aims to further develop the concept of light-weight steel and timber building structures focussing on vibration comfort. This is done by exploring structural measures that can steer the vibrational floor response for both the induced situation as for the transmittance to adjacent fields. Broadening research shows the general impact of the damping, natural frequency and modal mass. From this starting point, new practical building tools are developed to affect and control the path and magnitude of vibrations positively. General guidelines are provided that show the demands for a structural assembly to create suitable apartments. The proposed measures to steer the vibration comfort were researched using both the conventional handcalculation method from the SBR-guideline and by more accurate finite element analyses from SoViST and Autodesk Robot. The resulting OS-RMS90 values indicate the response velocity of the floor and have to meet the limit criteria proposed for the specific function of a building. For the light-weight residential building concept, these criteria were set to 0,8 [-] and 0,2 [-] for respectively the home and neighbouring situation. It was found that for light-weight building structures the implementation of a large amount of stiffness is inevitable in both the floor assembly as in the junction. The consequence of additionalmass and height can be balanced by using efficiently shaped profiles and smart placement of the joists. For the supporting beams, these demands encourage the use of rectangular hollow structural sections whereas for the floor assembly I-joists are recommended. Additional transverse stiffness stretches the clustering of natural frequencies for orthotropic plates but is most effective for two-way span floors. A smaller span will result in improved comfort levels but will complicate the structural assembly by introducing more elements and connections. Besides the overall performance enhancing measures, it was found that the limit criterion for neighbouring apartments is harder to achieve without additional interventions. Introducing more substantial obstacles for the vibrations to overcome along the path, will reflect the transmittance and hence steer the floor response towards improved comfort levels. The use of an alternating floor field can provide in this issue as it avoids the mode-coupling of natural frequencies from adjacent elements. One other recommendation is the differentiation of the home-separating and in-home junctions. This results in maintaining more vibration energy in the home situation and limits the nuisance caused from excitements in a neighbouring apartment. The as-built ’De Karel Doorman’ revealed the impact of additional stiff elements in the wall that substantially increase the bending and torsional stiffness in the junction. It was found that these elements mitigate the nuisance caused by footfalls to imperceptible values for adjacent floor fields. However, these elements do leave a mark on the flexibility of the floor plan. Light-weight building structures face new challenges and acknowledge the shift from strength-design to serviceability-design criteria. Regarding vertical extension projects, not just the building engineering aspects but also the practical implementation was found to contribute in the consideration for structural assembly measures.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

In recent years, the application of coda wave interferometry to concrete structure has been assessed for structural health monitoring purposes. Smart aggregate is a sensor which consists of a piezoelectric sheet which is sandwiched between two marble layers which are meant to be used for structural health monitoring purposes by embedding it into concrete. However, its implementation for coda wave interferometry applications had not been attempted previously. In this research, the application of coda wave interferometry in concrete structures is explored further. The aim of this research is to assess the possibility of implementing coda wave interferometry to monitor the hydration process and the evolution of elasticity-modulus of concrete, as well as to learn how the wavespeed changes in concrete specimens subjected to cyclic loading in compression and bending. Additionally, seismic interferometry is also attempted to retrieve virtual impulse response to be used for coda wave interferometry. All experiments in this research utilize smart aggregates as transducers. By implementing coda wave interferometry, it is found that wavespeed does increase as concrete ages. This wavespeed increase can be linked to the evolution of elasticity-modulus of concrete, which enables its value to be monitored through the utilization of coda wave interferometry. It is also found that the use of embedded smart aggregate yields excellent reciprocity and stable correlation coefficient throughout the recording, while attached smart aggregates do not perform as well as the embedded ones in terms of reciprocity and correlation coefficient. Positive linear wavespeed change vs. stress and strain relationships in compressive samples are observed in lower stresses. In higher stresses, both wavespeed change vs. stress and strain display gradient reductions. Under repeated cyclic loadings, the loading phase of the first load cycle tend to have lower initial wavespeed change vs. stress and strain gradients compared to the following load steps, and the wavespeed change vs. stress and strain paths of reloading phases tend to follow the paths of their previous unloading phases. Wavespeed change vs. strain is more representative compared to wavespeed change vs. stress in depicting the compressive specimens’ condition due to the occurrence of permanent deformation during loadings. In a 10m-long beam specimen subjected to bending and shear, coda wave interferometry of later arrivals reveal decrease in wavespeed in the first loading phase of the test, while earlier arrivals show increase in wavespeed in the same phase. Moreover, it is possible to detect major crack formations by utilizing coda wave interferometry, which sensitivity is determined by the location of the cracks relative to the source-receiver sensors’ proximity. By assessing earlier arrivals of the signals recorded by smart aggregate implanted in the compression zone, the shift from uncracked to cracked section is observed through changes in wavespeed change vs load gradients. Seismic interferometry attempt was unsuccessful due to poor repeatability of the hammer hits and insufficient illumination to create diffuse wavefield.","Coda Wave Interferometry; Structural Health Monitoring (SHM); Smart Aggregates; Concrete","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering","",""

In a fast-changing world where climate action is becoming increasingly important, there is need for an innovative approach in large infrastructural projects where nature is not considered as an obstacle, but stimulated and used in a sustainable way. The BwN design philosophy offers the opportunity to realize this improvement. This research first aimed to create an evaluation framework of (international) standards and goals to identify opportunities for improvement of a port masterplan and to get a better understanding of the need for sustainable port development. Included in this evaluation framework are, amongst others, the Port Vision2030, the Corporate Social Responsibility statement and the international strategy of the Port of Rotterdam (PoR). On the basis of these visions and standards, the corporate governance of the PoR was tested by conducting an informal opinion poll amongst twenty colleagues at the PoR (International, Environmental Management and Port Development). A practical example of a traditional port development project that can be improved by applying BwN is the Kuala Tanjung (KT) Port-Industrial complex at Sumatra, in Indonesia. This port development project is still in its initiation phase where a first master plan is proposed. Since the goal of the Indonesian government is to build a world-class port, international and sustainable standards apply. This project was used as a case to identify opportunities to improve a traditional master plan by applying a BwN approach. The evaluation framework was applied to the current master plan of KT to check whether this project meets the requirements for international port development, in particular from a nature/social point of view. It is concluded that the current design mainly focuses on the functional requirements of the port, proposing mitigation and compensation measures against the negative social and environmental impact of the port development. The BwN philosophy, on the other hand, prescribes a thorough understanding of the natural system emphasizing on the positive effects of the project for stakeholders and nature, to create a win-win solution. After applying the general evaluation framework, it became clear what aspects in the current master plan should be improved. A literature study of applied BwN solutions resulted in an onshore and offshore alternative for the port development including several BwN solutions. Together with experts involved in the KT project, it is concluded that the onshore alternative is more realistic (from a functional point of view), while still offering opportunities for applying the BwN philosophy. In the current natural system of KT the mangroves offer various important ecosystem services. In addition, it is concluded that the breakwaters proposed by the current master plan form a large part of the CAPEX. Consequently, a solution is proposed where mangroves are integrated in the design to attenuate waves and enhance nature at the same time. To test whether this BwN solution is realistic, a preliminary feasibility study has been executed. The results of a mangrove coastal protection program at Demak (Java, Indonesia) and various scientific articles (Ecoshape BwN Guidelines, 2018) about rehabilitation programs for mangroves have been used to set up a general checklist with habitat requirements for mangroves. These requirements were compared with the local conditions at KT and recommendations for creating these conditions at the breakwater location were given. According to the checklist, the site at KT appeared to be suitable for mangrove establishment. This resulted in preliminary mangrove breakwater designs for various depths. In addition, the effect of the BwN solution on the phasing of the adapted master plan was determined, rough cost estimates were made and the implementation risks were identified. According to these conditions, the mangrove-based breakwater appeared to be technically feasible for the first 2000 m of the shallow part of the south-eastern breakwater at KT. Finally, the evaluation framework was applied again to check if the current master plan of KT has been improved (read: less dilemmas occurring from deviating standards in Indonesia) and a general advice is given on the applicability of the selected BwN solution to other ports in Indonesia and (sub)tropical zones of the Asia Pacific region.","Building with Nature; Sustainable Development Goals; sustainable development; mangroves; international standards; permeable dams; breakwater; port design; port development; Indonesia; Indonesia ports; Port of Rotterdam; Port of Kuala Tanjung; Ecological approach; port planning; port master plan; Corporate Governance; Sustainability; climate change; Project Management; Stakeholder management; Innovation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","Port of Kuala Tanjung","3.3506353, 99.4513321"

The vehicles make use of the ground-effect (an effect where the drag is reduced, and the wings of the vehicles generate an increased lift). The unique speed and distance range of a WIG vehicle — a vehicle that, in functionality and appearance, sits somewhere between a ship and an aircraft — could be an ideal option for high-speed passenger transport on routes with ‘medium’ distances. That said, WIG vehicles have hardly ever been seen in civilian applications, such as high-speed passenger transport. This report answers the question: can WIG vehicles operating as high-speed passenger ferries, be feasible and profitable? This feasibility is assessed on the basis of literature research and real examples of WIG performance, functionality and profitability. Suitable routes and vehicles are selected based on criteria analyses. Using financial estimations, the profitability of two suitable WIG vehicles on two separate routes is investigated.The specifications of recently built WIG vehicles and their design drivers are analyzed by performing a literature research. This information reveals that WIG vehicles have one main limitation: a low seaworthiness. It is then likely that this limits the seakeeping operability for a number of vehicles. To deal with this limitation, suitable vehicles are selected using a criteria analysis. The literature research shows that the WSH-500 and the Aron M80 both have a relatively good seaworthiness. The vehicles differentiate in size (48p &amp; 6p). The costs of the vehicles are estimated by using general aviation cost estimation theory. A criteria analysis based on seakeeping operability and number of passengers and distance, shows two suitable routes: ‘Buenos Aires – Montevideo’ and ‘Helsinki – Tallinn’. The potential demand for WIG transport on these routes is estimated by creating demand curves of transport. The strategy to market WIG transport on these routes is estimated by using a market research to gage the potential demand. A suitable strategy is to target the top niche of customers on these routes. The profitability is estimated by combining the suitable vehicles, cost of vehicles, routes and strategy. The net present value and internal rate of return is calculated for a number of cases that are explained in this paper. The cases vary mainly on the following aspects: vehicle, total investment and route. In conclusion, WIG vehicles operating as high-speed passenger ferries can be feasible and profitable. The technology behind WIG vehicles has a technological readiness level of 8 out of 9. There are multiple, full-scale prototypes made and tested. Suitable vessels and routes have been selected to deal with the primary limitation that comes with WIG vehicles; they have low seaworthiness capabilities. The seakeeping operability rates of the selected vehicles and routes range between 91% and 100%. The net present value (NPV) and internal rate of return (IRR) of investments made in a WIG transport company can be positive in a number of cases.","WIG; Wing in ground; profitable; WSH-500; Aron M80; Aron; Ground effect vehicle; WIG vehicle; Burevestnik 24; Orion 12; wing in ground vehicle; WIG craft","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is shown using a PCA on the frequency spectra of several data sets that indeed a large redundancy in frequency content is present in onshore seismic data, and an attempt is made to generate a distribution of frequencies in order of importance. Given this redundancy in the frequency spectrum of onshore seismic data, it has been attempted to reconstruct the missing frequencies by applying the Fourier transformation iteratively to the data. However, this transform does not take spatial sampling into account, which is aimed at to compensate for the missing frequencies. Therefore it has been elected to use a linear Radon transformation instead, which keeps components which are connected in space-time connected in the transform domain. A CGNE scheme has been set up to reconstruct the data, which performs very well along the almost linear asymptots in the shot records, up to a reduction of 70% of frequency components. This scheme iteratively applies the linear Radon transform to a shot record, weighing the data in the transform domain with an amplitude based norm. The energy that was spread out due to aliasing because of the missing frequencies is refocused to the main reflectors, especially along the asymptots of the reflection hyperbola. Missing frequencies are reconstructed, up to a scaling factor, and band gaps of up to 6Hz get filled in very well. Next, it is attempted in this work to give quantitative quality metrics, to make comparison between seismic images easier and based on data, rather than subjective visual inspection. Treating migration as a black box, several quality metrics have been devised for the migrated sections: correlation to the ground truth, contrast within an image, average length of found lines, and local SNR. Contrast is not a very good metric to compare between images as its average across an image is almost constant with reduction percentage. The other parameters are good metrics and show a clear trend that the fewer frequency components present in the shot records, the worse the quality of the final image. An increase in deterioration of image quality is observed around 70% reduction, which is in correspondence with the earlier found value for the shot records.","Seismology; Frequency; Sparse inversion; Radon","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Earth Sciences","",""

Y. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","Engineering fields such as aerospace rely heavily on the Finite Element Method (FEM) as a modelling tool. In combination with the scale and complexity of the structures typically involved here, computational cost remains a traditional issue. To perform FEM analyses of such structures efficiently nonetheless, engineers rely on techniques such as substructure homogenisation. Essentially, the advantages to using homogenised models are an easier division of labour, less model preparation time and a reduced computational time. Unfortunately, the classical approach to substructuring is either limited to linear elasticity as in the case of static condensation, or is still computationally expensive as non-linear FEA of detailed substructure models need to be performed each time a different loading is applied to the full structure. To improve the efficiency and/or accuracy of homogenised substructures, it would therefore be of interest to develop a methodology which allows to capture a complex structural response without constantly resorting to non-linear FEA. An emerging technology that may assist in improving the efficiency and accuracy of how homogenised substructures are modelled, is machine learning. While the fundamental principles of this field were developed in the 1940's, the ever-increasing accessibility and magnitude of computational power have resulted in a leap of popularity since the 1990's. Especially the (deep) Artificial Neural Network (ANN), a versatile machine learning framework, has proven to be a promising tool that can perform tasks ranging from image recognition to the failure analysis of composites. In the current master's thesis, a framework is developed that integrates ANN and FEM techniques as to establish a highly flexible approach to substructure homogenisation. More specifically, this framework allows to establish a homogenised representation of a substructure regardless of its structural complexity (e.g. inclusions or cut-outs) and material complexity (e.g. damage progression and failure). To achieve this, traditional techniques to approximate homogenised behaviour are replaced by a constitutive model that is captured in an ANN. The developed framework consists of three parts. Firstly, the data generator module creates, runs and post-processes a series of FEM simulations of a chosen substructure, based on a predetermined Design of Experiments. In this DoE, all independent parameters (e.g. applied loads) that influence the response to be modelled should be sufficiently varied. The second module trains an ANN based on the generated data. In doing so, it learns to predict the homogenised mechanical behaviour of the chosen substructure as a function of the independent parameters. The third module then integrates this trained ANN in the FEM software package Abaqus as a user material subroutine (UMAT). The substructure of choice is now homogenised and represented by a single element, which can be readily used together with traditional elements in a global model.<br/>The described methodology was applied to two FEM models of increasing complexity. The first model was a biaxially loaded, 2D elasto-plastic high strength steel material without additional complexities. An initial ANN design was made based on this model and it turned out that a network with 2 Hidden Layers (HL) and 10 nodes per HL was ideal to capture the response. Furthermore, it was determined that the ANN converged after training for 1,500 epochs with the 'Nadam' scheme. The second model was a composite plate with an elliptical cut-out and Hashin damage, thus adding both structural and material complexities. This model was loaded in biaxial tension and in-plane shear. A 2-HL network was found to be the most suitable architecture with 60 and 40 nodes in each HL respectively. A training time of 10,000 epochs was required to reach convergence using the Nadam optimiser, which led to an excellent fit of the mechanical response. Moreover, several input and output vectors for the ANN were investigated. It was concluded that the best results are obtained if the input vector contains the previous and current stress and strain state as well as the strain increment, whereas the output is the predicted stress increment.","Composites; Homogenisation; Homogenization; Substructuring; Machine Learning; Neural Networks; Artificial Neural Networks; Structural Analysis; Structural Modelling; Finite Element Method; FEM; Finite Element Analysis; FEA; Damage","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-12-20","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

It is employed in cutting mild steel plates with thicknesses ranging from 0.5mm to 250mm, to manufacture heavy equipment such as windmills, offshore structures<br/>and structures in high-rise buildings. In the cutting process, a mixture of oxygen and the fuel gas (here acetylene) is used to preheat the metal to its ignition temperature which, for steel, is 700C - 900C (bright red heat) but well below its melting point (1400C). A jet of pure oxygen from the cutting torch is then directed into the preheated area instigating a vigorous exothermic chemical reaction between the oxygen and the metal to form iron oxide (slag in general term). The high pressure oxygen<br/>jet from cutting torch blows away the slag enabling the jet to pierce through the material and continue to cut through the material as the torch progresses.<br/>Now, in order to optimize and automate this cutting process of steel, we will be studying various factors such as speed control of the cutting torch to maintain an accurate angled cut, need of preheater to improve quality of cut, the oxygen pressure required to enable the exothermic process sustained and to pierce deeper. Hence to study and implement the above factors, we need to have the knowledge of temperature distributions in the process at any stage.<br/>The objective of the project is to obtain a dynamic model of the oxy-fuel gas cutting processby employing system identification techniques. The integral part is the study of heat transfer dynamics of the process and investigation of the parameters important in oxy-fuel cutting.<br/>Furthermore, we choose to model the heat sources in oxy-acetylene flame cutting, and the heat conduction in the steel using a numerical simulation based on the Cell Method. The cell method aims at numerical formulation of physical theories from the very outset, i.e. without discretizing the differential equations [1] and hence it is suitable for direct computer implementation. It requires the examination of parameters that are important when cutting different tubes and to develop a control system to automate the entire process with the aim<br/>of achieving improved cutting speed and high quality cut.","Thermal analysis; oxyfuel cutting; Modelling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","A large part of the world population lives in deltas or in the vicinity of a river which provides many advantages, such as access to transportation, food and drinking water. Inundating floodplains are a natural and recurring phenomenon which is for instance a way to irrigate soils, but drawbacks occur when people or infrastructure are harmed by (extreme) inundations. Developing countries in Africa and Asia are the regions expected to experience the largest increase in impact of inundations in the coming decades. Conventional flood risk studies can effectively analyse (fluvial) inundations, but require considerable and sometimes complex data and software, which is not always available, in particular in the aforementioned regions in Africa and Asia. Additionally, these studies often rely on discharge data, which is not always available and becomes less accurate for extreme discharge when the river banks overflow. Furthermore, even when data is available, this might only be granted after long, bureaucratic procedures. Elevation data is available from publicly available models, but the horizontal and vertical resolution often does not suffice. Therefore, there is a need for an alternative method to analyse fluvial inundations that is more independent and uses open source data and software. Moreover this method needs to provide information on a high temporal resolution (daily) because of the dynamic behaviour of inundations. The spatial resolution should be as high as possible, given the limitations of temporal resolution. This research focuses on detecting, estimating and mapping inundations in the Ouémé delta (Benin, West-Africa) to retrieve information about extent and timing of inundations and analyse how inundations developed over time by means of satellite remote sensing imagery and open source data and software. Furthermore, it aims to investigate how upstream precipitation (causing fluvial inundations) and population in the Ouémé delta (subjected to the effects of inundations) developed over the past decades to make a first step towards analysing the impact of inundations. To answer the research questions an Inundation Extent Mapping Model (IEMM) is developed to detect inundations, estimate the inundation scale and subsequently allocate the estimated surface water fraction in an area of interest (the measurement cell). First an inundation detection method is developed and tested (CMC-ratio), which relies on scaling a measurement cell between a (dry) calibration cell and an additional (wet) calibration cell. Second, the inundation scale estimate of the CMC-ratio is validated with MODIS optical remote sensing imagery and improved by developing and testing various scale estimation methods. Third, the estimated scale is allocated by comparing different elevation maps (MERIT DEM and HAND) and mapping methods. The outcome of the IEMM is compared to discharge to obtain information about timing of inundations and confirms that the IEMM is increasingly sensitive to larger inundations whereas discharge measurements are reported to show the opposite. This shows that in terms of impact (i.e. affected people and deaths), the maximum extent of inundations likely has a larger effect than number of days of extreme inundations. The lead time is derived showing the speed at which inundations propagate through the Ouémé delta. Ka-band passive microwave imagery is available in the MEaSUREs dataset from 1978 - 2017, which enables multi-annual and multi-system comparisons to analyse inundation behaviour over time. In practice, however, variations in bandwidth, incidence angle, sensor sensitivity cause changes that need to be accounted for when conducting inter-system time series analysis. Precipitation analysis of daily rainfall of rainfall stations in the middle and upper Ouémé catchment show a decreasing trend in extreme rainfall, in line with the trend across West-Africa. Based on reported disasters and population growth a link is suggested between populated zones and impact in terms of affected people and deaths caused by fluvial inundations. In particular this sheds light on urbanized zones in the South of the Ouémé delta, such as Sô-Ava and Aguégués. This leads to the conclusion that with the current method it is indeed possible to deploy optical and passive microwave remote sensing to detect inundations, estimate the scale, which can subsequently be mapped to an elevation model to find an inundation extent. However, improved understanding of downscaling and re-gridding effects, vegetation and surface water content is required. For now, the Hybrid inundation scale method is therefore recommended, which uses an artificial wet calibration brightness temperature based on reverse engineering from optical imagery. Furthermore, recommendations to use additional validation methods should be included in further research. Population present in inundation prone areas has a larger effect on the impact of inundations than the mere occurrence of inundations. Considering the expected population growth in Benin, it is recommended to further investigate how this will develop in the future.","Flood Risk; Benin; Remote Sensing; Inundation; Passive microwave remote sensing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Water Management","","6.3722979,2.3261376"

(mentor); van Nederveen, G.A. (mentor); Bekebrede, G. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","neering (SE). Nowadays, this approach is more and more instructed by clients in the Netherlands. The switch to Systems Engineering was necessary because of the development of integrated contracts (UAV-GC; Uniform Administrative Conditions for Integrated Contracts) such as Design-Build-Finance-Maintain (DBFM) and Design &amp; Construct (D&amp;C). Before the introduction of integrated contracts, mainly RAW contracts (Rationalization and automation Soil, Water and Road Construction) were used in the Netherlands for public procurement in infrastructure projects. In RAW contracts, the to be built system is described in detail and the segregation of responsibilities between client and contractor is distinctly deﬁned. In integrated contracts, this distinctly deﬁned segregation of responsibilities is missing. As a result of the integrated contracts, the projects became more complex and multidisciplinary, which asked for a more structured approach (Emes et al., 2012). Another difﬁculty of integrated contracts is the communication between client and contractor because more information has to be transferred. An important element of SE are the veriﬁcation and validation processes. This validation process is considered complicated in the civil engineering industry. Four subproblems are determined by means of literature and practical knowledge. First, the interaction between client and contractor. Findings of a questionnaire performed by the CROW (2017) about the relationship between client and contractor are:56.9% of the contractors’ employees do not feel equally treated by the client, 43.6% of the clients’ employees and 69.7% of the contractors’ employees agree on the statement that the other party is mainly defensive instead of cooperative, another issue during the interaction between client and contractor is trust. 23.3% of the clients’ employees and 17.7% of the contractors’ employees say that the other party cannot be trusted, 73.6% of the clients’ employees and 73.5% of the contractors’ employees disagree on the fact that the other party puts the common interests of the project above their own interests. The second subproblem is the confusion between veriﬁcation and validation. Veriﬁcation is the process of determining if the system meets the speciﬁed requirements (Alsem et al., 2013). Nevertheless, the purpose of the validation process according to ISO (2015) is ""to provide objective evidence that the system, when in use, fulﬁls its business or mission objectives and stakeholder requirements, achieving its intended use in its intended operational environment"" (ISO, 2015, p. 74). The third subproblem is executing sufﬁcient validation. The difﬁculty is to represent the client and stakeholders needs in requirements. Therefore, the validation is often conducted last-minute in the construction phase of the project. The fourth subproblem is that the effects of the use of 3D visualisation during design validation on project performances are unknown. These problems result in the following research objective and question. The aim of this research is to gain insight in the effects of 3D visualisation during the design validation on the project performances, namely time, costs and quality. What are possible effects of 3D visualisation on design validation within the civil engineering sector in the Netherlands? The methodology for this research consists of three phases: (1) context, which includes literature and project evaluations, (2) experiment, which contains baseline and follow-up measurements and (3) the results and conclusion. Phase two, experiment, is a gaming simulation called the ontwikkelstraat. In this research, the following deﬁnition is used for gaming simulation: ""a special type of model that uses gaming techniques to model and simulate a system. A gaming simulation is an operating model of a real-life system in which actors in roles partially recreate the behaviour of the system (Meijer, 2009)"". The Ontwikkelstraat is a two-day case imitating a project from tender till exploitation and includes design, construction and maintenance of a hydrogen factory. During this gaming simulation, three types of measurements are conducted: questionnaires, recordings of the interaction between client and contractor, and observations. According to the literature, sufﬁcient design validation has to fulﬁl several conditions. The aim is to acquire proof that the system in its ability to achieve its intended use (ISO, 2015). Rijkswaterstaat (2017) prescribes three conditions the design validation should meet, namely design validation is an integral element of the design process, conﬁrmation by client and stakeholders, and determine the validation process in cooperation with the client. There are multiple ways of conducting design validation. Several design activities are of importance for design validation. During the system design phase, these activities are analysing contract documents, as well as document functionalities, requirements and systems. In the preliminary design phase, these activities are based on the variants and validation of the design products. It is concluded from the three cases studied that alignment of the design products with client and stakeholders is a key validation step in all cases. Bryde et al. (2014), Sebastian and Van Berlo (2011), and Azhar (2012) described the capabilities of 3D visualisation. Three-dimensional visualisation can be static or dynamic. With a static image of the 3D model of the design, the communication and coordination between actors and disciplines are more detailed. By decomposition in subsystems and objects, the technical details of the design can be sufﬁciently discussed during the validation sessions with the client and stakeholders. Another capability of the 3D visualisation is expectation management between contractor, client and stakeholders. 3D visualisation can also be used for dynamic images for moving systems, such as locks and movable bridges, which can be used for showing the functionalities of the design. Dynamic images can conﬁrm that the design meets the intended functionalities and use of the system that is going to be built. Currently, 3D visualisation is used within the civil engineering sector in the Netherlands is by means of BIM. Within the civil engineering sector in the Netherlands companies deviate in the BIM maturity level, as well as the multiple subsidiaries within the contractor ﬁrm VolkerWessels. According to the BIM wedge that is developed by Bew and Richards (2008), level 1 of the BIM maturity is implemented. Therefore, the use of 3D visualisation is implemented in all integral projects within the infrastructure branch of VolkerWessels. The 3D models are used for clash detection, reinforcement in concrete, immediate vicinity and quantities. Conclusion According the results of the gaming simulation, visualisation does not have an effect on the project performances time, costs and quality. A possible explanation that no effect of visualisation on the project performances has been found is that the physical model of the hydrogen factory in the ontwikkelstraat was only used during one of the follow-up measurements. During the other two follow-up measurement, the physical model was not used by the participants. The follow-up measurement where the physical model was used, it was used by one participant, who built the model. However, the participant did not communicate his ﬁndings from the physical model to the other project team members. Therefore, there are not enough results to conclude that there are no effects of visualised validation on the project performances. From observations during the gaming simulation, it can be concluded that not the availability of the 3D model, but the standard practice of project teams is the issue. This research aimed to ﬁll the theoretical gap on the effects of 3D visualisation on design validation. Although this aim is achieved, every research has to make compromises to stay within scope. The main limitations are presented in the itemisation below. • Lack of proper literature regarding the conditions for sufﬁcient design validation; • Small sample size of the gaming simulation, which makes it harder to generalise the ﬁndings; • Time constraints during the gaming simulation, the participants are under a lot of time pressure during particularly the design phases. Therefore it is possible they overlooked the physical scale model. Soms suggestions for further research are: • It is found that not the availability of the 3D visualisation is the problem, but the standard practice of project teams play a role. Therefore, research on the problems of implementation of 3D models during design validation and how to solve these problems would b relevant for the whole construction industry; • During the project evaluations, it has been found that the way of handling changes in the contract after procurement is challenging. It turns out that validation of the design is often obstructed because the results of the validation process can result in uncertainties for all actors in a construction project. Research on the politics behind the changes in construction projects is relevant, because of the uncertainties these politics bring in the development of projects and the relationship between all actors that are involved; • Lastly, further research on the interaction between client and contractor is needed. Research on the development of achievable strategies to manage the counterbalance between collaboration and competition between client and contractor would be signiﬁcant. Recommendations for practice Based on the literature and project evaluations, a proposed approach, called visualised validation approach (VVA) is developed. The VVA is a combination of two different project management methodologies, which are the V-model and the scrum. During the System design phase, three activities are essential: determining V&amp;V management plan, requirement validation, and interaction with the client about the intended use of the system. The preliminary design phase is an iterative process, with scrum design sprints and validation sessions with the client and stakeholders. The biggest challenge in the construction industry is the implementation of the visualised validation approach. According to an internal investigation, the accessibility of the process and in particular the 3D mod- els have impact on the implementation of the VVA. Several employees indicated that they are reserved to use new approaches because of the lack of skills or manpower.","Design validation; 3D visualisation; Systems Engineering; BIM","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-06-20","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","Synchronization between muscles caused by shared neural input has been proposed to have a functional significance in muscle coordination. In this study, intermuscular coherence (IMC), a measure of shared neural input to muscles, was used to explore the neural underpinnings of proximal arm muscle coordination in force- and myoelectric-control tasks. In force-control, the goal was to attain a force magnitude and direction, whereas in myoelectric-control, the goal was to have single or pairwise muscle activation. Muscle coordination was assumed to be more selective in myoelectric-control, being that this task imposed stricter requirements in muscle activation. Accordingly, the expected difference in muscle coordination would be reflected in IMC if shared neural input results from a neural strategy for motor control. The hypothesis was that when single muscle activation was required, IMC in myoelectric-control would be lower than in force-control. Opposite to this, when pairwise muscle activation was required, IMC would be higher in myoelectric-control. Therefore, the presence or not of shared neural input was thought to be the mechanism to correspondingly couple or decouple muscle activation. The main finding was that there was no significant difference in IMC between force- and myoelectric-control tasks for both single and pairwise muscle activation conditions. Furthermore, IMC in single muscle activation was higher than that of pairwise muscle activation conditions in both tasks. Finally, the bands in which IMC was increased were the alpha-band and lower part of the beta-band. These findings are interpreted as that neural constraints have a fundamental role in the distribution of shared neural input to proximal muscles, and thus to their coordination.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Biomedical Engineering | BioMechatronics","",""

Computer viruses cause an enormous economic loss. Moreover, many illnesses/diseases still causing a serious threat to public health. For example, the outbreaks of circulating influenza strains cause millions of illness and deaths worldwide every year. Pronounced outbreaks of flu usually occur during winter. This recognized timing allows public health agencies to organize their flu-related mitigation and response activities to prepare for the winter flu season. Although the general wintertime peak of influenza incidence in temperate regions can be easily forecast, the specific intensity, duration, and time of individual local outbreaks are quite changeable. Even after an outbreak has begun, it is still difficult to predict the future characteristics of the epidemic curve. If the diseases/viruses outbreak characteristics could be reliably predicted, the public health response will be better coordinated.The goal is to develop a fast and accurate epidemic model to estimate, fit and forecast the spreading of an epidemic on a defined network. The aim is to conduct a study over viruses spreading phenomena both theoretically and numerically, then create a general model/algorithm that can be easily applied to different diseases and computer viruses.

We are able to fit and estimate with a relatively low error compared to other algorithms.

The ability of piezoelectric materials to convert ambient vibrational energy into usable electrical energy is seen as a promising battery-free solution to be used in inhospitable areas to self-power electronics for a longer time with little maintenance. The goal of this research is to maximise the mechanical input: elastic strain energy experienced by a lead zirconium titanate (PZT) bilayer piezoelectric buzzer by introducing four different boundary conditions during loading. Investigation of how mechanical input from each of these boundary condition influences the stored electrical output is carried out. The effect of three different static loads on each of the stored electrical output for four boundary conditions are studied. In order to accurately compare the data, the mechanical input (elastic strain energy) is calculated while the electrical output (stored energy) is measured experimentally. Given the brittle nature of ceramics, the maximum load bearing capacity for the PZT ceramic disc is determined by mechanical tests such as the ball-on-the-ring and uniaxial compression tests. This is to ensure that the experiments do not fracture the sample. Results show that, by inducing a bending mode in the buzzer, mechanical input values almost four orders of magnitude higher can be reached when compared to boundary conditions without bending modes. A similar result was found for the stored electrical energy with values for the bending mode of almost three orders of magnitude higher than when no bending is involved. The comparison between the calculated mechanical input and the measured electrical output shows good agreement in the boundary conditions involving bending. The energy conversion is highly efficient for the full range of applied loads for these boundary conditions. In the case of non-bending boundary conditions, the stored electrical energy is one order of magnitude high than predicted for the mechanical input and thus the model is in poor agreement with experiment.","Piezoelectricity; Boundary conditions; Bending of PZT; Electromechanical coupling coefficient (k2); Ball-on-the-Ring test; Maximum load bearing capacity","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","The transport sector is making a significant contribution to the global CO2 emissions causing Global Warming. A large portion of this is caused by heavy-duty vehicles like tractor semi-trailer combinations. Since tractor semi-trailer combinations are often operated at relatively high speeds for long periods of time their fuel consumption, and with that their emissions, can be strongly reduced by reducing the aerodynamic drag. This can be done by improving the aerodynamics of individual vehicles, by carefully rounding their leading edges or application of drag reduction devices, like boat tails and side skirts. Another option is to use the benefits of drafting by operating two or more vehicles closely together in a platoon. The benefits of this have already been proven in multiple studies and real world experiments. When platooning will be implemented on a large scale, it will be beneficial to optimise the platoons for maximum drag reduction. To be able to do this, the effect of different truck design parameters have to be investigated. This study focuses on the influence of underhood flow on the drag of a tractor semi-trailer in isolation and in a platoon. This is done by using simplified models adapted to have a underhood model consisting of one porous medium and four ducts to replicate the mass flow, pressure drop and flow field of a real underhood area. Simulations were performed on full-size and highway speeds using the commercially available PowerFLOW solver, based on the Lattice Boltzmann Method. For an isolated vehicle it was found that an increased underhood mass flow gives a higher total drag, mainly because of the drag contribution of the porous medium. Due to the mass flow entering the underhood, the suction over the leading edges is slightly reduced. On the other hand, smaller leading edge radii with higher suction give less mass flow through the underhood. Besides this the underhood flow actually has beneficial effects on the parts surrounding the tractor-trailer gap and in the trailer underbody area. The highest total drag was found for the models with the most underhood flow and the smallest leading edge radius. Platoons of two vehicles were tested with three different inter vehicle distances, 3.75, 7.5 and 15 meters. The leading vehicle, which did not have underhood flow in all cases, has the strongest drag reduction for the shortest distance. The trailing vehicle has the lowest drag at the largest tested distance, while it is highest for the middle distance. This can be explained by the reduction in pressure in front of the vehicle. This reduces the drag contribution of the front surface, but also reduces the suction over the leading edges. The models with underhood flow experienced a stronger drag reduction, meaning that the absolute drag values were closer than for the isolated vehicle. This is caused by the reduced underhood mass flow in a platoon. At the shortest inter vehicle distance only 35% of the mass flow of an isolated vehicle is available, while this is 50 and 70% when the distance is increased. The beneficial effects of underhood flow on an isolated vehicle are still present in a platoon, although they are reduced in strength. When a boat tail is mounted on the back of the trailer of the leading vehicle the drag of this vehicle is strongly reduced due to the increased back pressure. However, this might not be beneficial for the trailing vehicle. The increased stagnation pressure indeed increases the total drag of the trailing vehicle at an inter vehicle distance of 3.75 m. As discussed before, an increased stagnation pressure also gives increased leading edge suction. Therefore the drag is actually reduced for the two larger inter vehicle distances. It was also found that the tail gives higher flow speeds over the top of the trailing vehicle, and lower flow speeds around the bottom. This reduces the drag for the underbody parts like the wheels and slightly decreases the underhood mass flow. When the platoon is placed at a yaw angle, the total drag of the leading vehicle is increased. The contribution of the front part is decreased, but this is more than compensated for by the drag increase for the rear and all other parts, which are no longer perfectly aligned with the flow. The drag increase of the trailing vehicle is stronger, due to an increased contribution of the front part. The underhood mass flow is also increased compared to the platoons without yaw, this effect is strongest at small inter vehicle distances. The leading vehicle causes the flow to be more aligned for the trailing vehicle, therefore the drag increase for most other parts is less strong. The same effect can be seen for the side force, which is way lower for the trailing vehicle and increases for increasing inter vehicle distance.","Platooning; Trucks; bluff body; Underhood flow; CFD; LBM","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

One part of these telescopes is the ﬁber positioner, where a few thousand of optical ﬁbers need to be individually positioned very accurately. The problem with current ﬁber positioners is the small patrol area, the long production times and the light loss due to the incorrect movement of the tip. The goal of this research is to design a new type of positioner which solves the mentioned problems; large patrol area, fast production and reduction of light loss. The ﬁnal design is an r-theta design with one rotating motor and a displacement mechanism to move the ﬁber horizontally over the focal plane. The design is based on the best suitable straight line mechanism from the Reuleaux collection: the Scott-Russell linkage. Flexures are used in the ﬁnal design. This eliminates backlash and slip-stick effects in therefore improves the accuracy. An experiment with a scale model has been done to show that an exact horizontal positioning with the ﬁber exactly orthogonal is possible with this design. By adjusting two parameters in the design, the movement and the angle between the horizontal and the ﬁber can be adjusted. This means an exact movement can be ﬁnetuned in order to reduce light loss. The ﬂexure based displacement system is monolithic and can be made by laser cutting. This reduces the production and assembly time of the system drastically. The design meets the patrol area requirement and shows large potential to increase this area up to an estimated 4 times the pitch. In order to validate the remaining requirements of this very promising design, additional experiments with a real scale fully functional prototype is needed.","fiber positioner; compliant; Straight line mechanism","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-12-20","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

This poses a hazard to human lives and infrastructure, particularly in low-lying areas adjacent to major rivers. An example of such areas is the Masaka wetland, located in the southern edge of the capital Kigali along the Nyabarongo river. As the city expands into the vicinities of this location, there is growing concern regarding infrastructure damage and human losses associated with extreme discharges. Simultaneously, potential for agricultural development, for which flood duration is a critical factor, has also been identified. Hence, there is a need for increasing the available knowledge on the seasonal pattern of discharges at this location.<br/>However, significant changes in this behaviour may occur as a result of reservoir commissioning in the Nyabarongo river catchment. In particular, the Shyorongi reservoir in the scope of the Nyabarongo II Multipurpose Development Project will regulate approximately 47% of the catchment of the Masaka wetland. Hence, its operation may result in significant shifts on seasonal discharges and associated flooding in this location, which consisted of the main topic of investigation in this research. For this purpose, time series of inflows to the reservoir, as well as contributions from non-regulated areas, have been generated by separately-calibrated lumped rainfall-runoff models based on the FlexTOPO framework, the period from January 1981 to August 2018. The operation of the reservoir was approximated by a standard operating policy. Two operational scenario families were devised: one maximising hydropower generation and one prioritising the reduction in peak discharges by limiting releases to a pre-defined threshold. For each scenario family, different parametrisations (target electricity output and maximum release, respectively) were tested, comprising a total of 50 scenarios. The resulting discharge time series of each scenario was compared to the baseline (no-reservoir) scenario according to two criteria: reductions in flood durations and reductions flood peaks. While flood durations were assessed on a relative basis, the effect on flood peaks was quantified by the expected shifts in the exceedance probability curve. This was estimated by a partial duration series (i.e. Peaks-Over-Threshold) approach, which was implemented to estimate peak seasonal discharges associated with return periods ranging from 2 to 500 years.<br/>On specific years such as 2018, operation emphasising hydropower production had the secondary result of reducing peak discharges by up to 20%. However, over the majority of the simulated period, reductions were found to be insignificant, as reflected in the limited shifts in the fitted probability distributions. This type of operation also had generally insignificant effects on flood durations, regardless of the electricity output (and associated release) target. In contrast, it was observed that reservoir operation with the specific goal of flood mitigation may consistently result in 20% to 25% reductions of seasonal peak discharges. However, this performance was found to depend, to a large extent, on the specified reservoir releases in comparison to inflow hydrographs, which vary over different years. Therefore, the availability of a seasonal outlook on discharges may guide the definition of optimal release rules for each year. Additionally, reservoir rules that account for the pronounced seasonal variability in inflows may allow for significant reductions on both flood peaks and durations in comparison to the policies hereby simulated, and it is recommended that such optimisation be carried out for the Shyorongi reservoir. On relatively wet years, a trade-off was observed between the minimisation of flood peaks and of flood durations at the Masaka wetland. This is linked to the increment in discharge at the tail of the hydrograph caused by reservoir emptying, which may trigger the exceedance of the relatively low bankfull discharge threshold at this location. However, the simplified implemented operation rules adopted in this study have a limited capacity to represent practical reservoir operation. Therefore, there may be considerable potential for the optimisation of reservoir operation to improve performance in both flood mitigation and hydropower generation scenarios. However, due to the limited storage capacity of this reservoir, flood management in the Masaka wetland requires the adoption of complementary structural and non-structural measures according to the desired targets.<br/>It is highlighted that several assumptions have been made concerning the conceptualisation of the catchment and characteristics of the Shyorongi dam and the Masaka wetland, as detailed in the body of the report. Additionally, the estimation of parameters for hydrological models and extreme value distribution functions inherently involves uncertainties. Therefore, the results and associated interpretations hereby presented should be interpreted in the context of a considerable amount of propagated uncertainty, and should not be adopted for design purposes.","Flooding; Hydrological modeling; Extreme value theory; Rwanda; Reservoir operations","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","","-2.022393, 30.156208"

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","Manganese nodules have been lying on the deep sea soil for centuries before they became known. The first ones to discover the nodules were Murray and Renard, during their scientific cruise between 1872 and 1876 (Murray and Renard, 1876). The Clarion-Clipperton Zone, located between Mexico and Hawaii, appears to have a virtually inexhaustible amount of mineral resources. The manganese nodules consist mainly of man- ganese, but because they also contain metals such as copper and cobalt, the nodules become more and more interesting for our modern society. Another name for the manganese nodules is polymetallic nodules, be- cause of the content of many other metals.<br/>By means of a vertical hydraulic transport system the manganese nodules will be transported upwards from the seabed. Given that the nodules are located at a depth of about 5000 meter, it is plausible that they come into contact with the pipe wall during transport. When a nodule interacts with the wall, abrasive wear can occur. Abrasive wear, or sliding wear, causes the nodule to degrade, or decrease in mass, through the sliding contact with the pipe wall.<br/>The main research question of this Master Thesis is formed as follows:<br/>What is the contribution of abrasive wear to the degradation of polymetallic nodules, in a vertical transport system?<br/>The contribution of abrasive wear is tested on the basis of the equation of Archard (1953). In the MTI laboratory in Kinderdijk various manganese nodules are tested in a specially designed experimental setup. The polymetallic nodules available for this Master Thesis originate from the Clarion-Clipperton Zone (CCZ). The first set of experiments is focused on single nodule degradation. The nodules are weighted before and after a test run, hereafter the nodule mass after a test run is divided by the initial nodule mass, resulting in the normalized remaining mass. Each test run consists of a specific sliding length. With the sliding length and normalized remains mass, a prediction can be made of the material specific wear rate factor, noted as k [m2/N]. The experiments resulted into a value of k = 4.16·10−9 [m2/N]. With this k-factor, in the worst case, 97% of the original nodule mass is remaining after 1000 meters of sliding contact.<br/>Subsequently, a batch of nodules is tested in the experimental setup, with the expectation that the con- tribution of abrasive wear increases to the total nodule degradation, due to the presence of particle-particle interaction. Recently, Blue Mining has conducted trials in Freiberg, Germany, in an abandoned mine shaft. A vertical pipe of almost 130 meters has been placed inside, and the effect of abrasion on a batch of nodules has been observed. During the batch experiments in Kinderdijk, where the batch of nodules was in a horizontal position, it is seen that the contribution of abrasion is greater, compared to the tests in Freiberg.<br/>Using the open-source program OpenFOAM, a vertical turbulent pipe flow is modeled. The pipe has simi- lar dimensions to the pipe of the experimental setup. The simulation was done using a Large Eddy Simulation (LES). By means of a one-way coupling, the data of the flow field is linked to the movement of the simulated particle. Subsequently, point particles were released at various points at the entrance of the pipe. The first series of point particles consists of a diameter of one-third of the pipe diameter, corresponding to the com- mon size of a manganese nodule. The collisions between the point particle and the pipe wall are solved with a Discrete Element Method (DEM), which makes use of a (non-linear) spring-damper system.<br/>To test the sensitivity of the model, point particles of one-sixth and one-tenth of the pipe diameter are also released. The number of collisions per total number of simulations are compared with each other. After the sensitivity analysis it turned out that in 15% of the simulations there was contact with the pipe wall, regardless of the diameter of the particle. When this 15% is compared to the experimental results using single nodules, there is a weight loss of around 0.5%. This holds a weight loss of only a single - to a few - gram(s) for the average polymetallic nodule.<br/>It can be concluded, according to the experimental trials with polymetallic nodules from the Clarion- Clipperton Zone and by means of a one-way coupled CFD-DEM model, that the contribution of abrasive wear results into a (maximum) remaining mass of 97%. However, it is advised to extend the computer model with a two-way (or multi-way) coupling between the liquid and the solids. It is also recommended to conduct vertical abrasive wear tests with nodules, in order to validate the model and gain more insight in degradation behaviour.","Polymetallic Nodules; Particle degradation; Slurry transport; Deep sea mining; Vertical transport; CFD-DEM Coupling; OpenFOAM","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-12-04","","","","","",""

Currently in its design phase, the BDF is aimed at the Search for Hidden Particles (SHiP) experiment, which purpose is to investigate the origin of dark matter and other lightly interacting particles. The BDF target/dump sits at the core of the installation, and its aim is to fully absorb the high intensity Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) beam and produce charmed mesons. The average beam power on target is 305 kw due to which very high thermo-mechanical loads will be generated on the target/dump configuration which can lead to mechanical failure of the target material. This calls for continuous cooling and heat removal from the target material, which requires the design and optimization of a very complex cooling system to ensure the target reliability during operation.<br/>Keeping in view the high velocities that are obtained in the channels of the cooling system of the target assembly, an extensive 3D turbulence modeling of the full scale cooling system is required in order to predict the target water cooling system behavior. A comparative conjugate heat transfer (CHT) study using a simplified 2D geometry of the BDF target for different mesh size was performed for identical y+ values to validate the pressure drop in the cooling channels and the temperature profile in the target blocks with the analytical calculations. Subsequently, a 3D model of the cooling channel was simulated for different Reynolds number and an extensive study was performed to check the behaviour of the flow in the log-law layer. In addition to that the friction factor was validated with the analytical results and with the available literature for various Reynolds number. Thereafter a full scale 3D steady and transient model was simulated using the information obtained from the previous studies. All these simulations were carried out in Ansys Fluent. The energy deposition in space on the target blocks was obtained via FLUKA MonteCarlo simulations. The variation of HTC in different channels and the fluid-solid interface temperature is found out to be in accordance with the analytical calculations. The pressure drop and the temperature rise from inlet to outlet of the cooling system is also in confirmation with the design parameters. Transient simulations were performed subsequently in order to study the impact of time and space varying energy deposition in the target blocks on the overall flow. With the given inlet velocity, the boiling at the surface of the target blocks is not expected to happen. As a final part of this study, in order to make the numerical model more robust, a mesh sensitivity analysis was done in order to optimize the mesh size, especially in the boundary layer region.","Beam Dump Facility; Target; SHiP; SPS; Turbulence Modelling; Conjugate Heat Transfer; FLUKA; Fluent; CERN; Cooling system; Optimization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-12-19","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Energy and Process Technology","Beam Dump Facility | SHiP | Physics Beyond Particles",""

The goal of providing support is to increase citizen participation and to improve neighborhood safety and safety feeling. Currently, there is no city-wide approach for supporting NWAG’s. So, the question is: how to set up a support structure for the long-term success of NWAG’s? This is answered in this design project and supported by the research conducted throughout the project. To set up a successful support structure, insight were acquired into the desires for support and the contributions of support given in other municipalities. The difficulty for police and municipality is that they have many assumptions regarding giving support to NWAGs. Even though these assumptions are either nonexistent or resolvable in reality, they hold back the police and municipality in starting to give (parts of) the support residents desire. The research also showed that support is very desirable for residents. The number of residents starting and maintaining a NWAG increases when any form of support is given. Residents want to receive tools for starting a NWAG and want to exchange information with the police and municipality about their neighborhood. Residents find it evident and obvious that the municipality would support NWAG’s in this way, and do not understand why this is not the case yet. The coordinator of a NWAG has a central role, as he manages the NWAG. Therefore, the design goal was to create support for coordinators. The principle of making a ward WhatsApp group (WWAG) is used, because that group contains all coordinators in a ward, a municipal official and (ward) police. The focus is on helping residents to start a NWAG, to connect coordinators to the WWAG and to outline what the WWAG should do. <br/>Based on the user research, the following design guidelines were set up for providing support to coordinators:<br/>1. Keep information as well as activities about safety-related topics.<br/>2. Present information and activities straightforward, so that the purpose is evident.<br/>3. Aim to include coordinators in decision making about WWAG setup and execution of certain tasks that maintain the WWAG.<br/>4. Do not impose obligations for coordinators to become a member of the WWAG.<br/>5. Make clear agreements between all WWAG members for mutual understanding.<br/>6. Show appreciation for coordinators in person.<br/>7. Provide practical tools that support coordinators, mainly in the starting phase. <br/>The created support service consists of twelve touchpoints. Touchpoints are means to create interactions between coordinators and the support service. The touchpoints show the minimum means the municipality should use to provide support to NWAG’s. The support service helps residents to contribute to a safe neighborhood to live in themselves. This increases participation of residents as well as municipal and police officials in the neighborhood. This report shows the process of developing the touchpoints and explains the guidelines and touchpoints in detail, as well as elaborating on the implementation of the touchpoints.","Participation; User research; Government services; Neighborhood; WhatsApp; Community; Safety; Social cohesion","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

In recent years, the Ring of Fire measurement technique has emerged as a feasible option to visualise and analyse flow structures of transiting objects based on particle image velocimetry. The accuracy of this on-site measurement technique has not yet been validated under equal test conditions. <br/><br/>This master's thesis aims to compare drag area values of a cyclist from Ring of Fire measurements to simultaneously acquired power meter data. Tests with the cyclist in upright and time-trial posture, as well as different helmet types and various drafting distances, are envisaged to assess the correlation between the two measurement techniques in multiple drag area regimes, and to gain insight into large distance drafting above 3m, which, to the best knowledge of the author, has not yet been studied in academic research. In addition, the campaign plans to remove any user operations during the test, which would be another step towards a fully autonomous Ring of Fire system, as envisioned in the future. A spacious indoor facility is suggested as the testing site to minimize environmental effects and to allow for the continuous motion of the cyclist. The Ring of Fire method shows great potential, as the measurements are conducted under simulated racing conditions and wake visualisation allows the operator to locate origins of drag. Validating the drag area results could further attest to the Ring of Fire's viability as an optimisation tool in the upcoming years.<br/><br/>The conducted campaign, within the framework of this thesis, indicates good agreement between the power meter and Ring of Fire techniques when assessing the relative drag area delta of a small-scale helmet change and a large-scale posture change. In terms of absolute values, the power meter model shows a high dependency on underlying model constants. Using literature-based coefficients, the absolute CdA values are within 5% of the Ring of Fire derived values.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the feasibility of evaluating long distance drafting effects with the Ring of Fire system is demonstrated. Measurable drag area savings of 15% are obtained by the trailing cyclist at front wheel to front wheel distances of 7-9m. Due to non-uniform inflow conditions in front of the trailing cyclist, a wake contouring algorithm needed to be employed to satisfy mass preservation within the control volume by resizing the inlet and outlet plane. In addition, enclosure of the wake structure and contouring of a representative inlet plane is achieved. The flow topology in the wake of the trailing cyclist is acquired by a stereo-PIV system.

Due to these global trends the demand for dredging, trenching and deep sea mining activities have grown dramatically. In these engineering practices, underwater excavation is one of the major procedures which involves complicated physics. In dredging, operations with clamshell buckets in saturated cohesive soils often leads to a decreased production due to the highly adhesive properties of these soils. And, in offshore wind farm installation operations, the vulnerable power cables transporting the generated energy must be buried a couple of meters under the seabed for their protection, so trenching in saturated cohesive soils becomes indispensable. <br/><br/>Miedema has developed ""The Delft Sand, Clay and Rock Cutting Model"", in which several sets of equations are derived for each type of seabed soil. In the scenario of clay cutting, both the cohesion and adhesion should be known as the input parameters. However, very few information is available to define the relation between cohesion and adhesion. Yet, it is of great importance to get a better understanding of the relationship between cohesive and adhesive forces, because the large surfaces on dredging tools can generate a lot of resistance; limiting production for materials with increasing adhesion. <br/>First, literature is reviewed to get a better understanding into the relevant soil mechanical properties and cutting theories. Existing models for the adhesion factor, which is defined as the ratio between the adhesion or stickiness of a cohesive soil and its cohesion or internal shear strength, are analyzed and new models for the adhesion factor are constructed.<br/><br/>To validate these new models, a new dedicated test setup is constructed with the help of the National Engineering Research Center for Dredging Technology and Equipment based in Shanghai, China.

Suction caissons are preferred due to the ease of installation and removal.Based on the literature, it was understood that various kinds of research are being undertaken throughout the world to better understand the performance of suction caisson foundations. Two main components of suction caisson are researched widely, first being the installation behaviour, and second being the behaviour of caisson during repeated cyclic loading. This thesis seeks to gain further insight on the installation behaviour of the suction caisson. For this purpose, a suction installation apparatus was designed to be used in centrifuge. Various installation characteristics such as flow rate, soil profile has been studied in this thesis and detailed analysis is provided. Extraction tests of caisson were also done at a slow rate to determine the drained tensile capacity, which was used for determining tensile amplitudes in cyclic loading tests.Tripod structures withstand load by ’push-pull’ system, where the windward caisson is pulled out of the soil due to the cyclic environmental loads. This movement is compensated by the push behaviour of the other two caissons. Thus, the tensile capacity ofcaissons plays an important role in the design of caissons in a tripod structure. Windward caisson of a tripod foundation was modelled in this thesis to study the behaviour of the caisson under cyclic loading in tension. Cyclic loading tests were done at 100g using the geo-centrifuge at Delft University of Technology. A series of tests was done for various cyclic loading characteristics such as the average load, frequency and soil profile. Settlement and stiffness response of the suction caisson were obtained for each scenario. A brief discussion of the results is made in this thesis report. Very high settlement was observed when one-way compressive load was applied on the caisson installed in layered sand. A test was also done to study the response of caisson to storm loading where very high tensile amplitudes were used. The results obtained from these tests show the complexity of the response under tensile loads. When the tensile amplitude was more than 50% of the tensile capacity of the caisson, significant uplift of the caisson was witnessed along with a significant reduction in the stiffness of the soil.Finally, Finite Element Modelling (FEM) was done using the geotechnical finite element software - Plaxis 2D to compare the cyclic loading results obtained from centrifuge modelling with FEM. It was observed that the initial settlement behaviour was captured well in plaxis. But after few cycles, no more accumulation of strain was witnessed in the centrifuge tests. However, plaxis failed to capture this behaviour and thus higher settlements were observed in FEM analysis.This thesis can be used as a basis for the design of tripod foundations for OWT using suction caissons. The results obtained from this thesis reinforces previous studies and adds confidence in understanding the tensile behaviour of suction caissons.","Suction caisson; Offshore Wind Energy; Sand layer; Cyclic loading; FEM","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-12-31","","","","Geo-Engineering","",""

Nourishments and other human interventions constitute common practice in order to maintain and secure these areas. However, many aspects, especially the hydrodynamics, are not yet fully understood due to the complexity of the acting processes. This study investigates the evolution of submerged sandmounds under wave, current, and combined flow conditions, and examines the relation between the observed morphodynamic response, and the imposed hydrodynamic forcing. It aims to provide insight towards a better understanding of the hydrodynamics and morphodynamics that will lead to more efficient design, and accurate behaviour prediction of the nourishments. A physical experiment (MODEX) provided a reference dataset of hydrodynamic and morphodynamic measurements (wave height, flow velocity, bathymetry). The extent to which the dataset covers the full spectrumof acting processes was examined via a literature study of the documented mechanisms under wave, current, and combined flow conditions. It was found that the data do not capture slope effects, flow separation, and ripple influence on flow velocity. The analysis of the data resulted in the quantification of the flow types effect on several geometrical aspects (mound height, footprint area and shape, ripple pattern), and the position of the mound. In order to examine the extent to which the measured velocities are responsible for the observed response, sediment transport rates were estimated using an energetics model that depends on total, and orbital velocity. The results provided evidence that the observed response can not be fully explained using mean and orbital velocities. For this reason the study suggests an interpretation of the sediment pathways under the various flow types. Nevertheless these are on based on reasoning, and thus are not considered to be proven. Moreover, the results revealed a relation between aspects of the morphological response and Umax2 (which relates to the instantaneous maximum flow energy). The mound height reduction rate (dHm/dt), and migration rate (dx/dt) scale linearly with Umax2 , while the mound footprint length/width ratio displays an inverse linear relation. Lastly, the relation betweenmound area change rate (dA/dt), and flow energy is linear for non-oscillatory, and combined flow, and a parabolic for oscillatory flow. Finally, despite the limitations and omissions, this study provides significant insight on the evolution of submerged mounds. It is first step in the direction of more accurate prediction of morphological change, and more efficient design of nourishments.","MODEX; morphodynamic response; sand mound; physical experiment; flow; hydrodynamics; nourishment","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","Hydralab+",""

That makes these pumps very dependent on the location where they are placed for their water delivery. Their dependency on hydropower also impacts the water supply of these pumps to surrounding irrigation fields (Lawrence et al., 2018). Besides technical boundary conditions these pumps also have to compete with traditional powered pumps and stakeholder opinions considering this is a new technology. All these factors contribute to a rather exciting process to find the right locations for these pumps, or Pump Placement Process (PPP). Since this PPP has to be adapted to many different regions around the world the PPP becomes very complex and time intensive. Context Variation by Design (CVD) is an approach that might offer a solution to this PPP. This approach lets the user utilize the strength of many different contexts, which coincide with the many regions where the pumps are being installed (Kersten, Crul, Engelen, van, &amp; Diehl, 2018). An Adaptive Framework (AF) has been constructed that allows the various projects in the PPP to be compared with each other according to the CVD approach. This AF was subsequently filled in by various people active in aQysta’s PPP, and by comparing different projects new patterns have arisen. These patterns offer new ways to investigate and improve the PPP. It has thus been proven possible to apply CVD to aQysta’s PPP and create new insights concerning the PPP.","CVD; spiral pumps; adaptive framework","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Water Management","",""

(mentor); Arkenbout, EA (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","To successfully perform manipulation tasks in an unknown environment, a robot must be able to learn the kinematic constraints of the objects within this environment. Over the years, many studies have investigated the possibility to learn the kinematic models of articulated objects using a Learning from Demonstration (LfD) approach. In the majority of these studies the assumption is made that the robot solely manipulates these articulated objects. In reality, however, robots often manipulate free-space objects that generally do not encounter any constraints. As a result, a human has to manually confirm which of the observed demonstrations concern articulated objects and which do not. Furthermore, the majority of these studies do not evaluate the quality of the kinematic models prior to learning them. As a consequence, incorrect or uncertain models can be learned by the robot, which could lead to task failure or even dangerous behavior.<br/><br/>In this report, the novel Kinematic Model Learner (KML) framework is introduced, which aims to solve both of these problems using a multi-modal approach. In doing so, special attention is given to the understandability of the created framework, and its ability to adjust to different robot applications. <br/><br/>The KML framework consist of two separate frameworks called KMLtraj and KMLforce. After the demonstration is given, the KMLforce framework first uses the force data to determine whether the manipulated object is free-space or constrained. If the object is recognized to be free-space, it will be classified as such after which the corresponding kinematic model is learned. If the object is classified as constrained, the \traj{} framework uses the observed trajectory data to classify and learn the kinematic models of the constrained objects. In order to prevent the robot from learning incorrect or uncertain models, a probabilistic classifier is used which only learns a kinematic model if the confidence level is above a certain learning threshold. <br/><br/>The designed frameworks are experimentally validated by performing a total of 27 demonstrations on the care robot Marco using tele-operation. From these manipulations the trajectory and force data were used as inputs to validate each framework separately. Additionally, the KMLtraj framework is also evaluated using the Cody dataset, which contains the trajectories of 35 different manipulation tasks.<br/><br/>It has been concluded that the KML framework can robustly recognize and learn the kinematic models of the free-space and articulated objects. Moreover, a robustness analysis showed that the KML framework is more robust than the current state-of-the-art acrticulation package. Additionally, the KML framework is able to asses the quality of the learned models and can prevent the robot from learning incorrect or uncertain models. Finally, the framework can be easily adjusted to different robot applications as the effects of the tuning parameters are easy to understand and can be determined by assessing the robot applications or by performing simple experiments.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","An offshore wind turbine is placed on a so called “foundation” to gain height above the sea surface level. One of the used foundations is the jacket structure, which is kept in place by pre-piled supports. The piles are hammered into the seabed first, after which the jacket legs are stabbed into the piles. A template is used to guide the piles during installation and to secure the relative distances as well as the straightness and depth of the piles with respect to each other. This template is called the Pile Installation Frame (PIF). Seaway Heavy Lifting has designed a PIF with a fixed footprint for the Beatrice offshore wind farm project. However, there is a need to make the PIF adjustable in order to use it in different situations (e.g. environmental conditions, pile designs and jacket configurations). Therefore, this thesis investigates the following two questions: “How can the current PIF be altered in order to make the footprint adjustable for various footprints?”, and: “What are the influences of variations in pile designs and conditions?”. A trade-off method is used to find the most feasible conceptual design. Resulted in interchangeable frames connected between the original pile supports and the center base frame (with equipment and a lifting point). The integrity of the concept is checked for one of the operational scenarios, namely, “the in-place scenario”, i.e., the PIF is at the seabed and the piles are stabbed into the sleeves with a hydraulic hammer on top of one of the piles. A model of the concept design is made with the structural simulation software SACS, that does not account for the second order bending effect of the pile. Therefore, a new calculation model is developed. This model calculates the reaction forces from the piles onto the PIF, and it is based on the linear wave theory, a linearized approached current profile, and the Morrison equation. The bending of the pile is computed using the Euler-Bernoulli beam theory, which is iteratively solved to take into account the second order bending effect. The PIF is checked for the minimum square footprint of 20 m, 24 m and the maximum of 32 m for a representative reference condition (Beatrice offshore wind farm). From the check, the maximum stress level in the members and braces is below half of the maximum allowable stress. Furthermore, the deformations at the pile supports in the sleeve are in the same order of magnitude than the current PIF. Hence, these are not critical for the installation tolerances in the same conditions. To show the influences of the variations per project in pile design and conditions, an analysis is executed. From the analysis, it is concluded that the forces on the frame are maximum when the hammer is at the seawater level. Moreover, a pile diameter of 2.2 meter is the optimum for the reference condition. It is also observed that, the influence of the pile thickness is not considerable with respect to the forces onto the frame. The forces in the members and braces of the frame are mainly caused by the pile reaction forces transferred to the PIF. Therefore, the calculation model can be used for a first estimation of the PIF integrity. When the reaction forces are lower than for the reference conditions, the PIF can be used; when they are higher, an additional analysis with SACS is required.","Offshore engineering; pile installation; Structural Design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-12-24","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering | Bottom Founded Structures, Arctic and Wind","",""

These systems typically consists of multiple controllers, which coordinate the actuators and apply feedback based on data collected by sensors. Often the underlying control strategy is entirely described in a software application, which allows for hardware independence and adds the ability to conveniently change algorithms. In order to increase application throughput, a commonly used approach is to divide the application into smaller units called <i>tasks </i>and execute them in parallel using multi-core hardware. In this thesis an automated multi-core aware scheduling and assignation approach is designed for an industrial-sized mechatronic control software platform, more specific the Prodrive Motion Platform (PMP). PMP can be applied in a wide range of products, e.g. wafer scanners, robots, elevators. A key feature of PMP is flexibility, which allows it to be utilized in combination with a wide variety of both controllable hardware (actuators, sensors) as well as computational hardware. As a direct consequence, PMP supports many different customers and corresponding requirements. Within PMP, a customer typically defines the application, which is then translated into a set of tasks. This task-set is then scheduled and assigned onto the available multi-core hardware resources. In order to meet timing-constraints, the current scheduling approach relies on a time-consuming manual process, which provides a limited amount of tuning options, and neither considers <i>task </i>workloads, nor inter-core communication costs. Given these short-comings, this solution proved to be unsuited for upcoming PMP products. To address the aforementioned issues, we first review state of the art scheduling solutions and introduce an extensible task measurement framework. Subsequently, we evaluate various scheduling approaches on current PMP applications and identify two algorithms, namely, <i>Internalization using Load Balancing</i> and <i>DCS</i>, that are able to automatically find schedules, whilst still meeting application timing-constraints. Besides enabling to schedule new applications within upcoming PMP products, performance improvements of ~3.3% and ~2.0% were observed by <i>Internalization using Load Balancing</i> and <i>DCS</i>, respectively, compared to the original scheduling approach within the multi-core PMP product PPCx3. Last but not least it is shown that within a relatively new product XEONx3, our approach provides performance improvements of 34.30% up to 49.61%, depending on the utilized scheduling algorithm.","multi-core; scheduling; mechatronic; automated scheduling; multi-processor; assignation; clustering; directed acyclic graph; graph scheduling; motion control; internalization; hlfet; ish; dcs; load balancing; real-time; application scheduling; bottom-level; top-level; execution time measurement; task; tasks; motion control platform","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Embedded Systems","",""

Wind energy is widely available at sea, the challenge is to harness this energy.

Multiple eConowind units can be installed on the hatch covers of general cargo vessels. If successful, this wind propulsion device can be applied on many different ships. The VentiFoil concept will be investigated and improved using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) research tools. These tools are used to simulate the flow around different VentiFoil geometries.

The use of POIs as proxies of the real-world-places facilitates the study of places, urban environments and, consequently, human behavior. Therefore, the extent to which the POIs manage to capture the complex multidimensional nature of physical places defines the limits of all those platforms and of humans' essential understanding of places.<br/><br/>Admittedly, the already existing POI data sources tend to represent differently the physical places (e.g. focus on specific aspects of places) and their data are being produced in a variety of ways (e.g. user generated data or non-user generated data). In addition, multiple sources exist that indirectly include place-related information as, for instance, Google Street View which contains images of the exterior of places without providing a direct link between the image and the corresponding place-entity. Thus, an interesting challenge arises which is how could all those diverse place-related data coming from different data sources be combined towards the creation of a better digital representation of places.<br/><br/>This thesis introduces an innovative approach to the extraction and combination of multidimensional POI features from various place-related data sources towards the study of urban places. It consists of two main parts: (1) the process of selecting, extracting and combining multidimensional POI features from various sources which reflect the high dimensional nature of places and (2) the use of the extracted features to discover which of those - and to what extent - better define and distinguish urban places in respect to their core characteristic, their main function. <br/><br/>Regarding the first part, for the combination of POI data sources a ""matching"" algorithm is developed whose goal is the identification of POIs which belong to different POI data sources and represent the same physical place and is based on the comparison of a set of attributes such as location, name and website. <br/>For the extraction of the POI features the need of specialized techniques according to the nature of the different data is revealed and several methods are discussed and used. <br/><br/>The second part concentrates in data collected from two capitals, Amsterdam and Athens. A machine learning classifier is trained on different combinations of features extracted from those data and their importance for distinguishing the urban place types is computed and compared. The results, among other, support that the functional (e.g. opening/closing times) and experiential characteristics (e.g. topics extracted from reviews) are the strongest indicators of a place's type independently of the context (e.g. city) while the exterior visual appearance of places does not provide such valuable information. The combination of the extracted features lead to an F1-score of around 60\% when classifying POIs by their type among 10 classes (multiclass problem) and around 90\% when predicting if a POI is of a certain type or not (binary problem). <br/><br/>Overall, the importance of combining multiple data sources in order to capture the complex nature of places is successfully supported by the results and the features that tend to better ""describe"" places in respect to their main function are discovered and further explored.","Points of interest; Machine Learning; Features extraction; instance matching (POI matching); User-Generated Content","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science | Data Science and Technology","",""

By analysing the context factors within family households, key aspects regarding habits, cooking knowledge, and attitudes towards food were identified. These insights were used to generate concepts and that ultimately resulted in the Zesturn. The final design is a device that enables vegetable scraps to be dried in a common household oven and can subsequently be ground into powdery flakes.

Many problems that are encountered when providing surgical care are related to surgical equipment. A lot of surgical equipment is designed for the use in High-Income Countries (HICs) and not specifically for Low-and-Middle Income countries (LMICs). One appliance, used in every operation room worldwide, is an electrosurgical unit (ESU). Electrosurgery is the use of a high-frequency (HF) alternating current (AC) to raise tissue temperature, making it possible to cut and coagulate this tissue. There is a large variety of ESUs available to HICs, but these do not meet the requirements for safe and proper use in LMICs. The Biomedical Engineering department at the TU Delft is currently working on a project to create an ESU for LMICs. This thesis aims to compose a list of requirements for this ESU, design a protocol and test set-up to measure electrosurgical parameters and perform an experiment to measure these electrosurgical parameters.<br/>During the development of the list of requirements, there was a lack in the knowledge about the thermal effects of electrosurgery was found. In order to be able to fill this gap, a testing set-up was created as well as a protocol to perform measurements on electrosurgical units. Throughout the process of designing this set-up different obstacles were found which had to be overcome. These obstacles consisted of the influence of light on thermal camera measurements, the influence of a smoke extractor on thermal measurements in general, measuring simultaneously or separately with a thermal camera and a thermocouple and measuring inside the tofu or on top of the tofu with the thermocouples. Experiments provided data which concluded that light had an effect on the measurements, using the FLIR E75 camera. Therefore these experiments should be performed in the dark. Furthermore, it was found that a smoke extractor affected the surface temperature during measurements, so the smoke extractor should not be used. Other external influences did not seem to influence the measurements drastically.<br/>Taking these factors into account, a testing set-up and protocol are created. This set-up is used to perform experiments comparing two ESUs and comparing different power settings of the ESUs. The result of these experiments show that for the Valleylab Force Fx, higher powers created higher temperatures (starting at<br/>60 Watts). For the ERBE ICC 300, there is no significant difference in maximum temperatures per power settings. There is a large difference between the maximum temperatures of the Valleylab and the ERBE. This is probably because the Valleylab uses a power controlled system and the ERBE uses a voltage controlled system.<br/>In conclusion, the set-up and prototype were validated and can be used to measure electrosurgical<br/>parameters. This information can guide us in making further decisions in the design requirements for the new ESU.<br","Electrosurgery; LMICs; Measurement set-up; Valleylab; ERBE; RDE; ESU","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-12-18","","","","","",""

Higher air temperatures are not only uncomfortable, but also unhealthy especially for vulnerable groups such as elderly people. So there lies a challenge in making our cities adapted to climate change. One of the strategies of climate adaptation is the implementation of greenery. However, due to space constraints it is not always possible to plan urban parks. A relatively new trend is the integration of greenery into buildings. A significant amount of research has already been done on green roofs and green facades, but there is not a lot of knowledge available on green balconies. Vertical forests - buildings with full-sized trees on the balconies - can improve the local microclimate in the city by solar shading, evapotranspiration and wind flow change.

The so called Green City is an ideology embraced by many nowadays. The “Suspended Tree” (ST), which is the centrepiece of this research, is considered to be a part of this development. In laymen terms the Suspended Tree (ST) is a tree which is not embedded in the ground, the needed nutrients and water essential for the tree’s survival are supplied by a computer system. The absence of a belowground root system and the accompanying soil account for a weight reduction of over 50%. This weight reduction allows for the placement of trees on locations, often within the constraints of dense inner cities, which would otherwise not be realisable. In order to realise a green and sustainable built environment, it is paramount that sustainable innovations are successfully introduced on today’s market. To overcome the barriers that hinder the market introduction of sustainable innovations, Strategic Niche Management (SNM) is frequently applied. SNM stimulates the growth of sustainable developments by means of creating a protective space surrounding the innovation, in order to shield, nurture and empower the innovation pre market introduction. However while the literature on SNM has a solid analytical core, the development of a practical and manageable perspective is lacking. Therefore those who lack an academic background in transition management, innovation studies and/or theories on technical change, can not directly apply SNM in practice. This research aims to provide a practical operationalization of SNM, tailored to the case of the ST, therefore the central question for this research is as follows: “How to empirically introduce the “Suspended Tree” sustainable innovation to the construction industry’s market by means of implementing the principles of SNM?”. This question was answered by means of conducting a workshop, based around the principles of SNM, with a select group of actors surrounding the ST.

In addition to the construction of new bridges, existing bridges are ageing. These two factors make the assessment of railway bridges essential. The bridges are designed considering certain predefined reliability criteria to account for the variability in load and resistance. However, for the assessment of these bridges, a probabilistic analysis of the structure in the presence of uncertainties is recommended. This thesis presents a probabilistic analysis of a railway bridge based on a case study of a newly constructed bridge. In the analysis performed, uncertainties in concrete material properties are incorporated. Given the unavailability of measured data in the location of bridge construction, expert judgment elicitation is carried out to estimate for the uncertainties in loading conditions of a train. Further, these uncertainties are incorporated in a finite element analysis to estimate the bridge response in the form of shear force and bending moment. The variables corresponding to the maximum shear force and the maximum bending moment, as well as the loading conditions and the material properties, are then merged into a Non-Parametric Bayesian Network. Conditionalization of the developed Bayesian networks is carried out to draw inferences on the bridge response when evidence on load or material properties is known. It is shown that expert judgment elicitation can be applied for risk assessment of railway bridges. Further, the developed Non-Parametric Bayesian network can be used to estimate and update the probability of failure. Improvements to this study can be made by updating the probability of failure in the event of an earthquake.","expert judgement; Bayesian Network; Concrete Bridge; Railway load; Reliability analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","Subsea pipeline are extensively used for the transport of hydrocarbons from offshore wells, to platforms, pump stations and to onshore facilities. Because the installation of pipelines is time consuming it is responsible for a significant amount of the total costs of a project. Thus the workability of the installation is of great importance.When installing a subsea pipeline one always begins with a start-up structure, a FLET (flowline end termination) or PLET (pipeline end termination). The start-up structure is lowered through the moonpool via the pipelay tower until it reaches the seafloor. When it’s close to the sea floor the start-up rigging is coupled to the start-up pile with the use of a remote operated vehicle (ROV). Often the moment the start-up structure transitions from a vertical to a horizontal position with respect to the sea floor the loads on the stem pipe become critical with regards to the structural integrity of the pipe. And as such dictates the workability limits of the start-up structure installation. Pipe integrity is maintained via the use of a unity check equation which is described by the design standard DNVGL-ST-F101 issued by Det Norske Veritas Germanischer Loyd (DNVGL). In this equation, the combined loading criterion, the combination of the effective axial tension, the bending moment load and the water depth is evaluated for the structural integrity of the pipe string. The purpose of this thesis is to decrease the conservatism of the equation by probabilistic modelling of the resistance parameters – yield strength, ultimate tensile stress, wall thickness, outer diameter &amp; ovality – instead of using deterministic nominal values and in the end allowing for higher sea states to operate in which in most situations increases the workability. For start-up structure installations DNVGL aims for a target probability of failure of 10-3¬ ¬.To achieve this first a well-documented load case was found in the Ichthys project. In HMC’s pipeline database the 18” Ichthys pipeline project offered 1106 geometrical and material strength pipe line data points. This data set was filtered analysed and used two describe the (bivariate) probability distributions of the resistance parameters. Analysing the data set it was found that the wall thickness and outer diameter and the yield strength and ultimate tensile strength showed a significance correlation. Dependence models have been defined by the use of copula’s. A performed sensitivity analysis showed that in the shallow water case, which the Ichthys project is, modelling the ovality as a stochastic variable has no significance influence on the outcome of the unity check. To assess the benefits of probabilistic modelling of the resistance parameters in a more general sense the base case Ichthys situation is altered to four different load scenario’s. Two shallow water cases and two deep water cases. For shallow and deep water, one case with the original sea state, in which the unity check is below 1. And one case in which the significant wave height is increased to push the unity check value to its limit of 1. After the input, the (bi-variate) probability distributions, and the test cases were defined the sample size for the Monte Carlo was determined to be 3*106 samples to guarantee the accuracy similar to what is used in current installation analyses. Performing the Monte Carlo simulations the results showed the expected conservatism in the current method. Where DNVGL aims for a probability of failure of 10-3¬, the probability of failure in the base case was calculated to be 10-5. Which allowed for finetuning and decreasing the safety class resistance factor used in the equation by 3% in the shallow water case and 4% in the deep water case. Which makes it possible to operate in heavier sea states and thus increases the workability of a start-up structure installation in certain situations.","Probabilistic design; Monte Carlo simulation; Copula modelling; Start-up structure installation; Subsea pipelines; Resistance parameters","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-12-18","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

As flying in such missions is difficult the robust estimation of an MAV's state within its environment is crucial to ensure safe operation. In indoor scenarios, cameras are one of the predominant choices for state estimation sensors. This requires Computer Vision algorithms to interpret the obtained high dimensional signal. An application that allows the competitive evaluation of control and state estimation algorithms is MAV Racing such as the IROS 2018 Autonomous Drone Race. Thereby a race court consisting of several race gates has to be followed. For a fast flight during such a race court the detection of the racing gates with a camera can be used in a high level control loop. As these objects consist only of small structures that are spread across large parts of the image, this gives rise to a challenging Object Detection problem. In recent years CNN showed promising results on various vision tasks. However, due to their computational complexity the deployment on mobile devices remains a challenge. Furthermore, CNN typically require a vast amount of training data. Finally, the objects typically studied in Object Detection consist of solid and complex features which is not the case for racing gates. Therefore, this work defines the class of EWFO and studies their detection on MAV with YoloV3. Thereby, the training data is created with a graphical engine. We are interested in how to detect EWFO with a CNN on a MAV, using synthetic data. We conduct several simple experiments about EWFO in simulation and compare their detection to more filled objects. Subsequently experiments in a more challenging environment such as an MAV race are conducted. The experiments show how EWFO are harder to detect than filled objects as the detector can be confused to patterns present in the empty part. Particularly for larger objects the detection performance decreases. We give several recommendations on how to generate data for the detection of EWFO on MAV. These include how to add variations in background as well as the camera placement. Finally, we study the incorporation of image augmentation techniques to transfer the detector to the real world. We can report that especially modelling lens distortion improves the performance on the real data. Nevertheless, a reality gap remains that can not fully be explained. Furthermore, different architectures are studied for the detection of EWFO. It can be seen how a relatively shallow network of 9 layers can be used for the detection of EWFO on MAV. A further reduction in weights leads to a gradual decrease in performance. Based on the gained insights the deployment of a detector on the example system JeVois is studied. A detection performance/speed trade-off is evaluated. The final detector achieves 32% average precision at a frame rate of 12 Hz on a real world test set created during this work. The gained insights can be used to deploy the detector in a control loop for MAV. This ensures the safe flight through a racing court of an autonmous drone race.

A functional quantum computer microarchitecture, the Central Controller-Light (CCLight), has been designed, implemented on a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA), and verified to control superconducting qubits successfully. The next logical step, in hopes of creating a more scalable quantum computing system, is to take the CCLight and implement it as an Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC). In this thesis, the CCLight was built into an ASIC. It was shown that this approach yields the potential for higher performance and lower power for the microarchitecture core, and the groundwork for more robust and automatic testing of similar microarchitectures was laid out.

The area of main interest is the city centre of Amsterdam, where quay wall replacements are necessary on a large scale. In Amsterdam, the foundation quality needs to be checked before construction activities nearby are performed, such as a quay wall replacement. Levelling benchmarks are usually installed to determine building deformation. In case large deformation rates are observed, additional measures are taken to ensure no building damage occurs during construction. Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) measures deformations from space and provides multiple years of deformation measurements. This can therefore reduce required monitoring time before construction.<br/>In this thesis, the use of InSAR for building deformation monitoring is investigated by analysis of occurring deformations of three areas in the city of Amsterdam. Furthermore, deformation in the Spoorsingel area in Delft is analyzed since large deformations are observed here. In all cases, levelling benchmarks are available for comparison of deformations. <br/>The results from the Amsterdam cases indicate similar building deformation behaviour by InSAR and levelling. Differences between InSAR and levelling are suggested to be the result of the measurement location and non-uniform building movement. In the city centre of Amsterdam, buildings with more than 2 mm/y settlement require additional attention. In this regard, a probabilistic approach is proposed. The probability of exceeding the 2 mm/y threshold is calculated by combining the calculated deformation rate with the variance of this estimate. This method is not only useful for InSAR displacement time series but also for other monitoring methods such as levelling, where the amount of measurements is often limited.<br/>Furthermore, the InSAR data enables the identification of building deformation mechanisms such as rotation, as is observed for the Spoorsingel in Delft. To identify this movement, rigid building behaviour is assumed. For buildings in plane-strain situation a method is devised to calculate the three dimensional deformation, using the ascending and descending track of a Synthetic Aperture Radar.<br/>All in all, the InSAR data is of added value to determine the building deformation behaviour. For this, the location precision, the quality of the time series, the line-of-sight measurement and the variance of the deformation rate estimate should be taken into consideration. A flow chart is proposed which describes the use of InSAR for building monitoring.<br","InSAR; Deformation monitoring; Building monitoring; Levelling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geo-Engineering","",""

The circuit consists of two resonators, a simple LC-resonator, and a similar resonator in which the inductor is replaced by a SQUID as a flux tuneable inductance. The interaction between the two resonators is established by mutual inductance between the inductor in the LC-resonator and the SQUID loop part of the other resonator. This makes the resonance frequency of the SQUID-resonator a function of the flux in the LC-resonator. It is shown that mutual and self inductances in the SQUID loop give rise to two transcendental constraints, for the magnetic flux in the SQUID loop, and the generalised flux across the SQUID. By an approximate solution for the constraints and under the assumption that the loop inductance is small compared to the SQUID inductance, we derive an approximate description for the circuit dynamics. We demonstrate that the circuit Hamiltonian contains the asymmetric opto-mechanical interaction, but in addition also a self-Kerr non-linearity in the analogue optical cavity, as well as a weak cross-Kerr interaction between the two resonators.","Optomechanics; Quantum Electromagnetic Circuits; Analogue Simulation; SQUID; Lagrangian Mechanics; Mutual Inductance","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Physics","",""

In PET detectors, the photodetector's single-photon timing resolution (SPTR) influences the CTR by adding uncertainty to the single photoelectron time-of-arrivals. This effect can be modelled as the convolution of the scintillation pulse shape function and the total photodetector jitter at single-photon level, before following an order statistics process. Particularly in Cherenkov-based PET detectors, SPTR has a direct impacton the CTR due to the low number of detected photons. In this thesis, the research is focussed on the design of low thresh-old comparators for two specific purposes in PET. Firstly, the design of in-pixel (SPAD-cell) low-threshold comparator that improves SPAD jitter at the pixel level, since it allows the detection of photo-electron triggered avalanche at the earliest possible time, thus minimizing statistical fluctuations. The design is targeted for Cherenkov-based PET, where improvement in SPTR directly results in improvement of CTR. Secondly, for the integration of analog silicon photomultiplier (A-SiPM) on-chip. Such integration helps in realizing a high Photon Detection Effciency (PDE) and low Dark Count Rate (DCR) A-SiPM with integrated readout electronics. A high speed comparator with a direct connection to the fast terminal of A-SiPM has been realized.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-09-30","","","","Electrical Engineering | Microelectronics","",""

A variety of approaches to de- sign the interaction between a robotic trainer and the patient is used. For the purpose of improving rehabilitation robotics, a new adaptive algorithm is proposed. Assistive algorithms seem suitable for training impaired patients but prove difficult to val- idate with healthy subjects. For healthy subjects, error augmentation is shown to be more effective for learning. In an experiment, 13 healthy subjects performed a reaching task while strapped to an up- per extremity exoskeleton. During this task they were subject to an adaptive augmented error feed- back controller. Subjects were divided into three groups in which one of each, or both the follow- ing parameters of a force field were adapted: dead band width and divergent force field strength. Per- formance was measured as amount of deviation from a straight line between two targets. Adapt- ing dead band width results in a better movement performance than adapting force field strength (p = 0.0069). Adapting force field strength in addition to adapting dead band width did not improve move- ment performance (p = 0.9960).

Having spent the majority of time away from the radiative environment of the inner Solar System, the chemistry of the comets has remained unaltered, making them the pristine samples of the matter from the ancient Solar nebula. A mission to bring cometary particles back to Earth enables the examination of the materials in well equipped laboratories and saves the mass of the instruments to be carried on board. As conventional propulsion methods require a large quantity of propellant for this type of mission, the feasibility of using the novel propulsion technique of solar sailing is explored in this thesis. In order to return the comet samples to Earth within a reasonable time period, the orbit transfer is considered as an optimal control problem with constraints placed on the sailcraft’s position and velocity. The Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm was used to search for time-optimal trajectories that minimize the approach distance and the relative velocity with respect to the comet during sample collection. The optimal trajectory obtained predicts the solar sailcraft to reach the comet, collect the samples and return back to Earth in 6.8 years. The time of arrival at the comet was found to match with the comet's perihelion passage, enabling effective sample collection. The outcome of the trajectory analysis, thus successfully demonstrates the applicability of solar sailing to comet sample return missions in the near future.","Solar sailing; Trajectory Optimization; Differential Evolution; Comets; Sample Return","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-06-16","","","","Aerospace Engineering | Astrodynamics & Space Missions","",""

The vision is a reaction on a future mobility paradigm shift towards fully automated transportation (Autonomous level 5). The majority of today’s car owners are convenience driven. These type of drivers have what is referred to as a ‘rational’ way of thinking about mobility. Subsequently, their vehicle is perceived as a tool, offering flexibility and freedom. Full automation of vehicles is leading to the ultimate convenience of being transported from door to door, while maintaining time to focus on other things than driving. Therefore it can be expected to be a warm welcome to the average car user. This shift in they way people think about mobility as the result of an increase in convenience due to automation runs contrary to the way Porsche approaches this matter. Being a brand that mainly focusses on offering the most sportive option in every car segment, it creates questions about how they should answer to a situation like this without neglecting their brand identity. Approaching the mobility paradigm shift from a generational standpoint the conducted research shows that the end of a timeframe where the vast majority of sports car buyers are from a category called ‘The babyboomers’ is coming to an end. By setting the timeframe for this project to 2035, the targeted group of potential future buyers are nowadays referred to as millennials. In this project, the substantial differences between these two groups, together with the knowledge gained about important brand values and design principles are used as a base for a future concept. Consulted by Porsche’s design studio in Weissach (Germany), the design proposal in this thesis shows a vision on how Porsche as a brand can position themselves in an automated and convenience-driven future. The concept focusses on offering future sports car drivers a unique, emotional and foremost, a Porsche typical driving experience, allowing the user to focus on the road and forget about the interior as an object. Instead, the vehicle is approached from a holistic point of view. By integrating as many functions as possible into a steering module, a highly simplified new interpretation of sportive driving was design.","Porsche; Car Design; Mobility; Driving; Automotive","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

Many different prosthetic hands have been designed to give these people the function of their hand back. Of the people who own such a prosthetic hand, about forty percent does not wear their hand and about half of the wearers does not use all of the functionalities the hand offers. The main reasons for this is that the hands have too much weight, are too complex to control and offer no feedback. The goal of this study is to create a low-weight prosthetic hand that is easy to control and provides feedback to the user. Therefore, this study presents a Force Demand Valve (FDV) that can be used with the Delft Cylinder Hand (DCH). This FDV increases the pinch force to operation force ratio by more than 200% with the use of pressurized CO2. This mechanism does not change the size or the weight of the hand itself, because it is attached near the elbow. Also, both the closing speed and the feedback to the user have not noticeably changed with the use of the FDV, compared to the DCH being used without FDV. The main disadvantage of the mechanism, is that the gas consumption is high. This consumption, however, can be decreased by making the FDV smaller, by increasing the activation force of the FDV and by providing a threshold in which the FDV will not exhaust gas when constant forces are applied for a longer period. Concluding from a user experiment, the mechanism designed in this study will make the DCH available for daily use to a wider range of people compared to the DCH without FDV.","Upper limb prosthetics; pneumatic; force demand valve; body powered; force amplification","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Biomedical Engineering | BioMechatronics","",""

Its study is<br/>of great interest for engineering purposes and is broadly reported in the literature. The practical implementation of pressure measurements in industrial wind tunnel facilities involves the use of intrusive pressure probes only able to retrieve pressure confined in a two-dimensional space. The interest of the industry is, however, centred on three-dimensional large-scale flows. Although they are proven to be a reliable and established technique, direct pressure measurements can also be time-consuming or provide insufficient information when considering the relatively large measurement regions in industrial wind tunnel testing.<br/>Pressure measurement using flow velocity data from PIV represents a viable alternative to direct pressure<br/>measurements. A literature survey identifies the successful measurement of pressure using 2D and 3D<br/>PIV techniques. Nevertheless, limitations in terms of maximum measurement volume, setup complexity and computational time make its application in the industry impractical. The introduction of Helium Filled Soap Bubbles and novel particle tracking algorithms allows for larger measurement volumes and affordable computation times which, combined with the arrival of Robotic Volumetric PIV, open the possibility of large-scale industrial measurements. While the technique has been successfully demonstrated, its performance in terms of pressure reconstruction has never been reported in the literature. Feasibility of 3D pressure measurements in large-scale industrial environments opens the possibility to substitute intrusive direct pressure measurements.<br/>In order to prove the feasibility of non-intrusive pressure reconstruction from PIV, the practical implementations are investigated and assessed through a wind tunnel experiment in the wake flow of a wall bounded finite cylinder. The proposed approach is based on the combination of velocity information with flow governing equations to obtain and solve the Poisson equation for pressure using first Neumann and then Dirichlet boundary conditions on the edge of the domain. The analysis is performed at flow speeds of 10 and 25 m/s where time-resolved and double-pulse acquisition strategies are used respectively. PIV-based pressure measured in a 24 L volume is compared with state-of-the-art direct pressure measurements along planes inside the same volume, serving as reference data. Total pressure is retrieved from a Kiel probe survey and static pressure is measured through pressure taps installed in the test section.<br/>The results show a good agreement between PIV-pressure from time-resolved acquisition and direct pressure measurements at 10 m/s, while for the case of double-pulse PIV-pressure at 25 m/s, it does not fully agree with the reference data. The current system capabilities demonstrate the possibility of substituting traditional pressure measurements in large-scale industrial environments for speeds up to 15 m/s. Moreover, larger amounts of pressure information are available in a similar time-scale, which ultimately confers superior flow characterisation capabilities. For higher flow speeds, increased performance of double-pulse acquisition strategy along with dedicated pressure reconstruction approaches might represent a viable alternative for pressure measurements in the future.","Robotic Volumetric PIV; PIV/PTV; Pressure measurements; Industry; CVV; HFSB","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering | Flight Performance and Propulsion","",""

(mentor); Rezaei, J. (mentor); Wigboldus, Tijmen (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","The Internet-of-Things has grown much in popularity over the past years, leading to the gathering of large amounts of pervasive and detailed data. This same trend is seen in the agriculture industry, where a lot of data can be collected on the cultivation methods. The agriculture industry is considered to be a strategically interesting industry for the Internet-of-Things by KPN, the company that commissioned this research. Despite the rapid data collection, businesses rarely exploit the full potential value of their IoT data. One of the methods of value creation with IoT data is to share the data with other parties. Data platform ecosystems make the sharing of data possible, but require the participation from all sides of the platform, especially the data providers, to be successful. Platform sustainability is an important research topic within Information Systems research. However, it remains unsure how the participation of data providers can be ensured. Furthermore, Information Systems researchers have often stressed data governance to have an important role in the success or effectiveness of data platforms. This research aimed to explore how important ecosystem data governance is relative to other relevant factors for the participation willingness of IoT data providers. This knowledge can consequently be used to develop data platforms which IoT data providers are more prone to participate in. Due to the limited time to complete this research, it was decided to focus on the Dutch horticulture sub-sector within agriculture. This sub-sector is considered to be the most advanced Dutch agricultural sub-sector in terms of digitalisation and Internet-of-Things adoption. Relevant factors to data platform participation were identified by means of a literature review. The Best-Worst Method was used in a survey amongst 30 Dutch horticulturists to determine the relative importance of each of the relevant factors. Additionally, six face-to-face semi-structured interviews were conducted to identify concerns related to the relevant factors. The survey results show a low spread of the factors in terms of weight, indicating that Dutch horticulturists do not base their participation decision on just a few decisive factors. Ecosystem data governance is considered around half as important as the most important factor, the benefits of participation, and around three times as important as the least important factor, the external pressure. Although the benefits, human readiness and technological readiness are weighted higher, KPN is recommended to focus on the factors that can be directly influenced by them to direct development time and resources more efficiently. It is therefore recommended to focus on developing a data platform with a high level of security and a low level of complexity. Furthermore, the ecosystem data governance should be another focal factor as appropriate ecosystem data governance can likely eliminate concerns related to several other factors, such as the benefits of participation, safety of data, and the trust in and readiness of other participants. The concerns regarding the misuse of data, unfair distribution of generated value, and the loss of ownership and control over own data, can all be addressed in the ecosystem data governance.","IoT data; Ecosystem data governance; KPN; Data platform; IOS adoption; Inter-Organizational Information Systems; Data sharing; TOE framework; BWM; Best-Worst Method; Agriculture; Horticulture; Ecosystems; Data governance","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

These energy sources have a fluctuating and irregular pattern over time. Therefore, electricity storage is needed in the nearby future. The Concentration Gradient Flow Battery (CGFB), which uses the Blue Energy technology as a storage mechanism, has a promising market potential. Advantages among others are low cost and a small impact on the environment. This battery is currently under development by AquaBattery. However, for the CGFB to be cost competitive with other storage technologies, it needs further improvement. A new stack design with integrated profiled membranes may be such an improvement. To research the viability of profiled membranes a Design Science (DS) approach was used. The DS approach distinguishes four phases: conceptualization, experimentation, implementation, and evaluation.

Part of the VISIR upgrade consists in a novel chopper system based on the Dicke-switch concept to suppress the excess low frequency noise (ELFN) suffered by the detector array. The ELFN is a form of temporally correlated noise and can be mitigated by modulating the incident light at high enough frequency. The other main challenge of the NEAR experiment is the need of high contrast to image the circumstellar environment, and it will be achieved with the implementation of an annular groove phase mask (AGPM) coronagraph for the suppression of the starlight. The main goals of the thesis project were the validation of the Dicke-switch chopper systems to assess its ability to mitigate background level and ELFN, and the characterisation of the performance of the AGPM coronagraph in terms of null depth and contrast level. The first part of the laboratory characterisation of the Dicke-switch chopper system focused on the verification of the radiometric flux level achievable by its internal blackbody unit and by the so called artificial sky, a cold blackbody needed to reproduce the background level typical at the VLT, where the combined sky and telescope thermal radiation is the same as the one of a greybody at 280K and 10% emissivity. After the completion of the radiometric tests and mitigation of parasitic light effects caused by reflection of internal and external thermal radiation, the tests to validate the ability of the Dicke-switch chopper system to remove background level and suppress the ELFN started. The obtained results confirm that the Dicke-switch chopper system mitigate the ELFN as done also with pseudo-chopping. This was verified also for large offsets between the flux level of internal blackbody unit and artificial sky. Similarly, the characterisation of the AGPM coronagraph started with the preparation of the laboratory setup, in particular design of the optical setup, alignment of all the optical components and measurement of the optical quality of the system to limit residual aberrations and vignetting. The results of the coronagraphic tests revealed that the two candidate AGPMs for the NEAR campaign, both optimised for wavelengths between 10 and 12.5 μm, are not able to provide the required contrast level and null depth. On the contrary, an older AGPM, spare part of the one currently mounted in VISIR, and thus optimised for wavelengths between 11 and 13.1 μm, provided better coronagraphic performance, and even though it is still not compliant with the requirements, at present it represents the baseline for the NEAR experiment.","chopping; noise mitigation; coronagraphy; high contrast; exoplanets","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering | Space Systems Engineering","",""

In the current design approach, partial factors are prescribed to account for uncertainties in the soil, as well as for other types of uncertainties. This semi-probabilistic (level I) design approach needs to result in a reliable design for a range of quay structures and for multiple soil stratifications. It is therefore expected that, in general, this method results in overdimensioning of the structure. Whether this assumption holds, is investigated in this thesis by carrying out a reliability analysis for two quay walls in the Port of Rotterdam. The first case study covers a simple double-anchored combi-wall, whereas in the second case study a quay wall with relieving platform is considered. <br/>Only the most relevant failure mechanisms were considered, which are yielding of the combi-wall, yielding of the anchor bar, shear failure of the grout body and soil mechanical failure. These failure mechanisms are complex soil-structure interaction problems. Therefore, both the soil and the quay structure have been modelled with the finite element program Plaxis 2D, using the Hardening soil model. For performing the probabilistic calculations on this model, the probabilistic module ProbAna has been used. This is a package developed by Plaxis which couples several types of reliability methods to the finite element software of Plaxis 2D. As the computational effort is relatively large when using FEM, the First Order Reliability Method (FORM) was used over sampling methods like Directional Sampling and Crude Monte Carlo simulation.<br/>The results for the simple quay wall showed that the reliability level was sufficient for all considered limit states. Hence, almost all partial factors derived on this quay wall were lower than currently prescribed by the Eurocode. In the second case study, a quay wall with relieving platform, monitoring data of multiple years was used for calibration of the Plaxis-model. Thereafter, the reliability for the limit states yielding of the wall and soil mechanical failure was evaluated. It turned out that for both limit states, the reliability index was too low compared to the target reliability. <br/>Although each case study concerned a different type of quay wall, the results reveal that choices made in the design, either optimistic or pessimistic, can have large influence on the reliability. Perhaps just as important, are the assumptions made regarding the stochastic description of the soil. It is still under discussion up to what distance soil parameters are correlated in space and how spatial averaging should be applied. Reference calculations showed that choices regarding the amount of independent soil layers and the degree of spatial averaging have a large influence on the reliability. More fundamental research to these topics is therefore recommended. <br","Quay structures; FORM; Partial factors; Soil-structure interaction; FEM Analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","",""

A novel method is presented, injecting data from LES or other high-fidelity source such as DNS into the RANS equations, forming a Hybrid Injected RANS (HIRANS) model. The aim is to construct a multi-fidelity design optimization framework that outperforms single-fidelity RANS and LES variants. Two different formulations, injecting a scaled version of the non-dimensional anisotropic part of the Reynolds stress tensor and both isotropic and anisotropic components, are tested in the periodic hill case. A cost-effective LES configuration is assessed, and the agreement of the RANS and HIRANS results with respect to the LES reference is investigated. The original geometry is parametrized using a hill width multiplier, computing several LES evaluations. The injection of LES information from the same geometry into HIRANS and the prediction capabilities when using interpolated data from different geometries are tested. A global design optimization process is computed, using single-fidelity RANS, HIRANS and LES Kriging and multi-fidelity RANS-LES and HIRANS-LES Co-Kriging surrogates. The objective function is based on a combination of turbulent mixing and total pressure losses. <br/><br/>The correction of the mean velocity components required of the injection of both isotropic and anisotropic components for the test case. The LES setup analysis yielded similar results to the reference data with one tenth of grid points and forty percent of its averaging period. The locally corrected HIRANS model successfully reduced the L2 norms of the Reynolds stresses with respect to LES to a third part of the original RANS values in the fifty-nine LES samples tested, with a modest improvement in the mean velocity components. The non-local corrections yielded irregular results for the mean velocity components, with successful corrections of the Reynolds stresses despite the long distances in the parameter space and different flow features of neighbouring LES cases to interpolate from. In the optimization process, the Co-Kriging LES-HIRANS was not able to outperform the Co-Kriging LES-HIRANS and Kriging LES methods. It improved the initial prediction of the underlying function, but the surrogate yielded artificially low predicted errors far away from the LES samples, leading to an overly exploitative method. An error correction formulation combining two HIRANS fidelity levels was simulated using a modified Kriging believer criterion, outperforming the original formulation and achieving similar results as Kriging LES. The computational efficiency improvements for future research of the Co-Kriging HIRANS are suggested to be linked to an adequate error estimation integration into the surrogate model.","RANS; LES; HIRANS; Turbulence; CFD; Interpolation; Optimization; Kriging; Co-Kriging; Aerodynamics; Periodic hill; Correction; Prediction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-12-14","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

The three options that asset managers have are run to fail, perform maintenance or repairs and lastly to replace. This decision making process is becoming incrementally more important due to the threat of replacement waves. This a phenomenon that comes forth from the fact that a large portion of the assets were installed around the 1970's, the so called installation wave, combined with the fact that these assets have a life expectancy of 40 to 60 years. It is up to the asset managers to accurately asses the condition of these assets and prioritize investments due to budget restrictions. Asset management has been evolving from time based maintenance (TBM) to condition based maintenance (CBM) and risk based maintenance (RCM). To aid in the decision making process for the latter two methods, accurate condition assessment and failure probability methods are needed. At Stedin, one of the three largest network operators in The Netherlands, the asset managers require a better condition assessment method for transformers, as the one being used now lacks certain capabilities; trend analyses and proper prioritization is difficult and time consuming. Furthermore, there lies the question whether the condition of the transformer can be used to improve the failure or survival probability model. The assumption is that the condition indicators of an individual asset can be used to adjust the population based probability models, which are then comprehensive and more accurate. In this thesis, an improvement to the transformer condition assessment is implemented and the effect of the condition indicators on the survival probability of the transformer is studied. Several condition assessment methods were reviewed, with the chosen method being the so called health index (HI). The results from this method is accurately reflected in the transformers which are to be replaced by Stedin. However, it has become clear that using one single number for decision making is not recommended, as the subsystems that are in moderate or bad condition might be masked by those that aren't. This can be compared to the analogy that a chain is only as strong as its weakest link, and thus the condition of that link should not be masked by the condition of the rest. For the survival model, machine learning and classic statistical methods were reviewed. The chosen method was Cox's Proportional Hazard Model, which has the advantage of being applicable to situations in which the underlying probability distribution of the events is unknown. Due to missing failure data, the survival model was used to model the effect of the condition indicators on the probability of corrective maintenances. Further constraints in the data quality lead to the confidence bands of the model's parameters to be relatively large. However, the univariate models do prove the significance of the effect of these condition indicators. The conclusion is that there is a relationship between the condition and the observed failures, but that proper documentation of failures is necessary to increase the accuracy of the model.","Asset management; Transformer; Survival analysis; Condition assessment; Health index; Proportional hazard model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-02-05","","","","","",""

Renovation of those bridge, if possible, is preferred over newly built from an economical point of view. Fibre-reinforced polymer (FRP) decks prove to be excellent for retrofitting bridge decks compared to traditional decks, mainly due to its high strength-to-weight ratio. Lightweight bridge decks are advantageous in movable bridges considering the savings on foundation, counter- weights and mechanical equipment, not to mention, reduced transportation costs, installation time and traffic hindrance during execution.<br/>Connecting FRP decks to the steel girders can either be done mechanically (bolts), chemically (bonded) or in a hybrid fashion. Adhesively bonded connections do not require drilling in the FRP deck, thereby increasing its durability, have a more uniform stress distribution and fabrication costs are lower compared to bolted connections. Complex stress states and strength prediction of a bonded joints are yet not fully understood, therefore rarely being applied in primary load bearing structures like bridges.<br/>This thesis focuses on the stress analysis and strength prediction of adhesively bonded connection between FRP decks and steel girders. An existing bridge, representative for renovation projects, is considered as case study. Its former bridge deck is replaced by a FRP deck and adhesively bonded to the steel girders. Structural analysis of the bridge deck performed with a global and local numerical model, focuses on the stress states in the bonded deck-to-girder connections. Traffic and thermal loads are the governing load cases, which show the largest stress concentrations. Peak stress levels are obtained along the edges and ends of the bonded connection between the FRP deck and secondary girders.<br/>Comparison of results from the global and local model showed significant difference in stress levels and was further investigated. Stress concentration factors are determined to relate the (peak) stresses from the global and local model for different adhesive thickness and elastic modulus. Stress results from the global model are tweaked with the stress concentration factors and compared with strength values from literature.

In the Netherlands, the concept of a localized mega nourishment has been introduced as an innovative approach, aiming to counteract the anticipated enhanced coastal erosion. The positive results of the Sand Engine implementation lead the way for applying the mega nourishment concept as an innovative solution in many retreating coastlines around the world. In central Vietnam, Cua Dai beach experiences ongoing erosion that propagates to the north over the years which significantly undermines the existence of the coast. The complexity of the prevailing climate as well as the various human interventions that have taken place, complicate the understanding of the system and the determination of a long term solution to the problem of erosion.<br/>The present research investigates the concept of mega nourishment as a measure against the problem of erosion in the Cua Dai beach. A consistent approach has been followed for this purpose, addressed through several research steps. Initially, an overview of the recorded morphological evolution and of the relevant processes has been created as well as an assessment of the stakeholder relations in the area, through available literature. Then, the prevailing dynamics of the overall region that includes Cua Dai beach have been analyzed with the use of representative conditions of the influencing forcing mechanisms, based on characteristic past morphological periods. Extreme flood and storm events have been also investigated. For this purpose numerical modeling simulations with Delft3D have been performed. A design approach has been selected and the primary and secondary design parameters have been determined, formulating the final design solutions. Assessment of the design solutions has been realized, in terms of a qualitative analysis but also an assessment of their seasonal behaviour. For the latter part, numerical modelling simulations have been also made.<br/>An erosive trend has been identified in the north coastline where Cua Dai beach is located that has been present before any interventions in the coast took place. In addition, the trend of formation of an ebb tidal bar has been highlighted as well as its interaction with the north coast. The presence of resorts along Cua Dai beach was found to enhance the erosive pattern. The placement of sandbags across the public Cua Dai beach strengthened further the erosion. The extreme flood and storm events do not alter the erosive trend of the north coast that is present under regular seasonal conditions, but can explain the enhancement of the inspected morphological trends.<br/>The selected design approach that concerns the inclusion of the influencing stakeholders in the financing of the nourishment design solutions, led to the formation of three design alternatives that follow the mega nourishment concept. The required volume, the design lifetime, the location and the shape of the designs formed the main design parameters. The seasonal assessment of the behaviour of the designs has been performed separately for each design alternative, based on the level of diffusion and the trends formed in the alongshore sediment transport gradients. All design solutions have shown a degree of spreading around them, which is directed to the expected locations. Thesis findings suggest that sand nourishment applications that follow the mega nourishment concept can be an option for the problem of erosion in Cua Dai beach.","Nourishment; Delft 3D; Modelling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

The feasibility is assessed both from an astrodynamics point of view and from a systems engineering point of view. The astrodynamics part provides knowledge evolution results from a covariance analysis, which combines radiometric measurements of the spacecraft from Earth and optical measurements of the asteroid from the spacecraft. The systems engineering aspect on the other hand identifies all mission and subsystem requirements and provides possible subsystem design options.<br/><br/>From the 1906 potentially hazardous asteroids known at the time of writing, Apophis has been selected as the main research target due to its extremely close expected Earth encounter on April 13th, 2029: the expected miss distance is just 38440 km. Asteroids 2012 UE34 and 2001 WN5 have been selected as secondary targets. High-fidelity resonant trajectories have been generated using a multiple shooting method implemented in NASA's General Mission Analysis Tool. As a robust initial guess for these simulations, results from porkchop plots have been used, which combine the solution of Lambert's problem and resonance data. Only 1:1 resonance has been researched for this thesis. All trajectories target the asteroid B-plane at 600 km distance. <br/><br/>Data from JPL's HORIZONS has been used, alongside the generated high-fidelity trajectories, as input for a covariance analysis to produce the asteroid position knowledge evolution and the knowledge evolution of the asteroid in Earth's B-plane at the expected close-approach date. It has been found that, for Apophis, two flybys are sufficient to ensure mission success. After the second set of optical measurements, the orbital period of the asteroid is accurately known, which improves the asteroid position knowledge by roughly two orders of magnitude while improving the diameter of the covariance error ellipse at the expected close-approach date by roughly three orders of magnitude. The 1-sigma error ellipse diameter shrinks from roughly 65000 km to roughly 15 km after two flybys. The analysis shows that for the used spacecraft trajectory the asteroid knowledge evolution is independent from the targeted flyby B-plane parameters. In the case multiple optical measurements are taken during a flyby, the knowledge evolution is found to be close-to independent from the distance to the asteroid when an optical measurement is taken. Asteroid WN5, which does not have a near-circular orbit around 1 AU such as Apophis and UE34, has a different knowledge evolution that does not improve the orbital knowledge after two flybys, meaning that the proposed mission would not be justified for this target.<br/><br/>The major conclusions that result from the systems engineering analysis are the following: a feasible launch strategy would be to use a light launcher, such as Vega, to launch the spacecraft to LEO, in combination with an upper stage, such as STAR 48, to escape Earth's gravity and put the spacecraft in the desired interplanetary trajectory. Feasible options for the propulsion system are an ion thruster, a cold gas system and a hydrazine system. All three require a low velocity increment, in the order of magnitude of a few m/s, which translates into a propellant mass of maximum 0.2 kg. The attitude control system needs to provide a slew rate of at least 0.835 degrees per second during the flyby phase for accurate asteroid pointing in order to make optical measurements. The estimated necessary average power equals 215.16 W and the peak power 485.76 W. The average power will be provided by GaAs solar panels with an estimated area of 0.6709 m^2, while Li-ion batteries with a storage capacity of 3301.11 Wh will be used to provide the necessary power during peak power scenarios. The high-level spacecraft design has an estimated dry mass of 149.77 kg, excluding the mass of the upper stage.<br/><br/>The combination of the astrodynamics aspects and the systems engineering aspects indicate that a flyby mission to a potentially Earth impacting asteroid is a promising option to improve the Earth collision uncertainty knowledge of that asteroid.","Mission design; Covariance Analysis; orbit determination; flyby mission; spacecraft analysis; trajectory analysis; near-Earth asteroids","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

As such, now, more than ever, it is crucial to be prepared to operate a reservoir under extreme hydrological circumstances, when the consequences of an operational error could be very serious. However, the operation schedules currently use in the engineering practice lack on mechanisms for evaluating and balancing the potential risks associated with storage and release decisions. This results in reservoir flood control strategies that, from the perspective of flood risk mitigation, are distant from the optimal. This graduation project aims to improve existing methods for developing emergency operation schedules by including the concept of risk into the optimization of flood control operations. To address this topic, the research is divided into: (1) development of a methodology for including reservoir operation effects in the risk analysis of dam-reservoir systems; (2) combination of the risk analysis procedure with an optimization algorithm to devise optimal risk-based emergency operation schedules.<br/><br/>The thesis culminates with a case study in which the emergency operations are optimized for the Barker Reservoir system in Houston, Texas. Susceptible to Hurricanes like Hurricane Harvey (2017) and intense precipitation events such as Tax Day (2016), the Barker system presents an operational dilemma requiring trade-offs between released flows and stored volumes. Using the methods developed in this thesis, the flood risk analysis shows that a change in the operational strategy would contribute greatly to reducing the total risk of the system. Under extreme hydrological events, an operation strategy with releases starting at the first stages of the flood event display a reduction of almost a 32% on the total risk of the system as compared with the current operation strategy, including a 40% decrease on the risk associated with the structural failure of the dam. The new operating policy, however, increases the frequency of downstream damages during non-structural low frequency failure scenarios. Therefore, an increase of the downstream channel capacity along Buffalo Bayou and adequate measures to strengthen the dam are further recommended to reduce downstream damaging flooding and diminish the failure probabilities of the structure.","Dam safety management; Extreme hydrological events; Risk analysis; Reservoir operations; Risk-based optimization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering | Hydraulic Structures and Flood Risk","",""

To make this possible, camera calibration plays an essential role in providing important camera spa- tial information for 3D scene reconstruction. However, there are still many drawbacks left to improve on camera extrinsic parameters calculation in most existing systems: such as the procedure relies too much on extra calibration markers, or specific depth sensors may have complicated procedures that cannot easily be generalized to other depth sensors.To improve on this, we propose a markerless, feature-based pipeline for multiple cam- era re-calibration. This pipeline contains four main stages. It adopts feature descriptor extracting and matching to solve the issue of requiring additional markers, and the point cloud registration accuracy is improved by using point cloud segmentation and part selection. The experiment results obtained in this research show that this pipeline can calibrate four cameras with a single object (such as a chair, lamp) without the need for additional calibration markers. The extrinsic parameters calculated using this pipeline is more accurate and requires less processing time than originally.

In the case of steel structures, two parties are involved in the design. The engineering firm designs the structure, and at a later phase the steel contractor designs all the detailing. This fragmentation restrict the possibilities of creating a cost optimal design. Currently, engineers often optimise on total weight. The result is that at a later phase, the steel contractor will need to design more complex joints, in order to create sufficient resistance in the joints of the slender structure. This can lead to higher total cost of the steel structure, compared to when joint design has been considered at the early phase. This situation leads to the following research question: “How can engineers optimise the production costs of steel trusses with welded connections?”. In this research, I will focus on trusses with welded connections which comply with transport dimensions. To answer this question, a parametric optimisation model is developed. This model combines three software packages Grasshopper, Karamba3D and IDEA Statica Connection . Grasshopper creates the wireframe geometry that resembles the structure. Karamba3D performs the structural analysis and defines cross-sections through size-optimisation. Finally, IDEA Statica Connection will design all joints, check the joints plates for the strain percentage, and optimise the welds according to the directional method.<br/>The model shows that selected beams from the size optimisation in Karamba3D often fail the joint analysis of IDEA. This is because the strain criterion is exceeded. This failure can be resolved in the model either by modifying the cross-sections, changing the geometry of the structure, or applying stiffeners in the joint. When the truss does not show failure in the plates of the joints, the weld volume can be optimised. The optimisation model will automatically optimise the welds of each joint in the structure by using the directional method in IDEA. Optimising the welding volume, creates a significant reduction in welding volume compared to the full strength method. However, in the current state, deformation capacity in the joint cannot be guaranteed. This can prevent a plastic hinge to form and may cause premature brittle failure of the structure. To be able to use the welding volume optimisation, it should be complemented with an extra check to define whether the yield strength of the connected parts is lower than the rupture strength of the welds. Further research is recommended, to complement the weld volume optimisation with the needed additional check. Additional research into the cost-optimisation of steel structures with bolted connections and moment-resisting connections is also encouraged.","steel structures; optimisation; costs; joints; connections; Grasshopper; Karamba3D; IDEA Statica Connection; C#","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Building Engineering","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","On a regular basis doctors need to hold difficult conversations with patients. In shared decision making (SDM) conversations patients and doctors work together to get to a medical decision by talking about the patients preferences and values and the possible options and their respective risks and benefits. Good communication through the use of SDM should help in finding the best course of action for both doctor and patient. Currently SDM is learnt through workshops where medical students and professionals get to act out SDM conversations with an actor. These workshops are expensive and logistically hard to organise. A virtual patient could help with the education of SDM, as it would be easier accessible and students could more often practice their conversation skills. This thesis proposes a virtual patient system to teach SDM. The system allowed users to hold a SDM conversation with a virtual patient by making it possible to provide the virtual patient with information through speech and ask questions through text. Users were furthermore able to receive feedback on their performance after a conversation. At its core the virtual patient contained a BDI-based reasoning model, which made it possible for the virtual patient to deliberate about information it had received from the user. The experiment that was conducted suggested that medical students were able to hold a SDM conversation with the virtual patient. The results indicated that, even though the speech recognition was prone to underclassify certain subjects that a users talked about, there was an overall increase in SDM performance throughout the conversations users had with the virtual patient. Users felt that the feedback component of the system was educational with regards to teach wanted behaviour and knowledge. They also found that their opinion on the usefulness of virtual patients as an educative tool had increased after using it.","BDI; virtual patient; shared decision making","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science | Data Science and Technology","",""

An example is a retractable centre board, havinga big influence on the sailing properties. Predicting the performance of the centre board contribution in a hull-keel-centre board configuration is the subject of this research. When predicting the performance of large sailing yachts, Dykstra wants to keep the ability to superpose an appendage to the data of a hull-keel configuration obtained from towing tank experiments or CFD simulations. This means that a method must be developed to estimate the contribution of the centre board, in terms of side force, resistance and centre of effort. Both towing tank experiments and CFD simulations are conducted for this research. The Maltese Falcon is used as the 'case ship'. A towing tank model of the Maltese Falcon was already made and tested at the TU delft in 2002. This model is again subjected to towing tank experiments, with a new keel and two new centre boards, resulting in 9 different hull-keel-centre board configurations. The main focus was on the towing tank experiments, executed in the Delft Hydromechanics Laboratory. CFD simulations were done to validate the results of the towing tank experiments and to gain visual insight in the flow around the vessel. The lift-carry-over on the keel and hull above the centre board can clearly be seen, as well as the influence of the centre board on the circulation in the flow around the underwater body of the yacht. After post-processing all experimental data, the results of the towing tank experiments are used to develop formulations to predict the performance contribution of the centre board. The measured lift of the centre board contribution was roughly a factor 2 higher than the centre would generate according to Wicker &amp; Fehlner theory. Additionally, it was found that the lift-carry-over does not only have a positive effect on the generated side force, but also on the resistance. Furthermore, it was found that heeling the Maltese Falcon model by 15 degrees, yields the same magnitude oflift-carry-over as for the upright conditions. This resulted in the conclusion that heeling the yacht has no influence on the lift-carry-over from centre board to keel-hull. The new prediction methods, derived from the towing tank experiment data, are validated on YACHT1 and Adela. These are existing yachts with hull-keel-centre board configurations, but both very different. This enabled an interesting examination on the influence of certain aspects of the configuration on the performance of the centre board contribution. All in all, it was found that the predicted centre board contribution corresponded really well to the measured data of YACHT1 and Adela. This provides enough trust to implement the new centre board performance prediction methods in the Dykstra performance prediction tool. Every new design cycle of a yacht with hull-keel-centre board configuration will serve as a validation of the derived performance prediction methods.","lift-carry-over; centre board; hull-keel-centre board; Maltese Falcon; extra lift; effective draft; effective span; induced resistance; stalling; stalling behaviour; interaction effect; Adela; Towing tank experiments; CFD simulations","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Above this level, the particles are no longer in liquid water form, but rather ice crystals, snowflakes, graupel or hail. In this thesis is tried to contribute to the research into the critical operating phenomenon by answering the following research question: How can heat transfer analysis of aircraft engine inlets in ice crystals conditions be improved by application of \acrlong{ml} algorithms?\\ This thesis takes as starting point the test results of a \acrfull{ge} component test with a sector inlet in icing conditions. The test was run through a \acrfull{doe} matrix with inputs variations of flow inlet parameters and heating of the component. The temperature measurements from the test are signals which are showing the behavior of the wall temperature given a combination of inlet conditions.\\Ice crystals which are induced in the inlet flow impinge on the wall and melt because of the heat flux through the wall. This process repeats itself until the energy delivered through the wall is not enough to melt all the ice particles which are impinging. At this moment ice starts to accrete. Two hypothesis where formulated. Both using different characteristics in the temperature signal to calculate an experimental factor $\zeta$. This experimental factor $\zeta$ is used to close the ""5 heat equation"" which describes the heat fluxes to the impinging ice crystals. This $\zeta$ is used as a target value in a \acrshort{ml} algorithm.\\The \acrshort{ml} algorithm uses data to extract a mapping function which maps the input variables to the target variable, referred to as training. The mapping function of hypothesis 1 was nonphysical. It showed unexpected relations between the input variables and $\zeta$. Therefore is hypothesis 1 rejected. The mapping function of hypothesis 2 was physical and this hypothesis is accepted. \\ Using this trained \acrshort{ml} algorithm, the tool was build and prediction could be made. Some zones within the inlet variables showed very accurate predictions other zones showed very poor predictions. An unsupervised learning algorithm, \acrfull{pca} was used, to look for relations between prediction accuracy and inlet variables. The foundings from the \acrshort{pca} let to the clear proof that the ""5 heat equation"" used by \acrshort{ge} explains the physics insufficiently.

The Delfi-n3Xt was the first satellite from Delft University of Technology, to include three-axis Attitude Determination and Control System/Subsystem (ADCS). It was designed with 5 modes of operation. Four of these were advanced modes. In addition, the Delfi-PQ is not intended to include advanced modes of operation. Hence, this thesis considers using the Delfi-n3Xt ADCS software. This software is extended as a baseline implementation on MSP-EXP432E401Y launchpad. Nearly, 32 % of total nominal power is assigned to ADCS. Hence, energy efficient design alternatives could be considered for future satellite missions. In addition, ADCS is a critical subsystem, failure of ADCS means failure of satellite mission. This thesis aims to improve performance and energy consumption of ADCS. This thesis considers study of three different Digital Signal Processing (DSP) alternatives: Double Precision (DP), Single Precision (SP) and Fixed Point (FxP) arithmetic. Study in this thesis concludes that FxP alternative provides approximately 6.7 times better performance, and approximately 7 times better energy efficiency over baseline. Hence, this thesis proposes the use of FxP DSP alternative. It was also concluded that, the SP arithmetic has equivalent accuracy compared with DP. Moreover, SP provides approximately 3 times better performance, and approximately 2.7 times better energy efficiency over baseline. Therfore, future implementations could benefit from an SP alternative. A major part of the ADCS power is allocated to sensor and actuator. This leaves only 10 % of the total nominal power assigned to ADCS software. Hence, the proposed alternative might not provide considerable improvements on total nominal power. However, for future satellite missions, if there exists a computationally intensive algorithm assigned with more significant amount of total nominal power, then, the proposed alternative could serve as an initial study. However, this does not guarantee that the suggested alternative could satisfy more accurate requirements. In such case, FxP implementation might result in accuracy violation. And use of SP alternative is proposed. In such case, a new study is suggested in order to benefit from FxP alternative.","Delfi-n3Xt; Energy Efficiency; DSP; Fixed-point; Delfi-Program; ADCS","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Embedded Systems","Delfi-PocketQube",""

The diffraction limit of an instrument is inversely proportional to the diameter of the telescope: the larger the primary mirror, the higher the resolution. Therefore, the instrument METIS (Mid-Infrared ELT-based Imager and Spectrograph), based on the 37-meter aperture Extremely Large Telescope, will take advantage of the giant mirror to achieve an unrivaled resolution in mid-infrared. However, to reach this limit, the perturbations created by the temperature fluctuations in the atmosphere need to be removed by Adaptive Optics (AO). METIS will already have an AO system, called Single Conjugate Adaptive Optics (SCAO). However, this system will require a Natural Guide Star (NGS) with a K-band magnitude ofmK Æ 11. This limits considerably the sky coverage where the atmospheric compensation (thus high-resolution observations) could be done. The idea is to use an artificial guide star, called Laser Guide Star (LGS), to get rid of this constraint. This is performed by shooting a laser at the 90-km sodium layer, tuned so that it excites the atoms there that re-emits toward the ground. For a telescope with the size of the ELT, several lasers are recommended in a configuration called Laser Tomography AO or Multi-Conjugate AO. The plurality of the lasers allows removing errors such as the focus anisoplanatism. However, because of the complexity and cost of such a solution, the only available answer for the ELT/METIS is a Single Laser AO system (SLAO). This will be less complex and expensive at the expense of a decrease in the performances. The question is: what are the performances of such a SLAO system, and how could it be made? The Yorick Adaptive Optics (YAO) simulator has been used to estimate the performances of the SLAO system for the ELT/METIS. The elongation of the LGS beam, created by the finite thickness of the sodiumlayer, plays a crucial role in the process and has direct consequences on the performances. A parameter analysis has been performed to define the most suitable Field of View, number of sub-apertures, pixels size to tackle the problem. An algorithmhas also been developed inMATLAB, coupledwith the results fromthe YAOalgorithm. The goal of this algorithm was to estimate the correction that could be brought by the so-called truth sensing on the features left by the LGS correction because of the beam elongation. This sensing will require a natural guide star coupled with the existing SCAO sensor of the METIS instrument and will work in addition to the SLAO sensor. Once the parameters settled, it has been possible to create an optical design with ZEMAX. Because the distance between the telescope and the sodium layer varies relatively to the zenith angle, the focal point of the LGS beamchanges accordingly: the optical system needs to tackle this. It was also required to find a solution to separate the LGS beam from the science beam: two solutions have been described, with their advantages and limitations detailed. Finally, a mechanical implementation of the systemhas been made to explain how such a system could be hanged. The work performed has allowed estimating the Strehl ratio obtained for the SLAOsystemwith the ELT/METIS, which would be around 60%. These results have been confirmed by the European Southern Observatory and their AO experts. The study made on the truth sensing of the system has allowed putting constraints on the natural guide star brightness required (mK Ç 16.5), and the sky coverage of the SLAO system which would be almost 100%. The optical design made with ZEMAX has shown great performances so that the perturbations induced by the system are small enough to be able to measure correctly the ones created by the atmosphere. The solution proposed with the mechanical design could pave theway for further study in the domain. The Adaptive Optics with a single laser guide star is complicated, especially for a telescope with the size of the ELT. Using a laser guide star instead of a natural one creates additional complications that need to be solved to achieve good performances, especially if only one LGS can be used. The solution proposed would allow to considerably increase the sky coverage of the system, which is currently limited to few percents with the SCAO system. However, further studies need to be done, such as the evaluation of the real impact of the NGS magnitude on the system performances, or the design of the complete and realistic mechanical design.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

However, their design poses great challenges, since an offshore structure is subjected to combined wind and wave dynamic loading that is characteristic of the installation site and play an important role on the fatigue failure of the wind turbine structure.<br/><br/>One part of specific interest for the fatigue assessment of a wind turbine is the way that the transition piece is connected to monopile. Since now, grouted and bolted connections are commonly used, but their many drawbacks regarding their performance inspired Fistuca BV to invent a new type of connection, the wedge connection, in order to increase the fatigue life of the wind turbine structures and decrease simultaneously their construction and installation cost. More specifically, a basic flange with inclined planes is attached on the top of the<br/>monopile and a more complex one (fork-shaped flange) is fitted to the bottom of the transition piece. Inclined dowels are used to connect the two flanges and secure the structure. The final positioning of the dowels is achieved by applying external pressure on the back side of them, which is converted to a vertical reaction force between the two flanges through the inclined planes, acting as preload.<br/><br/>The work that will be presented here deals with the fatigue assessment of the wedge connection, and how the presence of the preloading force may affect the fatigue life of it.<br/><br/>A reference wind turbine and a reference location have been selected first, in order to calculate all the fatigue loads resulted on the structure due to wind and wave at the level where the wedge connection has been selected to be located (+4m above the MSL). The concept of damage equivalent loads has been applied. Damage loads due to waves have been calculated in the frequency domain, while damage loads due to wind have been handled in the time domain due to strongest non-linearities in the rotor aerodynamics. The process of damage<br/>loads’ calculation was carried out using MATLAB.<br/><br/>Once the loads have been calculated, the 3D CAD design software of SOLIDWORKS is used to design all the components of the wedge connection and assemble them to their final position. To facilitate the design process and reduce the computational time, the flange connection is reduced to a single wedge segment, on which the highest stresses are developed. Two load cases are examined for each one of the above resulted damage loads: one with preload and another one without preload. For the purpose of this thesis, xx MPa external pressure has been applied for the final positioning of dowels in case of preload. ANSYS Workbench has been used for the finite element analysis. Nominal stresses are calculated and based on selected S-N curves for both DNV-GL codes and Eurocode 3 and by making use of the Miner’s rule, the damage and the fatigue life of the connection is calculated. The selection of the appropriate<br/>S-N curve for each load case and for each component of the connection, has been based on results from test specimens.<br/><br/>A parametric study has been carried out as well, in order to check several parameters that may affect both the accuracy of the finite element analysis and the stress development on the connection, and as a result the damage and the fatigue life of it.","Wedge connection; Fatigue; Offshore wind turbine; Damage equivalent loads; Wind loading; Wave loading","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-12-13","","","","","",""

Marco Reijne developed a mechanical model in which a vault can be simulated. During my thesis, as a follow up on the research of Reijne, several improvements have been made to the model. A method has been developed to include vaulting poles with a variable stiffness. A variable stiffness vaulting pole could influence the flight path of the vaulter. It also has an effect on the weight distribution of the pole. Furthermore, an axial spring was added to the pole at different locations. At pole-planting box impact, a significant amount of energy is dissipated. An axial spring reduces the amount of energy loss. The feasibility of this innovation has been reviewed. <br/>Among other factors, the technique of the vaulter determines if a vault is successful. The control strategy of the athlete has been optimized for various vaulting poles. To conclude, the results of this research show that there is still room for improvement in pole vaulting performance.","Pole Vault; Variable stiffness; spring","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

The project aims to find new ways of helping in the informal domain in order to extend the services provided by WeHelpen, and to consider the interests of the stakeholders and members comprising cooperation WeHelpen. By doing so, it anticipates the desire to innovate in the informal helping context as researched in The Netherlands. A new angle on the interest group has been established, focusing on a type of behavior perceived as confused, rather than the underlying mental reasons for this confusion. This report presents the proposal doordraaischijf which is developed for cooperation WeHelpen. A first overview of the main elements of the product-service combination can be seen in here, accompanied by a brief summary. <br/><br/>This proposal will be elaborated on in more detail throughout the report, as well as the reasoning behind the embodiment and development. The project approach is a “lean” version of Vision in Product Design. It is an adaptation using specifically the context projection element to place an intervention in a future context. The researched contexts are presented. In the following chapters, different aspects of the design will be further elaborated on, and as of why this intervention is appropriate for the context of confusion. The proposal chapter will feature different aspects of the design are the interactions that are taking place, the context of use, the underlying working principles, shape, form, color, material, and finish. In the arguments, the reasoning behind elements of the development is explained additionally. The co-creation sessions with experiential experts are explained in the chapter focus group results. The relevancy for stakeholders of WeHelpen, the users, as well as society as a whole is argued. The user evaluation chapter presents the study conducted to answer the research question if people who should carry the intervention are able to formulate the scenarios and instructions related to their confusion. The journey-chapter focuses on the process in chronological order, also explaining the steps which did not contribute to the final proposal directly, but had influence on the process. A personal reflection considering several themes of the graduation project are included. The references present all the literature, multimedia publications, and the professionals which have been interviewed. The appendices provide insight in the materials that evoked insights as well as the results that served as a foundation for argumentation. <br/><br/>The doordraaischijf is a handheld disc which allows carriers to communicate their needs in a moment of confusion to others. The specific shape is a reference to a parking disc, except this disc has two sides that hold content. One side (orange) holds the scenarios the carrier has formulated related to confusion, while the other side (purple) displays the appropriate instruction to the helping hand for improving the situation. A digital platform complements the physical presence of the disc.<br/><br/>The carriers are people prone to confusion; those with a history of confused behavior or a higher chance of developing confused behavior. As people in confusion might be temporarily unable to formulate those needs, the disc holds predefined personalized scenarios and corresponding instructions for improving those situations. <br/><br/>A lot of people would like to help another who might be in confusion, but do not know how to intervene. This disc provides a perspective for action to the helping hand: the personalized instructions assist the helper in offering the appropriate help. The helping hand can be anyone that passes by. <br/>A carrier will rotate the insert disc to select the unfolding scenario in relation to confusion. The helping hand will consider the appropriate instruction on the other side of the casing, which is automatically and synchronously displayed when the carrier selects the scenario. The instructions are formulated personally by the carrier at a different moment in time, so the helper can rely on the content. This is also a safeguard for the intervention, as people in confusion might voice different options than when they are in a more accountable mental state. The instructions will leave room for interpretation by the helping hand, as the personal considerations as well as the variables surrounding the moment influence the interaction.<br/><br/>The digital platform facilitates all the support interactions. It allows for the creation of the personal content as well as the production and delivery. The helping hand can instigate contact through a personal connect code at a convenient moment.","Social Design; Context projection; Co-creation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

Due to it high toxicity to its removal is very essential. There are many removal technologies for the removal of arsenic such as adsorption, coagulation-filtration, membrane filtration, ion exchange and precipitation. Adsorption is one such technology which is mainly used as it’s a very simple technique. the extent of adsorption is affected by pH, nature of the adsorbent, surface area of the adsorbents. Iron is widely used for the removal of Arsenic from groundwater. The iron which is present in dissolved form in groundwater needs to first get oxidised to hydrous ferric oxides as flocs which provide adsorption sites for arsenic. In this study the effect of pH and Iron dosage on the arsenic removal by adsorption with the available dissolved Iron in the groundwater. The effect of pH on arsenic removal by floc formation of iron with a series of Jar tests were done for Arsenite and Arsenate. Also, the removal of arsenic in a multilayer sand bed (3 layers with Anthracite, Sand and Garnet) was evaluated at three different pH. It was found that pH plays a very important role on Arsenic removal. Arsenite removal was increased with pH whereas Arsenate removal decreased with increase in pH. At pH 5 and at high Fe concentrations, the removal decreases but the effective iron or the iron that flocculated to greater than 0.45µm was quite similar. This was also seen in the particle counter analysis. Iron concentration of 5mg/l was enough to remove Arsenate upto 90% whereas Arsenite needed higher doses of upto 20mg/l to reach 90%. Clear increase in the flocculation was observed in particle counts with the increase of iron concentration. Before the dosing of Iron Arsenic oxidation was seen in the filter bed maybe due to the presence of Arsenic Oxidising Bacteria (AOB). High oxidation efficiency was seen Sand and Garnet layer. The oxidation of Arsenite to Arsenate before dosing iron in the filter was less at pH 8. High resistance was observed in the filter bed within 3 days after backwashing although the removal was quite stable in the three days. After dosing of Iron, high removal of arsenic was seen in Anthracite layer due to the high adsorption of Iron in the Anthracite layer.","Arsenic; Adsorption; Sand Filtration","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","","CIE 5050-09",""

This has economical, environmental and health implications in this area. This event mainly occurs between December to March. The objective of this report is to map the plastic waste problem in Southwest Bali and look for efficient solutions to mitigate plastic washing ashore at its beaches. To reach this objective the main drivers for the plastic waste accumulation are investigated. Furthermore, research on the distribution and composition is provided. The local waste management system and its shortcomings are assessed. Personal waste treatment is analyzed using a survey. Background information on the problem was gathered with the use of a literature study and area analysis. A conceptual model is introduced to reach the research objective. This conceptual model is a schematization, in order to better understand the research area and the behavior of the plastic in the case area. In order to quantify the model further research is required. This consist of four research disciplines. Namely, ocean, boundaries and bottom; river measurements; beach measurements and waste management &amp; social studies. Via literature studies and interviews, research on the ocean, boundaries and bottom is performed. Three rivers where measured over the course of 2 months. Research was done to determine river parameters. Plastics were caught by a manta trawl and visual waste counting was performed to understand the plastic flux in rivers. Research on the beaches was done on the composition and quantity of various plastic sources namely oceanic, terrestrial and river inputs. Via interviews with local stakeholders the waste management system the case area is mapped. With the use of a survey, personal awareness and motivation among plastic pollution is analyzed. The plastic accumulation is largely dependent on the climate and local waste treatment. As waste management facilities are lacking and local awareness and motivation is limited, large quantities of plastic enter local rivers. Together with increased rain conditions large quantities of plastic end up in the ocean. Wind then transports plastic waste towards the beaches. This debris is mainly 'pushed' towards the beaches in Southwest Bali due to the coastal shape. During the research single use plastics are found to be the most common plastic type. Four solutions are proposed to reduce the plastic accumulation in the beaches of Southwest Bali. Intercepting plastics in rivers prevents further dispersion into the ocean and thus limits plastics accumulating on the beaches. Improved waste management could tackle the source of plastics pollution and reduce the amount of plastics entering our nature. Increased education on plastic pollution can result in improved personal waste management, especially in remote areas. As a lot of stakeholders are involved in the problem an improved communication network is desired in order to achieve a combined goal and work more efficiently.","Plastic; pollution","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","Pantai Project | Multidisciplinary Project",""

This lack often originates in the design phase due to the separation of the design and construction teams. A promising technology to enhance interaction is Augmented Reality (AR). AR can increase interaction by providing visualisations of high quality models and information. Previous research into AR applications is often theoretical or concerns other industries. This research tried to fill this research gap by analysing the theoretical and practical effects of two AR environments; an AR scale model and an AR 1:1 model. A literature review analysed which aspects of interaction were present in the AR conditions and how these aspects could, in theory, be affected by the use of AR. With this knowledge, an experimental set-up and evaluation framework were created. Experiments were performed to test how project teams reacted and perceived the technology. <br/>The outcome of the research creates insight into the usability of AR in the design process and the benefits and possible pitfalls of adopting AR, on the interaction within the design team. With this knowledge, AR applications can be developed more specified to the design process of construction projects and companies can apply AR more effectively. The results demonstrated that the use of AR can bring several benefits to the interaction within a project team. Though, important factors influence the occurrence of positive effects which underlines the need for further research and more real-life experiments for the development and adoption of AR as a design environment.","Augmented Reality; Construction; Design environment; Team interaction; Design process","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

This twomonth research focuses on one of the largest Caribbean beach tourism hotspots found in Varadero, Cuba. <br/><br/>Tourism along the Hicacos peninsula has been on the rise and will continue to do so. The Oasis beach hotel is capitalizing on this trend by building a larger new hotel. However, no characteristic flat white coral beach is present in front of it. Tourist demand is greatly driven by the presence of such a beach. Year-round erosion was verified to be partly caused by a blocking of longshore sediment transport. <br/><br/>The local harbour groyne at the eastern beach section was found to be responsible for this but may not be adapted, as it is a necessity for the harbour entrance. Demolition of existing hydraulic structures, construction of a groyne at the westward boundary and sand nourishing are proposed as a zero-solution to ensure sufficient beach width (40 metres) at the 800-metre coastal segment. <br/>Durability is not achieved through this zero-solution as the average lifetime between maintenance nourishments is smaller than one year. <br/> <br/>This result shows that successful development of the Oasis beach sector can only be achieved by considering cross-shore erosion processes as well. An important aspect of the cross-shore transport was expected to be the effect of tropical storms on Oasis beach. To ensure the safety of tourists in storm conditions, an assessment of the infrastructure was required. <br/><br/>A multidisciplinary path was chosen to ensure safety of inhabitants, tourists and capital, especially during hurricanes. Flood safety, coastal engineering, transport and infrastructure form the core pillars of the research. Two distinct events were simulated to determine the morphodynamical response of the Oasis beach, namely hurricanes Wilma (2005) and Irma (2017). Both affected the northern coast of Cuba greatly, but passed Varadero from opposite directions. A general hurricane scenario was tested in evacuation assessments of the entire peninsula, which has just one exit road. Furthermore, the capacity of the current evacuation scheme was projected on the expected population and tourists visiting the peninsula in 2048. <br/><br/>Proposed coastal solutions were the construction of a submerged breakwater along the entire length of the beach, an artificial reef or a combination of the two. Normal, cold front and hurricane conditions were imposed upon these structures using XBeach software to test their performance. The subsequent infrastructural safety of the hinterlands was modelled using Simio software. <br/><br/>Results yielded good performance of the artificial reef against structural erosion from both the normal north-eastern wave climate and the northern cold front waves. The submerged breakwater performed better in hurricane conditions though extension of both groynes was found necessary to keep sediments within the Oasis beach system. <br/><br/>A multi criteria analysis was used to determine the best coastal intervention given the project requirements. Initially, no financial motives were used to determine the optimal solution. The results of this analysis stated a preference for the installation of an artificial reef. Its added recreational value was not quantified and thus not discounted from the initial investment. In detailed design, cost estimations of all viable design alternatives showed that the rtificial reef was also a relatively affordable option. <br/><br/>The final recommended design that ensures beach durability thus consists of: demolition of weathered hydraulic structures, western groyne placement, initial nourishment, artificial reef deployment and maintenance nourishment for a 30-year lifetime. A modelling of the definitive design with, also including the vegetation of the dunes indicated the Oasis beach section to be flood safe. <br/><br/>The total cost of this intervention amounts to approximately $900,000 and takes 28 months to complete. If monitored well, the artificial reef will increase its coastal defence capacities and functionality is expected to exceed the 30-year lifetime. <br/><br/>Recommendations regarding storm safety also include the evacuation process of tourists during the extreme hurricane conditions, on which the coastal design was based. Various projections of the growth of the number of tourists on the Hicacos peninsula have been simulated in a Simio evacuation transport model. The model indicated that even for the largest projected growth of tourism in Varadero, the infrastructure suffices and using a 50:50 ratio between evacuees being transported in buses and cars, it is possible to evacuate the peninsula in twenty-four hours. <br/><br/>To be able to evacuate using this optimal ratio, an increase in car ownership in Cuba is required before 2048, as a shortage exists in the current situation. Therefore, the peninsula is still considered storm-safe, but monitoring of the actual increase in tourists is advised. <br/><br","Coastal development; Storm safety; Infrastructural assets; System engineering","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Transport, Infrastructure and Logistics","",""

SBWDCEs are able to gather a larger number of stated choice observations from fewer respondents, while RRM models challenge the notion of fully compensatory behaviour implied by the traditional RUM model and suggest that consumers choose to minimise regret. According to image theory, best and worst choices are not made with the same kind of decision rule, so accounting for that variability using a RRM model would produce a more realistic model with better model fit. Estimating the combined model proves that people do in fact use a compensatory decision rule when selecting the best alternatives and a semi- to non-compensatory decision rule when selecting the worst. The results also show that the way choice set size variation is accounted for can greatly impact the scale parameters, as these and the choice set size constants are inversely related. Although a better model fit was achieved, using best-worst tasks is contested and researchers also warn against the lower reliability of additional choices in the same choice set. Nevertheless, SBWDCEs provide great benefits in fields with small population sizes and can potentially help in obtaining higher quality prior parameter values for use in efficient experimental design generation.","Discrete Choice Modelling; Random Regret Minimisation; Sequential Best Worst Discrete Choice Experiments; Public Transport","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Transport, Infrastructure and Logistics","",""

(mentor); Krenn, Rainer (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","Nowadays, a satellite is considered as out of range forever once it is launched. This may soon no longer hold thanks to on-orbit servicing. However, the complexity of that topic makes it highly challenging on many aspects. On-orbit servicing using a robotic arm is nonetheless the most investigated technology in order to achieve the berthing of two satellites in orbit. This research project aims at developing a robust controller for the deployment of a robotic arm, which is mounted on a servicer satellite, and for the reaching of a defined handle on the target satellite under mission constraints. While operating the space manipulator, the combined control of both the manipulator and the spacecraft base has a great potential in terms of achievable performance and may bring robotic on-orbit servicing one step closer to reality. In order to reveal the potential of this innovative control strategy, a model of the system dynamics was developed, before being used to design a robust controller. The latter was then successfully implemented in different simulators to test its performance and robustness to a variety of constraints including hardware, environment and mission constraints. The simulations proved that combined control can be used for the entire maneuver. Finally, this controller was successfully implemented in the on-board computer of the on-orbit servicing simulator at the German Aerospace Center. From now on, the maneuver can be completed from the ground control room. The implementation of the robust and combined controller has increased the technology readiness level of the reach phase during an on-orbit servicing mission.","space robotics; on-orbit servicing; Control; H-infinity control; Attitude control; Robotics; loop shaping; combined control; robust control","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","RICADOS","48.083443, 11.275638"

This contribution originates from the degeneration of waste in the landfill. The gas which is created during the degeneration consists of 40 to 60% methane. One mole of methane has a global warming potential which is 28 times higher than that of carbon dioxide. Therefore, emissions of methane should be reduced. One method which can be used to reduce this emission is the oxidization of methane to carbon dioxide. This can be done by the construction<br/>of a cover soil with methanotrophic bacteria in the soil. These bacteria oxidize methane as their source of carbon and energy. This oxidation process discriminates against the heavier isotopes present in the gas, this shifts the isotope signature. A method to determine the oxidation efficiency of the methane is based on the evaluation of this change in isotope signature over the cover soil. Next to the fractionation of isotopes due to oxidation, fractionation also occurs due to diffusion. However, fractionation due to diffusion is generally<br/>assumed to be negligible. Mostly, this assumption is valid, since the dominant part of transport is advective; which does not discriminate against an isotope.<br/><br/>In this thesis the effect of compaction and saturation on two sands are evaluated. Using this evaluation, the criteria during which diffusion becomes an important transport phenomena are determined. This is determined by a series of experiments, where the concentration of methane is monitored while the gas diffuses through a soil sample. In this thesis the effect of the soil matrix on the fractionation of methane is also evaluated. This is evaluated by performing isotope spectrometry on samples of gas, taken at different times during the experiments. These two aspects are combined to evaluate if the oxidation efficiency can still be determined using fractionation of stable methane isotopes when diffusion plays a considerable role in gas transport.<br/><br/>During the experiments the decrease of methane in the chamber was measured. Spread over two soils, for a total of 18 variations in compaction or saturation the decrease of methane over time was measured. The results of the experiments show that for diffusion no distinction between variation in compaction and saturation needs to be made. Compaction and saturation can be described together for both soils using the air-filled porosity. The relation between the air-filled porosity and the effective diffusion coefficient is linear for both soils. Due to the large sand fraction the share of coarse pores is high for the whole range of compaction, meaning that no significant increase of tortuosity is visible in the relation between air-filled porosity and the effective diffusion coefficient. When the effective diffusion coefficients are compared to effective permeability values of these soils, it showed that the diffusion is more important for drier and more compacted soils. Thus, diffusive transport becomes important for gas transport over a cover soil when the pressures are lower, the soil is drier, and the soil is more compacted. <br/><br/>The fractionation factors due to diffusion, which have been determined for a selection of experiments, showed no trend with any other measured parameters. The precision of the measured values from which the fractionation factors are determined is high. Thus, the confidence in the fractionation factors is high.<br/>The lack of a trend present means that in sand the soil matrix has no effect on the fractionation factor. This means that the fractionation factor due to diffusion in soil is the same as in free air. For the calculation of the oxidation efficiency with a relevant diffusive flux the ratio of diffusive to advective flux needs to be<br/>determined but the fractionation factor due to diffusion is constant. Before the oxidation efficiency can be calculated, first the load needs to be corrected for any loss through hot-spots. Next, the advective flux and diffusive flux are combined, this is done by adding the fluxes together. The fluxes can be added because there are no interdependent effects, each flux only increases the total flux. Thus, the oxidation efficiency can be calculated using the changes in isotope signatures, even when a significant diffusive flux is present.","Diffusion; Fractionation; Landfill","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Only 10 per cent of this total amount has been recycled to date, therefore it was decided to focus on recycling of plastic waste to reduce plastic pollution which negatively impacts life on a global scale. Through an extensive analysis of the recycling context it was found that the biggest problem in plastic recycling is the inability to achieve a constant production of high-quality recyclate. With insufficient knowledge to address this found problem, it was decided to do an internship at Polytential BV, a start-up company located in Delft, the Netherlands. Their innovative product the Virtual Chemist, a device that analyses the composition of plastic waste up to 98,5 per cent accuracy, enables mechanical recyclers and compounders to analyse large volumes of plastic waste.<br/>The solution will facilitate a transition towards a data-driven recycling industry, increasing profitability in processing plastic waste by providing the industry with accurate and representative composition data, as processing large volumes is currently not possible. However, The Virtual Chemist was still in an early development stage (MVP) and required further development to be presented to clients as a sellable product (MMP). This was done by addressing the user needs and facilitating the right user experience, achieved through an analysis of the context, user, current system, and workflow to define a baseline for this project. Additionally, each step was completed by focussing on the user interaction and experience. The analysis results were used to formulate a design brief, which defined the goal and direction for the ideation and conceptualisation of the product. This report presents a summary of the completed design process, research findings, and concludes with recommendations that focus on further development of the Virtual Chemist.","Recycling; Plastic Waste; Plastic pollution; Virtual Chemist; Design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

In the context of coastal zone management, process-based morphodynamic models are often used topredict coastline evolution and support the decision-making process for adaptation/mitigation strategies. Frequently, the processes driving themorphodynamic evolution transcend the applicability limits of a single model. In those cases, model ensembles can be used to estimate coastline change under the joint effect of the relevant processes. However, model output and in extent the aggregated result are characterised by uncertainty originating among others from forcing variability and parameter imprecision. The increasing exposure ofc oastal societies to coastal recession risks and emergence of risk-informed coastal zone management create the need for aggregated coastal recessionestimates with quantified uncertainty. This study investigates different statistical methods for forcing and parameter uncertainty quantification around coastline change estimates from process-based morphodynamic models. Subsequently a numerical convolution approach for the aggregation of the probabilistic coastal recession estimates from multiple models was formulated to account for the combined uncertain effect of processes acting on different timescales. The methods of this study were applied on Anmok beach, South Korea, a coastal stretch experiencing erosion caused by long, intermediate and short timescale processes. Available UNIBEST-CL+ and Delft3D model schematizations from theCoMIDAS research program, capable of simulating the relevant processes, were utilised. Following a literature review, two methods were considered applicable for process-based morphodynamic models: Standard Monte Carlo (SMC) and Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS). The application of both methods on the UNIBEST-CL+model schematisation enabled the evaluation of their relative performance based on the precision of the different coastline change estimates achieved for the different sample sizes. Only LHS was applied on the Delft3D model schematisation due to computational demands limitations. Subsequently,the scenario-based approach currently used for the aggregation of multi-modelcoastline change outputs was extended to explicitly account for the uncertainties quantified in the individual model outputs. A numerical convolution approach, using Monte Carlo sampling, was suggested for linear super position of the contributing probability distribution functions. The advantages of this approach include speed, ease of implementation,comprehensibility and high resolution even at the tails of the aggregated distributions. Utilising this approach, the effect of alternative interventions (combinations of various breakwater designs with a small-scale nourishment) on the coastline change probabilities was quantified. The results showed that both methods (i.e., SMC and LHS) with adequate sampling can produce probability distribution outputs for coastline change when applied to the process-based models. SMC remains the most suitable method for coastline change uncertainty quantification for models with small simulation durations. The method gives quantified estimates of the precision, enabling the achievement specific target precisions, with the respective computational cost. For the smaller sample sizes used, LHS gave better precision results, proving more suitable for models with longer computational time. On the downside, without extra iterations of the procedure only upper estimates of the achieved precision for a specific sample size can be obtained. The probabilistic aggregation framework presented in this thesis has several advantages compared to the scenario-based approach currently used. It allowsfor quantified coastline change uncertainty estimates with the respective precision estimates and provides the distribution of the uncertainty across its range, information that could not be derived using the scenario-based approach. Different coastline change percentile estimates or confidence intervals with practical use to decision makers and the likelihood of any coastline change realisation of interest can be evaluated. The probabilistic uncertainty quantification and aggregation framework is believed to be useful for intervention assessment and comparison. It allows for the assessment of uncertainty around the morphological response under the combined effect of the processes acting on the coast with/without the intervention and thus the evaluation of the probabilistic intervention impact. Different interventions can be compared in terms of the probability of inducing desired/undesired morphodynamic realisations as well as in terms of the uncertainty range in the coastline change estimates.","uncertainty; uncertainty propagation; coastline position; Monte Carlo; Latin Hypercube; convolution; aggregation; precision; uncertainty quantification; coastline change","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","","37.773753, 128.947159"

Despite the extensive research on the behaviour of peat during the last 50 years, the vast majority of the attention was devoted to the volumetric behaviour. Only few attempts are reported to model the deviatoric behavior of peat, which is fundamental in many geotechnical applications as dykes founded on peat layers. This Thesis represents an attempt to understand the current knowledge on the deviatoric behaviour of peat with the aid of an hierarchical simple elasto-plastic model.<br/><br/>The constitutive model was conceptually developed aiming for the use of a limited number of parameters with an easy way of determination. This choice aligns with the needs of engineering practice, which demands the use of models with few and comprehensive parameters. The constitutive ingredients of the model have been derived from direct experimental evidences. The model requires 10 parameters, 5 out of them are the classical parameters of the well-known Modified Cam-clay model.\\<br/>\\<br/>The high compressibility of the peat along with its high friction angle intensify the end restraints occurring due to the platens of triaxial apparatus. In order to account for the effects of the boundaries, the constitutive model has been implemented in the Finite Element Programme LAGAMINE and the tests have been simulated as Boundary Value Problems. The model is in qualitative agreement with the experimental data and, in particular, with quantitative agreement until 20\% of strain for the case of consolidated drained triaxial tests. To be able to reproduce properly the case of consolidated undrained triaxial tests which impose an isochoric response, one parameter associated with the flow rule of the model should be changed. This change of a parameter is related to the fact that the fibers in the peat specimen are not considered explicitly in the constitutive equations, although they can alter the deformational response of peat under some kinematic constraints and influence the mechanical response in a predominant way at high strain levels.<br/><br/>Overall, the constitutive model developed in this Thesis gives good quantitative results until 20\% of axial strain. Further research on the influence of fibers on the response of peat under different strain paths and on the consequent matrix-fiber interaction should be done in order to have a model with predictive capabilities until high strain levels.<br","peat; constitutive modeling; organic soils; Modified Cam clay","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geo-Engineering","",""

This does not go unnoticed by regulators, that develop and enforce tighter requirements towards organisations. Simultaneously, outsourcing relationships develop and offshoring as well as nearshoring are still popular among cost-optimisation methods. While many security methods are discovered and developed and numerous standards and best practices exist that talk about information security management systems, there is only limited literature on how to develop and implement these controls so that they bring the expected value. The goal of this research was to present guidelines for designing and implementing information security management system controls on basis of identified risks and issues with controls existing at the time. This was to support existing financial institutions with improving their internal controls for information security when engaging in offshoring relationships. The goal was achieved through qualitative methods: case study observation followed by a questionnaire that was distributed among and answered by information security advisors and specialists with extensive experience in financial sector. Case study is a Swiss globally operating bank that outsources its processes to a number of offshore and nearshore locations. The bank has had a number of controls and processes already well established at the time of the research. This research confirms that financial institutions face various obstacles and issues at different phases of offshoring. The most commonly identified included: dispersed responsibilities, issues arising at the time of offshoring that could be identified prior to decision to outsource and finally – lack of power to enforce technical controls over vendors. The guidelines developed include but are not limited to: focus on additional areas when preparing for offshoring initative, establishing and defining responsibilities across different teams in the organisation and with the vendor and defining detailed contractual clauses. The findings from this thesis also open opportunities for further research – to investigate the relationship between these guidelines and efficiency of information security management system or to quantify impact of these guidelines in order to prioritise them.

The use of social cues in nonverbal human-human communication has been identified as a reliable source of information to determine if a person is engaged. These social cues can be used not only to understand more about human behavior, but also to design robot behaviors that can successfully draw the attention of humans. In this project we look to investigate what are effective techniques to draw attention and elicit initial engagement with a social robot at the entrance of a building. The robot proposed to display these behaviors is the humanoid robot Pepper, from SoftBank Robotics, as it has been specifically designed for human-robot interaction. Initially, the on-board functionalities of the robot are going to be tested. Secondarily, state-of-the-art techniques are going to extend those functionalities to improve Pepper's interactive skills. Eventually, robot behaviors are going to be designed and displayed to participants during an experiment. We aim at understanding the reactions of people to identify the most effective drawing attention behaviors and examine if the encounter with the robot is affected by a novelty effect. Different metrics are proposed to measure both these phenomena in our results.

To increase plan standardization, we clinically use Pinnacle's autoplanner for several disease sites. However, this introduces new challenges: first, the autoplanner is not perfect and still requires substantial interaction from the radiotherapy technician (RTT). Second, it is difficult to judge whether a plan has indeed the most optimal trade-o_ between cure and toxicity, since the RTT has not worked the plan. Knowledge-based planning (KBP) could serve as a quality assurance tool to resolve these problems. It uses historical data (anatomical and dosimetric) from previous plans, to predict the likely dose distribution for the current patient. In this study, we construct an initial, simplistic KBP model that serves as the clinical practice. We then investigate of a variety of KBP modelling approaches to predict rectum dose-volume histograms (DVHs), in order to complement the current clinical practice in prostate cancer. Methods:  For model evaluation, we formulate a clinical tolerance criterion (TC) bandwidth based on a ground-truth set of existing radiotherapy plans. We evaluate on the overall prediction accuracy (RMS), the fraction of correctly predicted DVH bins (TC<sub>α</sub>), anαd on the fraction of patients that have ≥ 90% of their DVH correctly predicted (TC<sub>β</sub>). We use the overlap volume histogram (OVH) to encode for organ geometrical information, and use reduced order modelling (ROM) to capture the most important characteristics of the DVH and OVH. Optimization methods we use are Principal Component Analysis (PCA) eigenvalue RMS minimization, direct DVH RMS minimization, and TC<sub>α</sub> and TC<sub>β</sub> maximization. Results:  Analyses of the KBP clinical practice yielded training and testing errors of 81.4% and 80.8% for TC<sub>α</sub> and 53.3% and 51.1% for TC<sub>β</sub><sub/>, with an RMS of 4.80 and 4.94 volume percentage [%]. Eigenvalue-optimization resulted TC<sub>α</sub> of 86.5% and 82.4%, and TC<sub>β</sub> of 68.8% and 59.1%, with respective RMS of 2.82 % and 3.22 %. Direct DVH-optimization yielded TC<sub>α</sub> of 86.7% and 81.9%, and TC<sub>β</sub> of 69.4% and 61.4%, with similar RMS. TC<sub>α</sub> and TC<sub>β</sub> maximizers resulted TC<sub>α</sub> training and testing errors of 92.1% and 78.5%, and TC<sub>β</sub> training and testing errors of and 84.3% and 53.4% respectively. Discussion:  The investigated models yielded significant improvements for direct eigenvalue- and DVH optimization methods. We have also been able to perform optimizations for the clinical goal metrics, showing promising results in training data. Because TC<sub>α</sub>- and TC<sub>β</sub>- maximizers were unable generalize to perform well for unseen data, it is believed these metrics are too sensitive to be trained reliably, and more consistent data may be required for these optimizers to produce reliable test errors. Based on our findings, we advice the clinical practice to extend KBP-approaches to optimize for DVH-least squares.","Radiotherapy; Machine learning; Dose-volume histogram; Overlap-volume histogram","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Biomedical Engineering | Medical Physics","",""

Rivers, sea and meteorology all influence the lagoon, variable over the year, resulting in a complex situation. To protect this area, it is crucial to know how different hydrological processes, hydrodynamic processes and spatial characteristics influence each other in this context. Using a multidisciplinary approach, this research focused on the question: What is the influence of hydrological and hydrodynamic processes on spatial characteristics of Terminos Lagoon, now and in the future? The study has shown that evaporation has a larger part in the water balance during dry season, where during other seasons the water balance is similar to the annual mean. It is found that the western part of Terminos Lagoon shows different characteristics<br/>than the eastern part, as river discharge plays a larger role in the western part of the lagoon. Secchi depth, temperature, dissolved oxygen, sediments and salinity are all different here compared to the eastern part of the lagoon. Salinity and river discharge, as well as air and water temperatures, show to be highly correlated. A tidal watershed divides the lagoon in two approximately equal areas, following the mentioned separation of east and west. Residual currents flow along the boundaries of the lagoon from east to west. A circular<br/>residual current in the lagoon is observed near the Puerto Real inlet in created temperature and Secchi depth maps.

The computational prediction of boundary layer transition in engineering applications is typically based on empirical models. These models require experimental measurements for calibration and validation purposes. For unsteady aerodynamic processes, the range of suitable boundary layer transition measurement techniques is traditionally limited to fast-response discrete sensor techniques, e.g. hot-film anemometry. Introduced in 2014, differential infrared thermography is an alternative approach to measuring unsteady boundary layer transition using thermal images acquired with an infrared camera. The application of this optical measurement technique reduces the experimental effort, but problems emerge when the temperature response of the surface under investigation is slower than the aerodynamic unsteadiness. The idea of differential infrared thermography is to evade this problem by subtracting subsequent thermographs and accrediting the largest difference to the moving boundary layer transition location. The working principle of the technique has been demonstrated in various experimental setups. In a heat transfer simulation, it has been shown that the image separation time between the subtracted thermographs should be as small as possible to avoid systematic measurement errors. An experimental validation of these results is performed in the present study, conducted at the DLR in Göttingen. In this study, the infrared radiation from a pitching airfoil model suction surface in the wind tunnel at Ma = 0.15 and Re = 1 ⋅ 10^6 is measured with an infrared camera. The pitching frequencies f and amplitudes a_1 are varied in a range from f = 0.25 Hz to f = 8 Hz and a_1 = 1° to a_1 = 8° to study their effects on the boundary layer transition measurements. The differential infrared thermography technique is applied with several different image separation time steps to confirm the findings of the heat transfer simulation. The time step size is optimized as a compromise between the measurement error and the signal strength. In the next step, two alternative boundary layer transition measurement schemes using infrared thermography are developed, based on a quasi-steady model and a heat transfer simulation result. The first newly developed approach involves the automated selection of the appropriate image separation time step for each data point over the motion period when applying differential infrared thermography. This adaptive approach outperforms the conventional fixed time step approach when applied to experimental data from the wind tunnel test. The second newly developed approach is termed local infrared thermography. When analyzing the thermographic measurement results at fixed model locations, the extraction of the extrema of the measured radiation signal yields instants of the motion period that correlate with the occurrence of boundary layer transition. It is demonstrated that the local infrared thermography approach can be extended to measuring two-dimensional boundary layer transition fronts. The analysis of these results provides insight into the origins of the differences between the results of differential infrared thermography and the reference measurements of the unsteady boundary layer transition location with a fast-response technique.","Boundary Layer Transition; Unsteady Aerodynamics; Pitching Airfoil; Wind Tunnel Experiment; Measurement Technique","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Their study through numerical approaches such as CFD are of great interest for this sector, and understanding how to control them is key to the evolution of the industry. In this work, we present an experimental method to generate quasi-2D flows and study fluid structure interactions thanks to the use of a soap film channel and a high-speed video camera. A simple test case is presented, introducing the fluid structure instability affecting a structure composed of a rigid cylinder with a flexible silk filament attached to its rear end. A complete description of the soap filmchannel is given. Explanations on how to build the apparatus, the required lighting and recording conditions as well as the fluid to be used are also provided. A set of relevant post-processing tools including a vortex shedding frequency analysis method and a position tacking algorithm are given to extract critical information from the experimental video recordings. A theoretical model was constructed in order to predict the effect of the fluid structure instability on our test case and compare its results to the experimental data obtained with the soap film. The model proved itself to be particularly relevant for the static analysis of the phenomenon, and predicts the stationary instability affecting the average position of the filament with precision. Unlike existing models, it takes into account the action of the stiffness of the filament and provides a better description of the phenomenon. However, its simplistic construction and the strong hypothesis prevent the dynamic results to be efficiently used. We highlight the advantages and the relevance of the soap film channel to obtain experimental data in quasi-2D conditions, and provide guidance for future researchers to use this technique.","Fluid Structure Interaction; soap film; Experimental study","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Hereby an intake structure, such as a velocity cap, can be used to take in water from the sea. These intakes are open seafloor founded constructions mounted at a water depth ranging between 10 and 20 meters. In order to design such an intake cap in an offshore environment, the action of waves and in general of unsteady flows is the most important design load to be accounted for. This thesis has the aim to investigate the nature of the forces and turning moment acting on the structure in presence of waves and to provide tools, in the form of hydrodynamic coefficients, that can be used to compute the design loads. The analysis is based at first on experimental records collected during a previous campaign including force measurements and PIV recordings. The measurements are then used to validate a CFD model in OpenFOAM. Structure-induced turbulence is shown to be fundamental to define the total loads on the structure in the numerical model. The use of a turbulence closure is in fact observed to be needed in order to come to a validation of the CFD model. Even if the flow separation around the cap is not always accurately predicted, the peak of the inline force is estimated by the model with an error of 8%. In the case of the vertical load the error observed reaches up to 15% but part of the mismatch is attributed to a bias in the experimental records. The CFD tool is then used to generate additional test cases on solitary waves and regular waves in order to expand the scope of this research. The hydrodynamic force coefficients are defined fitting both the experimental records and the load estimates of the numerical model by means of the weighted least squares method. The inline force characterization follows the theory of the Morison equation which is shown to provide a good fit in all analyzed cases. Good agreement is found between numerical and experimental results with regards to the estimate of the inertia coefficient while the numerical estimate of the drag coefficient is up to 19 % lower than the experimental estimate. Vertical force and overturning moment signals are originally fitted with the most common formulas used in literature which however produced poor fits to the force and moment signals. New equations are suggested therefore to come to a better characterization of these loads. The best fits for the vertical force are found with an equation that includes the effect of the horizontal drag, the vertical drag and of the vertical inertia, while in the case of the turning moment the best fits are obtained with a combination of horizontal drag, vertical drag, horizontal inertia and vertical inertia.","Intake structure; Velocity cap; CFD; OpenFOAM; Morison's equation; hydrodynamic forces","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

The legislation on offshore pipeline decommissioning in the Dutch North Sea is currently unclear. The Minister can decide whether pipelines are to be removed or are allowed in situ. In situ decommissioning is considered unwanted by major external stakeholders. Besides, the pipeline owner holds an extensive liability for the pipeline after decommissioning. Full removal options, on the other hand, are accompanied with large environmental, technical and financial impact. This graduation thesis Accelerated pipeline degradation aims to investigate how accelerated degradation of steel can contribute to offshore pipeline decommissioning. By accelerated degradation it is aspired to limit the environmental impact and seabed disturbance. Furthermore, the costs and technical impact can be reduced. After evaluating the current decommissioning methods, a series of alternative options is assessed. The assessment has resulted in a further investigation of galvanic corrosion for steel degradation. With this investigation, it is aspired to evaluate the mechanism of galvanic corrosion to accelerate the corrosion of the steel pipeline. By doing so, the liability period at the sea bottom would decrease dramatically with respect to in situ decommissioning. The materials that could be applicable for galvanic coupling were considered. Due to its high standard potential and low costs, the use of graphite (carbon) is determined to be most suitable. Subsequently, several small-scale tests on low carbon steel. In a laboratory setting the galvanic corrosion of steel was investigated by coupling steel samples to carbon electrodes. Coupling with platinum electrodes is also tested to provide reference scenarios. The results of the tests show an increase of corrosion current with addition of a galvanic couple. However, with increasing cathodic surface the steel dissolution is limited by corrosion kinetics and diffusion limitations. A preliminary schematisation for implementation is designed. Accordingly, the main challenges are identified. The test results and identified challenges are the motivation for a field test. This field test is to be designed to investigate the potential feasibility issues that arise in the practical situation. Furthermore, the operational challenges can be addressed on the test site.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-11-26","","","","","",""

However, the lack of a consistent framework for this kind of problems has lead to different implementations of the method presented in the literature, each with its own special features. <br/>The main objective of this thesis is to implement a variation of the Particle Finite Element Method and investigate the efficiency of the different features available in literature. <br/><br/>Initially, the meshing procedure of the method was developed, which consists of a Delaunay triangulation for assessing the connectivity of the particles and the ${\alpha}$-shape method for detection of the boundaries of the different domains. This was followed by an investigation on the influence of the related parameter ${\alpha_{lim}}$ on the outcome of the analysis; it appears that this choice has an impact on the results, in terms of the recovered domain volumes and the simulation response; this parameter has to be selected with care, with respect to the nature of the examined problem. Volume variations are also observed, caused by element deletion and/or addition during remeshing, which, eventually, lead to mass oscillations. These effects can be mitigated by either adjusting the value of the ${\alpha_{lim}}$ parameter, refining the particle distribution or prescribing the boundary surface during remeshing, by using a constrained Delaunay triangulation.<br/><br/>Another important feature of the PFEM is the treatment of contact, which is, typically, done in literature via employment of an interface mesh. This mesh is generated during remeshing, using the same scheme as for the regular domain meshes, i.e. a Delaunay triangulation and the ${\alpha}$-shape method, and the generated contact elements are then used to enforce the contact constraints, with a variety of methods. In this work, a simple algorithm that disallows inter-penetration and allows free separation and free movement perpendicular to the contact surfaces was formulated and validated against benchmark solid mechanics problems. The automatic contact detection and interface mesh generation allows for the incorporation of more advanced contact treatment schemes.<br/><br/>Transference of information between successive meshes is important in PFEM for solid mechanics, especially when the history of elemental variables, e.g. stresses, is required for capturing the solid material behavior accurately. The most popular technique is the nodal smoothing technique, where the values are mapped back and forth between the integration points and the particles at each time step; other schemes have been also presented in literature. This scheme has been shown to introduce some smoothing of information, which can be reduced by refining the particle distribution and, in general, does not seem to affect the overall system response significantly. <br/><br/>The developed method was, finally, compared with the available in-house implicit Material Point Method code, which shares the same formulation, on some benchmark quasi-static and dynamic solid mechanics problems. The PFEM demonstrates a more stable behavior in terms of capturing the evolution of stresses and kinematic variables, despite some inaccuracies caused by the smoothing of information and the use of simple, constant-strain triangles. On the other hand, the MPM -in its standard form- exhibits some instabilities in the assembly of equations and stress recovery, which is intensified when cell-crossing occurs, i.e. jumping of material points between elements. <br/>Regarding the computational cost of the two methods, the MPM seems to be faster and require less computer memory for the same number of information points, i.e. particles, with the simulation times, however, increasing exponentially with the number of degrees of freedom.","Particle Finite Element Method; Numerical Modelling; Solid mechanics; Material Point Method; Remeshing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We study an approach that was previously shown to have guarantees of improvement for the LDA classifier in terms of log-likelihood on the full data-set of labeled and unlabeled observations. This method is based on two key concepts: contrast and pessimism. We extend this approach to a broader class of probabilistic generative models, in which the class conditional distributions can be modeled with any parametric class that belongs to the exponential family. In this case, we prove that the classifier is never worse and, under mild assumptions, strictly improves the log-likelihood on the complete data-set. The case of Gaussian densities is analyzed in detail, both for LDA and QDA. Moreover, we study this method in the case of least squares classification. In terms of square loss we prove the contrastive pessimistic classifier is guaranteed not to degrade the performance and, with a further requirement on the data, it strictly outperforms the supervised model. <br/>Finally, we apply contrast and pessimism to the task of parameter estimation of a multivariate Gaussian density in a missing data framework. We fully characterize the case of a missing block of data and we show that a strictly increased likelihood on the complete data-set is obtained for any monotone sample.

Capgemini Invent is evoked by the increased safety measure in the pharmaceutical supply chain. The European legislation: The Falsified Medicine Directive, ensures additional serialisation of medication packaging with QR-codes. This raised the question which stakeholders can be involved in user-centred opportunities these QR-codes have when brought in to the home of patients. With this project, these user-centred opportunities and who and how current and future stakeholders are involved in medication safety and e-Health interventions are explored.<br/><br/>This report describes the user-centred design process that explores opportunities on how patients, taking medication, can be helped in their day to day lives. The research revealed bottlenecks in the medication care process that cause unsafe medication care. Unsafe medication care can cause (preventable) hospitalisation. Research focuses on patients that are most likely to encounter problems due to medication. These are patients with polypharmacy and multi-morbidity, taking medication that influences the cardiovascular system.<br/><br/>Patient group<br/>Five in-depth, semi-structured interviews are done with patients to set up a Patient Journey. This journey illustrated pain points in the patient’s live to do with their medication and care. These were taken on as a design challenge to resolve, namely: <br/>To empower patients in searching for a regimen in which living with medication is not restrictive and to take away strong negative emotion around adjustments to the medication regimen.<br/><br/>The interviews also showed a gap between norms for safe pharmaceutical care, to relieve bottlenecks, and patient’s experience. This project aims to resolve these problems areas from the patient side through patient empowerment. With the four aspects of patient empowerment the following design vision was made: 1) Patients will better understand their responsibilities in keeping and transferring their medication overview. 2) Patients will gain knowledge to engage in a consult conversation about their medication treatment. 3)Patients experience that their home and the consult environment is facilitated for safer medication treatment. 4)Patient experience their healthcare skills regarding their medication treatment are anticipated.<br/><br/>The Zeker App<br/>Trends in the pharmaceutical and healthcare market shows opportunities in using e-Health as a significant part of the solution. The Zeker app embodies e-Health for improved accessibility, effectiveness, efficiency, safety and quality, of medication care for patients. The Zeker app is designed using brainstorming, wireframing and digital user interface mock-ups. For patients with polypharmacy, the Zeker app gives reliable personalised answers in finding a medication regimen. When medication is restrictive it will reduce negative emotion by taking patients seriously and helping in the search as to why and what are alternatives for patients. Knowledge and giving overview empowers patients in increasing medication safety together with their caregivers: <br/><br/>“Together Sure about your medication.”<br/><br/>Stakeholders<br/>The Zeker app operates in the complex pharmaceutical health care network. For concept validation and further research into the future stakeholders in medication safety and e-Health interventions stakeholder interviews are conducted. Representatives of KNMP, NVZ, VIG, BOGIN and the Patient Federation with expertise in this field, were questioned about their opinion of the mock-ups. As well as their organisation’s and other stakeholder’s roles in these kinds of developments. <br/><br/>It was made clear collaboration with many different stakeholders required to get this concept of the ground. Both on an organisational level, like involving branch organisations. As well for utilising existing databases and content as building blocks for the app. This project distinguishes three types of data to consider for collaborative development: static data, resilient data and timely data.<br/><br/>The research puts forth the need for nationally arranged (big) data analysis of medication side-effects. This can be used in pharmaceutical development as well as in improvement and personalisation of medication treatment. It is believed the existing side-effect registration centre Lareb can fulfil this role. By digitising Lareb can expand its data collection and increasingly offer analytics as a service.<br/><br/>The government should increase its efforts towards e-Health acceptance and adoption for both patients and caregivers. Current numbers on use of e-Health show patients are still slow to adopt. Besides, patients are unwilling to pay for e-Health. Therefore, it is expected e-Health will increasingly be reimbursed by health insurance companies.<br/><br/>Viabilty<br/>For the Zeker app, this implies that it should be developed with or by a GP information system provider. Initial data exchange can be set up swiftly. The GP has an overview of all medication which the specialist has not. The GP has the ability to change the prescription, which the pharmacist has not. Reimbursement for e-Health by the GP is already arranged under patient self-monitoring. <br/><br/>With the collaborative development of PGOs and the changes in the financial model towards Value-Based Healthcare it is likely e-Health will soon be reimbursed as a separate type of care transcending individual caregivers. <br/><br/>The last iteration of the Zeker design is based on user-research. Thirteen in scope participants indicated that they understood the app and its four main functions. If it would help or whether they would use it frequently depended on whether they experienced problems with their medication before and if they had not already fixed the problems in another way. These patients also, indicated that they would not pay for such an application unless it needs little effort. When they are clearly shown the benefit as opposed to their current ways of working. The iteration improved the clarity of- and simplified the Zeker app design. Besides this, it was decided to make a clearer distinction between self-measurement and side-effects by adding a menu function.<br","Medication Safety; e-Health; Patient Empowerment","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design | Medisign","",""

Three COFs (TAPB-DMTP 100, TAPB-DMTP 50 and DhaTab 100) had high degree of crystallinity and reasonable BET surface areas (1906, 1952, 437 m2 g-1respectively ).

When run at 0.1C, B3 could deliver 360 mAh g-1 after the first discharge. The fact that IISERP-CON1 delivered the highest capacity must be attributed to the high density of adsorption sites and the strong link in between COF and Li2S that was observed with XPS.

To improve the safety and comfort of the vehicle more focus is put on improving driver assistance systems and also on making the vehicles more autonomous. In order for the safety systems to work properly and also to drive autonomously, it becomes essential that the vehicle has accurate knowledge of all the states of the vehicle. Two of such states are the roll and pitch angle. They are used to correct the images of a stereo camera, in roll control systems and for comfort assessment in autonomous vehicles. <br/><br/>Measuring the roll and pitch angle is in practice problematic. Gyroscopes are mostly used to calculate the roll and pitch angle by integrating the angular rates with respect to time. If low quality gyroscopes are used, this leads to inaccurate calculation of the roll and pitch angle, because the measurements contain noise or bias accumulated during the integration process. To use these low quality gyroscopes, they need to be incorporated in an robust algorithm together with other sensors. Only then the roll and pitch angle can be estimated accurately.<br/><br/>In this thesis a dynamic observer is developed, which has an internal vehicle dynamic model that calculates the tyre forces using an exponential tyre model. The performance of the observer is not only assessed using the true roll and pitch angle, but also compared against the performance of a kinematic observer.<br/><br/>To test the performance of both observers various test manoeuvres were executed in IPG CarMaker, which is a highly advanced vehicle simulation environment. The manoeuvres consisted of rapid steering inputs and hard braking to execute large roll and pitch angles. Sensor noise was added to the inputs of the observers to simulate low quality sensors. In this thesis it has been shown that incorporating dynamics into an observer significantly increases its estimation performance and outperforms the kinematic observer during all manoeuvres when sensor noise was added to the inputs of the observers.<br/> <br/>The contribution of this thesis to the scientific field is that an exponential tyre model is used for the calculation of the roll and pitch angle in the internal vehicle dynamic model of the dynamic observer. Another contribution is that this thesis not only compares the performance of the dynamic observer against the real roll and pitch angles, but also against a kinematic observer, to see what the estimation improvement is when including dynamic relations.<br","state estimation; Kalman Filter; Vehicle dynamics; Automotive","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the electronics industry, the importance of facilitating safe movements is constantly increasing. In order to prevent escalating the chances of damage, products have to be transported with adequate protective layers. Nevertheless, shipments with incomplete packaging are occurring, leading to damaged products arriving at the supplier side. This research aims to explore how can the packaging availability for reverse logistics be optimized in order to reduce the risk of non-repairable parts. Research Approach: The steps of the Lean approach named Define Measure Analyze Design Evaluate (DMADE) will form the backbone of the project. Literature revealed congruence on the fact that Reverse Logistics packaging is a common barrier for establishing efficient return flows. A case study at ASML is performed and the structure of the supply chain and the packaging flows are explained. Next to that, the most relevant product family is identified and the current performance of the system, in terms of packaging availability, is measured. The analysis of the current state, with the usage of 3 Lean tools (VSM-I, TIMWOODS, Ishikawa diagram), follows and based on the analysis outcomes, 9 conceptual designs are introduced in the design phase. In order to eliminate the less relevant ones, a Multi-Criteria Analysis is performed and after the requirement analysis is taken into consideration, the 2 most promising design alternatives are explained in more detail. Lastly, the evaluation phase with the mathematical model comes to assess how well each of the generated scenarios score in the decision parameter criteria. These are the Repair Success Rate, the Financial Performance and the fit with the Lean strategy. Results: After the evaluation took place, it was proved that scenario 1 results in the higher Repair Success Rate (70%), but the associated financial performance of €4,5K is barely positive. This scenario also leads to the shortest replenishment lead times of 45 days and the minimum stock levels. Scenario 3 proves to yield the highest earnings, leading to €485K, with significant tied-up capital release. As for scenario 2, the financial loss of €144K combined with the intermediate lead time and Repair Success Rate of 61% make it less attractive. Finally, scenario 4 is expected to have the highest risk of non-repairable parts (52%) and the greatest lead time of 64 days. Nevertheless, the economic gains of €267K might still place this alternative in the favorable bucket. Conclusion: The risk of supplying vendors with non-repairable parts can be truly alleviated by the installation of inspections gates and more precisely with clean bench equipment. This design will form a structural solution enabling a feedback loop towards the required stakeholders (CS Engineers, Development &amp; Engineering) while allowing at the same time root-cause resolution of the issues found. Clean bench inspections will enable validation of the return quality and also help in addressing the quality gaps. Moreover, the supply of spare packaging materials to the customers’ cleanroom is found to have a considerable positive effect on the reverse operations. Next to that, by rolling-out such a design configuration the intense pressure within the customers’ cleanroom environment will be relieved and thus, the customer satisfaction is expected to rise. Finally, the pro-active interference for investigating the quality of the return flow yields to valuable time savings.","Reverse logistics; Supply Chain Management; Electronics; Value stream mapping; packaging; ASML","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-12-10","","","","Transport, Infrastructure and Logistics","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","Previous years have seen a rise in the use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). Reaching a large endurance and range while being able to perform Vertical Take-Off and Landing (VTOL) landings allows a broad range of applications. For this purpose the DelftaCopter (DC) was developed, a tilt-body tailsitter UAV. It hovers using a single helicopter rotor for lift and transitions to forward flight by pitching its body down by 90°. In this forward flight state, wings generate the lift, while the helicopter rotor now provides thrust. The single rotor is more efficient than using multiple smaller rotors and helicopter swashplate is used for attitude and speed control. The heavy single helicopter rotor introduces significant gyroscopic moments, as is the case for all helicopters. In contrast with normal helicopters, the DC has a heavy fuselage putting the attitude dynamics between a helicopter and aircraft. In previous research, a controller based on a model incorporating the rotor as a rotating cylinder was implemented. This controller was unable to counteract the gyroscopic pitch-roll coupling, leading to the question of this thesis: how should the DC be modeled to allow control design. <br/>In this thesis, the previous model is called the Cylinder Dynamics (CD) model, and is compared with another model from literature. The latter model, in this thesis called the Tip-Path Plane (TPP) model, includes the flapping dynamics through the tip-path plane dynamics and is also a linear state-space model. In flight tests, chirps were used to cover a broad frequency range. Fitting both the CD and TPP models on this flight test data, it is shown that the CD model lacks accuracy in the high-frequency area, while the TPP is able to accurately model these dynamics. This shows that the flapping dynamics are important to the attitude dynamics of the DC. An Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) controller was implemented based on the fitted TPP model, and shows adequate tracking performance, further validating the applicability of the model to the DC. For forward flight, extensions to the hover models are proposed. The extension including the elevator and aerodynamic damping is shown to simulate key dynamics of the DC in forward flight with reasonable accuracy. The parameters and eigenfrequencies of this model are not significantly different from the hover model. Therefore it can be concluded that the gyroscopic effect plays an important role in forward flight attitude dynamics. Another extension which estimates of angle of attack and sideslip using high-pass filtered rotational rates, yields better accuracy, but significantly changes the model parameters also present in the hover model. More research with angle of attack and sideslip vanes could validate this modeling approach. It was also found that for a new version of the DC with a smaller, more quickly rotating rotor, the modeling done before resulted in much worse fits. It was shown that the CD and TPP model response is much more comparable for this version. Control performance also suffers due to this lower accuracy model fit. Further research is required to understand why this is the case.","DelftaCopter; System Identification; UAV; Control; Helicopter Model; Flapping Dynamics; Hybrid; Tail-sitter","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-12-10","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

This disease is characterized by skeletal dysplasias, bone fragility and many secondary health issues. It is a heritable disorder affecting collagen type I, which is an essential protein in bone tissue. Post-translational overmodifications in collagen biosynthesis disturb the collagen packing and alter the mineralization process. This results in bone with poor structural parameters and inferior mechanical properties. In the current study, we have tested the hypothesis that the structural and mechanical properties in bone samples from OI patients are related to altered post-translational modifications in the collagen molecules.Hydroxylysine (Hyl) and the crosslinks hydroxylysyl-pyridinoline (HP) and lysyl-pyridinoline (LP) in bone samples from OI patients were measured with liquid chromatography. Bone quantity, in terms of volumetric bone mineral density (vBMD) and volumetric tissue mineral density (vTMD), was measured with micro-computed tomography. Hardness and Young’s moduli were derived from indentation experiments. Lysine was overhydroxylated in OI bone (p &lt; 0.001), which led to increased HP values (p &lt; 0.001) and higher HP/LP ratios (p = 0.013) compared to controls. OI tissue mineral density was more heterogeneously distributed, although average vTMD values were similar in both groups. The vBMD was significantly higher in controls compared to OI bone samples. Elevated Hyl levels were significantly related to decreased vBMD and vTMD in bone samples from OI patients. In both OI and control samples, an increase in LP crosslinks was associated with elevated vTMD values. Indentation with a spherical tip (r = 0.25mm) showed no altered mechanical properties in OI compared with controls. Unfortunately, we could not determine if impaired overmodifications in collagen are related to the poor mechanical properties of OI bone. Young’s moduli and hardness were not related to HP levels or HP/LP ratios. In control bone samples a negative correlation between Hyl residues and mechanical properties is observed. More mechanical experiments are necessary to address the hypothesis appropriately.","Osteogenesis Imperfecta; Collagen; Hydroxylation; Crosslinks; Indentation; Micro Computed Tomography; High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC); Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

They are an integration of spatial heterogeneous parts of the system. Finding adequate parameter values based on field observations, which represents the heterogeneity of a catchment on the spatial resolution and scale of the model, is considered challenging since the scale of the observations do not meet the scale of the parameters. <br/><br/>The objective of this thesis is to analyze the extent to which it is possible to make an estimation of parameter distributions based on field observations (the precipitation, evaporation and discharge) and a given hydrological model structure. The goal is to avoid the use of uninformed prior parameter distributions during calibration by using available field data to generate informed prior distributions.<br/><br/>In this research, six different expert-knowledge inverse modelling methods are developed to find four parameter distributions. Each method uses sub-periods in the data and is coupled to the parameter of the model component representing that specific type of sub-period. <br/><br/>To test the methods, the study was conducted in a synthetic environment, which made it easier to validate the parameter distributions obtained with the methods. In this synthetic experiment, discharge data was produced by a model driven by real rainfall data and potential evaporation data. All forms of uncertainty were excluded in this test.<br/><br/>The effect of data uncertainty in the methods was investigated separately by conducting a sensitivity analysis. The same synthetic data was used; however the synthetic data was corrupted to simulate data uncertainty. <br/><br/>Last, an application of the methods upon real measured data was completed. The performance of the methods to find parameter distributions can no longer be assessed since in the real world the “correct” parameter values are not known. However, a comparison of the informed prior parameter distributions of the methods with uninformed prior parameter distributions could be made with a Monte-Carlo sampling strategy calibration.<br/><br/>In the synthetic experiment, all parameter distributions of the investigated model were correctly determined using the expert-knowledge inverse modelling methods. The sensitivity analysis revealed that the method to determine the maximum percolation rate parameter (Pmax) distribution was sensitive to data uncertainty. The determined Pmax parameter distributions did not include the original parameter of the corrupted synthetic data. However, this issue does not lead to other parameter distributions that do not include the original parameters.<br/><br/>In real-world application, insight is gained into the performance of the developed methods to find parameter distributions. An uncertainty interval was constructed with the Generalized Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation (GLUE) method. The total area of the constructed uncertainty interval using the calibration results of the informed prior parameter distributions was less than half than the uncertainty interval constructed using the uninformed prior parameter distributions. The posterior parameter distributions of the informed parameter distributions was two to five times smaller than for the uninformed parameter distribution. The model performance of both calibrations did not deviate significantly, indicating a sufficient model structure for the catchment and an adequate performance of the methods to find parameters.","parameter distributions; Conceptual hydrological model; field observations","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Show how to convey the renewed image in a coherent way.<br/><br/>The process of this assignment is the following: By analyzing the company and it’s context, insights on the challenges were found and translated into a roadmap to get to this updated brand identity. This is close to the original one, but differs in the conveyed look and emphasizes the reasons to believe the brand. The roadmap shows three different implementations to come to this identity: a brand guide, a portfolio update and a niche market focus strategy.<br/>A brand guide is created first to set a standard, also for the coherence, and provides the company with an handhold for all future brand communication. An proposed homepage serves as example.<br/>The portfolio update consists of new cases for the core products (bed alarm, multisense, Epi-Watcher, Wet-Watcher and Teleroep). Three case designs with each different aspects are shown to employees of care organisations and their opinions about characteristics are collected. Based on their feedback, a final design is made and again shown to them. This is also 3D printed. Advice about changes of the design is given.<br/><br/>As the current brand essence is making simple but qualitative health care alarms for smaller disease groups and the current mission is to enlighten the burden of these people, the strategy is to focus on niche markets: small disease groups. <br/>Vahlkamp already has products for niche markets, like the Epi-Watcher and products for the blind and deaf, but also sell mass market products. These should remain in the background.<br/>By keeping research into the emerging niche markets and new technologies going, opportunities can be found. By contracting companies for their niche products or developing new niche products, the portfolio can be expanded.<br/>In this way, the strategy supports their caring character and makes them more visible and distinctive, especially in the smaller niche markets.<br/>As was found in the analysis phase, most competitors design for the majority and thus not focussing on the majority, but on the niche markets, is a good strategy for more visibility and distinctiveness. Also, the threat of substitution of multiple alarms by the use of cameras is a reason to comply with this strategy.<br/>By using a brand guide, updating the portfolio and following the niche focus strategy, Vahlkamp’s brand identity will be updated so Vahlkamp will be a more visible and distinctive brand while conveying this message in a coherent way.","Branding; brand identity; Strategic Roadmap; niche focus; Health care","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor); Breedveld, P. (mentor); Plettenburg, D.H. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","Background: When a suspicious lesion is detected, a thorough examination is essential for the diagnostics of the lesion. Information about the nature and character of the lesion is crucial for the determination of the disease and an appropriate corresponding treatment plan. Taking a biopsy plays an important role in this examination. A biopsy is the removal of a tissue sample from a living organism. The aim of the biopsy is to provide a sufficient and representative part of a lesion, which will enable a thorough examination. Unfortunately,<br/>the diagnostics of a biopsy is not always as accurate as desired. Core-needle biopsy is a commonly used minimally invasive biopsy technique. This technique uses a needle, with a varying size between 1.3mm to 2.1 mm, to cut away a tissue sample from a lesion. Biopsies taken with core-needle instruments do not<br/>always represent the lesion sufficiently. It is often hard to determine the exact lesion site, and to know if the needle has indeed taken a biopsy from the lesion. To prevent non-diagnostic results from the biopsy, multiple samples should be taken from the lesion site. Common core-needle methods currently obtain a single biopsy sample per insertion. As multiple specimens must be obtained, multiple insertions of the biopsy instrument are required. The aim of this research is to design a single-insertion multiple specimen biopsy instrument.<br/>This design will be developed and evaluated on its performance and functionality.<br/>Methods: A list of requirements was setup to determine the conditions which comprise the design. Next to the requirements, a functional analysis was carried out which divided the functions of the design into three main functions. A, the insertion of the device into the lesion, B, the actions required to obtain a multitude of samples, and C, the retraction of the instrument from the body. The actions to obtain a multitude of samples, are subdivided into five actions: (1) the instrument must collect a tissue sample, and (2) enclose this tissue<br/>sample into a container. (3) This container must be transported through the instrument. And subsequently stored inside the instrument, (4). Finally, (5) the instrument must be reloaded. This sequence of actions can be repeated until a number of specimens have been obtained. Using these five actions as a lead of the design process, conceptual designs were created. During the design process inspiration was found in firearms. The storing of bullets and reloading mechanisms found in guns could help find solutions to the storing and<br/>reloading functions of the biopsy instrument. For each action a conceptual design is developed, and finally these five conceptual designs are combined and elaborated, resulting into one final design. A prototype of the final design was developed and evaluated. The prototype was validated on three different aspects: the ability to obtain multiple biopsy samples through a single insertion, the ability to use the prototype in accordance to the intended use, and a comparison between the prototype and an existing biopsy instrument in terms of<br/>procedure duration. For each of these aspects the prototype was validated in three different proof of concept experiments.<br/>Results: The prototype proved to successfully be able to take a multitude of biopsy specimens through a single insertion. Next to this initial evaluation, the intended use of the instrument is also successfully performed by the prototype. The last evaluation of the prototype, has shown that the procedure time of the<br/>prototype to take a multitude of samples is longer than the procedure time to take a multitude of samples using and existing biopsy instrument (TruCore II). The prototype took 5 minutes and 7 seconds, whereas the existing biopsy instrument took 3 minutes and 50 seconds to obtain multiple tissue samples.<br/>Discussion and Conclusion: The fabricated prototype has proven that it is able to take multiple tissue samples through a single insertion. This multitude of samples can be used to improve the diagnosis accuracy of core-needle biopsy. The functionality of the prototype is in accordance to the intended use. This<br/>intended use provides an indication of the possibilities of use of the prototype. The procedure time of the prototype can be decreased by further improving the usability of the design. Future research can focus on a more elaborate evaluation on the accuracy of the instrument. Furthermore, future work can be carried out<br/>on decreasing the instrument length of the current design. Another research can be done on possible ways to implement a semi-, or even a fully-automatic reloading and transportation mechanism on the now manual operable instrument. With these additional future improvements, this initial proof of concept prototype has the potential to become a fully functioning biopsy instrument.","Biopsy; Medical instrument; Core-needle; Single-insertion; multiple","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-12-07","","","","Mechanical Engineering | BioMechanical Design","",""

With network traffic volumes increasing and systems becoming more connected, maintaining visibility on IT networks is a challenging yet important task. In recent years the number of cyber threats have increased dramatically. Monitoring and threat detection are more essential than ever to stay in control in a growing threat landscape. The powerful properties of state machines and the similarities between network traffic and traces used to learn state machines makes this a promising approach. Current learning methods; however, maintain an intermediate data structure that is converted in a state machine after all data has been processed. The continuous nature of network traffic makes this conventional approach inapplicable. This study provides a solution by developing a method for learning State Machines on real-time data streams.

The proposed detection method is demonstrated to be highly effective in matching traffic from various malware types to pre-learned fingerprints.

Although some comparisons were performed using radiosondes, no thorough quality assessment of the wind estimation results has been done so far. During this research, the quality assessment is performed for the estimation of the wind speed and direction during the Analysis of the Composition of Clouds with Extended Polarization Techniques (ACCEPT) campaign, which took place in October and November 2014. This research shows that the wind estimation is working well during precipitation and a TARA-based criteria for the data selection to guarantee the quality of the wind retrievals is identified in the form of the coefficient of variation for the mean Doppler velocities.<br/>The quality assessment of the results of the TARA wind estimation is done by comparing the wind retrievals to the measurements of the meteorological tower at a height of 200 m above the surface at minute resolution. For the assessment to be performed, an effective way of removing clear air measurements is needed, which is done for the whole ACCEPT-campaign using a rough selection of time steps including rain. This approach showed that the wind estimation is working well during precipitation and shows that an improved data selection is needed.<br/>Several approaches towards improving the data selection for the wind estimation of TARA are per- formed. The most successful is the use of the coefficient of variation, which is defined as the standard deviation divided by the mean. This coefficient is calculated for the mean Doppler velocities, which are the input for the wind estimation algorithm. Comparing the results of the coefficient of variation method to the one based on rain selection shows that both return good results.

This system is described<br/>by a density matrix in order to include the presence of external influences. The time-evolution of the state of the system is calculated by solving the Von-Neumann equation both analytically and numerically, which is then used to calculate the extractable work. It is shown that exchange interaction does not have a direct effect on the extractable work, since it creates entanglement between two states of the same energy level and the operator commutes with the Hamiltonian of the system. The effect of the CNOT gate on the state of the system is then investigated. While it does have an effect on the extractable work, it did not achieve a decrease in charging time. These results are only relevant for the specific system used in this thesis. For other methods and systems, exchange interaction could lead to faster charging.","Quantum thermodynamics; Quantum battery; Electron spin qubit","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This can be achieved by making the motions more human-like. It is assumed that humans move optimal with respect to a certain objective or cost function. To find this function an inverse optimal control approach is developed. It uses a bilevel optimization for finding what linear weighted combination of physically interpretable cost functions best mimics human point-to-point motions. The upper level compares the optimal result of the lower level with a reference motion. Two depth cameras are combined in a motion capture setup to record this reference motion. <br/><br/>The human arm is modeled as a seven degrees of freedom manipulator, similar to a robot arm model of the YuMi. The bilevel optimization is done with both models, resulting in two differently weighted cost functions. The cost function that was derived using the robot model is then used to generate new motions for the corresponding real robot arm. The results of an experiment show that humans experience these motions as more anthropomorphic and feel at least equally as safe compared to existing motion planning strategies. This proves the validity of the inverse optimal control method and shows it is a step forward for better collaboration between humans and robots.","Robotics; Inverse Optimal Control; Human-Robot Interaction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

In many countries shallow-waters are rare. Floating support structures may be the solution for these areas. Many concepts have been developed but three concepts have been analyzed (spar, semi-submergible and the tension leg platform (TLP)) in the literature. This study focuses on the TLP, which has the lowest weight of these concepts but the dynamic system is complex and has significant more risk than the other support structures, for example the risk of resonance of structural elements. <br/><br/>The structural integrity of the total structure is important for the tension leg platform wind turbine (TLPWT). This study investigates the modelling techniques of the flexible TLPWT, with the aim to model the dynamics of floating wind turbine correctly. An Aero-hydro-elastic-servo model is implemented in Matlab, which includes aerodynamics of the wind turbine, hydrodynamic loads on the floating structure and mooring system, the flexibility of the total structure and the control system of the wind turbine. This model solves the equation of motion with the Houbolt numerical time integration method. In addition, the validity of the model is confirmed by validation using an Orcaflex model. The model is used to analyze the effect of the gyroscopic moments and the non-harmonic periodic load oscillations on the motion responses. <br/><br/>Steel structures are vulnerable to cyclic loading. Small cracks may initiate and grow in the structure, this is called fatigue. Fatigue is stress driven and resonance drives stresses. The fatigue performance can be improved by avoiding resonance of structural elements. A method has been developed to find a design with the natural frequencies outside the wind, wave and passing blade frequencies. The method consists of two algorithms, mode tracking algorithm and the selection algorithm. The method is used for a North-Sea site and the result of this an improved design, which has the natural frequencies outside the frequencies where wave and wind have energy. This design has better dynamic characteristics, which indicate better fatigue performance, in comparison of the reference TLPWT, which is predominantly designed to prevent slack tendons. The approach has shown to be successful but the method can only assist in the preliminary design phase of a TLPWT for any given site. <br","Floating Wind Turbines; Dynamic Analysis; Modelling; TLP; Fatigue","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-12-06","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

In the study, it is concluded that an offshore solution is crucial to protect Jakarta from the threat of sea level rise in the coastal area. The collaboration between these two countries was later continued by realizing the Master Plan for the National Capital Integrated Coastal Development (NCICD). The main purpose of this master plan is to provide a long-term solution for flooding problems. In addition to the main purpose, this plan also addresses other urban problems, proposes a solution to improve the coastal zone area and facilitates socio-economic development in the area. This project encounters high resistance from public and is deemed to be controversial in the public domain as the plan includes the construction of a large protection wall enclosing the sea and land reclamation. The public perceives that this project would have fatal environmental and social impacts, including the disappearance of mangrove forest, undesirable effect on the livelihoods of vulnerable communities, etc. Hitherto the plan has remained controversial, despite formal assessment conducted by the Indonesian government and Dutch consultants, in which the plan is considered as a measure to save Jakarta from being a sinking city caused by an alarming rate of land subsidence. Noting this constant debate of the project, identifying values of stakeholders is, therefore, important to understand the underlying reasons of persistent oppositions. Hence the objective of this research is to develop an approach for mitigating conflicting values in a public project in Indonesia as the supporting tool for decision making process.<br/><br/>To be able to understand the decision-making process and identify the values at stake, an analysis was performed based on 243 newspaper articles which were selected using the keywords: ‘giant sea wall’ and ‘NCICD’ within a time period of 57 months; from January 2011 to September 2016. From these articles, the decision-making process was constructed to analyze how the decision-making process was conducted in the past and what important aspects have been missed in the implementation of decision-making process. In addition, values of the stakeholders were also identified by analyzing the arguments set forth by diverse stakeholders.<br/><br/>From the previous literature and analysis in this research, it has been observed that there are certain stakeholders who are necessary to be involved but are still underrepresented in the plan. Furthermore, the values which are fundamental to certain stakeholders have not been covered in the previous assessments. Therefore, in this research, the values of stakeholders are adopted as the basis of using expert methods in decision-making process in combination with the stakeholder participation method. To conclude this research, the following list is the summary of the developed approaches in which an adapted version of existing methods are used to address specific value conflict: EIA and MCA as the method to mitigate the value conflict of safety, economic development vs environmental protection (i), CBA as a method to mitigate safety, economic development, cost-recovery vs economic and welfare (general), utilities (ii), VSD as the method to mitigate value conflict between safety, economic development vs economic and welfare (affected communities), culture/ Identity (iii), and VSD as a method to mitigate value conflicts between safety, economic development vs port development (economic interest) (iv).<br","NCICD; Value conflicts; Value; Stakeholder participation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","",""

This necessity is due to the fact that within The Netherlands 80% of all revenue within the GWW sector is initiated by the government and therefore must be awarded through a tender procedure consistent to European procurement legislation (PianoO, 2018a). As tender legislation and the amount of available work changed significantly over the last decades, the approach of tenders by supplying organizations has also changed. Here, tender management appeared as an emerging discipline that focusses on adding value by professionalizing the approach of the tender process within supplying organizations. Besides, it incorporates information from the entire organization in order to persuade the client to accept the bid. Tender management in this research is considered to be the management of bid development by supplying organizations. As employees are likely to perform better when their competencies meet their job requirements, this research focusses on establishing a competency-based profile. This profile will eventually help the approach of tenders mature and therefore enlarge the chance of success for supplying organizations in the tender process. In order to establish this competency-based profile, the following research question was established: Which competencies are important for tender management when preparing a bid for different infrastructure project types in an engineering firm? The competency-based profile for tender management professionals will be drawn up on the basis of a combination of literature review and the development of a serious game. The literature review aims to explore three concepts ('tender management', 'competencies' and 'project types') in order to develop elements of the game. The game enables tender management professionals to share their thoughts on important competencies for tender management by compiling competency-based teams. Based on the findings retrieved from both literature and CompeTender, the following conclusions could be drawn: Being creative is very important for creating innovative tender proposals, which are fit for purpose and have a surprising effect on the client (distinctive character). Besides that, this competency is related to the development of new approaches (innovations), which help to reduce both cost and time. The importance of having environmental awareness and being customer-oriented follows from the position of tender management between the client and the supplying organization. Analysing is an important competency for tender management due to the obligation to completely understand the customer demand, which often concerns a complex problem. Planning &amp; organizing needs to be incorporated as tender processes usually take place in a short time-span, but require involvement with a lot of different people. Finally, being cost-conscious is very important, as bids are usually judged on both price and quality. For a differentiation in important competencies for different project types no sufficient underpinning was found, except for the fact that being creative becomes even more important when tendering for contractor services. In order to distinct themselves from the competition, it is recommended to select tender management professionals mainly on their creativity and whether they have environmental awareness, are customer oriented, are cost-conscious and are good analysers. This will lead to a higher quality of bids, which reflect distinctive value and therefore outcompete the competition.  ","Tender management; Bid management; Tender process; Serious game; Competencies; Competency-based profile; Proposal management","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

The complexity of the soil-structure interaction (SSI) during an earthquake results in large uncertainties in the design process of a monopile foundation. The design codes do not provide a structured framework on how to deal with these uncertainties. On top of this, the design codes are for (offshore) structures in general and do not specify for the large diameter tubulars which are characteristic for the offshore wind energy sector. <br/><br/>This thesis presents the investigation into a 1D seismic Winkler foundation that is able to represent the SSI during an earthquake. The model, a beam on nonlinear Winkler foundation (BNWF) coupled with a nonlinear ground response model, is a fast method to determine the structural response for the stochastic seismic and offshore wind load cases. Semi-empirical formulations are used to implement cyclic loading effects into the model. A 3D finite element model of an embedded monopile is developed in parallel with the seismic Winkler foundation for tuning and validation purposes. <br/>The resistance of the soil to lateral pile deflections is further investigated to address the uncertainty in the SSI. A 2D horizontal cross-section of the embedded monopile is considered to determine the linear dynamic properties (impedance) of the soil, and a plane strain finite element model is developed to investigate the effect of nonlinear soil behaviour. A combined frequency-time domain extension for the Winkler foundation is developed to incorporate the obtained frequency-dependent foundation properties into a time-domain analysis. <br/><br/>It was found that none of the 2D analyses resulted in SSI representation that could be directly applied in a time-domain analysis. Moreover, the large D/L ratio of a monopile activates a global soil response, making an uncoupled 2D analysis inaccurate for the frequency range of interest.<br","Soil-structure interaction; monopile foundation; Beam on nonlinear Winkler foundation; Seismic response model; Hybrid frequency-time domain model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","European Wind Energy Masters (EWEM)","",""

This stresses the need for adaptable infrastructure. Asset owners cannot assume a certain final situation of the infrastructure and the impacts on it due to climate change. This report answers the following research question: How can existing infrastructural asset designs in the Netherlands be adapted to anticipated current and future expected climate change effects? A method is developed to explore what the effects of climate change are on infrastructure and what further steps can be taken to make the infrastructure adaptable. The Afsluitdijk is used as a case study and has five embedded sub-assets: the dam, motorway, outlet sluices, ship locks and bridges. Nine climate change effects are distinguished for the Netherlands in the scenario WH of the KNMI in 2085. The climate change effects are combined with the asset parts and all combinations are assessed separately. An expert reflects on the combination of climate change impacts and asset part and elaborates on how the climate change effect impacts the reliability, safety or maintenance of the asset. This resulted in 21 identified possible problems for the 2020 design of the Afsluitdijk. In this report is looked at foreign situations that are comparable to the Afsluitdijk’s circumstances. Some of the 21 identified problems can easily be solved. A structured approach on how to assess the impact of climate change on infrastructure is lacking so far. The method makes sure all aspects are considered and helps the expert to think of all theoretical problems that have not occurred yet but are in the future a possible problem. Assets that are an integral system are preferred. The Afsluitdijk is interconnected to its environment and hard boundaries are difficult to determine. This makes the Afsluitdijk not an ideal case study, but this interconnectedness is typical for large scale infrastructural projects and those projects are often most interesting. Rijkswaterstaat recognizes the surplus of water problems in the new design. However, drought, heat waves and a low water level are three climate impacts that are not taken into consideration in the new design of 2020. Summer related problems are explored by Rijkswaterstaat but have not yet received the attention it deserves. Rijkswaterstaat is unprepared to a situation where climate change effects are more severe than was estimated in their assumptions. On top of that, Rijkswaterstaat is inclined to address problems of big infrastructural problems by cutting them of in smaller projects and try to solve them. However, in large projects it is better to have an integral solution since all aspects are interconnected and influence one another. The method provides this integral viewpoint and allows the user to make long-term decisions while taking the uncertainties of climate change into account. By using the method, choices in design and management of the infrastructural asset can be made with confidence. This does not guarantee that the outcome of a risky decision will be optimal. But the decision will be rational in the face of uncertainty and that the repeated application of the method will on the long run be more beneficial.","Afsluitdijk; Climate change; Infrastructural assets; Adaptability","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

BigBang’s focus is on improving the waste separation approach of municipalities, consumers and companies, through their products, and basically by coaching the citizens. In high rise areas (HRAs) in the Netherlands, organic waste (OW) is hardly separated. Clean and separate collection of OW at the source contributes to a circular economy (Ellen MacArthur Foundation, 2018). Also, the EU has composed a new law which states that all OW must be recycled or separately collected at its source in 2023 (CounsilEU, 2018). Hence, municipalities with HRAs are more problematic. The municipality of the Hague is used as a case study for this research. 60% of the Hague’s inhabitants live in apartments (Onroerend Zaken Bestand, 2018). The average person in the municipality of the Hague separately collected 10.6 kg OW per year, compared to the national average of 79.8 kg per person per year. (CBS5, 2018). To reach the target of separating 75% of all waste by 2020, as set by the Dutch government (Rijksoverheid, 2018), a solution needs to be found to separate OW in HRAs. This was the starting point for this thesis’ assignment: ‘’How can the apartment inhabitant be supported in separately collecting OW by means of a product or service? ’’ The method of approach to the problem in this thesis is based on the basic design cycle (Boeijen et al. 2014). This method proposes the trial-and-error process of design consisting of analysis, synthesis, embodiment and evaluation. Design thinking is used to work towards a final solution which is desirable, feasible and viable. (DAM &amp; SIANG, 2018) Analysis Phase | Research to OW in High-rise area’s To get a representative view of the behaviour and environment of the apartment inhabitants (AI) in HRAs, a variety of AI, among which are students, a young couple, a family and young professionals, in different types of apartments is researched. AIs have to bring their waste to public containers, in or around the high-rise buildings, which are located in the basement, ground floor and in the hallway. AIs are generally classified into two groups. They are: separators of OW and non-separators of OW. The main reasons why AIs do not separate OW are : Lack of public containers, high separation efforts Lack of space and time to separate, lack of awareness about separating OW. AIs do not see the need to separate OW and have no idea what belongs to OW. Moreover, the main annoyances for AI who separate OW are: OW is perceived as unhygienic, this includes: dirt leaking trash bags, odour, fruit flies. Separating OW is perceived as high-effort due to: the walking distance to the public container and the walking frequency to the public container for hygienic reasons. In a stakeholder analysis, it is observed that 10% of the OW is polluted with other waste fractions, which is a problem for OW processors (Femke Mckinzie, 2018) Furthermore, municipalities seek for Municipalities are seeking solutions to increase waste separation in an effective and an economical way. (Langeveld, 2014) Analysis Phase | Business Analysis To explore viable business opportunities for BinBang regarding the separation of OW in HRAs, internal and external analyses of BinBang were performed, which resulted in a SWOT analysis. The strengths of BinBang are marketing, branding, communication, their collaborations with municipalities and their proven track record of changing the separation behaviour of people. Their weakness is their current product portfolio. The products of BinBang do not offer a solution for the main annoyances of AI who separate OW. The SWOT analysis resulted in seven promising search areas. Meanwhile, the selected search area is: extend the product portfolio with a bin to increase OW separation. Based on this search area and insights from the analysis, the following design challenge is formulated: ‘‘The design of a bin for the collection and storage of organic waste in high-rise building kitchens and for the transportation of this to a public container. The product is hygienic, low-effort and sustainable’’ A hygienic product has an acceptable odour level and does not allow visual or physical contact between the user and degraded OW. Conversely, a low effort product is defined by the disposal frequency of OW into a public container, which should be equal or less than the disposal of residual waste. A sustainable product is defined as having a minimum lifetime of 10 years, is repairable and recyclable. Synthesis phase in a creative session with industrial design students, several ideas were generated for hygienic and low-effort bins. These ideas are combined with literature research about odour reduction methods, which resulted into the following four concepts: Organic air bin | This bin uses a double-layered bag system to stimulate aerobic digestion in combination with activated carbon to reduce odour. Bio balcony bin | This bin consists of a top bin for the kitchen counter to collect OW. The top bin can be placed on the bottom bin, which can as well be placed on the balcony to avoid filling the house with odour. Waste cube | This bin makes an airtight biodegradable package of the daily produced OW. The cubes can be collected over a period of multiple days and brought together with the RW to the public containers. Cool waste bin |This bin cools OW in the fridge to reduce odour. Because of a lipo- and a hydrophobic nanocoating, there is no need for a plastic bag. The bin can be cleaned by pouring a bit of water in the bin, closing it off watertight and shaking it. To validate whether the different concepts resulted in the preferred odour reduction, four prototypes were created. These prototypes were each independently tested for one week by the AI households in a four weeks during research during hot summer days in August and September (KNMI, 2018). Cooling is selected as the odour reduction method for the final product because it resulted in not any odour, compared to the other reduce methods of the other concepts, which did result in odour annoyance. Apart from the odour reduction method validation, the research also generated new insights about product preferences. Based on these insights and cooling as the odour reduction method, the criterea for the final product are set. The most important one is that the product should be placeable in the fridge door during storage and by using at the kitchen counter (because of the lack of space on top) Quick disposal of OW, when the bin is placed in the fridge should be possible. The parts must be demountable for cleaning. The preferred bag type is a normal trash bag which should be biodegradable and non-leaking. Embodiment Phase The Frisbox is developed as a solution to OW separation in HRAs. The Frisbox is the first bin to collect OW for several days (low-effort) without odour and fruit flies, done by placing the bin in the fridge (hygienic). The Frisbox comes with the complementary Friszak, a biodegradable bag, which is non leaking, hygienic in usage and perfectly fits into the Frisbox. BinBang can introduce the Frisbox to the market by means of a pilot, in collaboration with a municipality, such as the city of the Hague. The pilot can be used to validate the effectiveness and develop the properties of the Frisbox. For the pilot, a version of the Frisbox has been designed with low investment costs. Evaluation Phase The Frisbox is evaluated by five AIs households by using the pilot Frisbox for the period of a week, to test if the product fulfils the design challenge. From this evaluation, it can be concluded that the pilot Frisboxes were evaluated positively by the AI and are: Hygienic (No odour annoyance, no fruit flies, no leaking bags, no visual and physical contact between the user and degraded OW) Low-effort. (Only empty one time a week in public container) Sustainable (The product is repairable and recyclable). The importance of a perfect fit bag like the Friszak is more preferred and supported because of the negative results of too large bags used in the test. The Friszak is a solution for waste processors because it could reduce pollution in OW. The Frisbox is an opportunity for BinBang to change the behaviour of AI in the separate collection of OW in HRAs and to reach the Dutch and European waste separation targets.","Hig-rise area; high-rise building; organic waste; bin; trashcan; industrial design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The design and experimental set-up were based on the large liquefaction tank (de Jager et al., 2017). Fluidisation was used as sample preparation technique to produce a saturated, loose and uniform sand bed. The performance of the fluidisation system was evaluated by experimental investigation of the sample by considering the relative density, uniformity, degree of saturation and the influence of viscous pore fluid. The reproducibility of the initial sample was considered acceptable. A series of centrifuge experiments was conducted where the fluidised sand bed was accelerated to varying gravity levels and inclined to a slope with constant tilting rate. In most tests the soil response was characterised by a rapid liquefaction flow slide and a sudden increase in pore pressures. The moment of failure was consistently influenced by a variation in fluid viscosity and tilting rate, regardless of the gravity level; these effects indicated that instability was caused by the restricted seepage rate during loading. It is believed that the liquefaction potential is governed by the extremely loose and highly contractive top layer, which yields a sudden loss of strength under limited drainage conditions. The pore pressure measurements, which showed no excess pore pressures building up prior to failure, can lead to a misunderstanding of the failure mechanism and false assumption of fully drained conditions. Monitoring the pore pressures is therefore not suitable to predict liquefaction flow slides in submarine slopes. Mitigation of liquefaction should be focussed on densification of the looser part of the sandy slope, which is usually the top layer.","Submarine landslides; liquefaction; centrifuge modelling; flow slides","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is estimated that currently roughly 1900 kilometres of flood protection does not meet the safety requirements for the future (Jonkman, Jorissen, Schweckendieck &amp; Van den Bos, 2017). Past flood defence projects show that integrating reinforcement measures is a difficult assignment. It is specifically focused on dike reinforcement projects in this thesis. A deficiency in the design process is identified in the role that the influence on the existing situation has on the evaluation and selection of design alternatives that are input for the Environmental Impact Assessment. The difficulty for improving the importance of the existing situation in the surroundings, in the design process is that the subject experts on these themes are typically assessing the consequences of proposed interventions (Aalberts, 2018). The research objective is set to develop a method that allows to include the influence on the existing situation within the evaluation and selection of design alternatives in dike reinforcement projects. This method aims for providing information to compare the spatial integration of reinforcement designs in early stages of reinforcement projects. Subject experts should assess the provided information, and determine whether a reinforcement design provides a satisfying influence on the project area. It is focused on dike reinforcement projects in rural area. A research through design study is used to develop the method to compare design alternatives. The study included the identification of technical design measures to increase the strength of dikes in rural area, and the decomposition of rural areas in functional characteristics that can be valued. A conceptual evaluation model is developed to express the relation between functional characteristics and design alternatives for dike reinforcements. It is studied how a method can be provided to compare the outcome of the conceptual evaluation model for a large variety of design alternatives. The value of the developed method is assessed in a case study, which is the dike reinforcement project “Wolferen-Sprok”. The resulting method is able to compare design alternatives on the influence on the existing situation by following seven steps. It is providing design measures for the identified safety problem of the dike in a certain project area. Simultaneously, the characteristics of the project area should be identified and visualized on maps. This provides the required information to apply the conceptual evaluation model that identifies effects of design alternatives on the existing situation. The retrieved data is visualized to compare design alternatives. It is concluded that the developed method focusses mainly on natural, cultural, and social economic functions in rural project areas. This means that influence of design alternatives on costs, maintainability, and landscape values should be addressed separately, in the evaluation and selection of design alternatives. It is recommended to study how the influence on these topics can evaluated in a similar method. The developed method can be applied to include the existing situation in the project area in the evaluation and selection of design alternatives in dike reinforcement projects in rural areas. It is expected that application of the method in design teams provides new input for further improvement of the method.","dike reinforcement; spatial integration; dijkversterking; existing situation; flood protection","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","",""

To do this, they receive one week of training every five years during which they study the knowledge and practice the skills and processes to handle medical incidents on board. The week of training is not enough for the captains to handle medical incidents confidently and they are in need of support.<br/>Currently, the support for captains is limited to phone calls and email with a doctor from the Radio Medical Services. MedAssist.online invented 2-way-AR technology, a unique method of merging two realities into one using tablets and a green screen. The merging of two realities creates the possibility to give instructions to the captain using hands as an overlay on the video. The 2-way-AR video function is put at the centre of a service which is designed to match the treatment journey and increase the number of interactions between a doctor and captain. A service which uses live video with the addition of 2-way-AR technology has the potential to become the telemedicine solution that boosts the confidence of the captains and their treatment performance. <br/>Boosting confidence is essential to help the captain be decisive in his actions. However, the real value of 2-way-AR is in supporting the captain perform medical skills like stitching and abdominal searches. This thesis researched the tablet positions and camera positions on both sides of the communication. For the doctor set-ups for different tablet positions were designed and tested to give him optimal control over his hands to give instructions. On the captain side, the camera position and tablet position were explored, built and tested. The set-up is evaluated on the understanding of the doctor of the captain's situation, his ability to interpret and implement the instructions and the flexibility of the set-up for multiple medical scenarios. <br/>From testing various set-ups, it was concluded that an additional camera on the captain side improves the ease of understanding for the doctor and his ability to give instructions.

ING is a primary example that currently tries to find a solution to these problems through the use of model driven development and more specifically code generation.

Code generators as any other software artifact is not bug free, meaning that testing code generators is of paramount importance. However, testing code generators is not straightforward as their output is another program that besides syntactic structure also has behavior. Many formal approaches have been developed that try to formally prove the correctness of code generators. Nevertheless, the complexity and scalability issues that these approaches face make them infeasible in practice. This thesis presents a testing approach that leverages a definitional interpreter to test code generators.

The small inland waterways have abundant capacity to accommodate up to 700 percent more transport. On the other hand, road based container transport is cause for external damages in the form of congestion, emissions and accidents. All that are of course unwanted. To reduce the overall external damage (monetized into cost) for container distribution a modeshift from truck to small scale inland vessel is worth promoting. This thesis researched the feasibility of designing radically renewing small scale container distribution concepts for both vessel and inland terminal. A scalable container carrier concept series is designed and tested for feasibility. Goal of the concept vessel was to design a dedicated series around its cargo, the container. Existing inland vessels of smaller dimensions have holds of suboptimal dimensions, resulting is excess cost. In parallel with the vessel series a scalable container terminal concept has been designed and tested. Goals for the terminal was autonomous operation and low cost per move as existing terminal fail to operate on competitive cost levels for low volumes. The results showed outperformance of competitor alternatives and economic feasibility for both concepts. Results of a case study show the possibility to ship and transship containers to more local, rural terminals at competitive costs levels. Meaning substantially below the costs of existing competition. In addition is the local terminal allocation leading to penetration of the inland waterway network’s capillaries. As a result, shorter pre- and post-haulage operations by truck are required. This increase in sailing distance share and decrease in haulage distance reduces the overall external cost of transport for those specific containers.","Inland Shipping; Container Transport; Container terminal; Small Scale; Feasibility Study; Generalized Cost; Intermodal Transport; hinterland","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Marine Technology | Ship Design, Production and Operations","",""

The operation of such a robot can be complex and requires a dedicated person to control it. Automation of the cinematography allows for the use of multiple robots, which further increases the complexity of performing cinematography. High-level command interpretation is required to allow for an intuitive interface suited for an inexperienced user to control such a system.<br/><br/>Natural Language (NL) is an intuitive interface method which allows a user to specify a extensive range of commands. A Cinematographic Description Clause (CDC) is defined to extract information from a processed NL command. A minimum input approach is considered such that a user has to merely specify the number of robots and the people to record, whereby the specification of a behaviour is optional. An environment is considered in which up to three robots have to frame two people. Taking into account their orientation, relative global location and the user command, a set of behaviours can be determined based on cinematographic practices. Camera views and image parameters are determined through behaviour specific non-linear optimisations and assigned to the robots using a Linear-Bottleneck Algorithm (LBA). A collision-free global path is computed for each robot with an A* search algorithm. Finally, a Model Predictive Control (MPC) determines low-level inputs such that the user command can be achieved.<br/><br/>Three situations are considered to validate the performance of the system given the minimal user input. First, tracking of the dynamic orientations of the people is evaluated for up to three robots, whereby camera positions are determined autonomously. Next, dynamic motions of the two people through an environment highlight the limitations of the system due to collision mitigation, mutual visibility and robot dynamics. An extension to multiple simultaneous commands increases the quantity of robots and people that can be tracked. This allows for an assessment of the flexibility and scalability of the proposed high-level command interpretation methodology.","Aerial Cinematography; MPC; Command Mapping","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

The Netherlands want to become a CE as well and the government presented a national policy programme including goals to reach a CE in 2050. One of those goals is that Dutch public authorities should procure all their projects 100% circularly by 2030. Practice shows that in the infrastructure sector public authorities start with high circular ambitions, but throughout the procurement process it seems to diminish. Public authorities tend to specify their need in detail, and make little use of the knowledge and experience that is present in the supply chain. The fact that the circular ambitions are only partly reached after the realization of the project makes the public procurement process not very effective. A possible contribution to increase this effectiveness can be a specific procurement approach that focusses on utilizing the experience from the supply chain, called the Best Value approach (BVA). However, no literature so far has described the opportunities of the BVA as an approach to procure circular infrastructure in the Netherlands.<br/><br/>The goal of this research is to create a guideline for Dutch public authorities about how they can procure circular infrastructure more effectively by making use of the BVA.

The inland port has to adapt to these developments in order to reduce the threats and to increase the opportunities, but this requires adaptations to the current infrastructure or services. It is preferred to know the opportunities and threats beforehand, so that the inland port can already adapt to these projected changes ahead of time. This research focussed on the development of a method to assess the future-proofness of a Dutch inland port in the period up to 2050, result in the following main research question: What method can be provided to assess the future-proofness of an inland port in The Netherlands until 2050 with regard to the current port activities? The first step of this research was focussed on defining future-proofness of an inland port. An investigation into literature on the definition of future-proofness resulted in the following definition of the future-proof inland port: A future-proof inland port remains useful and successful in the transfer of goods, the storage of goods and facilitating industrial processes for the production of cargo in the future and is flexible enough in port services and infrastructure to deal with potential changes. Subsequently, the activities of various inland port were analysed, resulting in thirteen main port activities in the inland port. In combination with the identified port indicators, the port characteristics of each inland port can be determined. In the final step before the set-up of the method, more insights is obtained about the uncertainties in long-term developments and the related methods to deal with these uncertainties. In the end, it was found out that trend-based narratives can be used for this assessment, because this new method reflects the threats and opportunities for different port activities for specific inland ports. The obtained knowledge about future-proofness, the port activities and the uncertainties in long-term developments were used to set-up of a method to assess the future-proofness of the inland port, which exists of four different parts:•Part 1: Determination of the current inland port’s strengths &amp; weaknesses (port characteristics)•Part 2: Determination of the port specific opportunities and threats (impacts)•Part 3: Determination of the flexibility of the specific inland port•Part 4: Assessment of the future-proofness of the specific inland port The applicability of this method was demonstrated through three case studies, in which the future-proofness of three existing inland ports is assessed. These case studies were the inland ports of Bergen op Zoom, Oosterhout and Wageningen. For these three case studies, the inland port of Wageningen seems very future-proof. It scores good on the current port characteristics, the impacts and the flexibility. The other two inland ports are still considered to be future-proof, although they might face some (minor) challenges in order to become future-proof. Overall, it is concluded that the generated method can be used to assess the future-proofness of the inland ports. It presents a first insight in the degree of future-proofness of the inland ports and can be used as a starting point to improve the performance of the inland port in the future and thereby becoming future-proof.","Inland ports; Future-proof; Framework; Usefulness; Successfulness; Flexibility","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","",""

In the past two decades, perfusion bioreactors have proved to be important tools in the creation, control, and evaluation of cell cultures and engineered tissues under precisely controlled in vitro conditions that simulate the physiological environment. Due to the demanding requirements for blood vessel substitutes, they have been extensively deployed in the culture and conditioning experiments of novel tissue-engineered vascular grafts (TEVGs) and have been often used to study haemodynamic mechanic stimuli, including the cyclic vessel expansion and wall shear stress. However, a key limitation of the currently available TEVG perfusion bioreactors is their often complex design and operation and the lack of standardisation of the mechanical characterisation.<br/>In this study, the goal was to design, characterise, and construct a TEVG perfusion bioreactor that is foremost simpler to operate and extends the capabilities of particular currently available set-ups. A modular bioreactor design is presented that allows for the toolless mounting of the graft with a diameter up to 6 mm and features completely separated circuits for the intra- and extraluminal side of the scaffold wall. The culture chamber encloses a removable graft frame, mainly machined out of polyether ether ketone (PEEK). In silico simulations have been used to assess local fluid dynamics within the scaffold, to predict the reliability of the simulated culture conditions. The presented design allows the exertion of a broad range of physiologically relevant shear stresses on cultured TEVGs, including arterial shear stresses. A test for the in vitro cytotoxicity showed that the medium extracts of the constructed graft frame did not show any cytotoxic potential. Finally, an assessment method for the estimation of the radial compliance is proposed, which aims to adhere to the relevant international standards on the mechanical characterisation of vascular substitutes.","bioreactor; cardiovascular disease; tissue engineering; Blood vessels","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-11-23","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

One of the instruments which is repeatedly used is the surgical punch, which is able to remove pieces of bone in order to create access to the lesion. The drawback of the currently used surgical punches is twofold: first of all, they do not allow for rotation of the tip relative to the handle orientation in order to align the tip properly to the bone to be cut. Furthermore, the successive introduction and extraction of the instrument from the operational area after each cut, increases the risk of introducing bacteria and slows down the procedure.<br/>A novel surgical punch was designed and developed called NeuroPunch. Throughout the course of this study, a human-centered design approach combined with a systematic engineering process was followed leading to several conceptual solutions for different functional parts of the NeuroPunch. By combining these conceptual solutions, a design was set for a first functional prototype including an ergonomic handle, a mechanism for the storage of punched bone pieces, and a mechanism for rotating the tip relative to the handle orientation.<br/>A first evaluation of the functional 1:1 scale prototype with end users shows positive results indicating that the NeuroPunch might be a proper replacement for the currently used punches in endonasal pituitary surgery. Several iterative steps are required to produce a fully functional prototype of the NeuroPunch which can be evaluated in a preclinical setting (e.g. cadaver study). The NeuroPunch shows much potential to be used for other surgeries as well, and it is demonstrated that the NeuroPunch will enable a safer and more comfortable endonasal pituitary surgery while potentially reducing operating time.","Surgical punch; Skull base surgery; bone; Design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-12-31","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

Pham (2017) used the denitrification process to stimulate the production of gas and precipitation of calcium carbonate as a soil improvement method. The ability to desaturate a soil to its optimum saturation by means of gas production inspired the use of this method to improve the engineering properties of soils more efficiently by means of a two-stage process of desaturation and compaction. Andrag (2017) started a research to investigate the potential of this concept and developed a test setup for the assessment of its efficiency. The prospects of this biogenic soil pretreatment method are further investigated in the current study. The objective of the research is to assess how the compactability of an initially saturated soil is influenced by the in-situ formation of gas bubbles and if this gas can be used to reduce the energy requirements for compaction of a soil to a given target density. A review on existing literature is initially carried out to grasp the latest developments on this topic. Information from literature is used to determine the typical characteristics of soils on which compaction activities are often found to be ineffective. Based on this information, a representative silty sand with a high gas storage capacity is created for further experiments. It is found that gradation is one of the main properties controlling the water content-dry density relationship of soils. The water content-dry density relationship of soils composed from industrially produced material is found to be often significantly different from natural soils, which can be explained by differences in gradation. A testing strategy is developed and a setup is established for assessment of the concept of biogenic soil pretreatment for reducing energy requirements for compaction. Denitrifying bacteria are cultivated with a chemostat setup which can supply bacterial inoculum for subsequent experiments. The effect of the biogenic pretreatment is evaluated by comparing the energy requirements for compression of treated and untreated soil samples from initial conditions to a given target density with a constant strain-rate. Soil samples are successfully desaturated to targeted saturations by means of an engineered treatment regime. Concentrations of the substrates are determined based on the stoichiometry of the biochemical reaction, Henry’s law, Boyle’s law and the ideal gas law. Gas is produced at a steady rate inside the soil samples with a very limited amount of gas escaping, confirming the high storage capacity of the assembled sample material. The determined optimum saturation of the silty sand (80%), is therefore achieved without exceeding the gas percolation threshold of the soil. The gas that escapes the sample during the gas production stage and the loading stage, is captured with a gas trap that is included in the setup. The changes in water content and dry density of the soil during the experiment can be accurately predicted by means of a volume balance. The major part of the initially available nitrate in the pore fluid is consumed at the end of the experiments, with a limited amount of accumulated nitrite. Moreover, the denitrification process is successfully buffered by including calcium within the engineered substrate solution.<br/>It is initially presumed that energy requirements for static compaction of a silty sand in the Rowe cell can be reduced by bringing the soil closer to optimum conditions in terms of saturation, before starting the loading stage. Based on an analysis of the work input per volume, it is found that the energy requirements for compaction increase slightly as a result of the biogenic pretreatment. In terms of compactability, no clear benefit is obtained from the biogenic pretreatment according to the energy-based assessment method that is used in this research. The slightly higher energy requirements for compaction of treated samples can possibly be explained by the formation of biofilm or entrapment of gas bubbles in the drainage lines of the setup. Cementation effects as a result of calcium carbonate precipitation are not expected to play a role, since calculations show that the relative amount of calcium carbonate in the soil is very limited at the end of the experiments. It is recommended to further investigate the potential of the denitrification-based pretreatment for the compaction of soils by exploring new methods of assessment. It is suggested to focus on implementation of a dynamic loading component to the test method and to investigate the options for execution of a field experiment. Representation of conditions that apply in practice is thereby essential. The potential of biogenic pretreatment for improvement of the engineering properties of silts and clays can also be investigated as it might be a sustainable alternative for the relatively scarce and costly coarse-grained fill material that is normally used nowadays.","denitrification; compaction; desaturation; proctor; nitrogen; biogas","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Earth Sciences","",""

The ones who need to innovate, are the employees of an organization. However, to properly innovate, the employees need to understand and be engaged with the vision and know how to apply strategy in daily practices. Yet, this is exactly what is missing. Most employees currently don’t have a clear idea of what their company’s vision and strategy entails (Kaplan &amp; Norton, 2005): research shows that only 8.7 percent of employees rated their knowledge of the company’s strategy above moderate, although they would like to know more about it (Alexander, 1994).<br/>This led to the following research question to explore in collaboration with P2 Strategy (an innovation consultancy): “How to enable P2S to get their clients’ employees to better understand, be motivated about, and apply the client’s vision and strategy into their daily work?”<br/><br/>As an answer to this question, the Visual Storytelling toolkit has been developed. The toolkit consists of tool suggestions on cards. These cards can be used by P2S to set up a tailor made workshop for a specific client, as well as staying involved with the client over a longer period of time. Visualization, materialization and storytelling are applied throughout the toolkit. The toolkit cards are divided into five steps that need to be completed by the participants (employees) during a workshop in order to reach the goal of engaged employees that can innovate in line with the vision. The five steps are:<br/>1. Valuemapper: participants individually retrieve personal values as preparation of the workshop.<br/>2. Vision Sharer: the vision and value shift are shared with the participants in an engaging way.<br/>3. Connector: the retrieved personal values are explicitly linked to the vision(‘s values).<br/>4.

Reflectioner: participants keep the vision on top of mind and reflect (with others) on the progress over a long period of time.<br/><br/>The graduation enhance the understanding of the actual use of strategy tools in both innovation consultancies and their client’s organizations. Furthermore, this study enhances our understanding of how to incorporate design in strategy activities, and that there are interesting opportunities for design (visual storytelling) in the organization field regarding routine change and engaging employees. The findings of this graduation suggest that innovation consultancies need to change their own routines, before being able to change routines of their clients - and that design, and specifically visual storytelling, is a way to do that.","visual storytelling; employee engagement; routine; vision","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

Motion shaping filters derived from Objective Motion Cueing Test measurements on the Vertical Motion Simulator were included in the SIMONA Research Simulator motion logic to match the motion cues between both simulators. Furthermore, the side sticks were set to matching characteristics and the visual cues were matched in terms of time delay, graphics size and screen characteristics. With increased motion filter order, pilots showed worse performance and a lowered contribution of motion feedback in their control strategy. Increasing the motion filter break frequency had similar effects, which were stronger than the effects of increasing the motion filter order, for the eight experimental conditions that were considered in this experiment. For the same motion condition the simulators showed offsets in the results.

Our method allows AGVs to execute reactive motion while tracking a locally parametrized reference path, anticipating on the predicted evolution of the environment. Given the static environment configuration in an occupancy grid map and dynamic obstacles represented by ellipses, we formulate explicit collision avoidance constraints. Well-informed planning decisions are made through a cost function with trade-offs between competing performance variables such as tracking accuracy, maintaining the reference velocity, and clearance from obstacles.<br/><br/>An efficient implementation of the method is presented that satisfies the real-time constraint of online navigation tasks. Furthermore, we present an implementation of a complete navigation system to emphasize our ability to deal with real sensor data and onboard processing. We show that the general definition of the framework applies to both unicycle and bicycle kinematic models, commonly used to represent mobile robots and autonomous cars, respectively. Simulation results for a car and experimental results with a mobile robot show that our method is a feasible and scalable approach. Proposed improvements of the method include 1) considering obstacle velocities and positioning with respect to the AGV in the penalty term that creates clearance, 2) incorporating prediction uncertainty of obstacles, and 3) improving our method that deals with infeasible solutions of the optimal control problem.","Trajectory Optimization; Collision Avoidance; Nonholonomic Motion Planning; Motion Control","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-12-04","","","","Electrical Engineering | Embedded Systems","",""

On average, 47% of daily train users cycle to a railway station and this number is expected to grow to until at least 2030. As a result, railway stations suffer from bicycle parking capacity shortages. Large investments are needed to meet the growing demand for bicycle parking capacity, while the expansions take up the limited space around railway stations. To address the ever-growing demand for bicycle parking capacity and to continue the success of the combined use of bicycle and PT, alternative solutions beyond building new bicycle parking facilities are needed.<br/>Bicycle sharing is a promising strategy to tackle bicycle parking capacity shortages at railway stations as it could significantly reduce the number of parked bicycles. A fundamental prerequisite is that a bicycle sharing system (BSS) makes use of the already parked bicycles, which is not the case with the available PT-bicycle system in the Netherlands. Existing literature shows that bicycle sharing between current cyclists has the potential, in theory, to reduce the number of parked bicycles by 22-25% at the central railway stations of the four largest cities in the Netherlands. When bicycles are also shared with travellers currently using other modes 37-50% capacity savings could be achieved. Currently there is a lack of knowledge about bicycle sharing from a user’s perspective to make a more realistic estimation of the expected potential. The important factors in bicycle sharing among potential users need to be clarified in order to estimate the potential demand and to progress towards the design of the organisation of an efficient system. Therefore the objective of this study is to investigate the preferences of current bicycle-train users and the demand for bicycle sharing in order to design an efficient bicycle sharing system (BSS).","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Transport, Infrastructure and Logistics","",""

However wood has historically been removed from river systems to improve flood protection, inland navigation and drink water quality. These actions reduced and degraded the aquatic habitat of the effected river systems. Rijkswaterstaat is interested in reintroducing wood to rehabilitate the aquatic (and terrestrial) habitat of river systems.<br/><br/>In order to successfully reintroduce wood in river systems it is necessary to identify where the wood comes from? How is it transported? How does it accumulate? And what are the effects on stream ecology and geomorphology? This knowledge can be used to determine if already naturally occurring wood in river systems can be managed to achieve the goal of river rehabilitation. If no or too little wood is present in the river system, an engineered solution can be used. This engineered solution is known as Engineered Log Jam (ELJ). These structures use wood as construction material to rehabilitate rivers. The stability, design and implementation of ELJs in rivers is a complex process.<br/><br/>This report provides an overview on the identification, classification, importance and management of wood in river systems. Secondly the gives an overview of studies done on the stability of wood in rivers, the design (process) of ELJs and the geomorphological impact of ELJs on river systems. <br/><br/>From the studies reviewed in this report it is clear that wood plays an important role in river systems. Wood directly effect river ecology and geomorphology by forming log jams. Proper management of wood is therefore required if one wishes to retain a healthy river system. Where one wishes to (re)introduce wood in a river system using ELJ structures the design process is vital. The first step is to identify the characteristics and properties of the river section. The second step is designing the correct ELJs for the desired goals. The last step is constructing and monitoring the ELJs. Evaluation is important to obtain points of improvement.","Wood; Rivers; LWD; ELJ","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To determine the best conceptual lay-outs, emphasis is drawn to understand the physical system to determine the effect of the expansion of the port on the natural system. The port of Bahía Blanca is situated at the end of a ria, or tidal basin. For the designs, different conceptual lay-outs are developed and simulated in a hydrodynamic model called MOHID. This is a 2D depth-averaged model (2DH), which uses a rough bathymetry grid of the ria to determine the effect of the port development. There are three mutations of the different port expansions on the environment, which are investigated using the MOHID-model: (1) the East expansion, containing reclamation of tidal flats and closure of a side channel; (2) the South expansion, containing a widening and elongation of the channel and reclamation of tidal flats; and (3) the deepening of the entire navigation channel to various minimum depths. From the results of the MOHID-model on the East expansion conclusions on the mutations of the different port expansions are drawn. For the East expansion, only small changes are predicted; only local erosion in the navigation channel near the expansion may occur. For the South expansion, the flow velocities reduce in the entire stretch and there seems to be sedimentation at the eastern part of the expansion.<br/>As a conclusion the best and most feasible designs are chosen. The best design is the lay-out that obtained the highest score in the MultiCriteria- Analysis (MCA). The most feasible design is the design having the highest cost/benefit ratio determined by a Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA). The east bank is located close to the current port, Ingeniero White, on tidal flats which are inundated at high-water and dry at low-water. For the East expansion, different port lay-outs are developed mainly differing in amount of reclaimed land, length of viaducts and the presence of a mooring basin. The best design on the east is characterised as being very compact and having small viaducts between the dry bulk and agribulk terminals and jetties. The main advantage of this design is the small expected increase of siltation, good safety and sufficient future expansion possibilities. The most feasible design, however, is characterised by long viaducts reducing the costs of the design. The other appointed location for the port expansion is the south bank, opposite of the current port development. This location, however, is characterised by one main disadvantage; It is far from any form of connection with the hinterland. Nevertheless, in 2013, the port authority (CGPBB) initiated the start of small reclamation works. The best and most feasible design fully utilises this reclaimed portion of land. Moreover, the best design has a small expected increase of siltation in the port area. For a final designs, all previous designs are combined to create a design in which all the advantages of each of the designs are fully incorporated. Therefore, this design has little reclamation as well as viaducts with only intermediate lengths.","Argentina; Bahia Blanca; Conceptual lay-out; Conceptual Port Design; Terminals; MOHID; estuary","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","","MP271",""

New in this fatigue damage sensor compared to sensors invented in the past is the fact that this sensor is both in geometry and fatigue damage mechanisms similar to aluminium welded joints. Based on the time it takes for the sensor to crack, a prediction can be made of the expected lifetime of corresponding aluminium welded joints. This prediction is based on the in the VOMAS joint industry project developed Total Stress Concept in which fatigue resistance of all aluminum welded joints is combined in a single SN curve.

(mentor); Bakker, M.F. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","This report presents the design process and the design proposal of a non-stigmatising stabilised bicycle designed for the bicycle company Beixo. With the trendy three wheel cargobike that has been designed for the problem of stability and stigma, insecure cyclists, including elderly, can cycle with confidence and stay mobile and independent. A literature study and user research using contextmapping methods were conducted to identify and understand the problem that this thesis deals with. Age-related disabilities, such as reduced balance and strength, can cause elderly people to fall with their bicycle. A fall often leads to injuries and fear of falling again. This feeling of insecurity causes many elderly to stop cycling, giving up an important part of their mobility. Assistive devices that help elderly to stay mobile, like tricycles, already exist, but these aids are perceived as stigmatising and are not easily accepted by users. Stigma is a negative judgmental reaction from bystanders to a person or person using a product caused by the visible characteristics of the person or product that are perceived as socially undesirable. This master thesis deals with the question if a bike can be designed such that it provides stability without being stigmatising. Existing research was used to find design strategies to deal with the problem of stability and stigma. The chosen design strategy included disguising the stabilizing function of the third wheel, adding additional benefits, making the design age independent and creating an association with an accepted product category. The design process consisted of design and research activities. The chosen design direction ‘cargo tricycle’ which has the potential to solve the problem of stability and of stigma was developed further into a concept and later the design proposal. The proposed design provides a solution to the problem of stability and stigma by creating a reference to cargo bikes. The bike has two front wheels in between which the cargo container is located. The bamboo container is compact and allows for easy loading of small cargo, for example groceries. The designed steering system steers the wheels around the container, allowing for light steering. The frame has a low entry and large adjustability to allow for an ergonomic cycling position for all users. The integrated shaft drive motor provides pedaling support, making cycling effortless. Its function and appearance could make this compact cargo bike suitable for many more target groups than elderly insecure cyclists, for example people who have never learned to cycle, ALS patients, people with reduced balance due to hearing impairment, people who wish to transport small loads, etc. To validate the design, a ‘looks-like-real’ working prototype was created. This prototype was showcased at the Embassy of Health during the Dutch Design Week 2018 where it received positive attention from visitors. The stability of the bike was tested by using it in everyday cycling situations in bicycle infrastructure. The subjective stability and stigma was tested with potential users, by letting them test ride the bike and asking about their experience. The design provides stability when cycling a straight path, but stability in turns can be improved. Potential users feel instable when taking turns and need to get used to the feeling of cycling on this bike. The bike is a tricycle and will never give the user the same cycling feeling as a bicycle. With a tricycle there is a trade-off between stability and a bike-like feeling. The opinion about stigma of the design differs between people. The reactions of the visitors of the Dutch Design Week were positive and indicated that avoiding stigma has been succeeded. However, not all the participants in the user evaluation agreed on this. Which product category the user compares the bike with when evaluating stigma is thought to influence the opinion about stigma and needs to be considered for the positioning of the product.","Stigma; Bicycle; Mobility aid; Elderly","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design | Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor); Hendrikse, H. (mentor); Willems, T. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","The offshore wind industry is a relatively new but fast growing field in the global shift towards renergy to reduce carbon emissions. However, more difficulties arise in the design of an offshore wind turbine (OWT) compared to an onshore wind turbine, as the offshore structures are exposed to more environmental influences. One of those is sea ice. As wind farms are being built in areas where floating sea ice exists, such as the Baltic Sea and Bohai Bay, the effect of interaction of ice with an offshore wind turbine needs to be taken into account in the design phase. Several accidents have taken place in the past, where offshore structures such as bridges, lighthouses and oil platforms were exposed to severe ice loading, leading to human discomfort and damage or even failure of the structure. Recent research has shown that ice-induced vibrations (IIV) can develop in wind turbines with a monopile foundation. This research studies IIV in a wind turbine with a jacket foundation, which is used in deeper waters. These IIV can be categorized into three regimes: intermittent crushing (IC), frequency lock-in (FLI) and continuous brittle crushing (CBR), depending on both structural and ice properties. During IC, which occurs for low ice velocities, large forces act on the structure. For higher velocities, the failure of ice ‘locks in’ with one of the structural eigenmodes, leading to the FLI mode, where cyclic loading of the structure sustains. This periodic movement affects the fatigue of the structure. When ice is moving at even higher velocities, the CBR regime begins, in which the ice load does not show a periodicity but fluctuates around a relatively low mean value, resulting in small, random oscillations of the structure around the mean deflection. In this research, the effect of these IIV on offshore wind turbines with a jacket foundation was investigated. To that end, a structural model for a 5MW wind turbine has been implemented and a preliminary study indicated that the second eigenmode is most susceptible to FLI. Next, the structural model has been coupled to a phenomenological ice model which simulates the three regimes of IIV. Case studies have shown that all IIV regimes do occur in the OWT when ice is acting on the structure; large displacements of the structure occur in IC and sustained oscillations take place in the second bending mode during FLI. Moreover, it was shown that the angle of incidence of ice has no effect on the IIV due to symmetry in the model. On the other hand, the chosen damping values have a large influence on the occurrence of IIV. Finally, it was found that a wind force solely can increase the displacements during IIV, but the aerodynamic damping involved reduces them.","ice-induced vibrations; ice; jacket","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Precision and Microsystems Engineering","",""

In the optical measurement experiments, hydrogel balls were used which have the same refractive index as that of water.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-12-03","","","","Applied Physics","",""

(mentor); Brinkgreve, R.B.J. (mentor); Gavin, Kenneth (mentor); Hendriks, M.A.N. (mentor); Haasnoot, JK (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","This thesis investigates the behavior of single and group micro piles under axial tensile loading. Micro piles are small diameter piles consist of grout and steel rebar and they are capable of absorbing tensile loads. By constructing a group of piles the bearing capacity of each pile within a group is less compared to the single pile. The reason is due to the existence of group effect in the pile group which influences the bearing capacity. During the production of the piles for Amsterdam car parking project, load tests are performed to check whether the piles behave according as expected which can be considered as acceptance tests. However in this test, only individual piles are tested and not a pile group. CUR 236 design procedure states that the bearing capacity of a pile in a pile group is less than the bearing capacity of that pile when it is loaded not in a group. To take this effect into account for the acceptance test, an additional load is added to the test load. It turned out at the Amsterdam car parking project that piles failed the acceptance tests due to this additional load which is required to apply according to CUR 236 design guide. However this procedure is questionable because the pile is loaded into a much higher level than it will actually experience during its lifetime. Therefore an evaluation of the standards and the influence of group effects on micro pile behavior is needed. The initial plan of approach was to investigate the standards of other countries and compare them to Dutch standards to find the eventual existing gap and propose an improvement method which did not succeed. The reason was that the standards of other countries were all written in their national language and therefore it was not possible to study them. Seeking for the research on tension pile group behavior did not help so much because many researchers believe that including a realistic group effect in the design is not an easy task and there was no clear conclusion on micro pile group influence. The direction of approach is then changed towards the numerical modelling and based on it the influence of group effects on micro pile behavior is presented. First a single micro pile is modelled with Finite Element Method in Plaxis. The single pile is finally modelled in plane strain by using Embedded Beam Row element. Model parameters and properties are defined based on Amsterdam case study. The load-displacement behavior of the single pile model was comparable with the one from Amsterdam field failure test and is therefore validated based on field failure test data. After development of single pile model, the model for pile groups is made. This group model is made to represent the practical situation in a building pit for Amsterdam case study. Three models for the pile group have been made which differ in pile spacing and the impact of this parameter on the capacity per micro pile is investigated. The different used pile spacings are 5D, 10D and 15D which are equal to 1 meter, 2 meters and 3 meters. Also for each pile spacing, the dominant failure mechanism is determined. According to the results it was concluded that for 5D and 10D pile spacing, the failure mechanism is based on soil plug pull-out while for 15D, it is according to slip failure. By validation of the pile group model, an improvement for the space between the piles within a pile group can be proposed as 10D where the soil plug pull-out is dominant failure mechanism. It is recommended to validate the pile group model based on full-scale failure test on pile groups or by small-scale test using Geo-centrifuge models. Also by monitoring, a real data base of the group behavior can be obtained. Comparing the monitoring data to the design values based on CUR 236 could give an idea how well the design guide is formulated.","Micropile; Plaxis; FEM; Analysis; bearing capacity; Single pile; Pile group; Axial tensile loading","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geo-Engineering","",""

This was done by an intervention study in a small village called El Progreso in the province of Colon, on the Caribbean coast of Panama. The project aims to provide safe drinking water to the 80 members of the Embera tribe, living in El Progreso. This is done by constructing rainwater harvesting tanks where rainwater will be collected from roofs of houses and school buildings and stored within the tanks. We want to investigate the impact of this system, which supplies safe drinking water on a daily basis, on the community. The construction of the storage tanks (ferrocement) will stimulate and create local entrepreneurship. In these ways we will take our first step towards a sustainable local enterprise and sustainable employment. This can ultimately result in a long-term development in the El Progreso area. The project consists of 3 study topics: the physical construction of the rainwater harvesting tanks and the project control and quality that comes with this, evaluating the quality and quantity of available water sources in the area of rainwater and rainwater and the possible changes in the community due to this project (both the influence of the newly constructed tanks on daily life as well as the presence of aid in the community and social impacts that comes along with this). The project resulted in the construction of 11 tanks, improved job opportunities for several community members, improved trust in aid organizations as well as connecting the community to a national aid network for future projects.","Intervention study; Rainwater harvesting; Panama; Indigenous community","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","","MDP261",""
