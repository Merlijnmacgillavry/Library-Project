(mentor); Künneke, R. (mentor); Weijnen, M.P.C. (mentor)","2006","As of January 1st, 2005 CO2 emission trading (CET) is implemented in the EU as a measure to reduce CO2 emissions to counter climate change. It requires that any company that exploits certain activities, such as electricity generation must acquire emission rights to account for its production of CO2. CET does provide an economic incentive to shift decision-making and thereby shift the total electricity generation portfolio. However, the long-term impact of CET on emissions by electricity generation is unknown. The objective of this research is to obtain insight into the long-term effects of CET on the electricity generation portfolio by means of a simulation model. The main question for the research is: How can the effect of CO2 emission trading (CET) on the CO2 emissions, caused by a change in the composition of the Dutch electricity generation portfolio, be elucidated with a simulation model? To an electricity producer the newly imposed CO2 costs influence the attractiveness of energy sources, because they differ in CO2 intensity – the emission per unit electricity produced. CET therefore is expected to affect investment decisions in generation capacity. As a consequence, over time CET could change the electricity generation portfolio. However, this shift is a slow process because electricity generation is capital-intensive and the installations have a long lifespan. Agent-based modelling has been chosen as modelling paradigm to assess the impact of CET on electricity generation. In that paradigm, decision rules of autonomous agents are the central object of study. Based on simulation runs over a range of scenarios it is concluded that CET leads to large but late reduction in CO2 emission. In the simulations it was found that at the end of the simulation period, emissions under CET are 25-80% lower than when CET is absent. In contrast, in the first twenty years, emission reductions were absent. That impact of CET is a caused by a shift from CO2 intensive coal power plants towards less CO2 intensive power plants. However, the shift occurs with a delay of 30-50 years. In most scenarios, because of the shift, natural gas power plants, wind farms and biomass power plants replace 50% of the coal power plants. The impact of CET in reality is expected to be even larger than assumed in the model. The impact in the first decades will probably be larger, because of the operational flexibility of some of the generation technologies. In addition, electricity producers have the possibility to invest in small units that can be operational at shorter notice than modelled. In the longer term the impact of CET may be larger because of the price elasticity of electricity demand and because of efficiency improvements and innovative technologies. Although the simulation results indicate that CET leads to emission reduction compared to non- intervention, it is not likely that the emissions are reduced to or below the cap. The main cause is increase of electricity demand. Additional research is recommended to find improvements for the design of CET in order to increase its effectiveness. In addition, the agent-based modelling environment should be further developed. A user-friendly and robust agent-based software package will lower the burden to use agent-based approaches. In addition, integration with system dynamics would increase possibilities for combining bottom-up and top- down modelling. Finally, tools should be developed for addressing the validity of agent-based models.","co2 emission trading; power generation portfolio; agent-based model; carbon policy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Technology, Policy and Management","Energy and Industry","","","",""

One method that can be tested in this direction is the creation of more detailed models of the actual airplanes via reverse engineering techniques. Laser scanning is one of these techniques. Here, a laser scanner is used to measure TU Delft’s Cessna Citation.

(mentor); Timmer, W.A. (mentor); Ferreira, C. (mentor); Mertens, S. (mentor)","2006","In recent years more focus is put on the applications of wind turbines in the urban environment. One of the ways to do this is using a turbine with a vertical axis (a VAWT). This type of wind turbines is around for many centuries. The modern equivalent which is based on lift producing blades only exists for 30 years. In this period airfoils for this application have been developed, but still much work can be done in this held. During this project a design process is developed with the purpose of improving the NACA 0018 airfoil, which is commonly used in VAWT turbines. The aerodynamics involved in VAWT are investigated to find the design goals for the airfoil characteristics. Furthermore the currently used NACA 0018, which is used as the design reference, is investigated. The two main pillars of the design process are the RFOIL program and the VAWT simulation program. RFOIL is a panel method based program with boundary layer equations which can calculate the properties of 2D airfoils. RFOIL gives accurate enough results to be a powerful design tool in the Reynolds number range from 300,000 to 700,000. The VAWT simulation program, written in MATLAB, calculates the performance of a VAWT using 2D airfoil data. The final Matlab program allows to adjust the turbines geometry, to chose from multiple airfoils and to set a dynamic stall model on or off. As such 2D airfoil characteristic from RFOIL or wind tunnel tests can be inserted to view the turbines performance with this airfoil.","Windenergy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","","","","",""

De gehele zuidoever en het westelijke deel van de noordoever worden of zijn al herontwikkeld. De zuidoever is inmiddels veel meer een onderdeel van de stad. Noord en de noordoever liggen echter nog steeds relatief geïsoleerd van het centrum. Hoewel de komst van de Noord/Zuidlijn de bereikbaarheid zal verbeteren, wordt Noord pas echt een onderdeel van de stad wanneer er een visuele verbinding wordt gemaakt. Een vaste oeververbinding over het IJ zorgt ervoor dat bewoners van Noord eenvoudiger te fiets of te voet naar het centrum kunnen. Om ook mensen uit het centrum naar de andere kant van het Centraal Station te krijgen, moet er een reden zijn om over te steken. Dit extra programma kan op de noordoever worden gesitueerd, maar ook op de brug zelf. Dan wordt de brug een living bridge. Het ontwerp van deze living bridge was het hoofddoel van dit afstudeerproject. De scheepvaart speelde en speelt nog steeds een belangrijke rol voor Amsterdam, en is daarom een zeer belangrijke randvoorwaarde voor de living bridge. Het vervoer van gevaarlijke stoffen over water zal moeten worden gereguleerd om op de brug en de functies op en aan de brug voldoende veiligheid te garanderen. De scheepvaart wordt daarvoor gescheiden in verschillende vaargeulen. Beroepsvaart wordt verdeeld over twee vaargeulen, zodat éénrichtingsverkeer ontstaat. Het vervoer van brandbaar gas wordt beperkt tot de nacht, zodat overdag slechts nog rekening moet worden gehouden met brandbare vloeistoffen, voornamelijk benzine. Wanneer een voldoende brandwerend gevelsysteem wordt toegepast, kunnen direct naast de vaargeul verblijfsfuncties (voor gebruik overdag) worden geplaatst. Woningen kunnen pas vanaf 25 meter van de vaargeul worden gebouwd, in verband met de ’s nachts varende gasschepen.","","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Design and Construction","","","",""

As a part of intentions to optimise the design of Artificial Surf Reefs, this thesis is aimed at gaining insight into the wave-induced circulations and the wave-current interactions around an artificial reef. Impacts of the channel width on these processes were assessed by varying the width of the channel. Several surf-ability parameters were measured or observed to verify the performance of the proposed design. The surface currents on either side of the reef show a decrease in intensities and dimensions resulting in less intense wave-current interactions around the structure. It was found that rip currents with a Froude number smaller than 0.1 do not cause negative impact on the breaker shapes.","","en","master thesis","TU Delft, Faculty of Civil Engineering and Geosciences, Hydraulic Engineering","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","","","","",""

Gouda heeft onlangs een nieuw ontwerp goedgekeurd voor een nieuw alomvattend stadhuis buiten het centrum. Bij de sectie urban architecture van de faculteit bouwkunde aan de TUDelft is een alternatief voorstel gedaan dat boven de daken van het oude centrum is geplaatst. Dit afstuderen heeft zich geconcentreerd op de technische consequenties daarvan. Allereerst is de daglichttoetreding van de onderliggende woningen onder de loep genomen. Zonder maatregelen zouden de onderliggende woningen veroordeeld zijn tot een beroevend niveau van natuurlijk licht. Geprobeerd is de vorm van het gebouw dusdanig te wijzigen dat de hoeveelheid daglicht voor de onderliggende woningen gemaximaliseerd werd, zonder de architectonisch / stedenbouwkundige compositie te wijzigen. Vervolgens moest het volume op zijn plaats worden gehouden door een serie ondersteuningen, maar in het bestaande netwerk van straten, pleinen en binnenplaatsen was daarvoor maar weinig ruimte. Een afweging is gemaakt tussen verschillende draagconstructie alternatieven en daarna is met fysieke en virtuele modellen gezocht naar een optimum. Het ruimtegebrek op maaiveld leidde ook tot een complex montagevraagstuk. Het montageplan bleek een vierdimensionale puzzel die direct gekoppeld was aan de keuzes voor de bezonning, opleggingen en detaillering, en moest daarom al vroeg in beschouwing worden genomen. Tot slot is gezocht naar een detaillering die de gewenste montage mogelijk maakt, door een efficiente knoopaansluiting die het constructiegewicht laag houdt.","","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Design and Construction","","","",""
