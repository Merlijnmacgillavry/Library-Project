(mentor); Neerincx, M. (mentor)","2013","De Interactive Intelligence Group (IIG) is een langlopende samenwerking met ProRail aangegaan, in een project genaamd RAILROAD. Het doel van dit project is om ProRail’s capaciteit om met calamiteiten en verstoring om te kunnen gaan te verbeteren. In deze context is er voor dit bachelorproject een monitor gemaakt die cognitieve belasting en emotionele toestand meet. De monitor is specifiek ontworpen voor de observatie van treindienstleiders bij ProRail. Het geeft op grafische wijze een real-time classificering van de gemeten cognitieve belasting en emotionele toestand van de gebruiker. Zowel de berekening voor de cognitieve belasting als de emotionele toestand vereist een wetenschappelijk model. Het model dat voor de cognitieve belasting is gebruikt, berekent dit op basis van taken die de gebruiker uitvoert. Voor de emotionele toestand is een model gebruikt dat de toestand aan de hand van een hartslag- en huidgeleidingsmeter berekent. In de implementatie van dit model in de monitor wordt hier voornamelijk het stressniveau van iemand mee bepaald. De monitor is een Windows-applicatie geschreven in C#, in combinatie met het .NET framework. Het ontwerp van de monitor is erop gericht om deze makkelijk aanpasbaar te maken; wetenschappelijke modellen zijn immers in constante ontwikkeling. De monitor is domein-specifiek met betrekking tot de werkzaamheden van de gebruiker, maar kan met een kleine wijziging geschikt gemaakt worden voor andere domeinen. Tijdens de implementatiefase is gebruik gemaakt van agile ontwikkelingstechnieken zoals Scrum. Hiermee kon er in deze fase flexibel gereageerd worden op onverwachte gebeurtenissen of additionele informatie. De monitor is met behulp van een ProRail expert gevalideerd. De kwaliteit van de code is door de Software Improvement Group (SIG) beoordeeld. Het grootste punt van feedback bij de eerste beoordeling was dat er enkele cirkelreferenties in de code aanwezig waren. De monitor is een goede eerste stap in het vaststellen van de individuele capaciteiten van treindienstleiders op hectische momenten. Wanneer dit voor meerdere treindienstleiders tegelijk toegepast wordt kunnen de taken die vervuld moeten worden optimaal verdeeld worden. Hiermee kan een begin gemaakt worden met de verbetering van de capaciteit om met calamiteiten en verstoringen om te kunnen gaan.","cognitie; emotie; computer","nl","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","2013-08-06","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Computer Science","","","",""

(mentor)","2013","The growth in technology and increased public interest has brought about a rapid evolution in the realm of e-mobiilty. While generally viewed as non-polluting and environmentally friendly, the Electrical Vehicles (EVs) could still contribute significantly towards indirect emissions, depending on the source of their energy. The only way they can be made truly emission free is if they are charged from renewable energy sources. This thesis aims at designing such a charging station powered by solar energy. The charging station would cater to the most popular type of Light Electric Vehicles (LEVs) - the e-bikes, and would be located at Delft in the Netherlands. Given that the Netherlands is estimated to have close to a million e-bikes already in use, the design of such a charging station would undoubtedly heighten the positive impact of LEVs. Firstly, the amount of solar energy that can be harnessed in the Netherlands is accurately found out. A photovoltaic (PV) model is developed to predict the PV module yields based on minimal weather parameters. The PV model gives a Module Ideality Factor that is indicative of the drop in PV yield due to temperature and irradiance effects. Two main system topologies are analyzed - an autonomous charging station and a grid-connected charging station - under two different load profiles. While the system reliability is of primary concern in an autonomous charging station, the electrical autarky and the Effective Autarky Ratio are optimized for sizing the grid-connected system. Lifetime estimation models are developed to predict the PV module and battery lifetimes. A basic economical analysis is performed to determine the financial viability of such a project. At large scales (several kW), the system is shown to have a Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCOE) that is grid competitive. Finally, the environmental impact of the system is studied. It is concluded that the implementation of such a charging station is not only technically feasible, but is also environmentally friendly and economically viable, especially at large scales.","Solar; Light Electric Vehicle; LEV; Charging; Charging Station; Electric Vehicle; EV; Renewable Energy; e-mobility; Photovoltaic; PV; Electrical Autarky; e-bike","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Applied Sciences","Photovoltaic Materials and Devices","","Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

(mentor); Pribic, R. (mentor)","2013","Compressive sensing (CS) provides a new paradigm in data acquisition and signal processing in radar, based on the assumptions of sparsity of an unknown radar scene, and the incoherence of the transmitted signal. The resolution in the conventional pulse-compression radar is foreseen to be improved by the implementation of CS. An unknown sparse radar scene can then be recovered through CS with a high probability, even in the case of an underdetermined linear system. However, the theoretical framework of CS radar has to be verified in an actual radar system, accounting for practical system aspects, such as the signal bandwidth, ease of generation and acquisition, system complexity, etc. In this thesis, we investigate linear frequency modulated (LFM), Alltop and Björck waveforms, which show theoretically favorable properties in a CS-radar system, in the basic radar problem of range-only estimation. The aforementioned waveforms were investigated through a model of a digital radar system - from signal generation in the transmitter, to sparse signal recovery in the receiver. The capabilities of the CS-radar versus the conventional pulse compression radar were demonstrated, and the Alltop and Björck sequences are proven to outperform the commonly used linear LFM waveform in typical CS-radar scenarios.","compressive sensing; radar; waveform; optimization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Circuits and Systems","","","",""

(mentor); Wijekoon, T. (mentor); Panosyan, A. (mentor); Baerthlein, E. (mentor)","2013","In recent years, high penetration of distributed generation (DG) driven by PV panels and heavy load insertion in the distribution network has led to frequent voltage fluctuations in the form of undervoltage and overvoltage. Voltage control using traditional voltage regulators are unable to cope with this situation as frequent tap changes reduce the lifetime of the mechanical taps due to arcing. Further, the nature of European distribution network in general, makes voltage control through shunt compensation methods typically ineffective and expensive. Series compensation through centralized on-load tap changing (OLTC) distribution transformers or feeder-specific compensators is hence a suitable strategy for voltage regulation in Europe. The thesis work describes the design of a novel, power electronic assisted OLTC transformer that provides voltage regulation in the European distribution network through series compensation. The aim is to ensure that the tap changes occur in an arc free manner, thus providing for long lifetime of the OLTC. Different topologies for OLTC are examined in detail and shortlisted based on the steady state operation and power ratings of transformer and switches required. A novel design of a partially rated autotransformer is proposed which has taps developed through a combination of no-load switches and a single hybrid switch. The hybrid switch is composed of a mechanical switch and two semiconductor switches which are used for steady state and tap change operation respectively. The mechanical switch ensures low steady state losses and the semiconductor switches are used for arc-free tap changing. Back-back series connected IGBT with anti-parallel diodes are used for the two semiconductor switches and voltage polarity based 4-step commutation is used for commutation between the taps. The novel design of the OLTC autotransformer is cost effective, efficient and has long lifetime. The complete system is simulated in the PLECS and the steady state and transient operation of the system have been investigated. The OLTC has customized for application in both MV and LV three phase distribution network. Detailed study of the failure mechanisms owing to internal and external faults is performed and possible protection mechanisms are suggested. A low level control mechanism is also developed, thus providing a holistic design for building a prototype.","OLTC; Power electronic assisted tap changer; Voltage regulation; Distributed generation; 4 step commutation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Electrical Sustainable Energy","","Electrical Power Processing","",""

(mentor); Van der Lei, T. (mentor); De Vries, P. (mentor)","2013","Manufacturing organizations have to become more competitive. There are two important things a company can do: become more efficient in all operations and introduce new products. Total Productive Maintenance (TPM) is a production philosophy that contributes to more efficiency. The introduction of new products sometimes require new production lines, which have to be started up. In this research TPM and the startup of a new production line come together. This thesis tries to create more insight in what influences the success of the TPM elements Early Equipment Management (EEM), Autonomous Maintenance (AM) and Training and Education (T&E) in the startup of a new production line by investigating the three elements during a case study at the packaging department of Heineken Zoeterwoude. Success has a different definition looking at the three elements. EEM success is defined as equipment satisfaction and vertical startup. AM success is defined as a quick and successful implementation of AM step three in the new line. Finally T&E success is defined as what operators find important in a T&E program during a startup. This research searched for factors that influence these successes. To realize this, this research first broadly consolidated TPM literature which appeared not to be sufficient. Additional theory was needed. Therefore the three elements were thoroughly observed and studies at Heineken, to find similarities with other theories. This showed that looking at the success of EEM, theory on systems engineering, production startup (problems) and project and process management seemed applicable to add possible influential factors. AM at Heineken showed that a lot of general TPM implementation barriers appeared (apart from AM barriers). Therefore theory on general TPM implementation barriers seem appropriate to add possible influential factors to AM. T&E was a bit harder, because it was obvious that theory on learning seems applicable, but hard to investigate. Therefore the choice was made to look for factors that could improve learning and let operators elaborate on these. Theory on learning improvement was therefore used. To investigate all factors, for each elements different important responders were questioned and on top of that extensive observations were done by close participation in the startup. This research showed that for EEM, theory on systems engineering could be a important contributor to EEM success. Also theory on production startup (problems) has to be taken into account since factors form this theory could influence EEM success. The impact of project and process management was not really indicated in this research, but there contribution to EEM success is assumed, because factors from project and process management do influence other factors (that do influence EEM success). Secondly this research showed that apart from AM barriers, general TPM implementation barriers have a large impact on a successful implementation of AM in the startup of a new production line. Thirdly this research showed that theory on learning improvement is important to show what operators find important in a T&E program when starting up a new line. Finally this research showed that there are a lot of relation between influential factors looking at the three elements. Factors influencing each other suggests that some are higher in hierarchy as others. Looking at all the influential factors, their descriptions given by respondents and the relations between them, made it easy to set very tangible recommendations for Heineken, so that these elements can be more successfully managed in future startups.","Total Productive Maintenance (TPM); Early Equipment Management (EEM); Autonomous Maintenance (AM); Training & Education (T&E); Production start-up","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2016-07-15","Technology, Policy and Management","Energy & Industry","","SEPAM","",""

That is, society calls for a higher embedding of values and ethics within the innovation process, especially with regards to sustainability. However, so far practical application of Responsible Innovation frameworks remains mostly at policy or academic level, while it is still scarce at firm level. Furthermore, innovation process' enhancement in the highly-competitive automotive industry has become a hot topic in the last decade, especially given the increasing pressures from consumers and governments, towards more sustainable vehicles while still maintaining competitive pricing. However, not all car manufacturers can be considered as highly-innovative as it may appear from an industry with such a tough and complex environment and technical development pace. This thesis carries out a case study of one of those firms (SEAT), and through a benchmarking framework, it intends to point out the most significant performance improvement areas when compared to the best-in-class firms from a cross-industry range, regarding the innovation processes of new product development. The emphasis is placed on Responsible Innovation, supported by other emerging approaches such as Open Innovation and Co-creation. This benchmarking process lead to an elaboration of a best-practices code for 'product innovation' processes’ management, which can be extrapolated to other firms of the automotive industry, as well as the future development of innovation culture change strategies to be carried out within this firm. Coevally, lessons are intended to be applicable to other firms, for allowing cross-industry learning. These lessons, in the form of best-practices, entitled measures for: increasing participation of all relevant internal and external stakeholders, improving the anticipation for the bi-directional interaction of innovation and the socio-technical context, enriching and deepening the deliberation process, and increasing the capability for responsiveness and reflexivity. These are extensively enlisted as recommendations both for academic and company purposes.","responsible innovation; innovation process; benchmarking; car manufacturer; open innovation; co-creation; best practices","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-12-31","Technology, Policy and Management","Technology Dynamics & Sustainable Development","","Management of Technology","",""

The goal of this study was to quantitatively evaluate the performance and learning characteristics of EMG-, force- and hand joystick-based interfaces. The human operator abilities were assessed in 8 healthy subjects using a screen-based one-dimensional position-tracking task, where the interface signal was mapped to the velocity of the cursor and the target was moving according to a multi-sine signal with a flat velocity spectrum. The performance of the control interfaces was evaluated in terms of tracking error, human-operator bandwidth, information transmission rate and effort. Results showed significant differences between the control interfaces in all the performance descriptors: the joystick-based interface presented significantly higher tracking error compared to EMG- (p<0.001) and force-based (p<0.005) interfaces; the EMG-based control interface showed a significantly higher bandwidth (p<0.001) than the force- and the joystick-based interfaces; the force- and joystick-based interfaces provided significantly higher information transmission rates (p<0.001) than the EMG-based interface; the force-based interface presented significantly lower effort than EMG- (p<0.001) and joystick-based (p<0.005) interfaces. None of the evaluated interfaces was superior in all four performance descriptors, but the force-based interface presented more positive results than the EMG- and joystick-based interfaces. However, in practice, the performance descriptors should be weighted according to the requirements of the specific application to determine which interface is the most suitable for the control of a particular active upper-extremity movement-assistive device.","control interface; electromyography; force; joystick; performance evaluation; learning curve; human-operator","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2014-07-29","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","BME","",""

(mentor)","2013","Fibre Reinforced Polymer bridge decks, thanks to their beneficial properties and various advantages over traditional materials, have great potential as a material used in bridge engineering. They exercise high specific strength and stiffness-to-weight-ratio, a property particularly interesting from the point of view of designers, as it provides the possibility to consider new design concepts and what´s more significant, enables dead load savings, which is particularly important while retrofitting existing structures by replacing old bridge decks. Over the last 30 years, many authors have studied and conducted research for FRP composite bridge deck which are gaining greater acceptance as the materials of choices for civil and infrastructure applications. Nevertheless, many aspects still need to be addressed before a widespread introduction of this new technology is possible. The purpose of this research is to provide an overview and investigate the performance of FRP decking system used to upgrade old movable bridges when composite action is provided between the deck adhesively bonded with the main girders. This thesis will firstly introduce the literature research investigating the structural analysis of FRP decking systems. Afterwards, the efficiency of using FRP decks for upgrading old movable bridges is investigated through three-dimensional finite element models based on the use of commercial software Abaqus. Three different FRP decks, Ecosafe from Lightweight Structures BV, ASSET from Fiberline and Duraspan from Martin Marietta Composites are used to investigate the upgrading and deck replacement of the old movable bridge, Wilhelminabrug located in Zaandam, The Netherlands. Due to the deterioration of the steel superstructure, a preliminary investigation for each deck is computed using three different configuration of steel superstructure, alternating the main girder span and the availability of cross beams, during the static analysis in order to find the most suitable solution. The composite behaviour of the bridge and lateral load distribution are further examined for each of three decks using the strain distribution. Moreover, the fatigue life assessment is analyzed using the cumulative damage method for the FRP deck and the simplified ?-method for the steel superstructure. Lastly, the effect of temperature differences in vertical deflection is considered and a small parametric study is considered. Based on the results of this research, it can be concluded that FRP decking systems offer remarkable potential when low self-weight is a crucial demand of the project. The investigation suggests that the deflection (SLS) governs the design as opposed to strength (ULS), although with the right superstructure configuration the requirements can be met. Composite action and lateral load distribution are additional advantages that adhesively bonded FRP decks offer in bearing the external loadings. Upgrading old movable bridges with FRP decks acting compositely with steel girders is to be considered as a feasible option their rehabilitation.","Fiber Reinforced Polymer FRP; FRP deck; composite bridge; hybrid bridge; composite action; effective width; adhesive bonded connection; lateral distribution; fatigue","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-10-15","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","Structural and Building Engineering","",""

(mentor); Van den Ham, E.R. (mentor); Ray, N. (mentor)","2013","The goal of this thesis is to propose a strategy that will allow Priva, a Dutch developer of Building Management Systems, to offer value to more stakeholders of the building industry, on top of the facility manager and the owner and tenant of the building, which are the currently targeted stakeholders. The approach of this thesis involves internal and external research. Internal research consists of interviews with the company’s managers and analysis of the company’s vision, brand, business model, and current strategy. External research entails interviews with stakeholders of the building industry and extensive literature and technology trends review. Interviews with stakeholders of the building industry revealed that feedback on various aspects is valuable to stakeholders and can be offered to them through Priva systems. Energy performance, installation performance and people’s performance are the performance aspects that Priva could offer services for. The stakeholders that have been identified as most interested through the research are Architects, Systemhouses (Priva Partners), Owner/Tenant, and Facility Manager, Certification Consultants, and Academic Researchers. Wireless Smart Sensors have gathered momentum in many industries due to the up-and-coming “Internet of Things”, where they will have application in numerous domains. In order to be easily deployed and in large numbers, they need to require little tooling and installing (“plug-n-play”) and be self-powered, eliminating as much wiring as possible. Large, complicated, all-in-one systems have important drawbacks: they are more expensive to install, harder to commission and more difficult to maintain (if one aspect is not working, the technician has to enter the whole system). Also, they do not allow a more flexible business model to support them, as it is not possible to offer different versions of the system for different client needs. On the other hand, modular systems with discrete components are easier to commission and maintain and upgrade. They can survive easier in a landscape full of diverse communication protocols and standards, and in a fragmented business environment. Close and long-lasting business relationship with both the Priva’s Partners (Building System Contractors and Systemhouses) and the end-clients (building tenants, owners and investors) are important for Priva’s success. This is fueled by the nature of the fragmented building industry. Priva’s Partners, are an essential part of Priva’s current business model, and are key part of the first step of the final strategy proposal. Before attempting to reach new stakeholders, it is vital to know how to keep the current ones. Priva’s main value proposition is turning to software from hardware, as Priva is more competent in the knowledge-intensive domain of software. That means that what clients pay for is what the software has to offer them. Internal interviews revealed that Priva is adopting a Product Leadership strategy and that top management has the vision of offering Performance Management services in the future. The latter is key to the organization as it matches the Software orientation and Business-to-Business domain. Priva is not serving consumers, so residencies are not targeted. Sharing components, if not the whole platform, between Horticulture and LWE is desired, as the potential economies of scale and shorter time for development are considerable. Through the interviews, a vision of Priva has been formulated: “Global product leadership in performance management solutions for the non-residential built environment”. The proposed strategy has three steps: short-term (3-5 years), mid-term (5-10 years) and long-term (10-15 years). The first, short-term step is called “Secure”. For this step, a new hardware and software platform are designed. Their goal is to offer value to the Priva Partners, making the installation of the system much easier and faster, and make the preparations for delivery of services to more stakeholders in the second step. This hardware/software architecture has three levels : sensor/actuator, gateway, and server. The software consists of a basic platform-Priva environment and many applications that can be bought separately. Every application corresponds to a performance aspect. The hybrid hardware concept reduces drastically the wiring required to deploy in a building and makes the coupling of sensors, actuators, dashboards and gateways much faster and easier. Wireless sensors, especially, are self-powered and they only have to be taken out of the box and ‘stuck’ on a pre-specified location in the room. The installation becomes even more easy, fast and cheap and it is highly compatible with retrofits and refurbishments. Leasing services are easier to implement. Finally, it promotes closer business relationships with Business Partners and end-clients. The second, mid-term step is called “Expand”. This step is about enlarging the scope of services by offering more value to more stakeholders. This steps consists of gathering data that relate to performance aspects that stakeholders are interested in and offer performance analysis and management in a visually appealing and easy to navigate environment. Regarding the performance aspects that are valuable to the stakeholders, the interviews confirmed that complicated performance indications are not valuable. It appears that only core performance aspects are interesting. Energy performance, installation performance, ROI and people’s well-being (thermal comfort, lighting, air quality) were mentioned by participants. Quantitative performance indicators are proposed for all the aspects that the interviewees mentioned as interesting. Performance management will be delivered to stakeholders through online servers, also known as the ‘Cloud’ and visualized through BIM software, a common communication platform that all targeted stakeholders are expected to use by then. The third, long-term step is called “Lead”. It is about securing the new position through synergetic solutions and leadership in the domain of performance management for the non-residential built environment. Using ‘Big Data’ processing methods, it is possible to find patterns and insights in the vast amounts of data flowing the storages. Connecting this with the then-ready performance management analysis tool can form a two-way risk & trade-offs management tool. The proposed strategy involves many shifts from the current Priva products and operations. This is contradictory to the conservative nature of the building industry, making the strategy more of a framework for innovation, rather than a definitive roadmap.","building management; building performance; building stakeholders; high performance building","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2014-07-26","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor)","2013","In this report is written what kind of influence oil has on the injection rate in geothermal wells. The geothermal well in Pijnacker (Ammerlaan) is used as a reference and their production water and produced oil is used in the experiments. The experiment consist of a microcell filled with beach sand in which production water with different quantities of oil is injected. The set-up was first tested by comparing the permeability derived from three different theories. After these tests the permeability of tap water, oil/brine mixtures of 0 ppm, 100 ppm, 1000 ppm and 10000 ppm oil are compared. The difference between 0 ppm and 100 ppm oil is about 8 Darcy while the difference between tap water and the 0 ppm oil mixture is 8 Darcy. The difference between the mixtures is caused by oil. The oil clogs and lowers the permeability. The difference between the brine and tap water is caused by some solvents in the production water which create an external filter cake on top of the sample.

Overall, misconceptions and stakeholder's lack of a common understanding of the system complexity limit the cooperation between the stakeholders. In this project a system dynamics model is developed to serve as a tool to support strategic conversations concerning water supply between stakeholders in this part of rural South Africa. As such, the modeling objective of this project is defined as: ""To deepen the understanding of the performance of Greater Kirkwood’s water supply system"". During the model construction process and as these questions were answered, three key dilemma’s in management and operation of the water distribution in this part of rural South Africa have surfaced: technical system aspects versus perceived social systemic injustice; short-term supply disruptions versus long-term supply disruptions; adding pipeline infrastructure versus overall system capacity. These identified key dilemma’s should be used as input for strategic stakeholder conversations in order to open the ongoing discussions on responsibilities and water management in Sunday’s River Valley Municipality.","system dynamics; stakeholders; water supply system; multi actor system","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Multi Actor Systems","","Policy Analysis","","-33.400018, 25.442046"

(mentor); Boersma, B. (mentor); Bierbooms, W. (mentor)","2013","Fatigue damage calculations are conducted as state-of-art design process for wind turbines. Fatigue analysis is performed on spar caps and trailing edge tape (UD material) considering uni-axial stress state. The main objective of the research project is to analyze the effect of various parameters like yaw errors, wind turbine design load cases and blade mass imbalances on fatigue damage of blade. Also, an overall structural study of the blade has been performed based on the guidelines of International Electro-technical Commission (IEC) 61400-1 Ed. 3 to understand the structural robustness of blade in terms of stiffness and strength. Loads based on an onshore site have been generated using aero-(servo)-elastic code, Fatigue Aerodynamics Structural and Turbulence (FAST). Based on these loads and predominantly linear Finite Element Model (FEM) calculations on a blade model in ANSYS (except for flapwise loading on spar caps), stress time series are calculated. Finally, using these stress time series, the fatigue damage at different blade sections are calculated in ’Octave’ environment using rain-flow cycle counting method and Miner’s rule. Results show that blade is stiff enough from blade-tower interference and resonance per- spective, but buckling is observed in the trailing edge close to the tip, with flapwise buckling mode coming out as the most critical one. Fatigue is not a structural issue based on state-of- art calculations and design load cases, even in the critical transition region (from circular to DU airfoil along the span of the blade). It was found that positive yaw errors are more detri- mental to fatigue life than negative ones for an anti-clockwise rotating turbine. Trailing edge tape is more affected by blade mass imbalance while spar caps are sensitive to changes in yaw errors in terms of fatigue life. Power production design load case is completely dominating fatigue life when compared to start up and shutdown load cases. All the results that have been presented here are based on a particular wind site conditions, a specific blade and a wind turbine model. The idea has been to give a qualitative and relative overview of different trends in the structural analysis, rather than coming to a conclusion in an absolute sense. Due to the presence of considerable cone angle, shaft tilt and rotor overhang, blade-tower interference is not an issue for the analyzed blade design. It should be, however, considered to increase the trailing edge tape length towards the tip region to prevent buckling issues. Also, extra core materials could be provided (thus increasing bending stiffness and thickness) to prevent buckling problems. Operation of turbine under other significant loading conditions like icing and heavy leading edge erosion should be incorporated to study fatigue in more detail. Fatigue life should be evaluated and validated with models other than Miner’s sum (for example, residual strength degradation model) along with full blade test (for an existent blade) for precise results. An aero-elastic stability analysis of full wind turbine model should be performed to understand the dynamics of whole system on blades. Finally, fatigue damage in bond lines between different components of blade is also a critical consideration for future work.","wind energy; fatigue; structural analysis; wind turbine; blade; composite","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-07-24","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Process and Energy","","Sustainable Process and Energy Technology","",""

(mentor)","2013","Domestic drinking water systems are the final stage of the transport process to deliver potable water to the customers tap. Although these systems play an important role in drinking water quality only several researches on the edge of residence time and temperature were performed during the past. These two parameters play an important role in microbial growth and metal leaching. Past research was performed on the appearance of Legionella in domestic drinking water systems, occurrence of hotspots which influence the drinking water temperature and the microbial growth and leaching of metals in stagnant water. However, the fluid dynamics which are present in domestic drinking water systems due to highly variable demand patterns were not included yet. By the use of SIMDEUM consumer demand patterns could be modeled, and drinking water dynamics can be approached. The Dutch legislation on drinking water prescribes the temperature at the tap should not exceed the threshold of 25°C. However, any scientific basis for this threshold was not found in the literature. Nor could it be obtained from interviews with experts. During this master thesis research a model was developed to calculate the temperature in domestic drinking water systems. Afterwards several scenarios were calculated to investigate the effects of e.g. hot summer days, pipe concealment, housing types and hotspots on the drinking water temperature. This research is a first exploration in the field of drinking water temperature modeling in domestic systems, since empirical data on temperature in domestic drinking water systems is not available. It was found that residence time influences the microbial growth more than temperature does. Demand pattern changes in time have more influence than demand volume changes since water in the domestic drinking water system is heated relatively fast. The results of this research have consequences for the in house sampling method of Dutch water companies (RDT sampling) which is used to measure the water temperature within the drinking water supply system before the water meter. Water is heated while it passes the domestic drinking water system before it is sampled at the kitchen tap. Hence the actual temperature in the drinking water distribution system will be lower than RDT measurements show.","drinking water; temperature; domestic","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Water Management","","Sanitary Engineering","",""

(mentor); Van Gulijk, C. (mentor); Nikolic, I. (mentor)","2013","The events of the Arab spring reminds us how individual citizens have the power to overthrow powerful regimes and destabilize complete regions. The dynamics of such bottom-up instigated revolutions seem to be in line with the (Social) Constructivism paradigm. The problem though, is that this paradigm lacks a powerful forecasting method that could have identified the Arab spring as a possible future event on beforehand. However the similar Complex Adaptive Systems paradigm does have a powerful forecasting tool; Agent-Based modeling. After an exploratory literature study we discovered that it is unlikely that Agent-Based modeling is applied by NATO state intelligence services for their forecasts on geopolitical dynamics on a Strategic level. This despite our expectations that Agent-Based modeling would be a lot more powerful in analyzing strategic geopolitical dynamics than the current methods of NATO state intelligence services. To confirm our expectations we performed an exploratory study to; How Agent-Based modeling can add value to the Strategic Geopolitical Intelligence process of NATO state intelligence services? Base on a literature study we have identified: * What makes Agent-Based modeling suitable for the Strategic Geopolitical Intelligence process, compared to other methods; * How currently the Strategic Geopolitical Intelligence process is executed by NATO state intelligence services; and * Which criteria should be used to compare the value of different Strategic Geopolitical Intelligence processes. The criteria were used to identify limitations of the current Strategic Geopolitical Intelligence process. For each of these limitations we checked whether Agent-Based modeling would be suitable to overcome (partly) the limitations. This resulted in the following list of how Agent-Based modeling can add value to the Strategic Geopolitical Intelligence process: * Risk scenarios can be built in line with the Complex Adaptive Systems paradigm, thereby increasing the external validity of analyses of volatile states; * A high number of risk scenarios can be taken into account, thereby decreasing the likelihood of unexpected events and allowing the development of more detailed scenarios; * Sensitivity analyses can be executed to assess intelligence, to take into account the uncertainty of intelligence, identify critical unknowns, determine de-warning indicators for negative warnings, prioritize indicators in the intelligence collection plan, provide bandwidth values for relevant critical unknowns and develop more accurate conditional conclusions. This allows for more intelligence to be used, providing more focus in the intelligence gathering process and be explicit about the uncertainty of the conclusions; * The intelligence analyst can gain a better understanding of the dynamics of the system under study, thereby increasing the transferability of the analysis as well as the external validity in the long run; * The Strategic Geopolitical Intelligence process will become more quantitative, thereby making the process more objective and increase internal validity, reliability and confirmability; * Explicit integration between near term- and mid/long term assessments can be realized, due to same detail the Agent-Based model will provide for both types of scenarios. Thereby making the process less costly, increase internal validity, reliability and confirmability; and * (Adaptive) Policies can be deducted and developed based on the risk scenario set, thereby making more effective and pro-active policies. In order to evaluate our own findings and provide a starting point for NATO to introduce Agent-Based modeling into their doctrine, we have designed a new Strategic Geopolitical Intelligence process that utilizes all these benefits of Agent-Based modeling. Based on literature and our own experience with executing a large part of this process on an actual case, we are confident that it is possible to implement our new Strategic Geopolitical Intelligence process design into practice. However we have also discovered that integrating Agent-Based modeling into the Strategic Geopolitical Intelligence process can significantly extend the duration of the analysis. Therefore it depends on the case and the available time for the analysis, whether it is sensible to apply the new Agent-Based modeling driven Strategic Geopolitical Intelligence process or the traditional Strategic Geopolitical Intelligence process. We especially recommend that based on our thesis, some research will be done to; * Increase the validity of our findings; * Identify under which circumstances it is still practical to use Agent-Based modeling in the Strategic Geopolitical Intelligence process; and * Iteratively improve in practice our new Strategic Geopolitical Intelligence process.","agent-based modeling; complex adaptive systems; methodology; strategic geopolitical intelligence process; volatile states","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Safety Science Group","","Systems Engineering, Policy Analysis & Management","",""

(mentor); Flipsen, S.F.J. (mentor)","2013","This graduation project focused on the scooter. Scooters offer cheap, flexible and reliable transport. However, their emissions are quite high. This leads to the problem description for this project: energy efficiency in current scooters is not as high as it can be. A lot of improvement can be gained in the vehicles efficiency by regenerating brake energy. Regeneration of this energy may lead to less fuel consumption, but also to lower emissions. In this project a prototype of a hybrid scooters was designed to deliver a proof of principle that confirms this assumption. Before prototyping was started, a study is conducted into the behavior of drivers. The results show that scooter drivers coast far more than they brake. For the scooter driver it has more priority to maintain speed during a trip, than to sprint from traffic light to traffic light. This study also shows that during braking about 9% of the energy that is needed to make a drive, can be regenerated. A prototype has been made to test the concept in practice. The tests show that the hybrid scooter can regenerate, store and utilize energy. Difficulties occurred in the cooperation between the capacitors and the motor controller. Regeneration at full power was therefore impossible. This leads to the conclusion of the project, which is a story with two sides. On the one hand, it is confirmed that the prototypes functions work. However, the prototype does not meet the expectations. The reason for this is that the motor controller can not handle this application. Therefore a full custom controller should be developed for application in the hybrid scooter. A controller without compromises may be able to show promising result. Returning to the research question it can be confirmed that an improvement in energy efficiency can be gained, but a statement of the size of this percentage can not be made.","Regenerative Braking scooter; energy efficiency","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2014-07-23","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","","",""

Therefore this paper proposes a new design and approach of a continuum manipulator, which can navigate through an environment with obstacles by passively shaping the manipulator along the obstacles. The proposed design consists of a sequence of crosslink segments, where steering is done by an antagonistic pair of tendons and forward movement is done by a single pushing force at the base of the manipulator. Analytical models and a prototype show that this manipulator has a highly increased range of motion per segment compared with similar systems. The results also show that the manipulator is able to reach a target in a multi-obstacle environment using a simple binary control system with low input forces.","continuum manipulators; environmental interaction; underactuated mechanisms","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-09-22","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","BMD","",""

(mentor); Flipsen, F.S.J. (mentor)","2013","BACKGROUND Several elements displayed in the 2011 MEErP’s (Methodology for the Ecodesign of Energy-related Products) and JRC’s (European Commission Joint Research Centre) reports which will be used in preparatory studies for measures under the recast of the Ecodesign Directive, indicate that a European list of Critical Raw Materials (CRM’s) constituting the basis for a large amount of EEE (Electrical and Electronic Equipment) consumer products are under pressure. Those CRM’s could consequently be restricted by the future European legislation, thereby impacting industrial designers’ work. In both reports, the word “reuse” appears as one of the possible ways for the treatment of end of use-stage products. With the creation of the Ellen MacArthur Foundation in 2010, the idea of a “circular economy” appeared. The aim of circular economy is to close this loop by recovering by all means the material consumed and, consequently the CRM’s. The EMF considers “reuse” as a major option which will lead to a nearly perfect material loop. In addition, the StEP – Initiative, a UNU programme aiming to reduce Waste EEE transfers to third world countries under the pretext of reuse, decided to support the research in order to explore “reuse” as a possible way to reduce illegal WEEE exports. A potential option to solve the e-waste problem was furnished in 2011 by the British Standard Institution which released the PAS141:2011 Standard aiming to standardize the preparation of WEEE for reuse. The above mentioned motivations led the author to address three research questions which aim to enhance the “design for reuse” process. RESEARCH QUESTIONS RQ1: Does the PAS 141:2011 Standard address reuse as described in the European Union’s literature? First, the researcher analysed the European Union’s literature on Ecodesign and “reuse” against the PAS141:2011 Standard and compared them. Following this analysis, it became clear that the UK Standard only prepares products for reuse after use-stage. As a consequence, there is a need to create design guidelines to facilitate industrial designer’s work when developing a product to be reused after a use-stage. To develop design principles, it was first essential to define “reuse”. The notion of “reuse” as such does not exist since it implies design for assembly / disassembly and design for repair / refurbish. Consequently, a “design for reuse” principles list was established based on relevant literature. RQ2: Do “design for reuse” principles potentially assist the designer to identify design weaknesses and strengths in terms of reuse? Next, a random EEE consumer product provided by Philips Consumer Lifestyle (which is also involved in the StEP – Initiative) as case study was analysed, tested and disassembled to determine the potential assistance of the “design for reuse principles list” (DRP) in the identification of the strengths and weaknesses in terms of reuse. RQ3: Based on the case study product’s analysis, what are the assumed benefits of “design for reuse” in terms of CRM’s? As one of the key design principles for the reuse of EEE consumer products concerns material identification, the elements constituting the case study device were listed and compared with the CRM’s list established by the European Union. This phase of the project showed that many valuable materials could be reused after use-stage and that the adoption of a reuse strategy could be interesting for countless business sectors in terms of parts, components and material recovery. In case the “reuse” option is not possible (for instance because the product is too damaged), this strategy also becomes useful for other End-of-Life options such as remanufacturing or recycling. As a common characteristic to all the above mentioned challenges Europe has to face, time seems to be the most difficult issue to tackle. Time is essential in the manufacturing supply chain as CRM’s shortages would be dramatic for the European economy. In addition, time is important in the assembly and disassembly processes as those operations are directly related to costs. Furthermore, time is crucial for our resources, social models and business activities. Time can however be optimized by different design decisions at early design stages which will define the End-of-Life of thousands of billions of consumer products, representing potential material supplies for the future generations. If the needed time to disassemble a product is optimized, there is a great chance companies will pay more attention to the potential of WEEE consumer products in terms of material waste, thereby closing the material loop and proposing a solution to the e-waste problem.","Reuse; Critical Raw Materials; CRM's; End-of-Life; Circular Economy; Consumer products; Design for reuse","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design","",""

The implementation of the Eurocode entailed a problem for the hydraulic structures that are part of the flood defense system. According the law, the locks that are part of the flood defense system should meet the requirements based on the most critical standard. Previously, for hydraulic structures the critical standard was Leidraad Kunstwerken (based on the Waterwet). This standard was more conservative than the NEN (based on the Woningwet). Since the NEN is replaced with the Eurocode, a higher safety class is added that is more conservative than the LK. So, hydraulic structures are forced by the law to be designed based on the Eurocode, while the Eurocode is actually addressed to buildings and bridges. So, the question arises: would it be correct to apply the Eurocode for designing locks that are part of the flood defense system. This research contributes to clarify the previous mentioned issue. It starts by exploring the issue in more detail, which eventually exposes the conflict between the Eurocode and LK. This conflict is restricted to the partial factor for water level difference, which comes down to the applicability of the reliability index (which indicates the degree of safety). Both the Eurocode as the LK prescribes a different reliability index. This difference in conception is researched in two ways. First, the influences on the structural design and the costs are analyzed. By means of a case study, two designs are made for the different standards (LK/NEN and Eurocode). This exposes the elements which are strongly affected. From there, it is searched to possible optimizations in the design in order to reduce the costs. The second perspective which is analyzed is the influence on the dike ring. By using the Eurocode for the structural design of the lock, the failure probability of the dike-ring will decrease. This change is analyzed and translated to a decrease in risk. Subsequently, the decrease is balanced with the required investment to upgrade the structural design. The use of the Eurocode can now be analyzed from an economic point of view. These two studies will finally conclude the influence and the applicability of the Eurocode for locks that are part of the flood defense system.","Eurocode; lock; Flood Defense System; safety; design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-08-01","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Hydraulic Structures","",""

The use of multicore processors, which is quite established in the desktop computers, is gaining importance in the embedded systems for industrial applications. Because of the complexity of the environment and the special requirements for these applications, the embedded multicore processors require optimised software architectures and the corresponding design methods. Performance optimisation is often based on the detailed knowledge of program behaviour. One such option to obtain information of program behaviour is software tracing, which forms the core of this thesis work. Software tracing is being used for a while now to identify faults, anomalies and bottlenecks in sequential as well as parallel applications. Tracing is not only limited to collecting and recording the event data from applications, but also to utilise the trace data in a meaningful way for further analysis and visualization. It is also not trivial to classify or analyse the trace data, especially when the amount of trace data exceed a million of events per second. For this reason, there is a need to create a high level model of trace data. In this thesis, we look at the theoretical model which describes the classification of trace events and also the relation between the events in a trace. The context for performing analysis on trace events is also discussed in detail. Based on the model, we have also created a prototype tool using Eclipse Modelling Framework (EMF) which performs the analysis on traces from real-time applications.","multicore systems; tracing; debugging; modelling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Computer Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Versteijlen, W.G. (mentor)","2013","The increasing energy prices together with the uncertainty about long term sufficiency of fossil fuel resources, confirm the increasing need for reliable alternatives based on renewable energy. Offshore wind power, particularly, has a great potential in providing a large share of the energy demand. The sustainable character of this energy fulfills the idealistic aspirations of some, however, the real debate is still concentrated around its economical disadvantage compared to the conventional energy sources. For this reason, great efforts are made to bring the Levelised Cost of Energy down by various research and development projects aiming to increase the efficiency and to reduce the risks related to offshore wind parks. One of the components that keep the costs linked to offshore wind high is the support structure of the turbine. To design this last, the turbine manufacturers rely on Finite Element Models to simulate the dynamic response of the turbine under different load cases. This is done to calculate the damage accumulation and consequently, estimate the fatigue life of the support structure. A particularly relevant parameter therein is the damping experienced by the turbine during its life time. However, this parameter is the most difficult to estimate among all other dynamic properties of the structure. The damping magnitude is quantified with critical damping ratios and their currently used values in design are considered conservative. If higher damping ratios can be proven, significant saving on material can be achieved, or longer fatigue life can be certified. To estimate these damping parameters from experimental data, free decay tests are carried out by means of rotor-stops. The damping estimated values based on these tests are found to have a high scatter leading to uncertainty about their real magnitude. Two important features in dynamic systems must be observed in order for damping to be represented accurately enough in terms of damping ratios. These features consist of low damping and well separated natural frequencies. These conditions lead to small off-diagonal terms in the modal damping matrix that are responsible for coupling the modes of vibrations originally derived for the undamped system. The physical reasons for this modal interaction to occur is the proximity of natural frequencies and non-proportional damping. When testing the structure in order to estimate the damping ratios, caution must be paid to the sensitivity of the structure to the excitation put into the system when nonproportional damping is applicable. In laboratory conditions, such aspects can be controlled. However, during rotor-stops, nothing guarantees that the force vector applied to the structure is so precise such as to excite a single mode of the tower. The interaction of the first bending modes in the fore-aft and side-side is probable under the effects of aerodynamic damping. In this case, estimating the damping based on the assumption that a single mode is excited can give biased results for the damping ratios. For this reason, the applicability of modal coupling during rotor-stop experiments is investigated in this thesis. The possible aerodynamic contribution to the damping experienced by the support structure has other implications on the interest of rotor-stop tests to provide damping ratios the turbine manufacturer is interested in. These damping ratios are needed to account only for soil, hydrodynamic and structural damping. As a first step, a hypothesis is formulated so that when verified, conclusions about the occurrence of modal coupling can be made. This hypothesis is based on assuming that the tower has coupled or decoupled degrees-of-freedom would not make a difference in the identified parameters if modal coupling does not occur. To identify these damping parameters, an identification approach is formulated. This approach uses simplified models to represent the coupling effects of the rotor on the tower. The identification procedure is based on solving an optimisation problem, using as input the main features of the system’s response. These features, in accordance with the linear response theory, are divided between the real and imaginary components of the frequency representation. The imaginary part is of high importance as it contains information about how dissipation occurs in the system. The results of application of this identification procedure to test data have shown that modal coupling is applicable in the specific rotor-stop tests. The aerodynamic damping is found to have a contribution to the damping of the support structure. Compared to the values found in previous research based on similar data within SIEMENS (W.G. Versteijlen), the identified damping for the fore-aft mode is lower in the present thesis. The specific rotor-stop tests used in this thesis are considered not valid to provide the damping ratios SIEMENS is interested in as long as the aerodynamic component is not extractable from the identified ratios so that it would be possible to obtain the damping ratios applicable to the support structure that is primarily linear and has decoupled modes of motion. From this study, it appears that it is of primary importance to study the aerodynamic contribution in detail. The availability of the drag terms for the blades at different configurations and wind speeds can improve considerably the identification of the damping of the support structure.","offshore wind support structures; damping; rotor stop","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","Structural Mechanics","",""

Inspections carried out since 2010 by Rijkswaterstaat revealed that a number of cracks per lock gate have been found. Based on experience and an evaluation of the photos made during the inspections it is assumed that the cracks occur due to fatigue. At this moment there is no good insight in the fatigue calculation of steel lock gates. The standard EUROCODE 3 used at the moment, has a part dedicated to fatigue strength, but describes that it is only applicable to structures in atmospheric conditions. As lock gates function in (sea) water conditions, it is questionable whether this standard can be used. Another aspect is that there is no guideline how to determine a load spectrum of forces on lock gates. The following topics are covered: a description of the forces on lock gates, a summation of the observations where cracks have been found, which part of the lock gates should be investigated and the standard that should be used and it’s limitations. Two calculations of fatigue damage based on a simplified model of the forces on lock gates are made. The first investigated case is the West lock of Sambeek and the second is the East lock of Terneuzen. For these lock gates the waterlevel spectrum is determined based on the waterlevel measurements of Rijkswaterstaat. From this spectrum a fatigue damage calculation is made. The results of the fatigue damage calculation based on the simplified schematisation of forces on lock gates did not match the fatigue cracks that have been found during the investigations. Some aspects causing this disparity might be that the schematisation of the lock gate is too simplified and the influence of waves is neglected. Another aspect that could influence the fatigue damage is the maintenance. A poor state of the wooden sealing at the back post, the coating layer and/or the cathodic protection system, could result in lower fatigue damage values. All these aspects have a negative influence on the S-N curve. The fatigue damage calculated with a simplified model cannot determine correct fatigue damage values. Therefore a FEM-model should be used to determine the stresses in the lock gate. The stresses in the lock gate itself should be monitored. A lock gate could be fitted with strain gauges to determine the real stresses in the lock gate. These real stresses could be compared with the result of the FEM-model and confirm the reliability of the FEM-model. Research on the influence of the salt and fresh water condition with or without cathodic protection should be done and rules included in the EUROCODE 3 on the influence of salt and fresh water.","vermoeiing; sluisdeuren; fatigue; lock gates; eurocode 3","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","Hydraulic Engineering Structures","",""

Constant effort keeps this system operational as much as possible. Traditional metrics can tell us something about the system such as the amount of power that is generated or consumed, or the amount of consumers whose needs are not being met. These metrics generally tell us something about a part of the configuration of the system. Other metrics, like robustness, tell us something about the whole system. In this case it tells us something about the degree to which a system can withstand a certain disturbance. Resilience is such a concept. It is a term that is often applied to ecological systems and it is comparable to robustness in that is looks at the whole system configuration. Specifically it says something about the ability of a system to stay in a certain set of system configurations, called an attractor. Even when the system is disturbed slightly. If the disturbance is large enough in these systems however, the system may move away from its current attractor, and end up in a different set of system configurations, another attractor. This behaviour is not exclusive to ecological systems. Sociotechnical systems also often show this behaviour. This makes resilience interesting to us. It could tell us something about the ability of an electricity system to stay in an attractor while under the effects of climate change or what types of configurations exist in the attractors of this system. In this thesis the ecological definition of resilience is translated to be appropriate for sociotechnical systems, the new definition is explored on its usefulness in its application to sociotechnical systems and an understanding of resilience is built up. The definition proposed is: “Resilience of an electricity system is the capacity of this system to manage shifts between attractors while being exposed to the effects of a disturbance”. The efforts in understanding this definition consist of several parts including building up an understanding of attractors, application to and exploration with a multitude of agent based models and looking at the degree to which t-SNE is able to operationalize it as well as proposing and briefly analyzing some alternative methods for doing this.","resilience; sociotechnical; electricity system; climate change; agent based modeling; t-SNE","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Technology, Policy and Management","Energy and Industry","","","",""

(mentor); Bakker, C.A. (mentor)","2013","THE GOAL The Dutch Association for Designers (BNO) is the largest organization of professional designers in the Netherlands and committed to support the interests of its members. BNO provides assistance in sustainable design through their ‘Groene Offerte’ (GO) community. However, there is no adequate sustainable support for during the briefing process, where the framing of the solution space and development of the design brief takes place. This project set out to support the transition: TOWARDS A GREEN DESIGN BRIEF, by the DEVELOPMENT OF A SUPPORT FOR DUTCH DESIGNERS (AND THEIR CLIENTS). THE RESEARCH Literature research and interviews with design agencies were conducted to gain insight in: 1) Currently available sustainable tools 2) The briefing process at product design agencies and the (possible) role of sustainability 3) Requirements from both literature and practice on a sustainability support for the briefing phase. TOOL CONFIGURATION GO|DO is based upon a matrix lay-out, combining a horizontal axis with six product life cycle phases and a vertical axis with six sustainability perspectives. This results in 36 intersections, each containing specific sustainable strategies and examples of how to integrate sustainability in design projects. Through its matrix, GO|DO provides both overview and enables a smart selection of relevant sustainable strategies for a specific project and client. GO|DO PROCESS GO|DO consists of a Strategy Map, deepening cards, a manual, and accessories. The tool can be used internally at a design agency in preparation of a briefing meeitng with a client, as well as in a session with a client. Although the development of this tool (and therefore the manual) focuses on the first scenario. The manual guides the users through the tool process. A GO|DO session starts with selecting sustainability perspectives that fit with the characteristics of the client and life cycle phases that can be influenced in this project. These selections determine the relevant intersections for the project at hand and can easily be explored with the corresponding deepening cards. Afterwards the users are guided into translating their findings into tangible design goals and project ideas. The manual directs the users towards a prioritized and visualized representation of their results, that can be communicated with the client. VALIDATION Three sessions at design agencies have been conducted to validate and optimize the design and process of GO|DO. CONCLUSION This project has resulted in improved insight and a theoretical model of the briefing process in practice. It has substantiated that there is a gap in providing support to designers for the uptake of sustainable goals in the briefing process. As a practical result GO|DO was developed, which takes a first step in bridging the identified gap. Although limited by the focus on the ‘preparation’ scenario and product design agencies, GO|DO foremost supports reaching sustainable (goals in) design briefs for this application area. The main value of GO|DO as a tool for the designers lies in its smart selection of relevant sustainable strategies by considering client ambition and own influence. GO|DO is a tangible and useful result for BNO and GO.","sustainable; design brief; tool; briefing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design","",""

Most of these wells are used to control the inflow from separate reservoirs or separate reservoir zones. This solution is particularly attractive for high-rate horizontal wells in thin oil rim reservoirs. Through the smart well technology, early gas or water breakthrough into the well can be delayed or even reduced. The use of Inflow Control Devices (ICDs) and zonal flow control valves (FCVs) offers an opportunity to evenly distribute the drawdown along the well, and therefore take corrective action if an early water or gas breakthrough occurs. In September 2011, Statoil completed Troll’s first subsea three-zone horizontal smart well. Just recently, anther well on Troll with a similar completion design was put into production. One of the most important objectives in the study of well Q-12BH, which forms the basis for this report, is understanding gas coning behavior. Without it, one would not be able to set appropriate operating strategies, and therefore optimizing production would simply not reach the wanted results. The approach taken begins by conducting an extensive literature review into coning control in thin oil rims and horizontal well technology. Early production data of well Q-12BH is studied, because knowing production history is a key into creating simulation models. These simulation models will analyze if the well was put into production with the most optimal zonal valve opening positions and what could possibly be even better setting for such a well.","horizontal; well; productivity; coning; rim","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","Petroleum Engineering","",""

This thesis report provides an analysis and validation of the development of a Social business guide on water projects. A Social business guide that structures the social business development process and is commissioned by the non-governmental organization, ICS. The process of setting up a social business is in fact, an organizational procedure. This meant the social business guide should grow from within the organization in order for it to have the best fit with the organization. To cover the complete social business concept, meant combining the existing organizational knowledge from ICS with knowledge from literature and social business experts. All these research results are present in this thesis report. Results from this research show the different elements of the social business development process. These elements are collected in a backbone structure that orders these elements. During this research several meanings of the social business guide for ICS became clear. These meanings are collected in the manifesto. This backbone structure along with the manifesto forms the requirements of the social business guide. This report shows the final social business structure in the form of the Exclamation model. To explain the why of each of the elements this model is supplemented with the social business guide booklets. During the validation, the social business guide proved to be a good starting point for ICS to improve their social business procedures. Recommendations discussed include:  Testing this social business guide in practice.  Start generating case studies.  Define a more accurate role of the different actors involved. The social business guide also has its limitations. It now is only developed for water projects and despite that some of the elements might be useful for other social businesses it should first be thoroughly tested on social businesses projects on water.","social business; fundraising","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design for Sustainability","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

Biomass undergoes a hydrolysis at 180ºC and 10 bars. The residues are processed in supercritical gasifier to produced syngas. This thesis aims at improving the energy efficiency of this concept by implementing an Organic Rankine Cycle power plant with a stripped steam stream as heat source. First a literature was carried out, defining the theoretical basis for working fluid selection and cycle configuration. A second literature review allowed finding the relevant correlations to compute the exchange surfaces of the heat exchangers. Four different Organic Rankine Cycles were tested. The configurations (subcritical, critical) and the categories of the working fluids (wet, dry and isentropic working fluids) were varied. First, a subcritical cycle with ammonia, a wet working fluid was tested and optimised. Then, a subcritical cycle with an isentropic working fluid: toluene was tested and optimised. Then, a subcritical cycle using pentane, a dry working fluid was designed and optimised. Finally, super-critical cycles using carbon dioxide and R124 were tested and optimised. The optimisation consists in delivering a maximum power generation under the same environmental and technical constraints. These cycles were implemented in the CycleTempo software. The investment costs of these cycles were then determined in order to assess their economical feasibility. This study is a first process design that should trigger new studies involving more stakeholders in order to more accurately define the energy recovery installation.","biomass; biorefinery; ORC; turbines; thermodynamics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Process and Energy","","ET","",""

The present study is focused on the development of simulation models that are able to calculate the evolution of thermomechanical stresses in critical components of the boiler. Such models can be useful in analyzing and estimating the fatigue lifetime of boiler components and therefore can be helpful in reducing maintenance costs. This study consists of two parts; In the first part a literature review is presented, along with a fatigue assessment methodology according to the EN 12952-3 standard. Then the mathematical model that has been developed is described. In the second part, the proposed methodology is applied in an existing GTCC power plant using online data. The simulation is focused on the high pressure steam drum of the unit and the results show that the component experiences a cycling loading in daily operation. By implementing a fatigue cycle counting technique based on the rainflow algorithm, the amplitude and mean stress of each identified cycle are determined. Finally, using these outcomes the fatigue lifetime of the component can be estimated. Various simulation scenarios are considered in this study. These include start-up / shut down of the plant, load change and daily operation. According to the simulation results the most severe situation is the start-up where the highest stress amplitudes are observed. Nevertheless, the calculated stresses are well below the yield stress of the material, leading to a theoretically infinite fatigue lifetime. The implementation of the simulation models to the other components of the boiler, such as the superheater headers, can give a better insight to the consequences of cycling modern GTCC power plants.","thermal stress; boilers; power plant","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Process and Energy","","Energy Technology","",""

(mentor); Brinkman, W.P. (mentor); Veling, W. (mentor)","2013","Paranoia is described as state of mind where the subject has an unfounded belief that other people will, intentionally, cause him a harm. Being suspicious is not a bad thing. In certain circumstances, being suspicious is often encouraged because it is really helpful in maintaining safety. However, when this suspicion is exaggerated or unfounded, it becomes unhealthy. In the worst case scenario, people may start avoiding social contact and spend more time worrying about their unfounded fear. This is the case of paranoia that needs to be treated. Various methods have been proposed to treat paranoia. This research focused on designing and implementing a Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy (VRET) system to treat paranoia where the patients were exposed to various stressors in a simulated virtual environment. Throughout the design and development process of the application, this research followed a Situated Cognitive Engineering (sCE) approach by collaboratively working with the therapists on finding out how VRET system could be extended to treat patients suffer from paranoia. By the end of the research, a prototype of the application was developed. The prototype accommodated prolonged exposure approach where patients are exposed to certain level of stressors for a prolonged time. The stressors are exposed as random paranoid thought provoking events that were triggered based on its probability and its rate of timer. Throughout the exposure, the patients main task is to reduce their anxiety level and not to avoid the situation, while the therapist aims to control the patients’ anxiety level within certain bandwidth by changing the probability and the rate of the random events. Throughout the research, two experiment were conducted. The first experiment aimed to examine if priming can induce paranoid thought in non-clinical population. The result suggested that priming can indeed increase paranoid thought comments in the non-clinical group that would less often exhibit paranoid thought. The second experiment aimed to examine if controlling the rate of the random event and its probability can evoke and control the paranoid thought. The result suggested that probability had significant main effect in evoking and controlling paranoid thought and there was interaction effect between the rate and the probability of the random events.","paranoia; prolonged exposure; virtual reality exposure therapy; mental health computing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Mediamatics","","Computer Science - The Media & Knowledge Engineering Track","",""

(mentor)","2013","In sports, the use of motion-capture techniques increases, leading to a fast increase in valuable motion data. Automatic recognition and classification of the captured motions, provides an orderly structuring of the motion data. By this the users can easily retrieve specific motion data. In this thesis, we consider the automatic classification of vault jumps in gymnastics, captured by a high speed video camera system. A vault jump consists of a sequence of motions belonging to a predefined motion label, such as a Handspring. Then, the vault classification problem consists of automatically recognizing a vault jump in a video recording and assigning the appropriate label to the recording. To this end, we segment the vault classification problem into a sequence of vault-section classification problems. The following vault-sections are proposed; Type of Vault (TV), Number of Somersaults (NS), Type of Somersault (TS) and Number of Twists (NT). The segmentation into vault-sections allows for the development of a versatile classification system, capable of classifying a large number of vault classes based on a limited amount of data. Next, we use video analysis techniques to transform a video recording into feature representations, or so called feature sets, which reflect the specific characteristics of the vault jump throughout the four vault-sections. The four vault-section feature sets are then classified, resulting in four vault-section classifications. The final labeling of the recording of a vault jump is by the combined results of the four vault-section classifications. The proposed automatic vault classification system is based on the vault jump recordings made by Van de Eb et al. [1] at the world championships in gymnastics 2010. Extensive experiments have been conducted on these recordings for evaluating various feature sets and classifiers per vault-section, resulting in one best performing combination per vault-section. Furthermore, the vault-section classifications are evaluated on their influence on the classification performance of a complete vault jump. In the end, an overall classification rate of 69.5%, with a correct classification accuracy of 90.2%, is obtained for the classification of the vault jump recordings.","automatic vault classification","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-09-11","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","BMD","",""

(mentor); Scholten, D. (mentor); De Reuver, M. (mentor); Lemstra, W. (mentor)","2013","The worldwide mobile payments market is expected to have reached “$ 171.5 billion as a total in 2012, with a 61.9 % increase compared to 2011” and a constant annual forecasted growth of 42% until 2016 according to (Christy, 2012, para.1). In this fast growing market, there are two major categories identified, according to (Cluckey, 2011, p.1 ) : proximity and remote payments. For the mobile proximity case, NFC is a technology that has seen a tremendous hype in the last years. However, barcode and QR code are also relevant and are addressed in the analysis section as well. NFC is a set of wireless standards based technology, that functions in short distance radio frequency identification (RFID) of approximately 4 inches and that can be applied in areas from simple data transfers to payments, by replacing credit card, according to (Hasoo, Lee, & Heekuck Oh, 2013). The same source mentions that the protocol is extremely secure, by granting privacy of the user and in the same time enabling personalized services, fact seen as very suitable for its usage in mobile payments services. Thus, in mobile proximity payments, NFC is a set of standards that enable device-to-device communication between mobile phones and other pieces of equipment, such as POS terminals. The thesis focuses mainly on NFC “self-organized” phone-based schemes, (J. Ondrus & Pigneur, 2005, p.2), owned by players such as Google, PayPal and A Handset Manufacturer that are looking forward to enter the market from outside and thus cause disruption in relation to the already existing initiatives, the “operator-driven ones” (J. Ondrus & Pigneur, 2005, p.2), where the banks and MNOs take the lead together. In the current thesis, the concept of the operator-driven models is extended to that of collaboration models(Smart Card Alliance, 2008), referred here as the collaborative models. These type of models are already working according to the functional standardized “four corners card payment working model” (LLC, 2010, p.1) and have the banks as leaders in network in charge of payments, and the mobile network operators, responsible for storing the payment credentials in the mobile handsets. According to (LLC, 2010), the four corners card payment model links the buyer and the merchants through their issuing and acquiring banks, by making use of the card schemes companies (ex. Visa, MasterCard, Maestro). Thus, these so called “disruptive or insurgent players” (Jan Ondrus & Lyytinen, 2011,p.2) have different organizational models compared to what is considered the traditional, reference one, in their attempt to step in the in-store payment by making use of NFC or other proximity payments technologies. Thus, companies such as Google, PayPal, and A Handset Manufacturer might find themselves in a position to exploit at maximum their resources and chose suitable strategies in relation to the other actors to gain support for initiatives and so reach success, by giving a high value for the network they are part of. Taking into account this problem, the research question to be answered is the following: What kind of network strategies should new-coming players in the mobile proximity payment market Google, PayPal and A Handset Manufacturer deploy in relation to the most relevant actors in their networks, in order to ensure their successfulness in the international market? For answering the research question, the author has created a theoretical framework that is applied to reach the research objective. It is important to emphasize that when referring to strategies, the researcher refers to certain manners the owners of the three disruptive ecosystems should treat the relation with the most important actors in their network in order to obtain support and obtain “multiple sourcing” for their models (Bruijn & Ten Heuvelhof, 2008, p.41). That is why he names them “network strategies”. For this, it should be noted that the researcher considers that the more support in the network an owner of a certain value proposition has, the higher the chances for reaching success are. That is because he views success mainly from the perspective of the value delivered inside the value network. That means that certain “blocking parties” or parties with “diffuse power position” (Bruijn & Ten Heuvelhof, 2008, p.40-41) should be dealt with in such a manner that more support is built with them and blockage is avoided. On the other hand, parties with “production power” should be kept close to the value proposition and involved in key decisions and benefits sharing. In order to measure the potential success of the disruptors and, based on that, derive the degree of successfulness of the strategies, the researcher has created a successfulness indicator, based on a network approach. This indicator measures success by taking into account the roles of the most important actors in the network (ex. how many supporters, blockers). The research approach taken to solve the problem is that of comparative analysis, between the roles that the most important actors (ex. banks, MNOs, card payment scheme) have in the new entrants’ ecosystems (Google, PayPal and A Handset Manufacturer) vis-à-vis their considered, static roles in the collaborative, traditional, operator-centric model. The latter is used as a reference, because it is considered in this research as the traditional, established model of performing mobile payments, as being based on the already standardized four corners model. In addition, all the critical parties seem to align their interests and thus increase the value for the all network in this case, thus labeling this model as Highly successful. As this latter model is considered a reference, it is the change in roles for the most important actors in the three disruptive networks compared to it that is relevant for giving insights regarding successfulness and then right network strategies that should be recommended. In order to be able to gather information about the case studies analyzed and then clarify the roles of the parties and then also quantify success, the researcher makes use of a business model based on platform theory called VISOR. For the collaborative model, the researcher uses a simple stakeholder analysis. As a manner of gathering data, the researcher has performed two sets of interviews. The first set was focused on gathering information about the business models of the disruptors and of the collaborative case. For this, he retrieved information from 7 consultants working for THE CLIENT, as well as consulting specialized materials about mobile payments. The second set of interviews was used in order to clarify the roles of the most important actors (ex. banks, card payment schemes and banks), by involving 7 experienced experts belonging to the entire mobile payments field. This set of interviews was recorded, transcribed and coded. The conclusions of the research are that Google scores “Low” as successfulness potential, PayPal “Low towards Medium”, whereas A Handset Manufacturer’s model is labeled as “High”. This is placed in the context where the reference, the collaborative model, is also labeled as High. That justification of these results is given by the fact that whereas Google has 3 major blockers and no supporters in its network on its Google Wallet’s product and PayPal has only 2, but still no major supporters, A Handset Manufacturer’s model is backed by 3 strong parties and 2 that seem possible to be activated. Thus, the researcher argues that the network strategies of A Handset Manufacturer’s are potentially more successful than Google’s and PayPal’s. Google is advised to bring banks and card payments schemes closer to the Google Wallet initiative, PayPal to strengthen the relationship with the banks for its close loop mobile in-store payment model, whereas A Handset Manufacturer’s should continue to focus on the relationship with the banks and build scale.","mobile proximity payments; NFC; disrption; success; network strategies; role shift","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-04-12","Technology, Policy and Management","Infrastructure Systems & Services","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","",""

(mentor); Wierenga, E. (mentor)","2013","Modern transmission power networks consist mainly of High Voltage overhead lines, since the later have proven their high operational reliability. However, technological developments have made it possible to use High Voltage cables, not only in the distribution grids, but also at higher transmission voltage levels. Thus, more mixed configurations, consisting of overhead lines and underground cables will take place in the near future. The Dutch transmission system operator, TenneT TSO, is a pioneer at this field, since it will install the longest 380 kV cable through the “Randstad 380 kV” project. On the other hand, mixed transmission systems bring new challenges at the field of the Power System protection because of their complexity. Consequently, the protection schemes need to be developed in order to retain their fast and reliable performance. Modern numerical protective relays are used, which can combine various operations within the same device, i.e. differential protection, distance protection etc. Before installing the protective relays, firstly their correct operation needs to be verified. For that reason, specific testing setups and programs are used to simulate possible transient fault conditions that can occur in a power system. This Thesis Project focuses on the differential protection of the 380 kV XLPE cable, which is installed at the South Transmission Ring of the Randstad area in the Netherlands. A number of simulations were carried out to verify the correct operation of the protection scheme, when faults occur within the High Voltage cable and at other points of the system. Important conclusions were reached, with respect to the correct response of the developed differential relay model and its operating time, when the protection current transformers are not driven into saturation. Moreover, recommendations for future research are given regarding the implementation of the differential protection model to the other parts of the studied configuration together with the distance protection scheme. The electromagnetic transient program ATP has been used to model the mixed configuration between the Maasvlakte and Westerlee substations of the Randstad’s South Ring.","differential; protection; modeling; ATP; EMTP; high voltage; cable; Randstad; relay; power systems","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Electrical Sustainable Energy","","Intelligent Electrical Power Grids","",""

However, vulnerabilities create opportunities for hostile users to perform malicious activities and IT security has gradually turned into a critical research area for organizations and governments. Processes of decision making in large organizations are widely influenced by their capability of detecting malicious activities effectively, and by the correctness in analyzing suspicious phenomena, which can be observed by a number of security sensors deployed in such large networks. Several techniques are currently employed to detect incidents starting from captured security-related events within networks and computer systems. However, the large volume of observable events, the continuous sophistication and changes in attack strategies make it challenging to provide effective solutions to detect and reconstruct cyber-security incidents. In particular, advanced multi-stage attacks tend to remain undiscovered because common security mechanisms can generally detect and flag harmful activity – sometimes with unsatisfactory false alert rates – but they are not able to draw a big picture of the incidents. Since such task is usually performed by security experts in full, it may be expensive and prone to errors. Therefore, it is essential to develop procedures for combining large heterogeneous datasets and system’s information in meaningful way, and for supplying detailed information to IT security management. By examining realistic multi-stage incidents, this thesis proposes the design of a model to correlate detectable suspicious events by combining complementary state of the art methods, which perform correlation along different axis. Thus, it aims at providing standard data formats, prioritizing and clustering data, increasing confidence about threats, finding relations of causality between suspicious events and eventually reconstructing multi-stage incidents. In addition, reviewing the most influential scientific papers gives us the chance to categorize the techniques and suggest practices for further implementation.","event correlation; IT security management; multi-stage attacks; machine learning; intrusion detection; big data","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Infrastructure Systems & Services","","Management of Technology","",""

(mentor)","2013","Nowadays a big challenge in aviation is represented by the scarcity of fossil fuels. Hence, there is a need for a more fuel efficient air transport system. A possible innovation is a change in operating mode. Conceptual design studies showed staged flight operations to be up to 40% more fuel efficient than non-stop operations. Staged flight operation uses extra stops to split up long range missions. An even more novel concept is in-flight refueling operation (IFR). IFR incorporates a fuel transfer system in midair. This eliminates the increase in travel time, which is associated with the extra take-off and landings of staged flight operations, while maintaining similar fuel saving as staged flight operations. This thesis focuses on the design of the cruiser, the passenger aircraft that will be refueled. The design of the tanker and of the whole operational concept are outside the scope of the thesis. The design of the cruiser is performed with the Initiator, an automated design tool. The modifications to the Initiator to enable it to produce an accurate design of the cruiser are described in the thesis. The cruiser was found to have a higher payload range efficiency (PRE) as the non-stop aircraft. 10.4% better than the 5000nm non-stop aircraft and 29.4% better than the 7500nm non-stop aircraft. Top level requirements of existing aircraft were used to produce concepts with similar payload requirements (B767-300 payload=26500kg) and with similar range requirements (B737-800 range=2500nm). They were outperformed by 7.3% and 9.6% in PRE, when operated with similar passenger comfort levels as the cruiser. Since only the cruiser design is considered no exact conclusions on the fuel savings can be given. Only a fuel budget can be provided for tanker operations. Comparing tanker fuel consumptions from literature 9 of 12 tanker designs outperformed the staged flight operation, 12 of 12 the non-stop operations. In-flight has to be further researched, however initial studies show IFR can be a possible solution for a more fuel efficient air transport. The cruiser outperformed existing aircraft for the given range of 2500nm.","in-flight refueling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","FFP","","","",""

Attempted has been to write this paper in such a way so that it’s easy to follow for everyone. Part one, the non-technical part, should be an easy read for everyone. Part two, on the other hand, is a technical report, nonetheless, most basic concepts are explained so that everyone should be able to understand, except for a few parts where technical pre-knowledge is required. Part two, can be understand without reading part one of this paper. However, it is highly recommended to read part one prior to part two as part two continues, where part one finishes. Besides, often is referred to part one of this paper. What follows is a brief summation of what can be found in each part. Part one (non-technical) Part one explains what energy storage is, and why energy storage is necessary. This has been done by first taking a peek into the energy grid and assessing the demand and supply of energy which is done in Chapter 1. There are different methods of energy storage, which has been discussed and compared in Chapter 2. Chapter 3 describes the complications one could expect when applying an energy storage project and discusses a case study for the application of a storage device. The Appendix of part one, explains how different forms of energy is converted to electricity which is used in the electrical grid. Part two (technical) Part two is a technical design study to the feasibility of one of the (hydraulic) energy storage concepts: gravity power. In Chapter 4, the concept of gravity power is analyzed and compared with other hydraulic energy storage methods regarding functionality and storage capacity. In Chapter 5, an initial design will be made. In Chapter 6, this design will be assessed regarding stability, construction and costs, and is further optimized in Chapter 7. Chapter 8, provides conclusions, recommendations and a final evaluation.","Energy Market; Power Grid; Gravity Power; Energy Storage; OPAC; PHS; Piston; Hydraulic","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Hydraulic Structures","",""

(mentor); Verhagen, H.J. (mentor); Salmon, J. (mentor); Lazar, M. (mentor); Adriaanse, L.A. (mentor)","2013","This thesis focusses on the north-eastward shifting beach at Brouwersdam, which poses a problem for users and stakeholders of the beach. This trend is likely to continue in the foreseeable future and could result in a beach that can no longer fulfil its current functions, like recreation and tourism. Analysis of bathymetric data from the last decades shows that the systems of the Oosterschelde, Grevelingen and Haringvliet are not in equilibrium, the Delta Works have changed hydrodynamic forcing of the system drastically. As a result, the system is transforming to a new equilibrium, a process that isn’t completed yet, nor will it be soon. The time scales of processes like these are in the order of centuries. For the area around the Brouwersdam the result is that the former ebb-tidal deltas of the Grevelingen and the Oosterschelde are pushed shoreward due to the reduced tidal forcing, therefore wave forcing is becoming more dominant. The former shoals Middelplaat and Kabbelaarsbank were pushed against the Brouwersdam and now form the beach there. Over the last decade, the amount of sediment that is lost in the south-western part of the beach is estimated at around 75,000 m3 per year and the amount of dry beach is getting smaller. A morphological model of the area was made to replicate the developments over the last and for the next decade using the SWAN and UNIBEST models. The model set-up consists of a wind- and wave analysis over the last three decades that has been schematized into different wind and wave classes and different tidal conditions, for two different bathymetries (2000 and 2010). The models are able to reproduce the trend, with dominant southwesterly winds and a beach that shifts to the northeast, but the quantities are different from observations. These differences could be the result of the complex flow patterns in the area. The incoming flood current flows from southwest to northeast and stays close to the Brouwersdam and the beach, while the ebb current stays on the outside of the area and flows in opposite direction. The result is a flood dominated flow pattern along the beach, which has its influence on the dominating transport direction and the models aren’t able to replicate this process correctly. In the near future the characteristics of the system are about to change again. There are plans under development to construct a tidal power plant or an inlet sluice in north-eastern part of the Brouwersdam, which means reintroduction of tidal motion in the Grevelingen. A decision on what solution will be chosen is expected before the end of 2014 and should be up and running in 2020. There are a lot of different possibilities for the beach; beach nourishments, the construction of a tidal power plant and eventual compensatory measurements will have a profound effect. How the beach will look like in a decade from now is largely up to the responsible (governmental) parties involved, all possible scenario’s should be carefully evaluated and it is stressed that cooperation between these parties is vital to find a satisfying solution.","Brouwersdam; beach; morphology; waves; modelling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Coastal Engineering","",""

(mentor); Beelaerts van Blokland, W.W.A. (mentor)","2013","Involving a wide range of stakeholders, both on private and public sector, the Tourism Supply Chain consists a network of tourism organizations engaged in information, combination and travel arrangement services provision . It is not only about the supply of tourism products and services but also the marketing of those as well as the creation of new markets -or expending already existing ones- towards greater profits. As the main characteristic of the tourism industry lies in the high interdependencies among the various players, in order for value to be added they all need to work together as a value chain when delivering the final tourism service or product to the final customer. In this supply chain, there are so far quite distinct roles (outgoing travel agents – retailers, tour operators – wholesalers, incoming travel agents, Global Distribution Channels etc.). Despite the technological revolution and the constantly developed new innovative distribution strategies, the basic tourism distribution mechanism stays quite the same; the distributers (active role) act and guide tourists towards the cities of destination (passive role). xperience the CITY, is a project aiming to change the way we travel so far, by changing the existing tourism supply chain and taking the City of Destination from a passive to a more active role, directly managing its sources (tourism infrastructure) and addressing the end-users. Instead of a destination push strategy, a destination pull strategy is proposed. Throughout this project, new ways of co-creation between the various stakeholders involved in the traveling process –all the 3 stages (pre-delivery, delivery and post-delivery) – will be investigated, from a passenger centric approach. The final outcome will be a new service and a new strategy towards better ways to experience the city of destination, with multiple benefits for everyone involved. This project builts upon the relevant literature of, among others, supply chain issues, the service-dominant logic, co-creation of value, tourism value chain and seamless traveling. Forming two main research sub-questions – “What value can the passenger add to the co-creation of value process?” and “What info can the passenger deliver depending on their specific interests and the way they want to experience traveling?” – the author explores the status quo of the tourism industry as well as the way they interact with each other, and how that could lead in co-creation opportunities. Towards that, as part of the methodology followed, an Explorative Research (qualitative) and Validation Research (quantitative) were organized. Looking for insights on how business is currently done, key stakeholders were interviewed. The analysis of these first insights, providing a more holistic view on the subject researched (traveling practices, traveling industry, co-creation, services etc.), led to the construction of a more quantitative online survey, that came to validate the assumptions made so far, leading to the development of a new innovative strategy and the design of a new air-traveling service. Among the findings so far, in a society and an economy that is constantly changing is the need of better practices. Fast changing trends and needs call for new approaches, both for those supplying and delivering services as well as for those experiencing and consuming them. How could we, either as business stakeholders or passengers, co-create towards a better future, either in terms of profit, sustainability or customized experiences? We believe that there are plenty of future research opportunities in the field in terms of co-creation and customer value creating processes, supplier value-creating processes and encounter processes in the traveling context. It is up to the future researchers to go deeper and further on these subjects looking for improvements and new approaches.","Co-creation; Tourism Supply Chain; Value Creation; Experience Economy; Seamless Traveling; Service-Dominant Logic; Service Design; Destination Marketing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Delft University of Technology","Industrial Design Engineering","","MSc in Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor); Eijt, S. (mentor)","2013","Hydrogenated Amorphous Silicon (a-Si:H) is a very promising solar cell material with a good potential to use in many applications, as it is cheap to produce, light-weight and flexible. However, upon prolonged exposure to light, the layers suffer from both metastable and irreversible changes (the Staebler-Wronski effect) that have a bad effect on the photoconductivity. Annealing the material up to 150-200oC removes the metastable changes. The Staebler-Wronski effect has been studied for over 35 years, but the mechanisms behind it are not fully understood yet. In this project an attempt is made to increase the understanding by examining the nanostructure of rf-PECVD produced a-Si:H samples, in particular the nanostructural evolution, as a function of annealing temperature (up to 800oC) and hydrogen dilution. Positron Annihilation Spectroscopy techniques, sensitive to even the smallest vacancies, are used to study the electron environment of the open volume defects. These techniques include Doppler broadening positron annihilation spectroscopy, two-dimensional angular correlation of annihilation radiation and coincidence Doppler broadening (DB-PAS, 2D-ACAR and CDB). Neutron Reflectometry is used to study the hydrogen content as a function of film depth. Raman spectroscopy is used in addition to the annealing experiment to detect the presence of molecular hydrogen. Clear evidence is found that dilution with hydrogen causes a broadening of the electron momentum distribution. DB-PAS and 2D-ACAR results strongly indicate that this broadening is due to a decrease in the average size of the open volume defects.","positron annihilation; PAS; DB-PAS; 2D-ACAR; ACAR; CDB; nanostructure; metastable changes; vacancy; vacancy size; doppler broadening; hydrogen effusion; hydrogen distribution; vacancy agglomeration; neutron reflectometry; amorphous silicon; thin film solar cells; hydrogenated amorphous silicon; Staebler-Wronski effect; electron environment; open volume defects; Raman spectroscopy; crystallization; wing parameter; line shape parameter; solar cell absorber layers","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-12-05","Applied Sciences","Applied Physics","","","",""

(mentor); Schiereck, G.J. (mentor); Prooijen, B.C. (mentor); Tonneijck, M. (mentor)","2013","The yearly floods of the Mekong Delta caused by the Mekong River have been considered a blessing; it purifies the agricultural lands and deposits a fresh layer of silt on the surface, which keeps the delta fertile. However, the growing demand for agricultural products internationally and nationally has pushed the farmers to harvest all year long, which has lead to a situation where the floods are more of a curse than a blessing. Besides the growing agricultural demand, the continuous urbanization has also caused the yearly flood to become less accepted. Furthermore, it is expected that the flooding problems will only increase even more in future due to climate change. A possible solution to reduce the frequency of flood risks is by constructing a flood diversion channel between the Mekong River and the Gulf of Thailand. The purpose of this flood diversion channel is to reduce the water level of the Mekong River during high water preventing it from flooding. The question is, if a flood diversion channel is a realistic measure to achieve this objective and to reduce flood risks. A feasibility study divided into two parts has been made, to find out how realistic a flood diversion channel, as measure is to reduce flood risks. The first part of the study is to find out what the required technical conditions are for constructing a flood diversion channel. The second part of the study concentrates on the question whether the effects of sediment deposition by the flood diversion channel into the Gulf of Thailand prohibits the construction of a flood diversion channel. The conclusion of this feasibility study is that a flood diversion channel can be a solution to reduce current flood risks caused by the Mekong River. However, when future climate changes are taken into account the diversion channel is only sufficient to reduce the increased flood risk of the Hau River; additional measures are necessary to also lower the water level of the Tien River. The concern of sediment deposition at Phu Quoc is unjustified. Deposition of sediment near the shore of the discharge location can even have a positive side effect for the eroding coastline. The preferred flood diversion channel is to construct a deep channel of approximately 70 km long and depending on the withdrawal necessities the width of the channel will be between the 340 and 680 meters. The flood diversion channel withdraws at Chau Doc, goes along the Vinh Te channel for as long as possible and crosses the K. Tam Ngan channel to eventually discharge at the Middle location into the Gulf of Thailand.","Vietnam; Mekong Delta; Mekong River; Reduce Flood Risks; Diversion Channel; Feasibility; Sediment","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Coastal Engineering","",""

In order to achieve this, molecular dynamics simulations are performed to study the reactions taking place during the initial formation of an anodic oxide layer, and to determine the influence of the electric field strength, temperature and environment on these reactions and the ion movement in the oxide layer. Simulations are performed regarding the oxidation of aluminium in an atomic oxygen environment under the influence of an external electric field, regarding the anodization of aluminium in water, in an oxalic acid solution and in an ammonium tartrate solution. It was found that applying a higher electric field strength only significantly influences the oxide thickness if this electric field strength is higher than a certain critical value. A higher temperature lowers this critical value. In an ammonium tartrate solution the tartrate ions assist in the formation of an oxide layer, leading to a thicker layer at a lower field strength as compared with anodization in pure water. To improve the modelling of the anodization process the charge equilibration procedure should be adjusted for a more realistic description of the charges and, with that, a more realistic description of the reactions that take place during the anodization process.","molecular dynamics; anodization; ReaxFF; electric field; aluminium; aluminium oxide; water; oxalic acid; ammonium tartrate","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Materials Science & Engineering","","Mechanical Engineering, track Materials Engineering and Applications","",""

They confine the flow of the river to a main channel but also act as resistance element once submerged and in that way influence the stage discharge relationship of the river. Several formulas exist describing groynes as a drag resistance. Another possible way of determining their resistance is by using a weir formula and fitting the up and downstream water levels to the water level slope of the river. In this thesis a schematized model of the river Waal is set up and progressively expanded. At first seven different drag and weir formulas are compared. There is no consensus for resistance is between them. They are therefor compared to a 2DV computer model of flow over a highly submerged weir in the SWASH software package. Drag resistance, expressed as a function of water depth to groyne height ratio has the same scaling as two weir formulas though they do not match in absolute terms. A 2DH computer model is then used to determine the magnitude of the lateral turbulent momentum exchange between the main channel, groyne fields and flood plain. Finally a 3D computer model is used to determine groyne resistance and the distribution of discharge and momentum around the groyne. Treating groynes as weirs is found to be an acceptable assumption. The schematized model is used to simulate a high discharge of 13.550 m3 s-1. Groynes, when seen as a weir, would be responsible for a 36 cm water level increase. Lateral turbulent momentum exchange increases this by another 34 cm, while using the groyne resistance found in the 3D model added only another 7 cm.","groyne; SWASH; Waal; water level; mixing layer","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Environmental Fluid Dynamics","",""

(mentor); Veeneman, W.W. (mentor); Van Nederveen, G.A. (mentor); De Zwart, B.M.G.J. (mentor)","2013","Introduction A large structural terminal adaptation is like most large engineering projects an enormous and complex task. A large airport deals with many stakeholders both internal and external who exert influence and could cause scope changes. The scope of a project is developed by requirements of the client and users. These stakeholders could affect the project’s scope through their interest and power position. One of the biggest challenges in such complex projects on airports is to manage the stakeholder driven scope creep or changes. The management of scope change events should be executed in such a way that they will be successful and contribute to the success of the project. Scope changes in the Front End Development occur on a regular basis in construction projects at the terminal building of Schiphol. Scope changes are inevitable, but and may have a large impact on project costs and time. Remarkable is the fact that most changes are stakeholder driven. The reason is that many parties operate in a relatively small area. Schiphol is confronted with many stakeholders that all have their own core values and interests concerning a construction project adapting the situation at the terminal. Research methodology The overall objective of this master thesis is the improvement of stakeholder and scope management to increase the success of construction projects of network operators. The overall research question is: “How can airports improve the management of stakeholder driven scope changes during the Front End Development of terminal adaptation projects”? In order to research these changes five scope change events have been explored within two projects at the terminal of Schiphol airport. Approximately 30 interviews were carried out and the findings were qualitatively compared. The scope change event takes place from the moment a stakeholder makes an intervention by announcing that he disagrees with a part of the scope until the moment a resolution is found. First the root cause is explored. Then the management approaches of the project manager in the change event and the interactions with stakeholders are explored and related to success. Additionally the project context is taken into account to explain differences and similarities. The change events’ root causes, management approaches, interactions and outcomes are qualitatively compared. In literature studies, frameworks were developed to analyse the change events. Different causes were classified and a list with overall causes was made in the end. All causes were framed into three dimensions: internal root causes, external root causes and environmental causes. A distinction between two management approaches was made. Traditional project management is characterised by a “predict and control” management approach. Disadvantage of this approach is that it presumes a static world, while in reality it is dynamic and project circumstances change. Process management is the opposite management approach, that presumes a changing world and is characterised by a “prepare and commit” strategy. In practice, not one of these approaches will generally be applied on its own, but rather a mixture of the two will be used. One of the approaches, however, can be pointed out in most cases as the dominant approach. The nature of interactions with stakeholders is characterised by the level of trust and involvement, the stakeholder relationship, the level of power and the style of communication. Five different context variables will be taken into account in this research. In the project contexts the influence of structure and arrangements are being studied and in the change events themselves, the influence on cost and time and on the existence of a change procedure are being explored. At last, the term success will be defined, to measure the influence of the management approaches and interactions. General success can be divided in two dimensions: efficiency and effectiveness. Efficiency particularly reflects to the extent in which the original design goals and project variables were met. Effectiveness refers more to the way the project, and in this case the change, is received by its stakeholders. Especially the opinion of the client and users are important here. Conclusions: root causes No root causes of changes in airport terminal projects seem to occur regularly. Scope changes have more than one root cause and are generally caused by both the project team and the stakeholders. Scope changes can be divided in changes that could have been prevented and changes that could not have been prevented. External caused changes are generally harder to prevent than internal caused changes. The occurrence of preventable changes should be avoided. The unpreventable changes (and preventable that did occur nonetheless) should be managed adequately by the project manager. It is recommendable that all changes and their root causes will be analysed afterwards and the preventability will be evaluated for learning purposes. Conclusions: management approach Success depends on both project-oriented and process-oriented approaches. In scope changes slightly more process-oriented aspects should be used than project-oriented. This ratio is related to the fact that it is stakeholder driven. In more complex changes, management switches should be used if the PM cannot solve a change event with his (hierarchical) tools and mandate. Often project managers have limited measures to perform process management. If changes are smaller and less complex in terms of consequences, they can use both project-oriented and process-oriented management. If larger change events occur, their mandates will not allow process management and they are forced to apply project management. If this can not solve the issue and friction arises, the change event should be taken to a higher level. If the overall PM of a project can not use process management within his mandate and can not solve it hierarchically, a management switch should be made to a body in which the network of actors is represented and the issue can be discussed at one table. This is the area where process management is performed and solutions will be found by negotiating. An organisation should make sure that every project has such a body, which is available to solve and discuss complex changes. Conclusions: interactions Regarding the interactions, trust and involvement are crucial for a change event to be successful. A collaborative relationship contributes to success, while a conflicting relationship has a negative influence on success. In communication, especially in stakeholder driven changes, the dialogue is important. If parties are on cross-purposes, the resolution will probably be unsuccessful. Moreover, the use of informal communication is quite important, because it brings parties closer together and makes them understand each other’s interests and respect them. Formal communication, can lead to unsuccessful resolutions of projects. Regular meetings are important to ensure progress in the change event. Conclusions: context A project’s structure and arrangements can also be divided into project- and process-oriented elements. If a project has a dominant project-management structure and arrangements, a counter arrangement should be made in the change event: it should be managed with an overreliance on the opposite management approach in order to achieve success. Schedule is very important to all parties and during discussions parties agree on aiming not to extend the projects’ ""time"". The schedule had not been changed in all observed change events. Larger changes in terms of money are more complex. Such projects should make a timely (probably immediate) management switch if the PM’s instruments and mandate cannot solve the change event. At all times, if a management switch is made, it will be important that the changes and subprojects are discussed at one table. One project or issue should not be discussed at different tables, but multiple issues at one table. Existing change procedures are more a matter of formality at the end of a change event, in which the right departments should approve rather than manage it. The uniqueness of projects at airport terminals A comparative case research has been done at Prorail to verify the compatibility of the conclusions at other network operators. Overall, less stakeholder driven scope changes occur at railroad terminal projects. Airport terminal projects are unique in many ways and can not be compared with other network operators at all, although some of the same conclusions were drawn. First, airports have many more complex stakeholder relations and processes in a relatively small area. Airports have multiple airlines and handlers. At the same time, the existence of security, boarder control and customs in this small area are also causing its uniqueness. This explains why stakeholder involvement is so important for success here. Another consequence is that more, and more complex stakeholder driven scope changes occur at airports. Secondly, the budget of a project at Schiphol is more fixed and controlled because the client is an internal party. Thirdly, this focus on costs can also be attributed to the unique way that user costs are charged by the network operators at Schiphol. Law enforces an exact coverage of the Aviation costs of Schiphol by airport charges, while users of railroads pay a fixed amount per distance. The investments of a project are paid almost directly by airlines, which makes this stakeholder more powerful as they will be affected both in operation and in expenditures. The mutual dependency between KLM and Schiphol is therefore larger and might explain the need for involvement and stronger budget controls. The use of a special purpose vehicle would be a good measure to mitigate the negative effects of this last mechanism. By creating a legal entity that can cover the business case, the costs could be separated from the aviation costs. The business case makes sure the costs are recovered after the payback period and the airlines are not affected by this. This is beneficial for airlines, but also for the airport, because the power of airlines decreases and efficiency of scope change resolutions will increase.","scope; scope changes; scope creep; project management; process management; stakeholder management; structural adaptation terminal; terminal construction projects","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","Construction Management and Engineering","",""

(mentor); Stive, M.J.F. (mentor)","2013","In this study, a probabilistic vulnerability assessment to the impact of storms in the coast of Thrace, Greece was carried out. To this end, the methodology presented by Bosom and Jiménez (2011) has been applied with some modifications. The introduced modifications, for this work, were the use of a different run-up model to deal with the uncertainty in the predicted magnitude (due to some reported under-prediction of run-up, using Stockdon et al. equation, 2006) observed in recent studies (Laudier et al. 2011). In addition, the vulnerability framework has been extended by including overtopping in order to characterize better the flooding hazard. For this project, the study area was the coast of Thrace, Greece and the used data were 3-h hindcasts of the WAM model for a time period of 10 years (January of 1995 – December of 2004) at fifteen stations of the N. Aegean Sea. Its variables were the significant wave height, Hs, the wave peak period Tp, the wave direction, Hdir. With this dataset, the return values of the hazards’ (i.e. inundation and erosion) for the return periods of 5, 10, 30 and 50 years were estimated, using the Reis and Stockdon equation to calculate the wave-induced run-up and the numerical model SBEACH to calculate the storm-induced erosion. Aim of these estimations was to compare the difference between each hazard magnitude with the corresponding geomorphologic parameter (i.e. beach height and width, respectively) in order to characterize the vulnerability of the coast against each hazard and for each return period. The obtained results along the coast reflect the relative variation of the hazard magnitude in function of the beach morphology, which is mild-sloped and low beaches presenting the largest values for inundation, while the steeper and narrower ones are the most sensitive to erosion. Finally, an integrated vulnerability assessment was presented and some possible recommendations to mitigate the problems were given. It must be stressed that coastal managers play an important role in the final assessment, since they must decide the probability of occurrence to be accepted as well as the period of concern of the analysis. These two variables will determine the return period to be considered for the decision-making.","vulnerability/management; inundation; erosion","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Coastal Engineering","",""

(mentor)","2013","Households installing a photovoltaic system today in Germany are facing de-creasing feed-in tariffs and high electricity grid prices. Converting excess photovoltaic power into heat is presently discussed as a viable option for energy storage; yet the problem has not been fully investigated from an economic point of view. This paper assesses the economic feasibility of integrating a photovoltaic system for both power and heat generation. In a model, power is supplied by a photovoltaic system in addition to access to the electricity grid. Excess solar power is transformed into heat via a heating rod and stored in a water tank. Additional heat generation is based on a condensing gas boiler system, which was found to be the economically most attractive heat generation technology based on a levelized cost of energy approach. An Excel based model simulates the annual energy flows of demand and supply on an hourly resolution. The costs of the energy flows are then calculated using the net present value method. The economic feasibility is judged by comparing the integrated power and heat system cost with other possible uses of solar power such as battery storage or feeding the electricity to the public grid. The cost analysis is performed for the years 2015 and 2020 to capture the evolution of battery storage costs and feed-in tariffs. After the analysis of multiple scenarios, it was found that the proposed system does not become financially feasible until 2020. Till then it only remains the second best choice to the option of feeding the electricity generated by the photovoltaic system to the grid.

(mentor); Gattol, V. (mentor)","2013","The goal of this thesis is to develop a cultural design and branding strategy that supports an Indian nonprofit in sanitation (Sanitee) in its efforts to become an iconic nonprofit brand in the Western market. By selling t-shirts, Sanitee aims to raise funds for its sanitation projects and increase public engagement around sanitation. This thesis is considered especially relevant for organization that consider to develop a hybrid brand that combines social and commercial activities. Especially for other nonprofits in sanitation or other aid-related causes that aim to engage a Western audience by the use of fast-moving consumer goods. The value of this thesis, is that it provides practical insights for hybrids on how to accomplish such goals and what is required to reach iconic status. This result of this thesis is a strategy that involves Sanitee’s beneficiaries in both the production of its t-shirts and the development of its cause-projects. By doing so, Sanitee’s social and commercial activities and values are inherently linked. Therefore it becomes a more ideal hybrid that is able to develop a coherent cultural expression that resonates with its target customers. This expression is applied to Sanitee’s t-shirts, website lay-out and is suitable for the development of various other brand touch-points. In addition, this thesis includes a strategy to involve target customers from the campus of Delft University of Technology in the development of Sanitee’s brand. The literature review of this thesis shows how brands are able to develop a socio-cultural relevant brand that creates identity value to its customers. It investigates existing hybrid brands and identifies a framework for opportunities in innovation. This review mainly concerns brands that are popular in The Netherlands. This thesis also includes customer research in which four open-ended interviews were conducted with target customers about their preferences in the design and branding of hybrids. The main conclusion is that these customers are highly skeptical about most brands and prefer informal and small-scale projects. The scope of this thesis’ customer research mainly concerned students and recent graduates from The Netherlands. The implication of this thesis is that it affects the perception of hybrid organizational constructs and their design and branding efforts. It suggests that non-ideal hybrids have difficulty to reach iconic status due to the lack of a relevant socio-cultural expression in design and branding. This thesis can provide insights to other hybrids on how to develop an engaging and successful hybrid brand. The main recommendation is to pilot the supposed strategy and to test its value and potential of customer engagement. In addition, more extensive research is recommended on the perception of hybrid brands by Millennials in order to gather more opportunities for design and branding.","cultural strategy; branding; nonprofit; hybrid; sanitation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","Marketing and Consumer Research","",""

(mentor); Van Duin, J.H.R. (mentor); De Bruijn, J.A. (mentor); Roovers, G. (mentor); Schmidt, R. (mentor)","2013","The motive for this graduation project is to reduce the knowledge gaps in scientific literature addressing public private cooperation among stakeholders in the maritime supply chain. The objective of the graduation project is to obtain insights how public and private stakeholders should cooperate to increase the performance within the maritime supply chain. The performance of the Scheldt supply chain is defined as safety and short lead-time of the cargo vessels. Furthermore, research is done to interventions to improve the safety and lead time of the activities in the supply chain. The insights gained through the research should form the basis of a framework that can be used for the development of chain cooperation among public and private stakeholders. The goal of the framework is to lay down the conclusions of the Scheldt supply chain and interventions. Furthermore, the framework should provide information addressing the applicability of these conclusions in maritime supply chains. The Scheldt supply chain is analysed according to two perspectives, namely system and actor perspective. The first perspective is based on hard engineering discipline and the second is based on social science. Both are necessary to analyse the sociotechnical system, in this case the Scheldt estuary. The main question of this graduation project is: How can chain cooperation among the public and private stakeholders in maritime supply chains be improved? Supply chain management is able to tackle a number of problems that are currently presented during the cooperation between stakeholders. The results of supply chain management are lower cost, higher organizational performance and competitive advantage. The antecedents and requirements have to be taken into account before supply chain management can be implemented. The definition of Mentzer et al. (2001) is chosen for this graduation project. Mentzer et al. (2001) state: The systemic, strategic coordination of the traditional business functions and the tactics across these business functions within a particular company and across businesses within the supply chain, for the purposes of improving the long-term performance of the individual companies and the supply chain as a whole. Furthermore, these authors present a framework that can be used for the development of the framework for public private cooperation. The type of supply chains based on relationships and uncertainty has consequences for the perspective that is necessary for the analysis of the supply chain. Both system and actor perspective are necessary in case of complex supply chains. The Scheldt supply chain is analysed from the system perspective to the involved actors, communicated information and conducted activities. The Scheldt supply chain is analysed in the actor perspective based to the interests, power and dependencies of the stakeholders. Therefore, multiple research methods are used, namely formal relation chart, interaction diagrams, SADT/IDEF0 and power-interest diagram. The communication of information has the most influence on the performance of the supply chain. Much of the information is communicated once in the supply chain among the 18 identified stakeholders. The GNA is the stakeholder, which is most involved in the communication. Together with the pilotage services and Port of Antwerp, the GNA has the most influence on the activities in the supply chain. In the supply chain the stakeholders have conflicting interests regarding safety versus short lead time and individual versus supply chain interests. The positions of the stakeholders with high power could help to realise their interests, however the interdependency in the supply chain results that the stakeholders depend directly and indirectly on each other. Based on the conducted system and actor perspective analyses there are eleven bottlenecks identified in the Scheldt supply chain. The bottlenecks are related to each other, meaning that no bottleneck can be improved without influencing the other bottlenecks in the Scheldt supply chain. The identified bottlenecks in the Scheldt supply chain are:  Infrastructure in the Scheldt estuary  Insufficient capacity of stakeholders  Insufficient complementary processes of stakeholders  Quality of information  Sharing of information  Decision making among stakeholders regarding improvements and performance  Different business model of public, private and hybrid stakeholders in the Scheldt supply chain  Conflicting interests and different priority of interests  Internal focus of stakeholders  Power positions and dependencies in the supply chain  Cultural differences among Dutch/ Belgium and public/ private stakeholders There can be five essential problems extracted based on the bottlenecks in the Scheldt supply chain, which are confirmed by the interviews that are conducted with stakeholders. Because these problems are mentioned during each conducted interview, it confirms that the problems stated below are essential in the Scheldt supply chain.  Information is on average inaccurate, incomplete and too late and therefore influence the planning of activities  Lacking incentive to invest in the individual capacity or process, because the benefits are insufficient.  Misuse of powerful position or dependencies of stakeholders in the Scheldt supply chain  Cargo vessels which unnecessarily have to wait or detour because of lacking mutual synchronisation of activities  The focus of stakeholders on their own activities costs and benefits, which prevent a corporate identity in the Scheldt supply chain. Based on the insights from the system and actor analyses there are three types of interventions developed that will enhance the public private cooperation in the Scheldt supply chain. These three types are, go with the flow, cooperation and hierarchical interventions. To implement the interventions there has to be sufficient willingness to invest among the stakeholders otherwise the interventions might not be realised. The cooperation interventions can be divided in five interventions, namely:  Elaborate corporate strategy  Platform of communication  Template for information exchange  Shared planning specific location Infrastructure is a requirement for the function of the Scheldt supply chain. Based on the ambition of the involved stakeholders interventions would be implemented in the Scheldt supply chain to improve the performance. The respondents who have analysed the interventions concluded that the platform for communication and elaboration on corporate strategy have the most benefits in the Scheldt supply chain. The framework of Mentzer et al. (2001) has a higher potential considering the requirements than the framework of Li et al. (2005; 2006). Therefore, the framework of Mentzer et al. (2001) is used in the proceeding part of the project. The seven activities as described by Mentzer et al. (2001) have to be taken into account to realise supply chain management in a supply chain. The implementation of the seven activities depends on the ambition and willingness to invest of the stakeholders. Eventually, the implementation of the seven activities influences the performance of the private public cooperation in the supply chain. To the framework of Mentzer et al. (2001) quality of information is added as eighth activity. Shared values are present in every activity on the background and therefore it is added to the framework, but not as activity. The adjusted of the Mentzer et al. (2001) framework results in a new framework called public private supply chain cooperation (P.P.S.C.C.) framework. Furthermore, criteria are presented to check the realisation of the activities and a hierarchy of activities is presented. The reference case of Rijkswaterstaat and the corresponding discussion confirmed the activities in the framework. Since the framework is verified by one reference case there is not sufficient scientific evidence to verify the framework The chain cooperation among the public private stakeholders could be improved according the activities in the P.P.S.C.C. framework. When these activities are taken into account and implement according to the proposed hierarchy an environment among the stakeholders is created that stimulate the improvement of the cooperation. Eventually, the result is an improvement of the supply chain cooperation. Based on the gained insights there are recommendations suggested to improve the public private cooperation in the Scheldt supply chain. Furthermore, there are five recommendations provided to improve public private cooperation in general. The three recommendations are specific for the Scheldt supply chain:  Without communication there will not be a Scheldt supply chain  Initiate the Scheldt supply chain with clear defined projects instead of everything at once  Elaborate on the corporate strategy of the GNB treaty The five recommendations for the improvement of public private cooperation in general are:  A common goal among the supply chain stakeholders is essential.  Cooperation is give and take  Unambiguous definitions result in better communication, which is essential for cooperation  Multiple perspectives among the stakeholders are required.  Keep your core competences Future research to public private cooperation in maritime supply chains should focus on the justification of the P.P.S.C.C. framework and addition of relevant activities. Therefore, more reference cases should be conducted to establish scientific proof for the verification of the framework and the result is more insight in new activities. Future research should enhance the elaboration of the scorecard to rank the interventions. When more stakeholders are involved, there will be a realistic view on the consequences of the interventions. Furthermore, research has to be conducted to the power and dependencies in the Scheldt supply chain and how these can be used as advantage to realise an improvement of the performance of the public private cooperation. At last, future research should involve the processes that have to be initiated to realise the improvement of activities of the P.P.S.C.C. framework.","actor network; competitive advantage; maritime vessels; Scheldt estuary; supply chain management; system engineering","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Technology, Policy and Management","Multi Actor Systems, POLG","","SEPAM","",""

It allows multiple group members to interact with an application at the same time. This in turn allows every member of the group to directly participate in the team process rather than having to send their ideas up the chain of command. An area where such an application might come in useful is in the managing of water ows in a city. This is especially important in Dutch cities, which often lie beneath the sea level. If multiple team members could simultaneously see where there were problems with the water ows in the city and if every team member could present their solutions easily and intuitively, this could be very beneficial. For the bachelor project, such an application has been developed by the team. The application shows a model of the city of Delft which is accurate with respects to the actual relative sizes of terrain and buildings. The user can then spawn water at any place on the map and observe how the water ows through the city. But the user can do more than observing, he or she can also change the elevation of the terrain. This will allow a user to see how this change affects the flow of water. The agile programming method scrum was used in the development of the program. This gave the team the exibility they needed to successfully develop the program. Every team member was assigned a specific role and a planning for every scrum sprint was conceived to make sure that the project would go smoothly. Various tools were also used to this end, these tools handled some of the more mundane aspects of the development or made some hard parts a little easier. Even though some things did not go as expected during the development, the program as it is at this moment in time fulfills all the goals that were set up beforehand. This means a working prototype is able to run on the touch table of the Gemeente Delft and that every visitor of the i-Lab will soon be able to try out the application.","water; touch; simulation; physics","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Intelligent Systems","","Computer Graphics and Visualization","",""

(mentor); Astrid, P. (mentor); Hoogenboom, J.E. (mentor)","2013","This thesis proposes and evaluates a concept for downhole depth estimation by matching subsurface measurements from two sensors in a bottom hole assembly. The application of a downhole depth estimate in automated subsurface navigation has also been demonstrated. One of the key hurdles in achieving real time subsurface navigation lies in communication bottom neck between surface and downhole. Modern measurement while drilling and logging while drilling tools measure all vital information downhole except depth. Real time availability of depth estimate in the downhole can open new doors for real time automated bit steering and optimization in well drilling operations. The downhole depth estimation concept introduced in this thesis is based on correlation of gamma ray responses from two sensors to estimate average rate of penetration at the bit. This average rate of penetration of the bit is used to estimate distance travelled by the bit. An algorithm is proposed for correlation of gamma ray sensor response. Various parameters in the algorithm are investigated and discussed in detail for optimized performance. The error in the estimation is a result of difference between average and instantaneous rate of penetration as well as wrong correlation. Synthetic sensor response is created from a gamma ray data set to evaluate the algorithm for different noise levels and count rates. The error in estimated depth due to difference between average and instantaneous rate of penetration is approximately 2.2%. The total error is observed to be less than 4% for lower statistical noise levels. To reduce the error associated with proposed system, a nuclear marker - detector system is proposed and evaluated using Monte Carlo based nuclear simulations. In the last section the application of downhole depth for automated well-plan execution through a rotary steerable system is realised.","downhole depth; drilling automation; log correlation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2014-04-08","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","Petroleum Engineering","",""

(mentor)","2013","This research focuses on fracture networks in sedimentary rocks within the Umbria-Marche fold-and-thrust belt in the Northern Apennines, Italy. The aim of this research is twofold, namely to correlate the geometry of fracture networks with tectonic position and lithology and to correlate the orientation of fracture networks with the origination of a fold-and-thrust structure. The fold-and-thrust belt within the area strikes about N160° and developed in the Miocene within a compressional regime as the result of the collision between the European Corsica-Sardinia Margin and the Adriatic plate, accompanied by back-arc extension due to rollback. In order to analyze geometries of fracture networks software named DigiFract is used to digitize outcrops in the field. Fracture orientation, density, spacing, height and termination are analysed for different lithologies within the Umbria-Marche succession. Orientations of fracture sets are correlated to different structural stages during the development of the fold-and-trust structure. The first stage in which fractures develop is layer parallel shortening, during which bedding-normal pressure-solution surfaces develop, striking parallel to the hinge line. Subsequently, longitudinal joints striking parallel to the hinge line develop during fold initiation. This is followed by amplification and tightening of the fold, causing development of transversal joints, striking perpendicular to the hinge line. In theory, fold limbs are preferred sites for deformation within an active-hinge fault-related anticline, rather than the corresponding anticlinal crests (Salvini and Storti, 2001; Salvini and Storti, 2004). Our data is not substantial to proof this theory, but is in accordance to it. Chert, primarily present in the Maiolica Fm and the Diasprini Fm, and marl, present in the Bisciaro Fm, act as non-fractured or very low density-boundary between fractured beddings. Siliclastic turbidites are less fractured than carbonates at similar tectonic positions.","fracture network geometry; DigiFract software; fracture orientation; fold-and-thrust structure","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","2013-07-12","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","Applied Geology","",""

(mentor); Thomassen, E.W. (mentor)","2013","This document describes the development of a manual pressurized atomization system for impregnation coating textile for New Way Technology. New Way Technology is an innovative company, specialized in sustainable nano-hybrid products. New Way Technology develops, produces and distributes environmentally safe coating, cleaning and impregnation products and additives, based on nano technology. The research has been executed on different perspectives. The approach focused all one’s attention on which liquid application methods there are, how to get the optimal conditions for applying the textile coating on a surface and which are the dimensions to indicatie the right direction to develop an atomization system for textile coating. The cleaning and coating products exists for a longer period already, but without any packaging and/or packaging line for the products. This led to the initial graduation assignment to develop a packaging and packaging line for the products of New Way Technology. During the project this assignment changed into a more specific assignment to develop a manual pressurized atomization system for coating textile. Within the analyses it appeared that the current temporary bottle, with a press system, did not function well for coating textile. There was no constant distribution of liquid and consequently some parts of the textile remained uncoated. This influenced the functioning of coating negatively and had to be solved. The main assignment could be divided into sub design problems. These design problems are “how to put air into a bottle”, “how to activate/drive a spray mechanism” and “how to give feedback to the user”. Within the assignment it was obvious that the activation mechanism to put air into the bottle had to be manual and the functioning easy as well as self-evident for the user. This ended in the decision to implement a pump. The decisive factors for the spray mechanism were airtightness and simply assembly. Unfortunately, the different possibilities and research conclusions showed that the wish to give feedback to the user could not easily be fulfilled. Combining the subsolutions let to the basics for the final concept which consists of three main parts; the case (the basis), the pump element and the spray system. For the dimensions of the final product the connection between the pump and the case were very important. The height of the case and the diameter of the case should be well balanced. The pump has to fit within the case, so their dimensions influence each other. More important was that the relation between the volumes of the pump and case influenced the amount of pump movements (user handling) and the decrease in pressure. More important is that the amount of pump movements (user handling) and the decrease in pressure has been influenced by the relations between the two volumes. A simulation model was setup to determine the optimal proportions. Within this simulation also the user was involved. Concrete, the diameter of the case depends on the maximum grip circumference of the user and the force to pump correlates with the maximum hand force. The further elaboration of the elements of the manual pressurized atomization system was based on minimalistic design. Due to these simple shapes and decreased amount of parts the costs for the production and assembly remain low. Besides, through the optimalization of the dimensions both the material use and the costs involved reduced. This effect resulted also in a lower environmental impact. All aspects that are important for the company and the user. Unfortunately, in order to make the product tamper evident a sealing was required by the company for which still extra material was needed. With the addition of a sealing the design of the NWT – Manual Pressurized Sprayer had been finished. The coating can be applied through the pre-condition; spraying under pressure. Using a manual pump system contributes to a better environment in comparison with spraying by a propellant. An additional advantage is that rebuilding of the pressure is possible. Spraying with the desired pressure results in a more equal distribution of the liquid and a better adhesion of the coating. Final result, an optimal coated piece of textile, which is water and dirt repellent. One recommendation for further product development is decreasing the overall costs. Despite the optimization the costs of the product remaining too high, especially because of the high investment costs for the moulds. These costs certainly can be reduced in further product development. At the one hand this could be achieved by increasing the batch size. This resulted in lower investment costs per product and the possibility to make even better price-fixing agreements. On the other hand the production methods could be optimized what will also lower the costs. Another aspect which could be improved is the total size of the product. Within the user test it has appeared that the grip and the height could be a bit smaller. Applying these aspects within the product design this will contribute to the birth of a successful new packaging product","atomizing; nano-coating; packaging; pressure; spraybottle","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design","",""

De hoofdvraag hiervan was: hoe snel gaat het dit droogproces en hoe hangt dat af van de samenstelling, in het bijzonder de korrelgrootte en het gehalte organische stof? De verwachting was dat het fijne slib een hoger vochtgehalte heeft dan het grove slib en dat slib met organisch materiaal meer water zou kunnen vasthouden dan slib zonder organisch materiaal.

Two algorithms that use remote sensing information to infer the corresponding bathymetric evolution are cBathy (Holman et al., 2013) and Beach Wizard (van Dongeren et al, 2008). cBathy models the temporal evolution of bathymetry by assimilating up-to-date bathymetry observations with a prior running average bathymetry.

Beach Wizard is a data-model assimilation scheme that works by comparing multiple sources of observed information with numerical model results. The bathymetry is progressively updated in time in order to make the observed and computed properties converge. Although Beach Wizard has the ability to use multiple sources, the main source of information it uses is video-derived roller energy dissipation. The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether a combination of the two algorithms can improve our ability to estimate the nearshore bathymetry. The method of combining the two algorithms was to use cBathy bathymetry observations in combination with roller dissipation maps as sources to the Beach Wizard data-model assimilation scheme. Results demonstrated that a possible method of combining the sources is to use cBathy bathymetry estimates as Beach Wizard sources during calm conditions and roller dissipation maps as Beach Wizard sources during stormier conditions. cBathy bathymetry estimates perform well as Beach Wizard sources in the surf zone during low energy conditions; however, performance decreases during higher energy conditions (when waves are breaking). It is during these higher energy conditions that imaps become more relevant in this region.","Argus; Beach Wizard; cBathy; data-model assimilation; remote sensing; bathymetry; Duck; XBeach","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Hydraulic Engineering","",""

(mentor)","2013","Membrane structures have a rich history of use across many disciplines and are widely used in aerospace and structural engineering applications. A few examples can be found in solar sails, atmospheric balloons and parachutes. These membranes have many advantages, including their ability to take complex shapes and their low mass to surface ratio, which is especially important in aerospace engineering. Although membranes can carry tensile loads very well, they tend to wrinkle under the slightest compressive load. As these wrinkles affect the load carrying capabilities of the membrane it is important to model the stress distribution in the membrane accurately to assess these capabilities. To model the wrinkles in a membrane, the mesh size in a numerical model needs to be at least as small as the wrinkles to detect them. Considering the small scale of the wrinkles with respect to the membrane as a whole, this requirement often results in unacceptably high computational costs. This issue can be solved by modeling the wrinkles as a continuous in-plane contraction of the membrane, which is known as the tension field theory method. This method is incorporated into the theory of finite deformations by a relaxed strain energy function defined in the literature. In this thesis it was investigated whether a variational formulation of the relaxed strain energy function can be used to obtain a robust and efficient method to model the stress distribution in membranes in the presence of wrinkles. Using the interior-point method, the relaxed strain energy function was formulated as an unconstrained optimization problem based on the original strain energy function. The convexity properties of this relaxation were proven to guarantee a stable energy minimization in the membrane. Using the variational principle three governing equations were obtained which uniquely described the deformation of the membrane under applied loading and the stresses and wrinkling strains in the membrane. The solution to these equations was obtained by discretization of the membrane structure and a linearization of the governing equations. Several numerical examples were considered which assessed, verified and validated the proposed method. It was shown that the method is efficient and robust based on the properties of the governing equations and the numerical results.","membranes; wrinkling; relaxed strain energy function; interior-point method; variational formulation; convexity; tension field theory; finite element method; isogeometric analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Aerospace Structures and Materials","","Aerospace Structures and Computational Mechanics","",""

The functionality of the DizzyData system is exposed through a Representational State Transfer (REST) Application Program Interface (API) that DF can use. Due to the extensive possibilities of DizzyData software and the characteristics of DF’s typical users, the project leaned a bit to the field of End-User Programming. Due to this risen demand for digital document processing, not just for invoices, the DizzyData project was started to provide users with the possibility to build their own digital document processing solution. The DizzyData technology has great flexibility in the document processing Workflows, allowing for numerous different applications to be created. With this great flexibility comes a problem. Because of the vast amount of options and combinations of all these options, understanding the workings of the system can seem a daunting task. The complexity makes it hard to keep an overview and to explain to potential customers the capabilities of the solution and what they can use it for. This is where our project comes in. The front-end which we created should give the users an overview of the system, and make creating and editing the structure and properties of a document Workflow easy and clear. This helps to make the project accessible for users that lack experience in programming and development, thereby also helping the sales team by allowing them to give a graphical demonstration of the product to potential customers. ___ The report covers the initial assignment as provided by the stakeholder, the process and the tools and methods used, research and preparations, the system design, some facets of the implementation with examples, quality assurance, future work and a conclusion as well as some appendixes including our orientation report, the plan of approach, our adoption of Scrum and a quick start guide on git.","DizzyData; front-end; interface; web; user interaction; OCR; Bachelor project","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Computer Science","","Technische Informatica","",""

(mentor); Fossati, F.V. (mentor)","2013","A common practice during the design of a sailing yacht is to assume an ideal environment. The wind is constant in intensity and direction and the sea is calm. In this situation, an equilibrium between the aerodynamic and hydrodynamic forces and moments can be found. The equations of equilibrium are thus solved to find the best setup (combination of sails, sail trim, etc.) in order to achieve the maximum boat speed. This procedure is the core of a 'traditional' Velocity Prediction Program (VPP), which was first introduced in 1976. Since then many improvements have been made and nowadays VPPs are capable of dealing with the most diverse designs. However, in nearly forty years of life, the nature of these programs has not changed and, still, important dynamic effects caused by the real environment, are not taken into account. Investigating the performance of a yacht taking into account these effects, is far from easy. Indeed, the equations of equilibrium should be replaced by the more complicated equations of motion which need to be solved in the time domain. However, in recent years, the dynamic characteristics of a yacht sailing in waves and shifting winds (real environment) have become a more popular topic in the sailing yacht community. In the wake of the increasing interest towards this subject, the present work aims to investigate some important dynamic aspects. The effect of the surge motion and of the heeling angle on the motions of heave and pitch, and on the mean added resistance, are studied by means of towing-tank tests. These are performed on two models of series 4 of the Delft Systematic Yacht Hull Series. Then, time-domain simulations are performed to study the effect of a pitch-induced oscillating aerodynamic force on the seakeeping of yachts sailing upwind in waves. The aerodynamic force is calculated using a quasi-steady as well as an unsteady method, whereas the hydrodynamic part of the problem is tackled using a strip-theory program which is capable of considering asymmetric hull shapes (e.g. hulls with a heeling angle). The results show that surge has a small influence on the motions and on the mean added resistance alike. The heeling angle on the other hand, prove to have a large effect on the seakeeping of the models. This effect can be qualitatively predicted by the strip-theory program, although the trend is not always correct. Finally, in same cases, the aerodynamic force significantly affects the pitch and heave motions and this results in a considerable reduction of the added resistance in waves.","sailing; unsteady; time domain; upwind; dynamic; VPP; yacht; DVPP; aerodynamic; hydrodynamic","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Maritime and Transport Technology","","Ship Hydromechanics and Structures","",""

(mentor); Verwaal, M. (mentor)","2013","Recently, Bang & Olufsen (B&O), manufacturer of a highly distinctive and exclusive range of quality audio, video and multimedia home equipment (Chapter 1.3), launched their subbrand B&O PLAY to address the Urban Creative Professional (UCP), an audience that lives life actively and is able to make large individual purchases to radiate an image of intellectuality (Chapter 2.1). The first product to be presented under the wings of B&O PLAY was the Beolit 12, a speaker marketed as portable. However, with its WiFi demanding AirPlay protocol to wirelessly amplify music and a rather weighty cabinet, the product turned out to perform best as moveable in home (Chapter 2.1). With their vision “Courage to constantly question the ordinary in search of surprising, long-lasting experiences”, B&O aimed to take today’s portable speaker to the next level. They wanted it to perform better in portability and ease of use, while maintaining the high quality standard of their acoustics. In other words, the goal was to improve product usability (Chapter 1.1). However, their ideal to move its customer with enduring magical experiences drives the company in a constant search for technological excellence. As a result, the company found interest in an user interface technology, supplied by Aito. This supplier’s piezo technology allows the seamless integration of an interface without losing its intuitivity, due to the inverse piezoelectric tactile feedback (Chapter 3). With this potentially game changing capabilities they aspire to change the perception of touch switches from simple ‘input tools’ to a rich, intuitive and powerful experience (Chapter 1.3) By implementing the Aito technology in the desired B&O speaker, the improvement of product usability could become even stronger. Therefore the design assignment became: “Design the next level high-end portable speaker by implementing the Aito technology, which should contribute to the improvement of product usability” (Chapter 1.2). With the awareness of today’s acceleration of technology development and the approaching saturation of the portable speaker’s market (Chapter 2.1), B&O aims to launch this new design in spring 2014. Therefore, it was desired to finalize the assignment with a visual prototype with working Aito technology. The assignment was divided into the following three design objectives in order to simplify the attempt to a successful completion: Integration of the Aito technology, improvement of usability in terms of the user interface and improvement of usability regarding outdoor use (Chapter 1.2). The introduction of the new technology created the possibility to approach the design process differently than IDE students are normally accustomed to (Chapter 1.4). Roberto Verganti’s ‘technology epiphany’ theory was applied to search for an innovative meaning that could radically differentiate this speaker from its predecessor. Initially, a design-driven approach was taken to explore the design context and companies’ values as well as to see what might be beyond those boundaries (Chapter 2). To achieve the latter, interpreters were addressed to discuss what meaning people could give to the evolving life context. The designer used the interpreter’s input to envision a meaning. In parallel, the technology-push approach was carried out to uncover possibly hidden meanings of the Aito technology, which could contribute to the designer’s envisioned meaning (Chapter 3). The technology’s capabilities and criteria, helpful in achieving the first objective of Aito’s technology integration, were used in combination with the already found boundaries of the design-drivers to capture the envisioned meaning into a more realistic design direction for a speaker (Chapter 4): “Design a weatherproof portable speaker that encourages the UCPs to live their life actively outside home, by providing them with the ability to take along their home comfort of socially sharing music, enabling the enduring magical experience due to social affirmation.” Moreover, a sound concept proposed by the B&O acoustic department was analysed to reveal specific product constraints that set the foundation of the product regarding dimensions and weight (Chapter 3.4). Subsequently, use-cases were addressed with the design direction in order to define the product functionalities and additional technical specifications (Chapter 5). Outdoor related functionalities ‘portability’, ‘protection’ and ‘product placement’ required a design approach to explore how they could be achieved. This contributed to the addressing of the third objective on product usability with regard to outdoor use. Moreover, B&O’s design language was elaborated to be able to still ensure a premium look (Chapter 6.3). The second objective was addressed in the design phase as well. The target audience had been interviewed in the analysis phase to discover their listening behaviour. (Chapter 2.1) The concluding requirements in combination with the capabilities of Aito’s technology resulted in several innovative user interface ideas, designed for the given time-to-market and aimed to contribute to the improvement of usability (Chapter 6.2). All knowledge and requirements resulted from the execution of the design objectives were taken into account in the ideation phase (Chapter 6.5), in which integrated design ideas were sketched. These were converted into more elaborated concepts (Chapter 6.6) which were qualitatively validated by the designer and his B&O colleagues. Parts of concepts were combined and redesigned into a final design on the basis of comments given by B&O (Chapter 6.8). The final design was embodied in a visual prototype (Chapter 8). Eventually, the development process was evaluated to verify the success of Verganti’s design approach. The conclusion was drawn that Verganti’s method did not support enough in achieving a radical innovation. The analysis of the Aito technology taught us it has the potential to become the game-changer in product user-interfaces. Therefore the technology is considered radical in itself, enabling a radical change in usability, as opposed to a radical change of the entire product meaning. Furthermore, an product evaluation on the basis of the target audience’s requirements to verify the success of the product with these critical people, concluded very positive. (Chapter 10). The thesis concludes with recommendations.","design; usability; technology integration; user interface; interaction; consumer electronics; audio","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2014-07-05","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Van Wingerden, J.W. (mentor); Van Solingen, E. (mentor)","2013","Wind is arguably the most promising source of sustainable energy. However, it is still considered to be an expensive option compared to fossil fuels. Recent developments have achieved significant cost reductions and increased the reliability on wind energy. The main reason for this has been the application of innovative and effective control strategies. All turbine designs over time have been involved in reducing the overall cost of energy by either maximizing energy yield or minimizing the effect of loads to increase the life of the wind turbine. Minimizing the effect of loads is the main focus in this thesis. Control strategies currently used in the industry involve changing the pitch angle for each individual blade to reduce the loads and are called Individual Blade Pitch Control (IPC). However, this strategy causes considerable wear and tear to the large pitch bearings in the wind turbines due to high frequency pitch control action. Thus, control strategies which not only reduce loads, but also provide smoother pitch control action are investigated in this report. It is observed that periodic loads faced by the blades of the wind turbine can be represented by a limited number of parameters such as rotor speed, they are slowly changing and more importantly, account for much of the fatigue causing loads. Thus, this thesis report focuses on applying suitable control strategies to primarily reduce periodic loads. Moreover, since the loads are periodic and slowly varying, the use of basis functions as the input space of a feedforward controller can result in smoother pitch activity. The aforementioned strategy has previously been applied on the ``\emph{Smart Rotor}'' concept which is a mechanism where each blade is equipped with trailing edge flaps similar to an airplane wing to change the lift profile of the blade to reduce loads. This strategy has been successfully applied to the \acs{IPC} mechanism and has resulted in lower pitch activity. The control methodology applied to IPC discussed above is a feedforward controller which consists of parametrized basis functions. The algorithm discussed involves a learning technique where the control parameters are calculated through successive correction in each trial period by ensuring that the wind turbine does not repeat its ``mistakes''. Consequently, the feedforward control is adaptive as it can adjust the controller parameters to compensate for changes in plant dynamics during operation. However, since the controller is based on a model linearized for a particular set of operating conditions such as wind speed, the performance of the controller deteriorates during turbulent wind conditions. Additionally, since it takes a few revolutions for the control parameters to converge and that if the rotor speed changes during this time, the parameters calculated are no longer optimal.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Delft Center for Systems and Control","","","",""

As both techniques have their own strengths and weaknesses, a combination of both techniques can complement each other in certain fields of research. The combination of these two imaging techniques is referred to as correlative microscopy. The SECOM platform is a platform that integrates an optical fluorescence microscope with a scanning electron microscope. This platform has been developed at the Charged Particle Optics group of Delft University of Technology and has resulted in a spin-off company called Delmic. Delmic made this platform commercially available and further explores new possibilities for simultaneous correlative light and electron microscopy applications. One of the fields where the SECOM platform enables interesting possibilities is the field of live cell imaging. In previous research projects devices have been developed that allow simultaneously imaging of living cells in their naturally hydrated state with optical and scanning electron microscopy using the SECOM platform. In addition to the ability of simultaneous correlative imaging, this thesis focuses on integrating a way of manipulating the sample in the device while imaging. This allows observing changes in the sample after addition of a pharmaceutical and adding contrast agent during imaging. Here a conceptual design is presented that integrates two microfluidic pumps, reservoirs and an imaging area with microfluidic channels in a single MEMS device. By alternating two flows from the two separate reservoirs the environment of the sample can be changed and so thesample can be manipulated. This manipulation can be performed while imaging the sample with correlative microscopy. One of the critical manufacturing steps of the proposed conceptual design is bonding of the silicon base to a coverglass. A suitable bonding technique for this manufacturing step is proposed. A simplified design has been manufactured in order to demonstrate this bonding process and create a device that allows manipulating the sample by changing the composition of the fluids that surround the sample. Experiments have been conducted to evaluate the bonding process and the microfluidic performance of the device. It is observed that the proposed bonding technique results in the desired hermetic, vacuum compatible and biocompatible bond that is optically transparent and does not block the microfluidic channels. Furthermore it is demonstrated that the layout of the microfluidic channels and the imaging area allows alternating two flows with different composition through the imaging area.","MEMS; correlative microscopy; SCLEM; microfluidics; live cell imaging; SEM; electron microscope","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-08-16","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Precision and Microsystems Engineering","","Micro and Nano Engineering","",""

(mentor); Hut, R.W. (mentor); Steele-Dunne, S.C. (mentor); Ursem, W.N.J. (mentor)","2013","Satellite-based soil moisture measurements indicate a diurnal variation in backscatter in west Africa. This diurnal variation is assumed to be caused by variation of moisture content in vegetation (Friesen, 2008). The obtained satellite soil moisture data can be improved, if ground measurements support this hypothesis. Especially at locations with a dense land cover, where the satellite can’t penetrate into the soil improvements can be made. Currently there are no easy applicable methods to measure vegetation water content continuously, which can assist in confirming the relation between vegetation water and the satellite measurements. In this research a new non-destructive, cheap, easy applicable and continuous method to measure water content in trees is developed. This new method makes use of the variation in natural frequency caused by the diurnal variation of water content in trees. The natural frequency of a tree depends on its stiffness and its mass. Diurnal variations in the mass of a tree are mainly caused by changes in water content. To determine the natural frequency two methods are tested. The first method makes use of the wind as a driving force and the measurements are analysed in the frequency domain. The second method uses a single pulse as driving force and the measurements are analysed in the time domain. To confirm the validity of the proposed analyses both methods are first tested on simplified system (a stick fixed in a vice). Different weights are attached to the top of the stick to relate weight and frequency changes. The vibration of the simplified system and of trees are measured with an accelerometer. To determine the natural frequency both systems are modelled as a damped first order spring-mass system. Results indicate that, for the simplified system, changes in natural frequency are detectable and can be related to mass changes of the system. When the methods are applied on a tree the accuracy of the measurements is not high enough to identify changes in weight, caused by variation in water content. It is possible to measure the natural frequency of a tree but the changes in natural frequency due to changes in water content are very small (less than 0.1 Hz for small trees). For the simplified system the weight changes compared to the own weight of the system are much larger. Presumably, this is the main reasons for the difference in performance between the simplified system and measurements on a tree. Additionally, the simplified system is better represented by a first order spring-mass system. Previous studies have indicated that the anisotropic mechanical properties of a tree, prevents it from behaving like a first order spring-mass system.","natural frequency; weight fluctuation; tree","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-07-09","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Water Management","","Water Resources","",""

(mentor)","2013","With an expected growing city population, growing number of households and an optimal international position as a port- and services city, Rotterdam has many potentials to be lively and economically viable. However, the inner city image and quality are lagging behind to benefit optimally from this perspective. The city center determines the attractivity of the city towards the public, and is therefore of great importance for the economic strength of the city. The center of Rotterdam is relatively sparsely populated. Main streets are dominated by wide traffic streets which separate parts of the city center. On top of that, very central streets in Rotterdam are monofunctional places which lack the diversity of use to stay active during the whole day. Governmental interventions to increase liveliness in the center are in process, but since the economic crisis struck, it has become very difficult to drastically increase the number of mixed-use buildings and add residential housing to increase activity in the streets. This is why another focus is necessary to increase liveliness and activity in the city center. The opportunity for intervention lies in the lack of attractivity of the public space. Many places of potential in the city center lack the quality and human scale that is necessary to invite people to stay and create the dynamics of people interacting with each other. Attractive public space can increase the amount of visitiors and extend the period of residing in the city, which is good for commercial and cultural facilities. Eventually, good quality and image of the city center is vital for attracting new people and inhabitants, businesses and investors. If nothing is done, Rotterdam might lose the competition between Amsterdam and Utrecht, and stay behind in socio-economic perspective. This thesis is about the spatial conditions for a more vital and attractive city for people to stay, live and work in. The goal eventually is for Rotterdam to be better able to attract new people and businesses and become more economically viable. The design intervention implements spatial conditions to create an attractive inner city public space in the main boulevard of Rotterdam, the Coolsingel. The goal was to show that with a different traffic strategy for the city center, a large part of the Coolsingel street can be transformed into an attractive and more vibrant urban space, which can improve the image of the center of Rotterdam.","inner city vitality","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-07-05","Architecture","Urbanism","","Urban Regeneration in The European Context","",""

Findings/conclusion Using a landscape approach, regional park IJsselmonde is a park that is designed to recover the relationship between the city and the landscape, at a location where this relation has been completely lost due to rapid urban expansion and fragmentation by infrastructure. By clearly dividing the three existing landscapes (urban garden, cultural landscape, wilderness) at the island, but at the same time recognising the complex coherence between the three, a new relation between the city and the countryside is made. The image of the wilderness for the waterfront creates an attraction for visitors. The park is made better accessible, both by public transport and by bike and program is added that complies with the different characters of the open space. By doing this, the open areas are protected from unwanted urban developments since all new developments should be measured against the image set for the area.","regional park; ijsselmonde; accessibility; wilderness; agricultural landscape; urban garden; waterfront; recreation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-07-08","Architecture","Landscape Architecture","","","",""

(mentor); Madrazo, F. (mentor)","2013","The lobby of the Metropole, a habitable bridge in Rotterdam In our mobilized epoch considered as the network era, hubs are crucial devices for the orchestration of our cities. Road and building mediate in the quality of our cityscapes like the Randstad in which we live as continuous commuters. The habitable bridge is used as the ultimate typology for the examination of a new form of architecture in which a multitude of urban functions are brought together. The province meets the city, the artificial meets the natural, architecture meets infrastructure. Despite a strong belief in the capacities of architecture and infrastructure, Rotterdam did not manage to merge these two paradigms after the Second World War. Although the ambition is there to merge the boulevard with the river, the south with the north, the street with the building, significant proposals are lacking. Through the use of historical precedents like the multifunctional Boompjes of the Golden Age, the reintroduction of the river as valuable public space is envisioned. The fascination for a multifunctional bridge, merged with the ambitions of Rotterdam, catalyzed by the architectural needs of a new era forms the base for my proposal ‘The Lobby of the Metropole: the Fusion of Architecture and Infrastructure in Tomorrow’s Megalopolis’. METABOLISTIC COLLECTIVE FORM AND THE POTENTIAL OF CONGESTION The city is approached as an organism that comes to life through a multitude of streams. The careful orchestration of urban flows is considered as the main challenge of the urban fabric. The integral design of landscape, architecture and infrastructure could catalyze the quality of our future cities. Previous to my design ‘The Lobby of the Metropole’, I did an extensive research into the ideas of the Japanes Metabolists and the history of Rotterdam. Through a written report called ‘The fusion of architecture and infrastructure in tomorrow’s Megalopolis - The Relevance of the Metabolistic Collective Form in the Network Era’ I have laid the foundation for my design. The acknowledgement of different speeds in the city is integrated in the design of a habitable bridge in which a variety of streams are accomodated, among other: walking, biking, living, working, commuting (tram) and driving (car). The resulting proposal for a multimodal hub exploits densification in favour of urban sprawl. The design acknowledges the potential of metropolitan accumalation instead of considering a new realm as unmanageable congestion. Approaching the infrastructure of the city as architectural challenge provides a new attitude in which landscape (public space), architecture (buildings) and infrastructure (roads) are considered as equal mediators in the city. To improve the quality of Rotterdam, the ground floor of the design is kept free for pedestrians, bikers and public transport. Favouring slow traffic at the expense of cars will improve the habitable quality of the city. The large open ended steel structure accomodates public and private program. Future transformations can easily be processed through the use of a flexible system in which ventilation, data, energy and walls are easily accessible. Programs work through a ‘plug and play’ method.","lobby; Metropole; habitable bridge; architecture infrastructure; architecture; infrastructure; bridge; megalopolis; metabolism; Rotterdam; Multimodal; Hub; Terminal; New era; Flexibility; Sustainability; Technology; Domestication; Collective Form; Fumihiko Maki; Havenstad; Harbor; Harbour; Riverside; River; Urbanism; Plinth; Groundscraper; Living Bridge","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2016-07-05","Architecture","Explore Lab","","","",""

(mentor); Chang, Z.Y. (mentor)","2013","Om een pH-sensor[1], ontwikkeld binnen het PASTEUR-project [2], aan te kunnen sturen en uit te kunnen lezen is een ontwerp voor een sensorsysteem gemaakt dat de pH en temperatuur in vlees kan monitoren. Belangrijke eigenschappen hiervan zijn het lage energieverbruik, de draadloze digitale communicatie en het kleine formaat. Het systeem meet gedurende 48 uur elke tien minuten de pH en slaat deze op. Andere intervallen zijn ook mogelijk, maar dat verandert wel de tijd waarin het systeem blijft werken. De gebruiker kan al deze data ophalen via een reader en ook een instantane meting aanvragen. Het sensorsysteem is opgedeeld in twee onderdelen: de draadloze communicatie en de sensor node. In deze thesis wordt het ontwerp van de sensor node besproken. Deze stuurt de sensor daadwerkelijk aan, slaat de rauwe data van de pH en temperatuur op en geeft dit door aan de draadloze communicatie zodat deze de data kan versturen naar een computer, die de data verder verwerkt. De sensor node bestaat uit een microcontroller en een extern geheugen om alle data in op te slaan. Daarnaast bestaat het uit hardware om de communicatie met de RFID-tag en de sensorstick mogelijk te maken. Het systeem bevindt zich het grootste gedeelte van de tijd in sleep mode om energie te besparen. De microcontroller die hiervoor gebruikt is, is de C8051F986 van Silicon Labs, welke de laagste sleep mode current heeft op de huidige markt. Het geheugen is een 24AA64-I/OT, een EEPROM chip van 64kbit met I2C communicatie. De draadloze communicatie zal door middel van RFIDtechniek tot stand komen. De groep die dat ontworpen heeft, gebruikt de TMS37157, een passieve RFID interface met SPI aansturing. Een protocol is ontwikkeld, genaamd het Data Link Protocol, om foutloze dataoverdracht te garanderen. De sensor node wordt gevoed door een 3V lithium knoopcel. De microcontroller en het geheugen wordt direct gevoed door de batterijspanning, de pH-sensor door een 1,8V regulator, en het RFID subsysteem wordt enkel gevoed door de RF energie van de reader. De software is geschreven in C en werkt zonder operating system, omdat er slechts één proces tegelijkertijd zal worden uitgevoerd en een OS dus niet noodzakelijk is. De software is opgebouwd uit een toplaag, een middenlaag en drivers. De toplaag bestaat uit de mainfunctie die controle heeft over de functie die met de TMS37157-chip communiceert, de functie die het geheugen beheert, de slaapfunctie en de functie die de pH-sensor aanstuurt en uitleest. Vanuit de TMS37157-chip kunnen acht verschillende commando’s komen die door de sensor node moeten worden opgevolgd. Op basis hiervan roept de mainfunctie de juiste functies aan. Ondanks de CRC-check van de TMS37157-chip moet de foutdetectie van de draadloze communicatie extra verzekerd worden, omdat de CRC geen rekening kan houden met geheel niet ontvangen van verzendingen. Daarvoor is er een data link protocol ontwikkeld. In het geheugen worden de kalibratiemetingen, de geplande metingen en de instantane metingen apart opgeslagen. Hierbij is ervoor gezorgd dat genoeg ruimte is om acht kalibratiemetingen op te slaan. Bij deze kalibratiemetingen worden de time stamp en de pH-waarde, door de gebruiker meegegeven, opgeslagen. Zonder getriggerde metingen is er daarnaast nog ruimte om 2698 geplande metingen op te slaan, wat meer dan voldoende is voor wat nodig is om 48 uur lang elke tien minuten een meting te doen. Dit aantal is wat minder met getriggerde metingen erbij, omdat deze meer ruimte innemen. Het ontwerp is nog niet getest, dus er zijn nog geen algemene resultaten te zien, maar met behulp van een logic analyser is wel aangetoond dat het beheren van de EEPROM en de communicatie met de TMS-chip via SPI werkt.","pH temperatuur sensor draadloos energiezuinig monitoring versheid bederfelijkheid houdbaarheidsdatum","nl","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics & Computer Engineering","","","",""

Enabling water management plans for Southwest Dutch delta to give the nature more important position in order to strengthen area’s socio-economic vitality","Kozlovskaja, K.","Meyer, H. (mentor); Balz, V. (mentor)","2013","“The global ecosystem is the source of all the material inputs feeding the economic subsystem” (Costanza, et al., 1997) and delta regions are the hotspots of such feeding ecosystem. Deltas have been one of the most nutritious and economy sustaining landscapes since the beginning of a human era. They provided food, water, connectivity, and even nowadays they remain one of the most densely populated areas on Earth. However, nature is not an inexhaustible source, it has a limited capacity and it regenerates rather slowly. In order to ensure the future of existing and upcoming generations the whole concept of economy has to change, because nature will never manage to keep up after unprecedentedly fast growing human needs. The relation between economy and nature has to change from nature-abusive towards the system, where nature and economy sustain each other. The Dutch Southwest delta is a great example of how human activities and needs obstructed the natural environment in an artificial state. The Delta Works protected the land from floods, contributed to the improved conditions of agriculture and created new possibilities for recreation sector. Unfortunately, on longer terms, the same Delta Works have worsened the natural qualities of delta environment, which turned against agriculture and tourism. What is more, due to the sea level rise and land subsidence, continuous dike heightening is unavoidable if another strategy is not involved. This graduation project investigates what could be the fruitful balance between engineering infrastructure and creating new roles for the natural processes. The socio-economic benefits from the natural areas are not widely recognized and accepted. Protection of these areas is often regarded merely as a cost or burden to the community and the economy rather than as a benefit (SMIT, et al., 2012). Robert Costanza was the first who attempted to valuate the global ecosystem by determining the ‘price’ of the ecosystem services. This graduation project is aiming to identify, quantify and to value the range of potential benefits delivered by managing the project area, and to consider the range of options available for capturing or generating financial returns from the range of benefits identified. Monetary value attachment to the nature can have a crucial impact on decision making towards more sustainable developments. The Grevelingen lake area became a laboratory for such developments. An experimental intervention on a vast scale is aiming to stir up the society and trigger discussions about new approaches of the delta management. An intervention is letting the water further inland and showing how it is possible to live with it without hampering any part of the delta system (nature, economy, safety). Involvement of monetary value and a cost-benefit analysis is bringing the subject closer to reality and can make the discussions between the stakeholders more precise.

(mentor); Torres, P.I. (mentor)","2013","In a typical offshore wind farm, the turbines influence each other due to an aerodynamic phenomenon known as wake interaction. A wake is a trail of reduced wind speed generated behind the turbine as result of the exchange of kinetic energy between the incoming wind field and the rotor of the turbine. When a wind turbine is operating in the wake of another turbine, the power production of this turbine is reduced. Usually, the interaction between the turbines is not included on the modeling and the control of a wind farm. Typically, the power production of every turbine is maximized locally by setting the pitch angle and the rotational speed such that the maximum point of the power coefficient is reached. Even though the power is maximized locally, the total power production of the wind farm is not optimized. Therefore, new techniques to model the interactions between the turbines need to be developed. In addition, the obtained models should be flexible and suitable for controller synthesis. In this thesis, an output-error identification method for spatially interconnected systems that makes use of sequentially semi-separable (SSS) matrices is applied to the modeling of a row of wind turbines. The advantage of using this method in this case is twofold: Firstly, the use of the SSS parameterization permits to model naturally the interaction between the turbines and secondly, all the computations involved in the modeling process can be performed efficiently. In addition, the delays present in the wake interactions can be modeled by intercalating state space models that represent pure delays and that can also be placed in SSS structure. The disadvantage of the selection of an appropriate initial guess common in the output error approaches is overcame by obtaining a model in cascade via PO-MOESP subspace identification. A comparison with a centralized identification approach is also provided.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Delft Center for Systems and Control","","","",""

(mentor); Van Gameren, D.E. (mentor)","2013","PROBLEM STATEMENT Zoetermeer is a city that has gone through a very strong growth in fifty years time. Mainly young families with children have moved to Zoetermeer in the past decades to enjoy the quietness and space that the city offers. Once the construction of VINEX district Oosterheem will be completed in 2013, the city limits will be reached. In short this means that future additions to the dwelling stock will have to take place within the city limits. The locations that the city council has appointed as inner-city building sites in June 2005 are mainly suitable for the construction of apartment buildings. The composition of the population of Zoetermeer starts to look like an average city more and more. For example Zoetermeer is strongly aging. Children leave their parental home and find themselves a way through the housing market. Eventually parents will lose the need for the large family house that they have once moved in. In short there will be more and more small households in the future. This change means that the demands of the population will change as well. Research shows that partly because of these changes there is an increasing demand for apartments. Theoretically this should match with the mentioned changes in building typology. However, this is not recognized in the transaction figures for apartments in Zoetermeer. In fact for owner-occupied apartments and apartments in the free rental sector there seems to be a weak market. One can argue that there is a mismatch between what is provided and what is needed. Zoetermeer will have to anticipate the changes in the composition of the population the next few years as good as possible. Especially with the new constructions in the next few years it is critical that the desires of the people are met. A good flow of the different target groups is partly depending on this. This research tries to find an answer to the question what aspects contribute to the success of new apartment buildings in Zoetermeer. RESEARCH Despite of the upcoming aging different target groups indicate their preference for a single-family house (Companen, 2007). This is the case especially for the younger households and families. Smaller households between the age of 35 and 65 years and elderly prefer an apartment, but transaction figures show that only few households actually choose for an apartment. The quality of a dwelling will be an important condition for house hunters to choose an apartment nonetheless. The research question that results from this question is as follows: What is the qualitative demand on the apartment market in Zoetermeer en how can this be anticipated with the development of new complexes? Goal of the research The goal of this research is to contribute to a better match between the demand and supply of apartments in the owner-occupied and the free rental sectors in Zoetermeer by appointing factors of success and failure with new apartment buildings. By hunting down the precise demands for quality of the involved target groups and linking this to the factors of success and failure, recommendations for the future additions to the apartment stock can be formulated. The underlying intention is to better serve the inhabitants of Zoetermeer with their needs and thus contribute to a more balanced housing market in general. The recommendations will mainly be propositions of what qualities should be given to the future building projects in Zoetermeer. This can refer to many different aspects, like for example the size, the plan, the price and the location. To achieve the objective the research is divided in four stages, each with a sub question and sub goal. Stage 1  Sub question: What does the mismatch look like?  Sub goal: Mapping the current housing market of Zoetermeer. Stage 2  Sub question: What are the theoretical housing preferences of apartment residents in Zoetermeer?  Sub goal: Analyzing the current and future preferences according to the literature. Stage 3  Sub question: What is the behavior of Zoetermeer residents?  Sub goal: Determine housing preferences of house hunters on the basis of recently built apartment buildings. Stage 4  Sub question: What are the potentials for future additions to the apartment stock?  Sub goal: Determine factors of success and failure for future additions to the apartment stock. MARKET ANALYSIS Population Although Zoetermeer was known as a typical family city since the 60s, the main conclusion of the period 2000-2012 is that the number of elderly households increases and the number of families decreases. Recently an increase in the number of young households has ben recognized as well. The expectation is that this number will not continue to increase but will decrease eventually and that the number of small households (30-55 years) will keep decreasing. Furthermore, the number of families keeps declining but the number of elderly households keeps growing. Especially the group 75+ will grow strongly after 2020, since the group babyboomers will reach that age about the same time. Especially after 2020 there will be a noticeably different housing need on city level with a strong focus on the growing number of elderly people. Since 2012 the group 55-75 year olds is even the largest group in Zoetermeer. Stock The present stock consists of 30,000 single-family houses and 20,000 apartments. That is a ratio of 60/40. With respect to surrounding cities the number of single-family houses compared to the number of apartments is relatively large. There, this ratio is 32/68. The present stock is characterized by a large supply of medium expensive owner-occupied dwellings and dwellings of the segment between the quality discount limit (366.37) and the liberalization limit ( 664.66) (price level 2012). The dwellings are mostly spacious, with an above average supply of 90 m2. The amount of owner-occupies apartments in the plans is higher than before, although the amount and number of owner-occupied single-family houses is much lower. THEORETICAL HOUSING PREFERENCES The housing market analysis in chapter 2 describes the current situation of the housing market of Zoetermeer. Also future predictions are being discussed for both the demand and the supply. On the basis of these predictions the future potentials are determined. The most important conclusion of the market analysis is that the focus of the coming years in Zoetermeer will largely lie on the elderly. Especially the preferences of this target group will have to be taken into consideration in future plans. The analysis also shows that in Zoeteremeer there is a relatively large tendency to move. This is an additional reason for policy. By putting together the different sources that have been cited in chapters 2 and 3 an overall picture for the future potentials of the apartment market of Zoetermeer can be composed. Price In the period up to 2009 the chances of the apartment market seemed to be in the social and medium expensive segments. Subsequently, many apartments in the medium price class have been built in the period after 2009. Due to this change in supply, the demand of the next few years will lie especially on the expensive owner-occupied apartments and the cheap rental apartments.  Owner-occupied:  200,000 – 300,000  Rental:  518 - 664 Dwelling size In general in Zoetermeer there is less need for new constructions of medium size dwellings and a greater need for variation, for example small and cheap or expansive but spacious. Less need for:  Rental: 70-90 m2  Owner-occupied: 90-120 m2 More need for:  Variation Buyers generally have a preference for a four- of five-room apartment. Tenants prefer three of four rooms. Although the average size of households declines, the need for sufficient rooms remains. Even the smaller households have the need for at least one extra bedroom.  Buyers: 4 or 5 rooms  Tenants: 3 or 4 rooms ? Architecture Apartment seekers in Dutch cities (> 100,000 inhabitants) have a preference for dwellings with a traditional architectural style. Especially with buyers this preference is significant; 65% of the seekers. Also with tenants the preference for traditional apartment buildings is the highest (37%), however 44% of the tenants say they don’t have a strong preference. Buyers are firmer in their wishes when it comes to architecture. Residential environment The most important conclusions about the living environment is that the ‘off-center’ environments (all districts surrounding the center) are not attractive in their current situation, especially not with the younger household. The growth potentials are in the green-urban areas (current supply: Rokkeveen and newer). This means that for new projects within these off-center areas spacious layouts will have to be taken into account.  Young households (<35 yr): Green-urban/center-urban  Small Households (35-65 yr): Green-urban  Families: Green-urban  Elderly: Green-urban / center-urban /off-center Facilities Both buyers and tenants of apartments think it is important to have shops for the daily groceries near their house. Also the distance to public transport and a public park are important aspects in the surroundings of a dwelling.  Shops/daily groceries  Public transport  Public park It is not the amenities that are typical for a city, like restaurants and theaters, that are preferred in the near vicinity. ANALYSIS OF LIVING BEHAVIOR IN PRACTICE Success factors Failure factors Edelweiss - Large apartments are preferred - Location (park, shops, medical center) - Show house - Buyers first choose for size, than for sun and view - Lowest levels are less popular - Smallest types not popular - Not possible to modify Spazio - Four-room apartments are popular - Apartments with unobstructed view are popular - Current residents are satisfied - Choose for location and anonymity - A great addition at once - Too expensive for interested people - Parking facilities - Lack of real balconies Bijdorp - Location in relation to shops - Medical facilities - Small scale - Social contacts - Layout of the dwellings - Size of the dwellings - Interior of the courtyard - Lack of meeting place - Parking facilities (visitors) - Lack of balconies - Storage rooms are too small - View Nuova Campagna - Small scale - Architecture - Luxurious look - Rest/space/green - Social contacts (gallery) - Penthouses (price/location) - Technical condition of public space (parking garage and porches) RECOMMENDATIONS Future additions Approximately 4800 dwellings will be built the coming years. These will mainly be apartments. This fits both the demand for the near future and the limited availability of expansion possibilities in Zoetermeer. Various recently developed apartment buildings turned out to be quite a success. Nuova Campagna is an example of a project where there is a high level of satisfaction among the residents and where developers have succeeded in selling apartments of the highest price range. Many aspects of this project can be used in future plans, like the atmospheric layout, the traditional architecture and the size of the balconies. However, duplicating such a project does not necessarily mean a repetition of its success. It has been found out that the most expensive apartments were difficult to sell. Oosterheem did not turn out to be the best location for developing penthouses. The demand for apartments will mainly be in the category  200,000 – 300,000. A complex like Spazio matches more with that price range. However, the living qualities that Spazio has to offer do not match with the wishes of the apartment hunters that are able to afford such apartments in many ways. The anonymous character, the modern architecture, and the lack of real balconies are examples of this. With future development plans it wil be most important to combine the right aspects. For dwellings with a particular price it should be considere for what target group the coherent price will be accessible. On the basis of that knowledge what kind of character or architecture fits that target group, what kind of facilities are desired, etc. There will have to be built consumer oriented. This can be done by using market analyses as the basis of housing projects and involving future residents and consumer organizations in the building process. Edelweiss is a plan where this has been done frequently. Although this is a good starting point, Edelweiss shows that even involving residents in the development, one can still fail with the final implementation. Developers will have to keep doing research. Although there is a lot of knowledge about target groups, peoples behavior and cohabitation are always subject to change. Zoetermeer is living proof of that. The traditional houdeholds cycle is becoming less ordinary. For instance there is a growth of the number of singles, an increase of the life expectancy and there is a greater difference in incomes. So also in the future research on target groups will have to be carried out continuously. Also new target groups will have to be recocnized forehanded. ? Facilities Zoetermeer is more or less fixed to the designated locations for new additions. Briefly, from now on one will have to ‘make do with what one has’. Urban planning aspects such as public parks and routes for public transport have already found their way. In the interpretation of the last housing complexes on infill sites one will have to deal smartly with these existing facilities. At each location questions can be asked, like: ‘Which target group likes living amidst the vibrance?’, ‘Which group chooses for quietness and green?’. As soon as these questions are answered , one can plan targeted. When developing new complexes there must be a focus on the availability of grocery stores. The surveys have shown that all residents of large cities have a great need for grocery stores near their homes. It is also important that houses are easy to reach by public transport and that elderly homes have medical facilities at a short distance. The market analysis shows that for all target groups the potentials lie in the green-urban environment. Especially families and small households (35-65 years) have a strong preference for green-urban living. Elderly and young households would possibly also choose for center-urban or off-center neighborhoods. In the end all off-center districts are less popular for all target groups. These are the districts that surround the city center. The main difference between the green-urban and off-center districts is the architectural interpretation. The preference for green-urban districts has not much to do with aspects like location or accessibility, but more with their layouts and image. Since the future constructions will still mainly occur in the off-center districts, the qualities of green-urban living, like the spacious layouts will have to be taken into account in order to increase the chances of success. Social and small-scale With the construction of new complexes, the focus will have to be on the green-urban character. This is coupled with the collective preference for traditional architecture, and the desire of elderly for small-scale buildings. Also with project on inner city locations this will have to be taken into account. The preference of the elderly to live small-scaled and traditionally is an expression of their social needs. As people grow older, the need for social contacts in their near environment grows too. The overall design of a complex can be based on this approach. The residents of the complex Bijdorp are very satisfied with the social atmosphere within the complex. This is partly due to the positioning of the galleries surrounding a courtyard and the small scale of the buildings. Only the courtyard could have be designed better and an indoor meeting space would fit the needs even more. The lack of balconies feeds this need even more. In particular the inhabitants of the gallery housing in the complex Nuova Campagna are very positive about the social atmosphere around their house. Here the layout is also small-scaled. Parking facilities What certainly should be taken into account in the development of new apartment buildings are the parking facilities. The case studies show that people greatly value sufficient, good and affordable parking. Also when people search for a new home this aspect plays an important role. Further, for senior housing It must be remembered that visitors also need to be able to park their cars. Dwelling size and plan Although the number of small households increases in Zoetermeer, the question remains fairly balanced in terms of dwelling size. This is because the desired living space per person is also growing. Currently there seems to be no explicit demand for small homes. Starters are not rushing as before to move to a starter home, but on average they remain with their parents longer to eventually move to a quality home. Elderly also stay in their family homes as long as possible before they decide to move to an apartment. Only when their mobility starts to form a barrier they make that consideration. In view of the enormous aging new apartments should ideally be accessible for seniors. The Handboek voor Toegankelijkheid would be a good guide for designing such houses. Even simple actions like opening the door to visitors can be a problem if there is no room right next to the door to temporarily park the walker. The practical limitations of a single family home for the elderly are often the main reason to move. Therefore, apartments must remove the barriers on technical and practical level. Number of rooms Nationally we can see a trend where buyers of apartments in major cities search for houses with four or five rooms. Tenants choose a house with three or four rooms. In Zoetermeer this does not seem to be different. Moreover, the age of the intended target group will have to play no role in determining the number of rooms. In most cases it is the composition of the household that determines the number of rooms they will need. In practice, in Zoetermeer there is generally a greater need for four-room apartments than three-room apartments. Outdoor space and view The case studies show that unobstructed view of housing is one of the most important qualities. It even seems more important than the amount of sunlight. When designing apartment buildings there must be searched for a balance between apartments with and without unobstructed view. If necessary, prices can be adjusted or extra qualities (surface) can be given as a compensation. Price There are concrete plans for about 1,900 condominiums, especially in the medium-price segment (174,000-245,000). Although medium-priced homes remain desirable in the future, this number seems too large because in the recent years many dwellings have been built in this price segment. Demand and plans 2007-2020 Source: ‘Herziening marktonderzoek. Woningmarkt Zoetermeer.’ KAW, 2012 For new construction, instead of just focusing on the medium-price segment, variation in price will ensure a better balance in supply. This is also argumentative in view of the future, when the composition of the population is expected to change again after 2030 the moment that the elderly households will decrease in number again.","Zoetermeer","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-07-04","Architecture","Real Estate & Housing","","Housing Systems","",""

(mentor); Van de Voort, J. (mentor)","2013","This Master Thesis as presented to the chair of Explore Lab 14 of the TU Delft, deals with the issue of perspective. The problem that architecture is all too often drawn out of a singular perspective and even opposes different modes of perception, is an issue which influences the role of the architect. This problem, generated at the hand of massmedia, assists in the construction of perspectives on life that in certain pataphysical instances make such an ‘activity of living’ into a completely absurd experience. A sort of ‘Hyperculture’ is constructed as tradition are denounced and embraced in society. This phenomenon is catalyzed by rapidly evolving technologies and methods of communication, and poses a problem whether a Hyperculture is absolute or not. To what extend are we dependend on traditions, and to what extend are these traditions a threath to the survival of our species? To generate architecture that facilitates both the current zeitgeist as well as a localized identity, is the imperative for the architecture of the 21st century. Not just subcultures struggle at the hand of hyperculture, but also certain professions, as economic and political life changes from day to day. In this contemporary context of hypermodernity, an entirely new generation of architects is emerging with seemingly unlimited technological possibilities. But is the current generation of architects ready to introduce them into this profession, or must we seek others to do so? The research concludes that the architects can do nothing but observe, and as such the problem of hyperculture transcends onto other actors involved in the architectural construction process: the hypercraftsman. The individual who wields these new technologies has the upperhand in deciding which traditions fuel his professional ability, and which traditions pose a threath not only to his profession, but also to the quality of the products of his making and a quality of life that these products generate. ‘How is hypermodernization apparent in professions that contribute to a broadening of design possibilities in Dutch architectural design and what is the added value of these possibilities?’ is the research question that is propoosed for this thesis. The conclusions of this research implies changes for the role of the architect as the rapid emergence of new design and manufacturing possibilities requires cooperation to a much greater extend than in contemporary architectural design. By introducing new stakeholders in the design process hyperculture may be deflected. Leading to a much greater degree of freedom for both the user and the maker-designer. This work adresses contemporary manufacturing methods and technologies and may contribute to the evolution of positive anomalies in socio-technical regimes.","hypercraft; technology; craftsmanship; philosophy; industrial ecology; architecture","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture","Explore Lab","","","",""

(mentor); Bakker-Wu, S. (mentor)","2013","PostNL Parcels (PNP) is the market leader in the Dutch domestic parcels market. This booming market is growing with almost 11% per year in revenue. PNP can keep up with this trend due to shipment volumes provided by its larger business senders belonging to the Key Account Managers. However, with the middle and smaller business senders PNP is losing revenue and market share. This will lead to an unstable situation in which larger senders can become too demanding. PNP’s position with the middle and smaller senders must be strengthened in order to stabilize the power distribution of its senders and regain market share. Internal and external analysis results PNP positions itself as a high quality player and therefore has premium pricing. However, the senders do not perceive PNP´s quality high which makes the acceptance of PNP´s premium pricing more challenging. This is particularly the case for the middle and smaller senders since they pay higher prices than the larger senders due to less shipment volume discount. Analysis showed that PNP’s inside-out developed shipment services are not customer directed. It is unknown whether PNP is offering what senders want. Furthermore, the target group of senders currently is one large group. There is no segmentation present and communicating propositions is challenging. Not knowing the concrete shipment service needs of senders and being unable to justify one´s premium pricing is the root cause of the decline in the middle and smaller senders. Customer Research The average middle and smaller sender of PNP sends more than 88% of its parcels using a single shipment service. An unique approach using Adaptive Choice Based Conjoint (ACBC) analysis was adopted to determine the optimal configuration of this shipment service. Based on these configurations, a cluster analysis was conducted. Four distinctive segments are discovered: the basic shipments, the business shipments, the important shipments and the modern shipments segment. Compared to the current amount of approximately 40 shipment services configurations this is a very large reduction. Market simulation tested a higher buying propensity for the new configurations. Interactive Tool A means of applying the new shipment services and communicating them needs to be developed. An interactive communication tool is proposed to do this. In order to gain more senders, the influx of business senders must be larger than its outflow. To accomplish this, the tool increases influx by interesting senders for PNP’s shipment services, increasing requests for quotations and helping senders to choose for PNP during negotiations. Next to that the tool decreases outflow by re-ensuring senders that PNP has the best propositions at the end of a contract. The purpose of this tool is to fill the communication gap of the shipment services, gain competitive advantage in key moments of a sender’s journey and strengthen PNP’s brand image. Conclusion The new configuration of shipment services and the concept of the tool are the results of a first step explorative study in customer directed shipment service development for PNP. It is recommended that PNP does not deny this approach to sender segmentation and shipment service development. Altogether it leads to a strategy to grow further with the middle and smaller senders, reclaim the lost market share and strengthen PNP’s position in the market.","PostNL; parcels; pakketten; ACBC; conjoint; portfolio; strategy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2014-07-04","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","","",""

TRAce Merger uses the event trace from a mobile device and the power trace from a measurement device. It synchronizes them offline, maps the mobile device events trace on the corresponding trace from the power measurement tool, and attributes energy consumption to smartphone functionalities. The event and power traces traces from these two systems contain timestamps based on the corresponding local clocks. Taking the aforementioned clocks inaccuracy and deviation into account, we synchronize these traces to extract useful information from their contents.

The project consists in designing a winery on the exact same location where old quarries once were placed on the outskirts of the village Oia, situated north of the Greek island Santorini. The quarries, a cultural landscape, are positioned right next to the town Oia having a big height-difference and as a consequence, they strongly demark a boundary between the town and the remaining surroundings. This separation has a strong impact on the local landscape and for this reason I wanted to explore the ways a boundary can be transformed from a separating element to a connecting one; explore the boundary as an architectural concept. The attention is focused on ways that a landscape of great importance can be treated and even preserved. Mass, corrosion, void, diversity, imperfection, contrasts. All these, are archetypal types that can be read and found in the island of Santorini. How does a contemporary intervention stand next to them? How does it become part of them? My answer is not based on the form and only the form. New materials are introduced, such as corten steel, contemporary ways of construction are used, but always having as a solid foundation the knowledge that I have acquired from the local way of constructing. The sculpting of the mass - which also refers to the local technique of cave houses – a process that happens from outside to inside can be parallelized with the traditional way of constructing, but using different methods and tools.","landscape; void","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2014-07-01","Architecture","Architecture","","Explore Lab 15","",""

Thesis project was performed at the Sanitary Engineering Department of the TU Delft as part of the Sustainable Energy Technology program. It is one of the unique research projects performed in the field of renewable driven Reverse Osmosis desalination, producing fresh water with only renewable energy sources as driving force. With the ever-increasing awareness regarding fossil fuel depletion and the global fresh water scarcity, developing innovative renewable powered desalination solutions has claimed its spot amongst the top future development goals. Reverse Osmosis (RO) has proven to be one of the key technologies, showing great potential in combination with renewable energy sources. However, due to the intermittent nature of renewables and the continuous operational requirements of RO membranes, the development of cheap, reliable and environmentally benign energy storage solutions is required. Previously research has been performed on an innovative Photo Voltaic (PV) driven brackish water RO system with an energy recovery device and pressurized water storage. Inspired by and based on the results obtained during the project mentioned above, a novel concept with hydro-pneumatic energy storage was designed and implemented. The scope of this project was to implement and test the designed pilot plant, after completion of a comprehensive literature research and detailed sizing & estimation trajectory. The pilot plant equipped with PV modules, a solar pump & controller, an energy recovery device, RO membrane and hydro-pneumatic energy storage was implemented and evaluated in North Jakarta, Indonesia. The results showed that hydro-pneumatic energy storage is a viable and feasible solution for continuous operation of small-scale renewable powered RO desalination systems. Unfortunately the installed system did not have the required storage capacity for 24/7 water production. However with the acquired experience and knowledge, the system behavior is now better understood and can be more easily predicted.","BWRO; Desalination; Renewable Energy; Energy Storage; Hydro-pneumatic; Reverse Osmosis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Water Management","","Sanitary Engineering Sustainable Energy Technology, Applied Sciences","",""

(mentor); Verhaegen, M. (mentor)","2013","Wind energy has relatively minor environmental impact compared to traditional energy sources. It doesn’t consume fuel or emits air pollution, while the land used for a wind farm can still be used mostly for other purposes such as agriculture. Some people state that wind turbines consume subsidies as a fuel, since they aren’t profitable without it. They use a blurred view on the real costs of energy, since they do not consider the costs associated with the pollution of the fossil energy sources. Despite this, wind energy has to deal with the public opinion that wind energy is expensive and should look for opportunities to reduce the prices. This can be done by reducing cost, increasing the yield or by extending the lifetime of the turbine. The latter can be achieved by reducing the loads on the structure. The rotor speed of a wind turbine is the result of the balance between the aerodynamic and the generator torque. Most of the utility scale variable speed wind turbines currently use a rotor speed feedback controller to control this torque balance. They can adjust the captured aerodynamic torque by changing the angle of the blades relative to the wind. But, the effect of changes in the wind on the rotor speed is delayed due to the inertia of the rotor. Meanwhile the construction suffers from the variations in the loads. For this reason it would be advantageous to measure the wind speed and use it for control, in order to anticipate on changes in the wind earlier and reduce the loads on the structure resulting in an extended lifetime of the turbine. The wind speed is currently measured on most turbines, however this measurement is useless for control, since it is contaminated by the wake of the rotor of the turbine. LIDAR is a measurement technique, which is able to measure the upcoming wind speed in front of the turbine using a laser. This measurement technique is relatively new to the wind energy market and an optimal configuration for the measurement is yet to be defined. So are the possibilities for using these measurements in a control system. A realistic simulation environment is required to investigate this and come to a reliable conclusion. This environment is created using a coupling between the simulation software packages Bladed and Simulink. It provides the possibility to co-simulate the nonlinear model of the turbine in Bladed together with a new controller in Simulink. Bladed provides simulated ‘line-of-sight’(LOS) LIDAR wind speed measurements from the wind field used. Multiple LOS measurements are combined to determine a mean wind speed representative for the whole rotor plane. How well the reality is approximated depends on the number of LOS measurements considered, the measurement distance(s) and number of measurement points per distance. The performance of the wind turbine using various LIDAR configurations is compared. The knowledge about the upcoming wind is used in the controller by adding a wind speed feedforward loop to the existing rotor speed feedback controller. The performance of the wind turbine using two different feedforward controllers is investigated. Controller A is based on the optimal pitch action for the wind at the turbine. While controller B is based on the difference between the actual pitch angle and the optimal pitch angle related to the wind speed measured at some distance. The feedback controller parameters are relaxed while using these feedforward controllers in order to achieve load reductions without deteriorating the rotor speed control. Feedforward controller B performs best for the load reduction, with reduced pitch rate demands, while having still sufficient disturbance rejection in the rotor speed control. This is because it takes more time to compensate for the virtual pitch error, resulting in lower pitch rate demands and thrust related loads. Filtering the measured wind speed adequately is a crucial step in the load reduction for controller A while controller B has this property by design. The filter effect of controller B changes with the wind speed as higher wind speeds provide less time to compensate for the upcoming changes in the wind. The optimal configuration of the LIDAR for the XD115 appears to be the pulsed system with four points on the azimuth at each of the three measurement distances. This configuration provides early knowledge about upcoming changes in the wind speed, while having sufficient coverage of the complete rotor plane.","LIDAR; feedforward; wind turbine","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Delft Center for Systems and Control","","","",""

The STAR-system uses a Phase Change Slurry (PCS) as variable thermal mass to control the indoor temperatures. Nature forms an inspiration for the design of a new system for a thermo regulative façade. Examples from nature are collected and structured by their main physical principle; conduction, radiation, vaporization, heat storage and metabolic rate. From all the examples the usable ones are translated into six concepts for a thermo regulative system for a building. Variable thermal mass proved to be the best working concept and was selected for further development. Thermal mass reduces temperature fluctuations is a room. However it can be difficult to get rid of heat accumulated in thermal mass during the summer. The STAR-system uses a PCS embedded in panels on the ceiling to buffer heat during the day. During the night, the PCS is brought to the outside in lamellas on the façade to cool down. This way, the PCS can buffer heat again in the next morning. The STAR-system can achieve an energy saving for cooling of 99.8%. The system only uses energy for a small pump, the rest of the system does not need energy and no additional cooling is strictly necessary. The STAR-system can be produced in a fully integrated façade element, or as an add-on system that can be attached to the existing façade. The system can also be installed as a custom-made system, which provides great architectural freedom. A lot of appearances for the façade are possible, as long as there is place for the PCS on the façade, in the form of lamellas or more complex shapes.","biomimicry; variable thermal mass","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-07-05","Architecture","Building Technology","","Facade Design","",""

(mentor); Valencia, A.M. (mentor)","2013","In 2012 TomTom NV started with the new department of ‘TomTom Taxi.’ The Taxi project comprises a product-service combination, which aims to make the process of taxi booking easier and more transparent. Three main products support the taxi supply: the first two are the Taxi Butler and Taxi Booking app, which enable passengers to book a taxi, and the third is the Taxi Assistant, which is a navigation device for taxi drivers on which ride requests can be received. At the start of the project the scope was very broad and the problem as given was: “Improving the user experience of the TomTom Taxi product service system.” Making this goal more specific would make it possible to improve a specific functionality of (one of the products of) the Taxi product service system (Taxi PSS). After a company and market analysis, and operational observations within TomTom Taxi (chapter 1 and 2), a more detailed problem area was decided to focus on. The associated problem statement is the following: “Design a feedback mechanism that can be implemented within the Taxi PSS and contributes to a better quality of the taxi experience.” Only Taxi Booking app users own a device, by means of which feedback can directly be submitted, so the main focus of the project is on the Taxi Booking app. Subsequently, the feedback mechanism is designed by following four steps. First, the current way of interacting and experiencing the TomTom Taxi products are mapped in a so called ‘customer journey,’ based on the insights gained from observations and interviews within TomTom Taxi (chapter 3). Second, the literature related to feedback mechanisms is discussed in chapter 4. The characteristics of PSSs and feedback mechanisms are explained and based on this information several design choices are made regarding the type of mechanism to be used, the data processing method and the time span of the rating process. In chapter 5, a total of sixteen passengers and drivers are interviewed about their taxi experiences and their preferences for a feedback mechanism within a taxi booking app. Based on the insights derived from the interviews, it is decided to design three extra menus within the current Taxi Booking app: ‘Choose quality aspects,’ ‘Choose your driver’ and ‘Rate the ride.’ It was also found that the largest difference in taxi user groups concerns the subdivision between the leisure/tourist and professional passenger group. This insight is implemented by offering the app users the option to choose for either ‘lowest price’ or ‘shortest waiting time.’ Furthermore, the most important taxi quality aspects were revealed. Within the new feedback mechanism users can indicate their preferences by (un)checking them in the ‘Choose quality aspects’ menu. Their settings are used for finding the best suitable driver automatically, and for compiling a list of best suitable drivers within the ‘Choose your driver’ menu. Lastly, after a conceptual phase for the three new menus, an iterative design process follows in chapter 6, in which the preliminary concepts are designed and tested iteratively. A total of eleven participants tested the three menus. The final result of the project is a feedback mechanism for the Taxi Booking app that contributes to a better quality of the taxi experience. In more detail, the result consists of two aspects. The first aspect is the new customer journey, which shows the feedback mechanism functionality within the taxi booking process. The second aspect is the working of the back-end of the feedback mechanism. Both are described in chapter 7. In the last chapter the conclusions and recommendations concerning the final design and the activities roadmap are set out. Concluding, the proposed feedback mechanism will contribute to a better taxi service by enabling ranking drivers’ peformance by means of passengers’ feedback. Also, drivers get the opportunity to improve their behavior since they will receive the passengers’ feedback per e-mail, and passengers are enabled to choose a driver that suits their requirements best. Nevertheless, in order to be able to conclude that the proposed mechanism actually improves the taxi service quality, the current perceived quality and the quality after implementation, should be compared.","app design; usability research","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2014-07-04","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor)","2013","Problem statement In this time of scientific progression and groundbreaking discoveries in the realm of the environment, sociology and neurology, both architectural theory and practice find themselves in a self determined, ignorant position. In our present time, with its complex systems and highly dynamic progression, architecture is incompetent of adapting nowadays needs of creating spaces. Todays (popular) architecture seems to strive to created icons as city- and / or institutional branding, leaving fur us behind buildings designed for a temporal function. On the other hand the progression of technology since modernity and the industrial revolution leaves us, with exceptions, 'alien' structures that men found hard to dwell and inhabit. To engage in the question how to 'spatialize' the globalized world, it is important to 'construct' models as a way to understand the world. In this time of technological progression, computer models and artificial intelligence help us to 'render' the world and give us answers to practical questions. However, the same technology based models are unable to solve our irrational human needs such as emotion, memory, subjectivity and imagination. The missing 'link' is the 'mapping' of subjectivity, that 'touches' the realm of memory and identity, a link that connects past, present and future. Visions on architecture and its objectives lose ground in contemporary society (through market models and short term profit models). Whereas buildings for reuse, without a clear program, seem to be timeless and capable of adapting different functions over time. Why can't be we built “new” monuments. Thomas Mayne pinpoints this by saying “What is ironic in a time of unprecedented advancement in scientific and technological inventions is the reactionary and superficial appropriation of historical forms. The problem here is not just one of form, but of the tendency for this architecture to be acquiescent to the day-to-day demands of utility and economics... This romanticising of an earlier time as ‘simpler,’ fails to grasp that it is in the realisation of complexity and contradiction that we begin to find our way out of the psychological malaise we’re currently suffering.”(1) Research question: How to intervene in the built environment, to unite nowadays demands, together with the collective, subjective demands, creating a 'modern' monument. Goal The goal of this design proposal is to design a 'Modern Monument' which addresses issues of past, future, present, local and global. In doing so, this project becomes the a new space and place for architecture as it unifies the formerly isolated layers of the city. The function of a school for architecture is raising the question how to educate architects and those interested in the built metropolitan environment. The buildings itself has to create an awareness of the wider metropolitan field , creating a space of (undertermined) possibilities. The question of how to deal with the past, the present and the future (time) and local, regional and global factors (space), combined with the complexity of metropolitan life, asks for a different method of developing an architectural project. The design of a school for architecture, tries to give an answer to the question what a 'monument' today 'can be'. Process method description By seeing the past as virtual, the past becomes real. (2) The past, being not 'actual', is in the opposite state: the 'de-actual'. Transferring the notion of time into the virtual, the past becomes something that is, rather than something that was. According to Henri Bergson and Gilles Deleuze, time is a living concept that we interact with. (3) With this notion, architects can construct a mapping of experience, memory and movement, and this puts them in a position to be more critical and take a 'imaginative' stance on the topics of the future. The 'activistic' architects and urbanists Rem Koolhaas, O.M. Ungers and Guy Debord used a radical mapping of subjectivity's and context, that reveal a different perception of the past, present and future in time and space. Their use of the “virtual” plays a decisive role in making grounded discussions in developing their architectural or urban critique and proposals. Their method of research open up new ways of seeing space and even more important new ways of intervening in the built environment, escaping the paradigm of regressive or progressive architecture. Their method strengthens the position of the architect by creating new scenario's. The combination of the mappings of these architects, together with the philosophical writings of Deleuze and followers, are the methods of research and become the framework for their design projects. With the design for a monument to be determined, this method is further elaborated by flattening ontologically past, present, future, and local, regional and global, compressed into one object. The working on these scales (space) and time creates a design strategy that is non-linear. Todays paradigm of (western) architectural design starts with program and the site, and ends with space and materialization. The design method for this graduation project is testing ways of stepping out of this linear process, and instead work in a cloud of input, derived from mapping, creating one final object. Reflection Relevance The relationship between research and design The research focused from the beginning on space and time in the realm of Berlin. Research on literature about architecture , built and unbuilt, destroyed or future plans together created a 'virtual' map of Berlin, revealing formerly isolated projects and plans compressed into one image. The mapping of what was really going on, instead of what it is, around the chosen site, delivered important input for design strategies. Instead of the actual historical surroundings, 'ghosts' of project opened up new ways of seeing and interpreting the site. Knowledge taken from architects and urbanist that are destroyed or still on the drawing table, all together can be used. In this way the design is not working in the now, but creating a continuity between past present and future, making it easier to adapt fur further progression in and around the building itself. It was important for the progress of the design to stay in a constant dialogue between on the one hand research and production, and on the other hand the small and bigger scale, flattening the boundary between the actual and the virtual. The relationship between the theme of the studio and the subject/case study chosen by the student within this framework (location/object) This approach is close to the theme of the studio, the Asignifying Affordance of Assemblage. The paradigm of the studio for structuring is the assemblage of the “parts” constituting the whole. Structuring these parts means to start from the middle, to leave the modern paradigm of architecture as a linear process. Structuring these parts means to map relations and differences, revealing new insights in the studied objects and space. The breaking between the actual and virtual, generates a relieving spirit to study objects, and reopen and reconsider existing paradigms on architecture from the postmodern era. Instead of the cartesian, dialectic approach, the parts create a frame of heterogeneous parts. The relationship between the project and the wider social context. The opposing 'powers' of on the one hand the fast progression and technical inventions, and on the other hand the slow, subjective memory of the collective, seem not to merge in architectural design. It is necessary for architecture to take a stance in contemporary society by unifying these formerly isolated phenomenons and therefore constructing the future city, uniting past, present and future. Mayne exemplifies this by saying that with “the acceleration of telecommunication, as well as the mutation of lifestyles that this implies, have replaced traditional communities founded on the physical proximity by way of multiple interactions in a network. [As a result,] in the urban space, it is more and more difficult to find a satisfying articulation between a “public” and “private” sphere, like that between city and country, center and periphery.”(5) The classic notions of architecture and urbanism, are unable to keep up with the pace of our time. It is unavoidable to radically change our methods of research on, and our interaction with reality, to translate todays questions into sustainable answers. “To overcome this crisis, Mayne affirms the necessity of abandoning conventional ideas about urbanism, which tend toward a simple and homogenous order, and to take account of the complexity of the actual urban experience, which can only be understood in terms of the relations between heterogeneous experiences.”(6) According to Bergson and Deleuze, time is a living concept that we interact with. The meaning, importance and actuality of history is a concept we have the potentiality to change. In this time of rationalising, it is important to work on a more critical position, towards the subjectivity of the virtual and thus history, “in which man now appears destined not only to ‘react’ but to ‘act’.” This can construct “our search for the condition – the ‘structure of experience’” - to be more critical and take a ‘imaginative’ stance on the topics of the future. The architect can be at the position to reconsider, reinterpret, re-imagine, the un-actualised virtuality’s. In this way architectural form can be seen as a result of time: past, present and future. The paradigm of form follows function, or the function that creates the site are in this design process turned upside down. It is the site that creates the form, and the form the program and the function. With the followed method the layers of the project, the site, versus building, versus program configure themselves to the logic of stable versus meta-stable versus unstable.

(mentor); Nijhuis, S. (mentor)","2013","For three hundred years, Mekong delta has become a water society where inhabitants in this region developed adaptive strategies, often called “shaking hand with floods”. Historically, people first settled on the lightly higher terraces and later on the levees along the river. With the digging of canals, people started to settle along the canal banks; such settlement has formed a typical pattern of ribbon-like settlement. At the confluences of network system, intensified urban expansion is occurring. Over twenty years after the introduction of “DOI MOI” policy (innovation), Mekong delta in Vietnam has experienced significant expansion of cities and rapid growth of population. The water cities are transforming into the road cities in which the role of water in the city structure is going to be neglected. Thus, the cities are losing its unique characteristic and inhabitants are facing more vulnerable to flooding. Furthermore, the consequences of human interventions into natural process have caused an essential change in the natural landscape. The transformation from a natural dynamic water system in which people adapted to the forces of nature into an infrastructure system in which the forces of nature are attempted to be controlled, turns out to be more problematic. Finally, climate change will have a serve impact on the natural system of the delta and in the lives of those living in these areas, namely: flood events, storm surge, water scarcity, subsidence and salinization. The projects aimed at answering a research question: How a new form of urban development for the Mekong delta can provide a water safety condition, improve the environmental quality, spatial quality and meanwhile provide economic value for its inhabitants? As the first step, the project researched in the complex system of Mekong delta cities. Research question was step by step answered through triple three layer approach and different layer analysis through different scales. These researches provided a clear understanding in: how nature layer, infrastructure layer and urban layer proceeded and integrated throughout 300 year history of Mekong Delta; what current image of development in Mekong Delta is and why water should be maintained for future development. Equipped with this knowledge, the project proposed to apply the theory of Transit Oriented Development in combination of water management. The result is compact urban areas in regional scale or compact neighborhood in city scale that are protected on high levees, connected by public transports, surrounded by natural delta landscape and provided with diverse economic values.","Delta cities; climate change; urban expansion; flood adaption; sustainable development; Mekong Delta","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-07-03","Architecture","Urbanism","","Delta Interventions Studio","",""

(mentor); Arntsen, O. (mentor); Bonnemaire, B. (mentor)","2013","Floating breakwaters (FBs) have been widely used as an alternative solution to protect coastal sites especially small harbors and certain areas which are not suitable for rubble mound breakwaters. Floating breakwater cannot completely stop the incident wave action. Instead, it attenuates the wave action by partially transmitting, partially reflecting, and partially dissipating the incident wave. The efficiency of the FBs profiles and configurations can be quantified by its transmission coefficient which is the ratio of the significant wave height at the lee side of the FBs over the significant wave height at the front side. The aim of this master thesis was to perform a numerical analysis of FBs structures by means of WAMIT and MultiSurf. The study was focused on the wave transmission behind the FBs and the response motions of the structure. Twelve cases based on laboratory experiments were numerically analyzed and some of the results were compared to available measurement data. Some results were satisfactorily confirmed to the experiment result while other results were still far from perfect. Some improvement methods were recommended to be carried out in the future work i.e. trying out more structure geometry representation, simulating more cases which are comparable to the experiments, and more detail study of how the experiments were carried out and how the final outputs were calculated.","floating breakwaters; WAMIT; MultiSurf; transmission coefficient","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","CoMEM","",""

(mentor); Silvester, S. (mentor); Beella, S.K. (mentor)","2013","Qwic is a Dutch company producing electric two-wheelers. Despite of rapid success and growth over the last years they do not reach their intended urban target group. Therefore Qwic needs to innovate their current electric bicylces (e-bikes). This eventually led to the following graduation assignment: Design the new Qwic e-bike for the 25-50 years old urban commuter. In order to do this the whole project was split up in four steps. Step 1, Analysis: Based on a broad analysis of the urban mobility domain and Qwic as a company with their current products, the following main conclusions can be drawn:  1 Current e-bikes are regarded by urban consumers as traditional bicycles and because of this they are considered too expensive.  2 E-bikes are mainly used by 65+ consumers. This has created the image that they are just for people with reduced physical capabilities. These two conclusions justify a redesign of the current e-bike concept. Qwic would be the perfect local player to initiate this redesign. But in order to do this they should transform their supplier driven development into a more user-centred product development. Step 2, Research: Subsequently to the analysis phase an extensive user research was conducted. Exploring the context, experiences and wishes of urban professionals. Based on this research the following two main conclusions can be drawn:  1 The urban e-bike should play a more active role within the intangible, mental experiences of the urban professional travelling in the city. An e-bike should utilize the possibilities that electric products offer.  2 The urban e-bike should fit the lifestyle of its users. The fact that an e-bike is an advanced product should not result in a complex, inconvenient user experience. Besides these two general insights a range of contextual themes and concrete findings were identified backing up these conclusions. These themes and findings form more tangible inspiration sources for concept development and are eleboratly presented within this report. Step 3, Envision: The research findings led to the insight that the current relationship between the urban professional and his e-bike is rather contradicting. On one side the product offers a liberating, attractive empowerment, while on the other side the e-bike causes a lot of hassle within everyday urban life. Because of this contradiction the e-bike remains merely an attractive proposition that eventually leads to a tense and disharmonious relationship with its owner. Based on this insight the following design vision is formulated: “I want people to feel liberated from everyday life boundaries and to move within the city with great ease and simplicity in order to taste the vividness of urban life to the fullest.” This vision is the first step towards the development of the new urban e-bike design. Step 4, Design: In order to achieve the formulated design vision, the new product should embody a set of specific qualities. By the determination of these qualities an important next step is taken in order to translate the design vision into a design brief. Then, combining the outcome of the research with the design brief and the capabilities of Qwic, it can be concluded that the emphasis of this project should be on redesigning the current urban e-bike. Developing new interaction qualities that improve the current situation. An elaborate product redesign rather than a complete product innovation. Eventually the research insights, design vision and design brief led to the development of a new e-bike concept: The urbangility e-bike. This concept is an improved redesign on the following topics:  Robust and distinctive aesthetics fit the context and the wishes of the urban professional. Communicating that it is not just an normal bicycle but a honest e-bike.  The fluent and carefree battery offers a hassle free interaction of charging, placing and securing the battery.  Intuitive e-controls ensure an agile riding style.  A smartphone application encourages sporty riding and to explore their urban environment.  Flexible and personal options make it possible to customize the urbangility e-bike to fit different subgroups of urban professionals. The proposed urbangility concept is also evaluated together with urban professionals. It received positive feedback on its fundamental design characteristics. Yet, the evaluation also indicated a range of details that needed to be optimized. Therefore it was decided to further develop the battery design. The battery seemed to be the most innovative feature of the new concept, with great effect on the eventual user experience. Therefore one extra step was taken towards a more detailed design proposal for the urbangility battery. Making it more fluent and carefree to use within the urban professionals user context.","e-bike; context mapping; urban commuting","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Design for Interaction","",""

De software van Priva regelt vervolgens dat de componenten in deze zogeheten klimaatbeheersingsinstallaties met elkaar kunnen samenwerken en een bepaald binnenklimaat bewerkstelligen. In grote klimaatbeheersingsinstallaties zijn veel componenten van elkaar afhankelijk. Als er in één component een storing optreedt, dan kan deze storing effect hebben op de werking van andere componenten. Deze componenten kunnen als gevolg daarvan weer afwijkend gedrag gaan vertonen. Een uitdaging die vaak voorkomt is dat er afwijkend gedrag wordt vastgesteld in een component, maar dat de daadwerkelijke oorzaak van een probleem in een ander deel van de installatie ligt. Als de afhankelijkheden tussen verschillende componenten inzichtelijk in kaart zouden kunnen worden gebracht, dan zou het makkelijker worden om te achterhalen waar precies de oorzaak ligt als er afwijkend gedrag wordt geconstateerd. Deze gedachte vormt het uitgangspunt voor onze opdracht. In ons uiteindelijke product is het mogelijk om van een klimaatbeheersingsinstallatie de afhankelijkheden tussen verschillende componenten weer te geven.

However, the academic world does not share this point of view, since they claim the evidence to promote the usability of technical analysis is sparse and inconsistent. Noticing this impasse we decided that developing software to analyse this issue would be a way to facilitate research on the subject, and might provide a way to make an educated decision on the usability of technical analysis. The goal is to build an application that runs a strategy and shows the results of this strategy to the user. Over the course of this project, the project group has developed such a benchmark system, with development proceeding according to an incremental, agile development technique called Scrum. The largest challenge we faced was storing and processing our data. After investigating the options, we decided to use MapReduce with an implementation of Apache Hadoop and reduced both file storage size and processing time by implementing Apache Avro. The final system can be divided into three main sections: Server - On the server side, the Hadoop framework was used to facilitate the implementation of a scalable MapReduce approach to the problem of going through a large amount of stock market data and producing trades using an implementation of a technical analysis-inspired strategy. Client - The client side manages the visualisation aspects of the project, with the GUI having been built using the JavaFX framework. Metrics - A calculation layer which processes the trades that the simulation generated, and calculates all the metrics shown in the user interface. While working on the project, we worked hard to ensure high code quality and high levels of maintainability and extensibility of the system using a diverse set of tools. Testing was also an important aspect of development: using JUnit for Java, we wrote unit tests for various parts of our application. In addition, we wrote integration tests to test the proper functioning of larger parts of the system all at once. The application delivered in the end implemented all of the features listed as ‘must have’ and ‘should have’, except for one ’should have’ feature: algorithmic optimisation of strategies. The reason for this is that implementing this feature would have taken too much time that it would have detracted greatly from the overall quality of the final application, and we therefore decided not to include it. At the end of this project, we have developed an application accepts a strategy along with parameters defined by the users, processes it in a few minutes while showing its progress to the user, and displays customisable information about the results of the simulation in an intuitive user interface.","bachelor project; technical analysis","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","2013-07-05","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Computer Science","","Computer Science and Engineering","",""

Extreme value models generally assume data are identically distributed and homogeneous in time. Because there are often different dominant generating mechanisms in different seasons, the sample distributions vary through the year, potentially violating the identical distribution assumption. Two methods for overcoming this are (1) dividing the data into seasons whose distributions are homogeneous (‘time-stratified’) and (2) employing a time-varying extreme value model whose parameters change through the year, such as a non-homogeneous Poisson process (‘time-varying’). The difference between the results of these two methods and the classical method indicates the influence of violating the identical distribution assumption. These methods also provide seasonal extreme estimates, which are useful for design, construction, and maintenance of ocean structures. Based on analysis of model and observation data from thirteen sites in the North Sea (4 wind speed, 9 wave height), the differences between all-year extreme estimates from the classical method, the time-stratified method, and the time-varying method prove not to be statistically significant. This implies the violation of the identical distribution assumption is also not significant. The seasonal estimates of the time-stratified method and the timevarying method are also compatible, validating the use of the less man-hour-intensive and more versatile time-varying method for calculating seasonal extremes.","Extreme Value Analysis; Non-Homogeneous Poisson Process; Hydraulic Boundary Conditions","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","CoMEM","",""

(mentor); Cuperus, Y. (mentor)","2013","The Kolenkit district performs many years in the wrong lists: it is the blackest district, poorest district, highest unemployment, lowest score on the quality of life and worst performing schools. The presence of non-western foreigners and the living-environment quality seems to have a highly negative relationship. This relationship is negative, so it means that when the number of non-western foreigners increases the living-environment quality decreases, and vice versa. This coherence is influenced by many underlying dimensions. Many foreigners live in physical degenerated districts, in districts with a high residential density and much nuisance. Due to the different bad lists of Kolenkit the neighborhood was the symbol of the Dutch disadvantaged area and is therefore stigmatized. Thereis much to talk about segregation in the Kolenkit. Do you accept it or fight against it? The open structure of the original AUP in the Kolenkit is replaced by an offensive urbanism based on the prewar city. Not based on how the originally AUP plan was meant. Parks and gardens are fenced, open blocks structures are replaced by closed building blocks. The result is a fragmented public space, and closed indoor gardens. Leading to a decrease of the public space and leads to further segregation. It is not contested that the segregation and pauperization in the Kolenkit increases if you do nothing. In such areas one often sees the theory of gentrification into practice: a way of change in the population composition of neighborhoods with a concentration of lower incomes. About the Theoretical background of gentrification has long been debated. About the definition of the causes and consequences. First and foremost a physical, but often social change in an inner city area occurs. There are different opinions about what the consequences are. A predominantly positive approach from policy papers are mainly top-down. Academics also need to look critical at the effects of gentrification. Where gentrification is synonymous to displacement of segregation. For gentrification on small scale projects, it is suspected that gentrification, or gentripuncture, has another role. Gentripuncture, a bottom-up approach, is a small-scale intervention. The word is derived from acupuncture and gentrification, and should target strategic spots to stimulate the further development of a specific area. A gentripuncture project is a small urban intervention, which fit within the literature of gentrification. This project will investigate what types there are and where gentripuncture can lead to?","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-09-01","Architecture","Architectural Engineering and Technology","","(Re)search for New Concepts for Dwelling","",""

(mentor)","2013","Framework The chosen graduation studio Architectural Engineering at the faculty of Architecture at the TU Delft focuses on the connection between architecture and engineering. The personal fascination with coastal defence structures turned out to be a great starting point due to the given location of Scheveningen. Research during the first semester led to a more specific site: an old seadike on the edge of the harbour. This location is seen as a ‘case?study site’ to project the plan on. In the building design, both engineering and architectural aspects strongly question, influence, and amplify each other. In the end this resulted in technologically driven architecture, which is the main focus of the chosen Architectural Engineering graduation track. Research The design is strongly influenced by findings from the technical research. The goal of the primary technical research was to gain knowledge on the aspects of the future water threat, wave loads and flood defence systems. The findings were translated into architectural tools resulting in a toolbox that was used to support the further design process. This was the starting point for the development of the integrated building design. In the end the plan resulted in a building design which tells the story of strengthening, adjusting, and replacing the dike with water defending architecture. Design The cohesion between dike and building characterizes the design of the building. Both elements are strongly interlinked by the chosen spatial and constructional principles. The result is an integrated building design which can be seen as a hybrid structure. Context, program and function are mixed in such a way that the building is a defence structure and at the same time offers a great place to live near the beach of Scheveningen. The result of integrating the residential program with the main function of defending is an innovative idea on thinking of coastal defence structures and protection against the water threat. In the end, the real innovation lies mainly in the fact that the dwellings that need to be protected are now used as the core elements that have to arrange the security. Larger context This graduation project is a plan which defines opportunities for architecture in sea?defending structures in intensively urbanized coastal regions. Due to the generic character, the wider social context of the plan is quite large. The ideas to rethink the dike not only as a solid element but more as a multifunctional water defence will stimulate further discussions on this topic. On the scale of Scheveningen the plan will increase the spatial quality of the harbour area and it’s surroundings. In the end, the future water challenge in urban regions is of great importance and can be further discussed with this graduation plan.","dijk; gebouw; Scheveningen","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture","Architectural Engineering","","Architectural Engineering","",""

(mentor); Hobbs, B.F. (mentor)","2013","This master thesis aims at improving the understanding of the factors affecting the cost and emission impacts of wind operations using an engineering- economic (unit commitment) model and generator performance data based on actual US and other country experience, and to analyze the impact of incentive mechanisms on wind power participation in electricity spot markets. The main research question that is answered is the following: What is the effect on emissions and total system costs due to the increased cycling and startup behavior of conventional fossil fuel generators if wind penetration increases due to policy mechanisms that incentivize wind generation? And what is the behavior of these emission- and cost curves? The methodology used for answering this research question consists of two main parts. First, a statistical analysis of available data of fuel consumption and emissions from the EPA’s CEMS1 database is performed in order to 1) verify if these factors are influenced by increased cycling and 2) to obtain up-to-date parameters which are then implemented in a unit commitment model. The development of this model is the second part of the methodology. The main aspects of this model are the detailed modeling of generator startups and the assignment of a cost associated with wind power curtailment- referred to as the curtailment cost-, which can also be seen as an incentive mechanism (or subsidy) to dispatch wind generation in the system. Consequently four different scenarios with a different generation mix and flexibility are composed by combining the analyzed generators in the data analysis. The unit commitment model has been run for all of these scenarios for different values of curtailment costs. The influence of varying this cost on the amount of wind curtailment, the amount of startups, the total system cost and its components, total CO2 emissions, electricity prices and profits for wind and conventional generators has been analyzed. No dependency of marginal fuel consumption on the generation output or ramping of the generator has been observed in the analyzed data, which is a remarkable result in contradiction with recent research. A possible explanation is the hourly time step of the analyzed data. The main conclusions of this master thesis are the following. First, total system costs increase when the cost associated with wind power curtailment increases (or when the subsidy for wind power increases) due to the increased cost of startups and cycling of conventional generators at higher wind penetration. The increase in costs depends on the generation mix of the system. Second, the impact of increasing the curtailment cost on CO2 emissions is heavily dependent upon the generation mix and flexibility of the system. The more inflexible and polluting the generation mix, the stronger the increase in emissions due to the cycling of power plants at higher wind penetration. Very flexible (gas) systems show even a decrease in emissions. However, costs and emission changes are small for a considerable cost associated with wind curtailment in the generation dispatch.","energy spot market; environmental impact assessment; economic impact assessment; unit commitment model; energy policy; wind power","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2013-08-06","Technology, Policy and Management","Faculty of Technology, Policy and Management","","EPA","",""

Het doel van de opdracht is om een demonstratie te maken van een SDSS waarmee bewezen kan worden dat het concept haalbaar is en dat hierin tevens ook het ‘follow-the-data’ concept kan worden toegepast. Voor de aansturing van UAVs hebben we het mogelijk gemaakt om meerdere UAVs onafhankelijk vanaf het basisstation te besturen. Dit hebben we geïmplementeerd door de UAVs te laten verbinden met één wifi-router. Vervolgens kan elke UAV opstijgen, landen, vliegen en hoveren. Voor de veiligheid is het mogelijk om de UAVs met één druk op de knop onmiddellijk te laten stoppen. Voor de afstandsbepaling hebben we een methode om in alle richtingen de afstand te meten. Hiervoor gebruiken we ZigBee en daarvan lezen we de signaalsterkte. Hierbij zit ook een vorm van identificatie, zodat duidelijk is tussen welke UAVs de afstand is gemeten. Verder hebben we een afstandstabel, mocht een meting misgaan versturen we de vorige waarde. Voor de communicatie hebben we de mogelijkheid dat berichten kunnen ‘hoppen’ tussen de UAVs, indien het basisstation buiten bereik is. Hierdoor krijg je een soort ketting. Verder zorgt een routingbuffer ervoor dat berichten niet dubbel worden verstuurd. Als laatste hebben we nog de collison avoidance. Hiermee wordt voorkomen dat de UAVs tegen elkaar botsen. Hiervoor gebruiken we de afstandsbepaling en wordt gekeken wanneer deze kleiner is dan een bepaalde waarde.","SDSS; UAV; ZigBee; Self Deploying Sensor Swarm; AR.Drone; afstandsmeting; netwerk","nl","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics & Computer Engineering","","Electronics Research Laboratory","",""

(mentor); Rooij, M.C. (mentor)","2013","The variability of feedforward controlled robotic arms is influenced by motor noise. This motor noise originates from multiple sources including the motors, transmission and bearings. It is modeled as additive and multiplicative noise. Human arms also suffer from motor noise in feedforward controlled movements, but humans are believed to perform movements that minimize the end-point variability due to their multiplicative input noise. Minimizing the end-point variability for human arms leads to smooth and energy-efficient movements. For robotic arms performing a pick-and-place task the end-point variability should also be as small as possible. The goal of this research is to minimize the end-point variability of feedforward controlled movements in robotic arms. The variability of a movement is determined in simulation using a technique based on the Extended Kalman Filter. The minimum-variability movements are found by performing an optimization of the end-point variability. In simulation it was shown that the minimumvariability movements can make use of the friction in the system, low input torques, and the state of the system. It depends on the exact noise supplied to the system, which aspects are used to minimize the end-point variability. These movements are different from energy-optimized or time-optimized movements. The minimum-variability movements are also applied to an experimental robotic arm set-up. It was found that the variability in the set-up is input-dependent. The minimum-variability movements had lower end-point variability than the energy-optimized or time-optimized movements. This research shows that minimizing the end-point variability for a robotic arm in simulation, leads to movements that have low end-point variability in an experimental set-up too.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","BMD","",""

(mentor)","2013","As the world population continues to grow, food supply is increasingly under pressure. In the recent decades in China, rapid urbanization has led to a nation wide scarcity of arable land. Without intervention, a national – or even global - food crisis could be imminent. The Vertical Cities Asia competition brief asked for a proposal in which 100 000 people could live, work and play within a 1 km2 plot in the south of Chengdu. The agriculture and food problem is particularly relevant to the Chengdu region, since this region is responsible for a large share of China’s rice supply throughout history. With the focus on food security, the intention of this proposal is to preserve the existing arable land and revise the current food supply chain, but at the same time to accommodate the influx of rural migrants - one of the greatest causes for Chengdu’s population growth. Given these preliminaries, the construction of a vertical town with an ultra high density seems inevitable. Reaching a high urban density is often done through the most economic way; skyscrapers in CBD’s, condominium parks dominate existing cities. However, each high-rise becomes a ‘cul-de-sac’ in the urban circulation, where transportation and movement still pressurizes the ground floor space. In order to achieve a true vertical town, circulation should take place on all (elevated) levels. Daily activities and needs are all accommodated within the vertical town, detached from the ground floor. A 72x72x72m cube appears to be a suitable module to build up this vertical town. The 72x72x72 measurement is generic enough to suit a wide range of program, since the floor plan layout is flexible enough fulfil different program requirements. Not only can each cube be dedicated to a program according to the current demands, but it also has the ability to change in function over time. By stacking the cubes on a minimal foot print, the adjacent arable land can be left untouched and continue to be used for food production. Certain rules are set out to dictate the method of stacking and linking. With this set of rules, there will be a large freedom in the town’s growth – horizontally and vertically – while fulfilling daylight, circulation and structural requirements. At the same time, the cubes are stacked in such a way to create maximum surfaces for urban farming. By stimulating local production of food, intermediary parties in the conventional food supply chain can be eliminated; consumers buy directly at the producers. Not only can this lead to a greater awareness of food production, but it will also contribute to the reduction of transportation. In turn, this means less air pollution and less fossil fuel consumption. Hence, sustainability is achieved by the prevention of existing problems, rather than resolving the consequences after the problem has occurred. On the scale of Chengdu, this Agropolis is part of a long-term vision to emphasize the importance of agriculture. The proposal intends to limit Chengdu’s horizontal expansion to only growth in Chengdu’s ‘fingers’, thereby preserving the existing agricultural land in-between. In the end the density issue is tackled in a way that the urbanism itself could occur anywhere in the world, and the entire story about farming and migrations of farmers makes it a specific project for China and the city of Chengdu.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2014-01-01","Architecture","Materialisation","","Vertical Cities Asia","",""

The research that followed was based on this speculation and tried to immortalize my own experience of a specific peripheral condition in Brussels. This stage led, through various experiments to a coherent mapping according to the personal fascination and the studio’s methodology. Eventually, it helped defining a set of design tools that coagulated in a design method that I considered it has the potential to refine into a design. Thus, I tested this method at three different scales: furniture, architectural and urban scale. The way the process of testing evolved was very much based on a non-linear approach, and finally, two of the scales merged (the urban and architectural). Naturally, a new set of contextual constraints helped coagulating on one hand, a local urban strategy for that specific Brussels condition, and on the other hand, the urban strategy led to the integration of the architectural scale. Finally I chose to focus and detail the architectural scale. The final design has taken the form of a house for an artistic community of 8-10 persons. Within my proposal, the notion of the house was reinterpreted according to a set of implications of the used design method. The reason for which I chose to design a house is partly rooted in the fascination of working with contrasting elements. In this case the contrasts or almost conflictual conditions are prefigured on one hand by the unconventionality of the spatial language and the fundamental aspects of the house. My final challenge was to surpass the conventional way of understanding the concept of the house through design. In order to embrace this confrontation I appealed to the notion of fragmentation and to a set of scenographic tools, which brings us back to my initial statement that the scenographic architecture is the one capable of embracing the transformations of a series of fragments into a whole.","border conditions; experimental housing; scenography","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-07-31","Architecture","Public Building","","Border Conditions","",""

Theory argues that peer monitoring can reduce moral hazard issues, because peers have the same kind of knowledge and expertise. Peers are therefore less hampered by information asymmetry as apposed to a vertical regulator. Moreover, peers are argued to be willing to regulate one another, as they share risks. However, based on an institutional analysis and a case study, this research project shows that these assumptions are not true for the case of the SGP. Strategic behaviour of peers reduces the willingness and creates information asymmetry. As a result, the peer monitoring arrangement in the SGP has a limited ability to decrease the negative effects of moral hazard. To improve the effectiveness of this peer monitoring arrangement this reports argues to implement more checks and balances so that peers have less opportunity to replace regulatory procedures with political games.","moral hazard; peer monitoring; Stability Growth Pact; regulation; European sovereign debt crisis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Policy, Organisation, Law and Gaming","","System Engineering Policy Analysis and Management","",""

(mentor); Engelen, S. (mentor)","2013","Dit document beschrijft de ontwikkeling van een simulator voor een Self-Deploying Sensor Swarm (SDSS). Daarnaast worden er ook twee mogelijke vormen van zwermintelligentie geïmplementeerd. Dit project is een onderdeel van een opdracht voor het Bachelor afstudeerproject op de TU Delft. Deze opdracht betreft het maken van een demonstratie van een SDSS[1]. Voor deze demonstratie is er gekozen om een zwerm van quadcopters te maken. De quadcopters moeten crawlers, objecten die vrij door het veld bewegen, volgen. De opdracht is opgedeeld in drie onderdelen: detectie van de crawlers, aansturing van de quadcopters en communicatie, en het implementeren van de zwermintelligentie. Dit verslag beschrijft het laatste onderdeel: de implementatie van de zwermintelligentie. De simulator is geschreven om de zwermintelligentie gemakkelijk te kunnen testen. De simulator is geschreven in C++ en maakt gebruik van de OpenGL voor het tekenen. Momenteel is de simulator nog in 2D, maar deze is eenvoudig uit te breiden naar 3D. In de simulator vormen quadcopters de zwerm. Daarnaast zijn er ook crawlers geïmplementeerd, die willekeurig over het veld bewegen. De communicatie in de simulator werkt aan de hand van een eenvoudige implementatie van een gossip-protocol. Hierbij is aangetoond dat gossip goed werkt de informatievoorziening binnen een SDSS te verzorgen. Voor de zwermintelligentie wordt gebruik gemaakt van agent-based modeling. Er zijn twee verschillende agents geschreven: de Solo Agent en de Swarm Agent. De solo agent is bedoeld voor de demonstratie. Deze agent is in staat om één crawler te volgen. Deze agent werkt enkel aan de hand van afstand en hoek van andere crawlers en quadcopters t.o.v. de quadcopter. Dit is een belangrijke eis, omdat voor de demonstratie ook gekozen is om enkel de hoek en afstand tot andere objecten te meten. Bij deze agent wordt een eenvoudig collision avoidancealgoritme geïmplementeerd. De bedoeling van de swarm agent is om aan te tonen dat het principe van follow-the-data kan worden toegepast in een SDSS. Hierbij moet met een relatief klein aantal quadcopters zoveel mogelijk crawlers gedekt worden. De swarm agent maakt gebruik van een ingewikkelder collision avoidancealgoritme. Dit algoritme is gebasseerd op het principe van interacties tussen ladingen. Er zijn tests uitgevoerd met 10 quadcopters en 100 crawlers. Hierbij werd een dekking van ongeveer 90% gehaald. Het uiteindelijke resultaat is een goed werkende simulator, waarmee een SDSS goed gesimuleerd kan worden. De simulator zou in de toekomst naar 3D uitgebreid kunnen worden. Daarnaast kan het gossip-protocol uitgebreid en beter geëvalueerd worden. Er is een eerste opzet gemaakt bij het implementeren van mogelijke vormen zwermintelligentie. Wegens gebrek aan tijd is het niet meer gelukt om de simulator te integreren met de andere onderdelen om zo een demonstratie van een SDSS te kunnen realiseren. Geconcludeerd kan worden dat er nog veel onderzoek naar het concept van een SDSS mogelijk is.","Self-Deploying Sensor Swarm; swarm intelligence; simulator","nl","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics & Computer Engineering","","Electronics Research Laboratory","",""

Though exact definitions are absent, A building group refers to a group of people, who often share lifestyle or ideology, pooling their resources to construct their houses. A pilot currently taking place in Houthaven has shown that building groups do not necessarily empower individuals, but can also benefit developers rebranded as building groups. By looking at examples of building groups from different periods, with different organizational structures and different building typologies, building groups that do construct affordable housing can be found. This project proposes a development strategy for Houthaven which uses a variety of methods support building groups in the creation of affordable housing. In working on the project, it became apparent that these methods can be classified into three groups: austerity, cutting out the middle men and cooperation. These used simultaneously in various elements of the strategy: in the urban, the process design and the block design. Furthermore, the strategy allows building groups to choose their own methods for creating affordable housing. Answers from the interviews show people want to use similar methods within their building groups. Large development locations, such as Houthaven, are so far missing in the self-build strategy of Amsterdam. As a pilot project, Houthaven should provide the example for developing large sites through building groups, so building groups can really affect the housing market of Amsterdam.","building groups; self-organization; affordable housing; Houthaven; Amsterdam","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-07-02","Architecture","Urbanism","","Design as Politics - We the People","",""

(mentor); Rosenboom, H.J. (mentor)","2013","Problem statement: In Delft is a high demand for living and workspace for the creative industry. Between 2014 and 2020 2,400m² workspace must annually be realized to meet the demand of the creative industry, this is not achievable without business centres or incubators (Louters Bureau, 2008). According to Florida's theory is creativity and innovation the strongest in the historic city, this makes it the most attractive type of creative environment for creative businesses (Florida, 2005). In this research the needs of the creative industry should be integrated in the urban structure to respect the city plan of the historic city. The site, named ‘Gasthuisplaats’, is since 1968 in use as a parking area that is situated in the historic city. Analysis: The relationship between the TU Delft, historic city (society) and creative industry is very weak. People in the historic city do not notice the presence of TU Delft in the city. Through a morphological and typological analysis the structure of the historic city is investigated. (Cities) architectural principles, historic urban architectural characteristics of the historic city, composition and spatial form of the historic city of Delft are defined. The urban structure that the location surrounds determines the development potential of the site. The needs of the city of Delft and requirement of the creative industry are also included in the analysis to strength the support base of the development. Design: A vision for the historic city reinforces the position of the site in the historic city by involving the 2 strong aspects of the historic city tourism and retail in the development. The vision creates 12,500m² workspaces for the creative industry in the historic city. The design of the Gasthuisplaats got a relationship with the history of the site, more than 700 years a guesthouse was located on this location. Forum Delft is introduced as a new function in the city, situated on the site, to strength the relationship between TU Delft, historic city and creative industry. This multifunctional function exposes and sells products of students of TU Delft and creative entrepreneurs in Delft. The development of the site provides also in the needs of the present functions, workspace for the creative industry, housing, relocation of the ‘Tourist Information Point’ and a new square. Conclusion: By making the historic city more attractive as a creative environment for creative industries this will be a fifth strong pillar for the historic city besides retail, housing, leisure and tourism. The developments improves the spatial quality mainly in the immediate vicinity of the site, create more living and workspace for the creative industry in the historic city, incorporated in the structure of the historic city and it improves the relationship between TU Delft, historic city (society) and creative industry. In addition the quality of life, vibrancy and vitality of the city improves.","creative industry; creative economy; historic inner-city; Delft; urban structure; TU Delft; urban regeneration","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-07-02","Architecture","Urbanism","","Urban regeneration","",""

(mentor)","2013","De Gillisbuurt is een Delftse achterstandsbuurt die deel uitmaakt van de 40+ wijkaanpak van het Rijk (Rijksoverheid, 2012). In de 40+ wijken is de veiligheidsbeleving een van de meest genoemde thema's, zo ook in de Gillisbuurt. Over hoe de veiligheidsbeleving in een buurt verbeterd kan worden is weinig bekend binnen de stedebouw. Met dit afstudeerproject is onderzoek gedaan naar manieren om dit te doen en is er een ontwerp gemaakt aan de hand van de gevonden oplossingen. Hierbij is er voor oplossingen gekeken naar literatuur uit de omgevingspsychologie. Hieruit zijn drie theorieën naar voren gekomen die van belang zijn voor het ontwerp: Defensible Space (Newman, 1972), zonering van ruimten (van Dorst, 2005) en het Handboek veilig ontwerp en beheer (Lopez, Luten, Woldendorp, & van Zwam, 2008) . Aan de hand van het handboek is een analyse naar de fysieke aspecten omtrent veiligheidsbeleving opgezet. Uit deze analyse bleek dat vooral het binnengebied erg onoverzichtelijk is door de vele beplanting die er te vinden is. Hierdoor wordt niet alleen de zichtbaarheid in het binnengebied verminderd, maar wordt ook het natuurlijk toezicht vanuit de woningen op het binnengebied bemoeilijkt. Daarbij zorgt tevens de oriëntatie van de woningen ervoor dat er weinig gebruikte voordeuren grenzen aan het midden gebied. Door een ontwerp te maken waarbij in het binnengebied ruimten ontstaan die aansluiten op de omliggende bebouwing wordt de verbinding tussen de woningen en het binnengebied versterkt. Hierdoor is er meer natuurlijk toezicht op het gebied mogelijk vanuit de woningen. De nieuwe ruimten ontstaan door het toevoegen van woningen op de juiste plaatsen. Dit maakt het plan ook nog eens financieel aantrekkelijk. Door de beplanting sterk uit te dunnen wordt de mogelijkheid tot natuurlijk toezicht verder versterkt. In het midden van het binnengebied ontstaat door de opdeling van het gebied een centrale plek in de buurt. Op deze plek zijn de moestuinen geplaatst die zich nu buiten de buurt bevinden. De moestuinen versterken momenteel al de sociale cohesie van de buurt, maar doen dit nog meer wanneer ze in de buurt te vinden zijn. Tevens versterkt dit de binding van de buurt met het naastgelegen verzorgingstehuis. Het verzorgingstehuis wordt met de buurt en het omliggende groen verbonden door middel van een nieuw pad. Door de opdeling van het binnengebied in kleinere toe te eigenen ruimten ontstaat er meer kans voor natuurlijk toezicht waardoor de veiligheidsbeleving positief wordt beïnvloed. Tevens zorgt het ervoor dat bewoners een duidelijker territoria kunnen vormen wat hun binding bij de plek moet vergroten. Dit zorgt voor meer betrokkenheid en zo ook voor een positievere veiligheidsbeleving. Door het binnengebied beter te verbinden met zijn omgeving krijgt de Gillisbuurt daarbij een betere plaats in zijn omgeving. Hiermee moet de ingreep ervoor zorgen dat de veiligheidsbeleving in het binnengebied van de Gillisbuurt verbeterd wordt.","veiligheidsbeleving; territoria; natuurlijk toezicht; sociale cohesie","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-07-01","Architecture","Urbanism","","Urban Regenration","",""

The aim of the project is to develop a prototype face recognition system. The prototype system had to outperform the existing 2D face recognition system. The project is divided into three subgroups each designing a specific part of the system. The three subgroups are: the data acquisition group, the data processing group and the data comparsion group. This thesis provides the data processing part of the system. An overview of the different existing algorithms is made, followed by the requirements for the system. The algorithm should give reliable results in a reasonable time and should be pose, expression and illumination invariant. A 2D face recognition algorithm, PCA, was implemented first. The 3D face recognition algorithm follows a morphable model approach. Several algorithms are used to align and fit the 3D face scan from the Kinect. To align the scan with a model, ICP and spin-images are used also referred to as registration. Deformation is done by a nonrigid ICP algorithm to fit the model with the scan. From the fitted model a geometry image and a normal image is generated. For prototyping reasons Matlab was used to implement and test the algorithm. The developed algorithm is tested by several measurements. From the results of these measurements, it could be concluded that the algorithm is robust and reliable, but isn’t fast. The proposed alignment solution is able to deal with rotation between ?pi/2 and pi/2 about any of the three axes and with translation in any of the three direction in the range of 1 till 10 cm. The proposed solution is able to improve up till 12% overall in the case of rotation compared to conventional spin-images and up till 43% in the case of translation. A speed-accuracy trade-off have been made. Furthermore, many optimization can still be made. More research will be needed to fulfill the system.","3D face recognition; ICP; spin-images; Registration; Deformation","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics & Computer Engineering","","Circuits and Systems","",""

(mentor); Van den Burg, L.J.P. (mentor); Westrik, J.A. (mentor)","2013","Stedelijke en regionale opgaven, lokaal ruimtelijke opgaven, volkshuisvestingsopgaven en infrastructurele opgaven (bijvoorbeeld: waterbergingsopgaven en hoogwaardig openbaar vervoer opgaven) zijn allen gecompliceerde en belangrijke maatschappelijke vraagstukken. Stedenbouwkundig ontwerpen en ruimtelijke planning worden meer en meer integrale disciplines. Verschillende disciplines zoals verkeerskundigen, waterspecialisten, bodemspecialisten, economen, etc. zijn steeds meer een onderdeel van stedenbouwkundig ontwerpen en ruimtelijke planning. Het divers aantal aspecten waar rekening mee gehouden moet worden groeit. Dit geldt uiteraard ook voor stedelijke vernieuwing. Naast het breder worden van het werkveld veranderen de gedachten omtrent het ruimtelijke ordeningsbeleid in der loop der tijd ook. Concepten voor stedelijke ontwikkeling spelen hierin een rol. Hier kan gedacht worden aan concepten zoals het modernisme, de compacte stad en de netwerkstad. Hoogwaardig openbaar vervoer (HOV), compacte stad, netwerkstad, stedelijke vernieuwing en modernisme zijn begrippen die actueel zijn in de integrale disciplines van planners en stedenbouwkundigen. In dit afstudeerrapport komen deze alle aan bod in een gecombineerde opgave. Voor de opgave van dit onderzoek wordt gekeken naar welke criteria de concepten van de compacte stad en de netwerkstad stellen aan OV en bereikbaarheid. Deze criteria zullen dirigerend zijn voor de implementering in een casus waarin de opgave voor een HOV-lijn een bijdrage moet leveren aan de stedelijke vernieuwing. Deze concepten zijn gekozen, omdat deze ten grondslag liggen van menig ruimtelijk beleid. Ook wordt gekeken naar welke criteria HOV en de stedelijke vernieuwing stellen. Het project heeft dus vier ‘pilaren’ namelijk: HOV, de compacte stad, de netwerkstad en de stedelijke vernieuwing. Het doel van het project is het maken van een masterplan en een stedenbouwkundig ontwerp van een haltegebied. Het masterplan bevat een voor een tracé van een hoogwaardige OV-lijn, daarnaast geeft het masterplan een visie geven op de mogelijke stedelijke ontwikkeling langs het tracé van de hoogwaardige OV-lijn. De analyses heeft geleid tot een tracékeuze van de HOV-lijn. Het tracé van de HOV lijn is opgebouwd vanuit de concepten van de stedenbouw/stedelijke vernieuwing in de context van de gekozen locatie. HOV en de lokale stedelijke vernieuwing zorgen voor input van het stedenbouwkundig ontwerp. HOV (hoogwaardig openbaar vervoer) is een OV-systeem op luchtbanden of rail. Het tracé van HOV is gericht op een korte reistijd, gerief, stiptheid en betrouwbaarheid. (Ministerie van Verkeer en Waterstaat, 2002) Hierdoor kan HOV (politiek) worden ingezet om te concurreren met (een deel van de) individuele autoverplaatsingen (Bach, 2006:166). De lengte van het tracé is van belang bij de keuze voor de vorm van HOV. Er wordt onderscheid gemaakt in vijf vormen van HOV, namelijk light rail, HOV tram, HOV bus met eigen infrastructuur, een tussenvorm en een HOV bus zonder eigen infrastructuur. HOV opereert meestal in een netwerk, dit netwerk bestaat uitsluitend uit HOV, deze kan echter wel verschillende vormen HOV bevatten. (Ministerie van Verkeer en Waterstaat, 2002) Het reeds bestaande netwerk van HOV is dus relevant voor het plannen van een HOV lijn. HOV is geen doel op zich; zij wordt gerealiseerd wanneer zij één of meer problemen verlichten. Aanleidingen voor het plannen van een HOV lijn zijn ruimtelijk ordening (o.a. potentiële gebieden voor stedelijke ontwikkeling), netwerkontwikkeling, leefbaarheid, ruimtelijke inrichting, economische functie, congestieproblematiek en exploitatie. (ENCI B.V., 2001:8-10) Voor het plannen van een (tracé van een) HOV-lijn moeten deze mogelijke aanleidingen worden meegenomen in een analyse. In dit onderzoek is voornamelijk gekeken naar stedelijke ontwikkeling en netwerkontwikkeling (HOV-netwerk als onderdeel van bereikbaarheid). In de plattegrond zijn een aantal aspecten van belang voor HOV. Het gaat hierom; de bebouwingsdichtheid, de functiemix, de kwaliteit van voortransport naar haltes, de kwaliteit van de halteomgeving, directheid van het voortransport voor met name langzaam verkeer naar en van de halte en de directheid van de OV-lijnen. (Bach, 2006:165-166) Bij het maken van een stedenbouwkundig ontwerp voor een haltegebied van (H)OV is een langzaam verkeerplan belangrijk. In dit plan kunnen de hoofdroutes voor lopen en fietsen worden opgenomen. De compacte stad is een concept dat geen vaste vorm, eenduidige dichtheid, stedenbouwkundige opzet of vervoersnetwerk heeft (Zijlstra, 2005). Duurzame stedelijke ontwikkeling, afstand, scheiding, dichtheid, variatie, centrum, functies, identiteit en samenlevingsopbouw zijn thema’s welke centraal staan binnen de compacte stad. Het belangrijkste instrument om de doelen van de compacte stad te bereiken is dichtheid. De twee belangrijkste doelen van de compacte stad zijn, het bevorderen van milieuvriendelijke vervoerskeuzen (het gebruik van het openbaar vervoer, fietsen en lopen) en het open houden van het landelijke gebied (Dieleman en Musterd, 1999:8 en 30). De randvoorwaarden die komen kijken bij de keuze voor duurzame mobiliteit/verplaatsing en bereikbaarheid zijn de voorwaarden welke voorrang geven aan (H)OV en langzaam verkeer. Deze voorwaarden hebben uiteraard andere eisen op de verschillende schalen binnen een stedenbouwkundig plan. De compacte stad geeft als randvoorwaarden aan het stedenbouwkundig plan, een bepaalde mate van dichtheid en variatie in (centrum)functies. Het reduceren van afstanden kan gerealiseerd worden door snelle verbindingen. Deze punten komen overeen met de criteria die HOV stelt. Voortkomend uit de gedachte van de compacte stad vloeit dan ook voort het principe van HOV. De criteria die de compacte stad dus stelt voor bereikbaarheid en (H)OV zijn de criteria die HOV zelf stelt. Samenvattend vanuit het concept van de compacte stad kan een scenario worden geschetst voor het bepalen van het tracé van een HOV-lijn. In dit scenario is de stedenbouwkundige situatie leidend voor het tracé van de HOV-lijn. Belangrijk voor het tracé zijn dan de plaatsen waar een hogere dichtheid en bepaalde hoeveelheid aan (centrum)functies reeds aanwezig of mogelijk zijn. Het concept van de netwerkstad wordt gekenmerkt door drie criteria: topologische kenmerken, (waaronder de directheid van verbindingen) kinetische kenmerken (waaronder de snelheid van verbindingen) en adaptieve kenmerken (aanpassingsmogelijkheden van de verbindingen). Verbindingen staan centraal in de netwerkstad. In dit onderzoek betekent het dat de criteria die HOV stelt van toepassing zijn binnen de kaders van het concept van de netwerkstad. De verbinding moet direct, snel en aanpasbaar zijn, de afstand hierin speelt nauwelijks een rol. Deze criteria sluiten aan bij het concept van HOV. Samenvattend vanuit het concept van de netwerkstad kan een scenario worden geschetst voor het bepalen van het tracé van een HOV-lijn. In dit scenario is de verbinding, in dit geval een fysieke verbinding, namelijk een HOV-lijn leidend binnen het stedenbouwkundig plan. Hierin bepaalt de ligging van de verbinding de plaatsen waar (stedelijke) ontwikkelingen kan plaatsvinden. De plaatsen waar stedelijke ontwikkeling plaats kan vinden zijn in het geval van HOV, daar waar haltes zijn geplaatst. Voor het bepalen van het tracé van de HOV-lijn in combinatie met stedelijke ontwikkeling zijn twee scenario’s beschreven. In scenario 1 is de stedenbouwkundige situatie leidend voor het tracé van de HOV-lijn. In scenario 2 is de verbinding leidend binnen het stedenbouwkundig plan. Dit scenario is goed mogelijk in het geval van nieuwbouwlocaties en sluit ook aan bij HOV waarin de directheid van de lijn belangrijk is. In het geval van stedelijke vernieuwing is er altijd al sprake van een bestaande situatie. In scenario 1 kan echter de directheid en dus de snelheid van de HOV verbinding niet gewaarborgd worden. Dit sluit dan ook niet aan op het gedachtegoed van de netwerkstad. Tenslotte liggen de locaties die verbonden moeten worden niet altijd netjes aan elkaar geschakeld. Daarnaast werpt de stedenbouwkundige situatie barrières op welke in sommige gevallen een directe verbinding niet mogelijk maken. In het geval van stedelijke vernieuwing is een derde situatie dan ook het meest waarschijnlijk. Dit scenario betreft een combinatie van de bovenstaande scenario’s (scenario 3) Hierin wordt gezocht naar de locaties welke verbonden moeten worden met HOV. Voor deze locaties moet een prioriteitenlijst gemaakt worden. De betekenis van een locatie in een prioriteitenlijst is afhankelijk van; de dichtheid, het aantal functies, de bereikbaarheid, de ligging van de locatie, de eigendomssituatie en de ‘potentie’ voor verdere stedelijke ontwikkeling. Deze punten kunnen onderdeel zijn van de doelen van stedelijke vernieuwing voor een gebied. Vervolgens moet gekeken worden naar welke locaties direct verbonden kunnen worden, uiteraard rekening houdend met de significantie van elke locatie. Dit kan betekenen dat niet elke locatie verbonden kan worden, echter dit kan ook betekenen dat een nieuwe locatie aangewezen kan worden voor (stedelijke) ontwikkeling. Met het plannen vanuit de compacte stad met middelen zoals het variëren in dichtheid en het toepassen van zonering kan gesproken worden van gerichte regulering in de planning. Het stedenbouwkundig plan dat hier uit voort komt is geen blauwdruk. Vanuit de netwerkstad wordt alleen de ‘basis’ aangelegd. In de stedenbouw heeft dit voornamelijk betrekking tot fysieke infrastructuur. Met infrastructuur als middel kan gesproken worden van weinig regulering in de planning. Beide visies op stedelijke ontwikkeling sluiten elkaar niet per definitie uit. In een scenario waarin infrastructuur leidend is kan namelijk ook zonering en dichtheden worden toegekend. Infrastructuur is in het concept van de compacte stad namelijk wel belangrijk, maar niet per definitie leidend. Het verschil tussen beide visies is voornamelijk gericht op de mate van regulering. Wanneer vanuit de visie van de compacte stad wordt ontworpen met infrastructuur als belangrijkste middel, dan kan men spreken van een combinatie van de compacte stad en de netwerkstad. De mate van regulering en het standpunt van een gemeente/overheid hierover zijn van belang bij het bepalen van in welke mate deze visies op stedelijke ontwikkeling worden toegepast. De locatiekeuze heeft betrekking tot stedelijke vernieuwing en HOV. Mede hierdoor is de keuze gevallen op Amsterdam Nieuw West. Dit gebied kent een grote stedelijke vernieuwingsopgave. Het stedelijke vernieuwingsplan voor dit gebied is opgesteld vanuit het concept van de compacte stad. Naast de opgave voor stedelijke vernieuwing kent het gebied een voorstel voor een HOV lijn. Als uitgangspunt van het onderzoek geldt dat Amsterdam Nieuw West in de context van haar regio (Hoofddorp, Schiphol, Zuidas, Westpoort, Amsterdam (centrum) en Zaandam) centraal staat binnen dit onderzoek. Vanaf de begin jaren 90 hebben volgens de gemeente Amsterdam en de woningbouwverenigingen verschillende problemen zoals: een tekort aan onderhoud van de bebouwing, de kwaliteit van de bebouwing, kwaliteit van de woningvoorraad, de openbare ruimte en sociaal-economische problemen en voorgaande maatschappelijke ontwikkelingen geleid tot de vraag naar stedelijke vernieuwing in veel naoorlogse wijken. (Belvedere 2006; KEI, 2006) Volgens het stadsdeel en de woningbouwcorporaties is in vele wijken in Amsterdam Nieuw West sprake van de bovengenoemde problemen. Een groot aantal wijken zal stedelijk vernieuwing ondergaan of ondergaat nu stedelijke vernieuwing. Amsterdam Nieuw West kent naast de stedelijke vernieuwing ook een opgave voor een HOV lijn. Het huidige voorstel voor deze lijn betreft een HOV lijn die de verbinding tussen Amsterdam West, Westpoort en Schiphol moet verbeteren. (DRO, 2010). De lijn is een onderdeel van het uitbreiden van het HOV netwerk in Amsterdam. Het verbeteren van de regionale bereikbaarheid past ook binnen de gedachte van de stad Amsterdam. Betere en nieuwe regionale verbindingen moeten namelijk een bijdrage leveren aan de ontwikkeling tot een internationale metropool. (DIVV, 2008) In dit onderzoek is met behulp van stedenbouwkundige concepten in een casus, een tracé voor een HOV-lijn ontworpen. Daarnaast is voor een lokale halte van deze HOV-lijn een stedenbouwkundig ontwerp gemaakt. De keuze om het tracé van een HOV lijn op te bouwen vanuit stedenbouwkundige concepten is gemaakt, om de synergie tussen stedelijke ontwikkeling en HOV zo veel mogelijk te benutten. Hiervoor is gekeken naar welke criteria de concepten van de compacte stad en de netwerkstad stellen aan stedelijke ontwikkeling , mobiliteit/OV en bereikbaarheid. Deze concepten zijn gekozen, omdat deze ten grondslag liggen van menig ruimtelijk beleid en stedenbouwkundig ontwerp. De beide concepten zijn bekend binnen de wereld van de stedenbouwkunde. Met het gebruik van deze concepten is een voorstel voor het tracé van de HOV-lijn ontworpen. Voor de compacte stad geldt dat infrastructuur (in dit onderzoek een HOV-lijn) wordt aangelegd tussen locaties waar stedelijke ontwikkeling plaatsvindt met een hoge dichtheid en een mix van functies. (centra, bijvoorbeeld). Het principe van HOV komt voort uit het concept van de compacte stad. De criteria die de compacte stelt voor bereikbaarheid (voor OV in dit onderzoek) zijn dan ook de criteria die HOV zelf stelt. De netwerkstad richt zich op de verbinding, dat gene wat een netwerk maakt en verbindt. Op een abstract niveau komt het neer op het volgende, hoe sterker de verbinding met een locatie hoe belangrijker deze locatie is. De verbinding staat dus centraal en de criteria die deze verbinding stelt zijn dus van toepassing. Uit de theorie van de concepten van de netwerkstad en de compacte stad komt dus naar voren dat de beide concepten op zich geen eenduidige criteria beschrijven voor een HOV-lijn. De criteria die HOV stelt aan de plattegrond zijn daarom voor beide concepten belangrijk. Een stadsontwerp dat gericht is op HOV moet rekening houden met divers aantal aspecten. Het gaat hierom; de bebouwingsdichtheid, de functiemix, de kwaliteit van voortransport naar haltes, de kwaliteit van de halteomgeving, directheid van het voortransport voor met name langzaam verkeer naar en van de halte en de directheid van de OV-lijnen. (Bach, 2006:165-166)De criteria kunnen gesplitst worden in twee categorieën. De eerste categorie betreft de schaal van de stad en de regio. De tweede categorie betreft de lokale schaal. Op de schaal van de stad en de regio moet de gekozen route gericht zijn op stiptheid, betrouwbaarheid, gerief en korte verplaatsingstijd. Daarnaast moet OV zijn passagiers brengen tot het hart van centra; bijvoorbeeld een belangrijk OV-knooppunt of een centrum. Essentieel is daarbij dat men daar kan komen met zo min mogelijk overstappen. (Bach, 2006:164). Directheid van een HOV-lijn is belangrijk, vanwege het streven naar een korte verplaatsingstijd en het mogelijk maken om te concurreren met de auto. Om directheid te verkrijgen moet op de schaal van het gehele tracé van de HOV-lijn in de stadsplattegrond gezocht worden naar de kortste verbinding tussen haltes. Op de lokale schaal zijn de volgende aspecten van belang voor een stedenbouwkundig ontwerp: voldoende draagvlak, functiemix en stedenbouwkundige inpassing van de haltes. Met de stedenbouwkundige inpassing wordt bedoeld, de kwaliteit van het voortransport, de kwaliteit van de halteomgeving en de directheid van het voortransport. Deze moeten zorgen dat het gebruik van OV laagdrempelig is. Dit alles vraagt om stedenbouwkundige aandacht voor de ruimtelijke inrichting van de hoofdroutes voor lopen en fietsen en voor de ruimte waar wordt overgestapt. (Bach, 2006:166-168). Bij het maken van een stedenbouwkundig ontwerp voor een haltegebied van (H)OV is een langzaam verkeerplan belangrijk. In dit plan kunnen de hoofdroutes voor lopen en fietsen worden opgenomen. De theorie beschrijft een tweetal situaties voor het bepalen van het tracé van een HOV-lijn. In scenario 1 is de stedenbouwkundige situatie leidend voor het tracé van de HOV-lijn. In scenario 2 is de verbinding leidend binnen het stedenbouwkundig plan. Dit scenario is goed mogelijk in het geval van nieuwbouwlocaties. In het geval van stedelijke vernieuwing is er altijd al sprake van een bestaande situatie. In scenario 1 kan de directheid en dus de snelheid van de HOV verbinding niet gewaarborgd worden. Tenslotte liggen de locaties die verbonden moeten worden niet altijd netjes aan elkaar geschakeld. Daarnaast werpt de stedenbouwkundige situatie barrières op welke in sommige gevallen een directe verbinding niet mogelijk maken. In het geval van stedelijke vernieuwing is een derde situatie dan ook het meest waarschijnlijk. Dit scenario betreft een combinatie van de bovenstaande scenario’s (scenario 3). Hierin wordt gezocht naar de locaties welke verbonden moeten worden met HOV. Voor deze locaties moet een prioriteitenlijst gemaakt worden. De significantie van een locatie in een prioriteitenlijst is afhankelijk van; de dichtheid, het aantal functies, de bereikbaarheid, de geografische locatie en de ‘potentie’ voor verdere stedelijke ontwikkeling van de locatie. Vervolgens moet gekeken worden naar welke locaties direct verbonden kunnen worden, uiteraard rekening houdend met de significantie van elke locatie. Dit kan betekenen dat niet elke locatie verbonden kan worden, echter dit kan ook betekenen dat een nieuwe locatie aangewezen kan worden voor stedelijke ontwikkeling. De scenario’s beschrijven in abstracte lijn een visie voor stedelijke ontwikkeling in combinatie met HOV. Scenario 3 kan toegepast worden in een bestaande situatie waar stedelijke vernieuwing wordt toegepast en waar de verbinding in grove lijn duidelijk is. De mate waarin dit scenario toegepast kan worden is afhankelijk van de stedenbouwkundige situatie van de locatie. Voor de casus van het onderzoek is een masterplan en een lokaal stedenbouwkundig ontwerp gemaakt. In de casus is sprake van een scenario waar in op een bestaande situatie stedelijke vernieuwing wordt toegepast met de compacte stad als gedachtegoed. In het masterplan maakt het traject van de HOV stedelijke ontwikkeling op een aantal locaties mede bereikbaar. Tevens laat het masterplan zien dat stedelijke ontwikkeling en stedelijke vernieuwing een drager kan zijn voor HOV. Het masterplan laat zien dat wanneer met stedelijke ontwikkeling en HOV rekening gehouden wordt, de synergie tussen beide optimaal benut kan worden. De mate waarin een uitwisseling kan plaatsvinden tussen stedelijke ontwikkeling/stedelijke vernieuwing en HOV is afhankelijk van de locatie. In dit afstudeerproject laat het lokale ontwerp zien dat het doel van de stedelijke vernieuwing voor het centrum van Amsterdam Nieuw West als een “regionaal” centrum bereikbaar is. Het langzaam verkeerplan binnen het ontwerp kan het laagdrempelig maken van het gebruik van de HOV-lijn bereikbaar maken. Voor het ontwerp is binnen het concept gedeeltelijk gekozen voor behoud. Het behoud van een groot gedeelte de woningen binnen het ontwerp betekent het behoud van woningen voor mensen met de laagste inkomens. (Lakenman, P. 2009) Tevens maakt het de stedelijke vernieuwing bereikbaar voor huidige bewoners. Deze keuze sluit aan bij de inzet op OV. Het gebruikt aandeel OV is namelijk groter bij huishoudens die minder verdienen. (Dieleman en Musterd, 1999:30) Het masterplan en het ontwerp maken met behulp van de HOV-lijn en de stedenbouwkundige interventies het gebied en de stedelijke vernieuwing bereikbaar. Met dit ontwerp zijn we dus op weg naar bereikbare stedelijke vernieuwing!","stedelijke vernieuwing; hoogwaardig openbaar vervoer; compacte stad; netwerkstad; modernisme; Amsterdam Nieuw West","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-07-02","Architecture","Urbanism","","Urban Regeneration","",""

(mentor)","2013","A 3D face recognition algorithm has been developed for the Microsoft Kinect during the final bachelor project at Delft University of Technology in 2013. The aim of the project is to develop a prototype face recognition system. The prototype system has to outperform the existing 2D face recognition system. The main goal is to develop a 3D face recognition system and is divided into three parts. Each part was developed by a group of two students. The subjects were data-acquisition, data-processing and data comparison. Data-comparison is the main topic of this thesis. Nowadays, security is an increasingly important topic in society. 3D face recognition can contribute to make the world a safer place. This thesis is about discovering the new 3D techniques in chapter 4, but first getting familiar with the 2D-world in chapter 3. Our results showed that a 2D system is not accurate to use as a face recognition system. This system is too sensitive for differences in lightning, poses and face expressions. Meanwhile the results achieved with our (proposed) 3D system were quite fast and accurate. The 3D system had five correct matches from the possible six matches. So only one person was not recognized and the process time is 1.19 seconds. This is not tested enough during the period that this thesis was created. It is concluded that 3D face recognition works accurately with geometry and normal map input in combination with the Haar-Walsh Transform and angle-based distance, even though the number of data is not sufficient yet. It even works with only the geometry image as input, both the Haar-Walsh and the Haar transform and the angle-based distance. These two options gave the same result. So as a future task we will increase the number of data to confirm our algorithm.","face recognition; matching; distance measurements; Haar; Haar-Walsh","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics & Computer Engineering","","Circuits and Systems","",""

(mentor); Westrik, J.A. (mentor)","2013","Problem statement In the Netherlands, business and office areas face the increasing problem of becoming and remaining empty. Vacancy causes deterioration and a further decline in overall quality of an area. It is therefore only regarded possible to transform these areas when supported by an area wide approach (Remoy, 2010) It is estimated that there is over 8 million m2 vacant office space in the Netherlands. Many of these areas are organized according to a grid layout, which should theoretically offer most flexibility (Ballon, 2011). It is therefore contradictory that these areas face these kind of problems. Analysis The very strategically positioned Plaspoelpolder (Rijswijk,ZH) is the research location on how structural trends in office vacancy could be tackled by various means of intervention. The area is characterized by it’s mono functional 60s-70s volumes, that were planned in the modernist tradition. The location is well connected to the public transport system as well as the existing infrastructure like the adjacent highway A4. Together with its central positioning in de Randstad, the future of the area has big potentials for regeneration, adding to the quality of the surrounding city, whilst tackling a major national problem. The municipality faces shortages in allotments, offering a great opportunity to develop a strategy in which urban farming functions as an organizing element. Design The basic starting point for the design is to envision a future where the mono functionalist layout of the area is radically broken by transforming existing office stock, and creating new dwellings. This comes down to a vision of changing it towards a living-working area where there is room for self-sufficiency, by both energy and food production. Furthermore, regeneration of these kind of desolating areas offers ‘Compact city’ benefits, as means to reuse built up infrastructure and prevent disappearance of open landscape. This functional restructuring comes in two fold. (1)The transformation of suitable vacant office buildings should be prioritized, this will create dynamics and will be benefitting for the whole area. (2)On the other hand it involves a clear vision on the demolition of the lower scale industrial buildings that face tremendous vacancy rates as well, and are not suitable for transformation. By flexible redistribution of plots with urban farming allowed, a perspective is created for both current and future owners, who get an option for buying and building their own house in the future. This last point also helps the transformation of the office buildings, since the surrounding area will get more attractive. Finally, this functional breakthrough is supported by a bicycle highway, crossing the area, as a generator for dynamics and supporting the urban farming economy. Adding to this, an energy-roof could be constructed over the highway in order to reduce noise and air pollution, making the surrounding a more attractive environment for living. Conclusion These intervention proposals should be embraced by the municipality and adopted into a broad and flexible land-use plan. This could create long term dynamics in the area and diminish the value destruction by vacancy a lot.

(mentor); Van Eesbeek, S. (mentor)","2013","Human movement control is frequently studied by in vivo quantification of NeuroMuscular System (NMS) properties, e.g. intrinsic joint stiffness and joint damping and reflexive feedback gains, during functional tasks. An important measure in movement control is joint admittance, the relation between joint angle and torque. The NMS properties can be used to indicate the specific contributions to joint admittance by parts of the system. Furthermore, dependencies of properties with system states can also be used for physiological interpretation, returning fundamental knowledge on healthy and pathological movement. This knowledge has proven useful for medical diagnostics and aid. In common functional tasks like walking, the variation in states of the NMS is often large. These large variations in states may cause time-variance of the properties. This study compared quantified properties between tasks that required subjects to track a varying or non-varying level of torque using the ankle dorsiflexor. A novel Linear Parameter Varying (LPV) system identification technique was used to estimate the time varying NMS properties. The results indicated that the admittance for tracking a non-varying torque was higher compared to tracking a sinusoidal varying (0.1, 0.2, 0.3 and 0.4Hz) level of torque. Admittance also increased with increasing frequency of the variation in required torque. The parameters were estimated using a parametric model that was fitted on the Frequency Response Function (FRF) of identified LPV models. Intrinsic ankle stiffness and ankle damping and reflexive position- and force-feedback tested significantly different between tasks. Ankle stiffness was lower and ankle damping and reflexive feedbacks were higher while tracking a varying torque. These properties respectively decreased and increased further with increasing frequency of the variation. Position- and velocity-feedback changed from inhibitory to excitatory with increasing background torque, while force-feedback was solely inhibitory. The results indicated that when tracking a fast varying torque lower ankle admittance was reached by lower intrinsic ankle stiffness and increased inhibitory reflexive feedback, compared to tracking slow varying and non-varying torque levels.","neuromuscular properties; joint admittance; linear parameter varying; torque tracking task","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-09-22","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","BMD","",""

Furthermore, the current economic climate calls for a new, more flexible spatial planning form and a different role of the urban planner in area development in the Netherlands. How to deal with this in a smart way, integrating water safety and other assignments of spatial planning?

(mentor)","2013","De Vlaketunnel is een verkeerstunnel, die rijksweg A58 van Bergen op Zoom naar Vlissingen onder het kanaal door Zuid-Beveland leidt. De tunnel bestaat uit twee landhoofden met de bijbehorende op- en afritten en een onderwatergedeelte. Dit gedeelte onder het kanaal is met de zinkmethode aangebracht. In 1990 is het kanaal door Zuid-Beveland opengesteld voor getijdoordringing vanuit de Oosterschelde. De sluis die het kanaal van de Oosterschelde afschermde is om scheepvaart-doeleinden komen te vervallen. Bij het ontwerpen van de tunnel is niet rekening gehouden met het getij als aanvullend belasting. Uit metingen blijkt in ieder geval dat het afgezonken gedeelte twee maal per dag op- en neergaande bewegingen ondervinden, conform het getij. De gemeten verplaatsingen bedragen gemiddeld 9 mm. De metingen laten ook zien dat de grootste verplaatsingen optreden in het midden van het afzinkgedeelte. In deze thesis staan de volgende vragen centraal: Hoe is fysisch mogelijk dat de tunnel opwaarts en neerwaarts gaat en kan de tunnel, in de huidige toestand de getijbelasting weerstaan. Op basis van het beschikbare grondonderzoek is gebleken, dat vanaf onderkant onderspoellaag de bodemopbouw voornamelijk uit losgepakt zand van circa 5 m bestaat. Hierna volgt het pleistocene zand. Na het analyseren van de verrichte metingen in de tunnel en het beschikbare grondonderzoek is een hypothese opgesteld. Hierin is veronderstelt dat de grond onder de tunnel elastisch gedrag vertoont. Bij hoogwater ondervindt de verzadigde ondergrond belastingstoename en een verhoging van de waterspanningen. Hierdoor treedt consolidatie op in de losgepakte zandlaag en het water wordt via het pleistocene watervoerende zandpakket afgevoerd. Door dissipatie van waterspanningen treedt verzakking op. Bij laagwater ondervindt de losgepakte zandlaag belastingsafname. Er treedt dan volumevergroting en het water wordt via het pleistocene zand weer aangetrokken. De hypothese is getoetst aan de hand van een PLAXIS model. De resultaten van de toetsing bevestigen grotendeels de opgestelde hypothese. De aan- en afvoer van water vindt voornamelijk plaatst via het pleistocene watervoerende zandpakket. Wat ook leidt tot het op- en neergaan van de tunnel is de infiltratie van water vanaf bodem kanaal - via grondlagen naast de tunnel - tot onderkant tunnel. Infiltratie wordt veroorzaakt door drukverschillen onder en boven de tunnel. De berekende verplaatsing bedraagt 10 mm. Dat is in orde van grootte conform de gemeten verplaatsingen. Het model is vervolgens aan de hand van de beschikbare metingen op basis van een gevoeligheidsanalyse gekalibreerd. Het gekalibreerde model is getoetst aan twee getijden. Een getij aangenomen op basis van het grenspeil sluiting Oosterscheldekering; scenario I en het hoogst opgetreden getij in het kanaal plus een additionele verhoging van 1 meter; scenario II. De toetsing is geschiedt aan de hand van het optreden van plasticiteit in de grondlagen en op basis van de capaciteit van de rubberprofielen in de voegen. Uit de plasticiteitsanalyse blijkt dat tijdens het passeren van een getijgolf de deformaties van de grond niet blijvend zijn. Bij laagwater komt de tunnel omhoog en in de grond direct naast de tunnel treden hoge schuifspanningen op. In de loop naar hoogwater keert dit proces zich om en bij absolute hoogwater is in het gebied net boven de tunnel lokaal hoge schuifspanningen te verwachten. Een bekende eigenschap van grond is dat bij cyclische belastingen een blijvende deformatie zal optreden. De kans dat dit optreedt bij de Vlaketunnel is met het opgestelde lineair model niet te voorspellen en dient daarom nader te worden onderzocht. De resultaten van de toetsing van de voegprofielen laten zien dat de berekende hoekverdraaiing van maximaal 0,001 rad ruimschoots binnen de toegestane marge valt van 0,0025 rad. Ook hier geldt de onzekerheid betreft het gedrag van de voegprofielen onder wisselende getijden.","Vlaketunnel; getij; afgezonken tunnel; Plaxis; voegrotatie; plasticiteit","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Alf, T. (mentor)","2013","Generally the foundations of offshore wind turbines are steel truss structures which are exposed to wave slamming forces due to breaking waves, typically plunging breaking waves in shallow water. Calculations show that the forces from the plunging breaking waves are governing the design responses of the structure and the foundations. However, there are considerable uncertainties on the calculated plunging breaking wave forces. This research study is to investigate the wave slamming forces acting on different sections of the truss structure for wind turbines. A physical model of 1:50 scale was built at the hydrodynamic laboratory, NTNU. A large number of experiments were carried out on various sections of the truss structure such as front section and side section. Besides, two different size individual piles places at the position of the vertical legs of the truss structure were tested in order to check the size effects. All the tests carried out for regular waves with different wave height and wave periods.The recorded total responses have been decomposed into quasi static and dynamic components. Then dynamic component of the total response is analysed using frequency response function (FRF) method or the transfer function method. The transfer function relates the impact force and the responses and an impulse hammer was used to obtain the transfer function. Duhamel integral method was used only for two individual cylinders in addition to the frequency response function method. The analysed results show that the measured slamming forces are much lesser than the calculated slamming forces in all the cases. This discrepancies could be due to the size effects, scale effects and unfavourable wave form when it hits the structure. The entrained air during breaking process also influences in the results as it is different in the small scale test and in reality. It is recommended to perform the large scale tests to overcome such discrepancies.","breaking waves; slamming forces; response; frequency response function","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","CoMEM Coastal and Marine Engineering and Management","",""
