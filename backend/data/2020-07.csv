(graduation committee); Wevers, Jeroen (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","This thesis explores existing and proposes new methods for assessing concentration risk in default-only credit risk models. Within the existing methods, the analytic Granularity Adjustment is studied in the single factor Gaussian threshold and in the CreditRisk+ framework. These adjustments are tested on a sample portfolio in the presence of recovery risk, and we show that the CreditRisk+ adjustment is more conservative than the Gaussian threshold adjustment. Furthermore, we show that in the presence of recovery risk, the accuracy of the adjustment on exposure level deteriorates. Additionally, the Granularity Adjustment is extended to an independent single factor \textit{t}-threshold model to account for heavier tailed asset returns. Based on the independent single factor \textit{t}-threshold model, we suggest an ASRF equivalent that could serve as an alternative to the current IRB framework. Although much existing literature is focusing on developing analytical methods for measuring concentration risk, recent advances in computational speed make Monte Carlo methods an interesting substitute for measuring concentration risk. To this extend, we propose a split between Monte Carlo based Economic and Regulatory Concentration Risk and show that these measures do not coincide for a given portfolio. This method involves a novel way of assessing idiosyncratic risk in multi factor frameworks. In order to assess sector concentration risk, this thesis proposes a Diversification Factor and a Capital Diversification Index as risk management tools. Finally, this thesis provides a clear account of the effects of concentration, diversification and recovery risk on the portfolio loss distribution for both Gaussian and \textit{t}-threshold models.

(TU Delft Industrial Design Engineering)","Tromp, N. (mentor); Sonneveld, M.H. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","Adolescence is a crucial development stage where both biological and psychological changes take place. Among the various transformations and developments, the discovery of sexuality and intimacy has an important role, especially from sixteen to nineteen years old. The construction of sexual identity is a significant bio-psycho-social development(Kar, 2015), however in Italy almost half of the teenagers have experienced a form of violence from their partners during High School raging from insults to physical aggression (Romito, 2013). The literature agrees that experiencing rejection is a common trigger of aggression with significant repercussions of mental and physical health. Therefore to understand better the phenomenon, its causes and consequences, a combination of desk research and field research was carried out. The results indicated that rejection is lived on an ego level touching the pride of people and therefore it is considered a taboo with strong effects on different levels of society. Based on this analysis, to improve the current situation, it was chosen to focus on the community level by triggering open conversation about rejection. All these insights gained from the analysis were presented to a team of experts and teenagers. Their feedback was helpful to understand the fundamental characteristics that the final design should have to trigger meaningful conversation around the experience of rejection. To discuss how media portraits rejection #FEIC is introduced. #FEIC is a service that provides teenagers with a showcase of media narratives of rejection and interactive activities. The showcase aims to get the teenagers familiar with the idea of media narratives, while the goal of the activities is to make them experiment with them. In the current development, one activity is designed and deepened to use media narratives as a trigger to talk about how society deals with rejection and how that affects teenagers and their thinking. Different variations of the activity were tested to understand what type of interactions were triggering more discussions. Moreover, to evaluate the overall experience and design features, the full service was presented to the experts through in-depth interviews. The feedback gained demonstrated that the use of media is a successful way to trigger meaningful discussion around rejection. The dialogue generated from the #FEIC activity was defined as “different” from what teenagers were used to discussing, “stimulating”, and “useful” to understand better the conditioning behind their judgment.","Teenagers; sexual reproductive health; Relationship","en","master thesis","","","","","","Showcase Project presentation: https://youtu.be/vPznJdtSZeA","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

(graduation committee); Dahm, Ruben (graduation committee); Sperna Weiland, Frederiek (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","Due to global warming, temperatures are expected to rise and, with it, the increase in moisture holding capacity of the atmosphere. Changes in precipitation extremes with temperature are governed by the Clausius-Clapeyron relationship (CC), which states that precipitation increases 7% per degree of warming. While global models and observations are consistent with CC, research at hourly observations have showed deviations in the CC relationship, showing steeper increase up to 14% per degree (super-CC) and &lt;7% per degree for larger temperatures (sub-CC). Studies have shown that scaling rates can be influenced by several factors, such as the length of observations, rainfall percentiles or the timescale of rainfall, among others. Apart from methodological limitations, research on scaling rates is not readily available in all parts of the world, with scarce studies carried out in the African continent. In this context, there is a need for better understanding the relationship between precipitation and temperature as well as the implications for future extremes. To address these challenges, this research investigated 3 main topics. Firstly, existing methodologies were compared and analysed for 353 rain gauges in Germany. Using as extreme rainfall indicators wet percentiles (80th-99th quantile), 3 methods were tested and statistically compared to estimate scaling rates with dew point temperature (DPT): (i) binning methods, (ii) quantile regression and (iii) change-point models at an hourly timescale. Secondly, the presence of super-CC was evaluated for storm events instead of fixed hourly intervals. For that, data from Germany at 10-min resolution was used. The last step involved the analysis of scaling rates for a dense network of newly available rain stations in 4 countries in sub-Saharan Africa: Ghana,Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda. The results from measuring the scaling of extreme precipitation with DPT shows that two regimes arise for Germany: for DPT below 13ºC- 15ºC the scaling rates are close to the CC rate across all quantiles. For warmer DPT of 15ºC or more, scaling rates above the CC are observed, with increasing slope for the highest quantiles. The study of storm events shows that, for mean intensity and peak rainfall intensity, there is a strong sensitivity to DPT, with higher DPT associated with higher rainfall. The analysis of storm duration indicates that shorter events are more frequent for larger temperatures than for shorter ones. The study in sub-Saharan countries shows consistent negative scaling rates with dew point temperature. In addition, for large surface air temperatures (SAT), there is a decrease in relative humidity, suggesting that there is a general lack of moisture availability at the higher SAT ranges. To better understand the physical processes that influence these results, the use of alternative predictors that describe the atmospheric moisture are proposed. In a future warming world, current literature indicates that the greatest rainfall increases will be more visible for short-duration storms rather than increases in annual mean precipitation. As such, within this project, a novel analysis on scaling rates for storm properties shows the potential of these approach to obtain detailed information on the storm properties and their relationship with temperature, which could be used in storm simulations and projects characterising current or future climate.","extreme rainfall; clausius-clapeyron; super-CC; climate change; quantile regression","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Water Management","",""

(mentor); Zhao, Y. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","Crystalline silicon (c-Si) solar cells that are well-established technologies have already achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) as high as 26.7% by using the interdigitated-back-contacted (IBC) configuration. However, this efficiency is still limited by the spectral mismatch between t¬he absorption characteristics of c-Si and the AM 1.5 spectrum. To better utilize especially the low wavelength irradiance and to exceed the single-junction silicon solar cell theoretical PCE limit (29.43%), the perovskite/c-Si tandem solar cell concept was proposed. This thesis project aims to develop a high efficiency single-side textured front-back contacted (FBC) silicon heterojunction (SHJ) solar cell as the bottom cells for 2-terminal (2-T) perovskite/c-Si tandem solar cells. Therefore, we firstly focus on the optimizations of the deposition parameters (power and precursor gases) of hydrogenated intrinsic amorphous silicon ((i)a-Si:H) passivation layer and the subsequent application of hydrogen plasma treatment (HPT) on the (i)a-Si:H layer. An optimized 8.8 nm-thick single (i)a-Si:H together with hydrogen plasma treatment (HPT) achieve an effective lifetime (τeff) of 1.3 ms, implied open-circuit voltage (iVOC) of 704.3 mV on symmetrical passivated double-side-flat &lt;100&gt; oriented crystalline silicon (c-Si) wafer. To further improve the passivation, a bilayer structure of (i)a-Si:H with a total thickness of 10 nm is optimized to boost further the τeff to 8.3 ms and iVOC to 733.5 mV. Afterwards, we implement the optimized (i)a-Si:H layers into the front/back-contacted (FBC) rear junction solar cells with single-side textured morphology, which is designed to be used as the substrate for future integration of solution-processed perovskite top cell. For solar cells investigated, we keep the textured rear side always the same with optimized contact stacks consisting of p-type hydrogenated nanocrystalline silicon oxide ((p)-nc-SiOX:H) and p-type hydrogenated nanocrystalline silicon ((p)-nc-Si:H, while varying the layer stacks on the flat front side. Specifically cell performances are studied with either n-type hydrogenated nanocrystalline silicon ((n)-nc-Si:H) or n-type hydrogenated amorphous silicon ((n)-a-Si:H) with varied optimized (i)a-Si:H layers. We observe enhanced passivation qualities of solar cell precusors when adding the (n)-nc-Si:H/(n)-a-Si:H layer on top of the (i)a-Si:H, which enables the potential for realizing high-efficiency solar cells. During the fabrication of FBC-SHJ solar cells, we also find that a thinner (i)a-Si:H on the front side is critical to improve the device efficiency thanks to the effective reduction of both parasitic absorption and carrier transport losses. Accordingly the gain in JSC and FF dominate the improvement of PCE. Lastly, we present rear junction FBC-SHJ solar cell with n optimized stack of (n)nc-Si:H and (i)a-Si:H, with VOC of 711 mV, JSC of 34.82 mA/cm2, FF of 79.64% and PCE of 19.72%. This optimized solar cell is also considered to be ready for its application in tandem device fabrication.","Solar Cell; heterojunction; Tandem solar cells","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-07-30","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","Although the idea of electric vehicles fell out of favour in the 1930s, it seems this phenomenon is now reversing and that many companies are willing to invest again on this technology. The advantages are clear: no emissions and the possibility to power vehicles by means of sustainable sources. On the other hand, a high number of simultaneously active charging stations would likely lead to severe problems in the electrical network, e.g. grid congestions and voltage issues. One of the main goals of this work is to estimate the impact that a higher EV penetration has on the power loading of the lines and transformers in a distribution grid. Once these effects are clear, the focus can move towards the investigation of possible strategies to limit it. Excluding an equipment reinforcement, the only possible way to keep a grid operating when the general working conditions approach the technical limits, is to improve the power management. In this regard, five control strategies were tested in different combinations. Among these, three were implemented on a single charging station level to control the charging operations of the single vehicles. These are the uncontrolled charging (the most commonly used strategy worldwide), the average power charging, where a constant low power is provided during the whole parking time, and the local optimisation charging, where a completely local optimisation analysis is carried out to calculate the cheapest operation possible. The other two strategies instead were implemented at central level, to curtail power in case of necessity. These are the Equal Curtailment Method, that prioritises an equal division of the curtailment among the chargers, and the Flexible Curtailment Method, that optimises the curtailment considering the flexibility of the charging stations. Several tests were run by means of simulations on real Dutch distribution grid models and they showed that simple charging strategies - such as the average power charging – can lead to both low charging prices and low loading percentages. It seemed hardly possible, though, to make the charging stations take greater advantage of the low prices at night, without causing overloading issues. However, this could be achieved if a curtailment scheme was also included by means of a central coordination unit. Therefore, it is clear that different levels of complexity may bring benefits to the network, but they may also present drawbacks. The purpose of this work is to shed some light on the different possibilities and to provide hints on how to choose the most appropriate strategy for each situation.","Electric Vehicle; Curtailment; Flexible; Optimisation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

Hence, interactions as a social phenomena have been studied by researchers in the fields of psychology and social signal processing from different stand points. The common trend in literature is to perform an in-depth study on a particular aspect of social conversations. Contrast to studying a particular aspect of social interactions, in this research, we attempt to comprehensively quantify social interactions with respect to individual experiences in the interaction, particularly focusing on spontaneous interactions which are typically non-task-directed interactions. To achieve this, we design a novel perceived measure, the perceived Conversation Quality, which intends to quantify spontaneous interactions by accounting for several aspects of spontaneous interactions, namely Rapport, Interaction Quality, Inter-personal liking and Free-for-all. Such an attempt to quantify spontaneous interactions is a substantial contribution towards building socially intelligent system to support human-human and human-robot interaction.<br/><br/>To quantitatively study the perceived Conversation Quality, we devised a questionnaire which measures, at the individual- and at the group- level, the perceived Conversation Quality in spontaneous interactions. Ex- isting literature in the field of social signal processing showed that behavioural features such as Turn-Taking and Bodily Coordination features are informative of several subtle social constructs like cohesion, rapport and interest-levels. Drawing inspiration from them, we extract Turn-Taking and Bodily Coordination features to model perceived Conversation Quality. Using a Logistic Regression, optimised using the Stochastic Gradi- ent Descent algorithm, we were able to predict the individual- and the group- level perceived Conversation Quality with a mean AUC of 0.76 (±0.13) and 0.96 (±0.03) respectively. From the experiments performed, we see that the Synchrony and Convergence based bodily coordination features are the best performing feature sets while predicting the individual-level perceived Conversation Quality and, the Turn-Taking based features are the best performing feature sets while predicting the group-level perceived Conversation Quality.<br/><br/>To further study the properties of the perceived Conversation Quality measure, we performed several statistical tests which study the effect of different social factors on the measure. From theses results, we see that the perceived Conversation Quality, both the the individual- and the group- level, decreases with the increase in number of participants in the spontaneous interaction. Moreover, the equal distribution of talk time amongst participants and the duration of their silence periods have a significant effect on the perceived Conversation Quality. Another interesting finding is that successful and unsuccessful interruptions have a positive effect and a negative effect on perceived Conversation Quality respectively. Moreover, the results also show that the time factor revealing bodily coordination features (lagged correlations and convergence) have a significant effect on both the two levels of Conversation Quality, suggesting that the time factor involved in the bodily coordination is more informative than the degree of coordination in itself. An important takeaway from the statistical test and the predictive modeling experiments is that, the two forms of perceived Conversation Quality, the individual- and the group- level, are completely different from one another with little commonality in their respective statistically significant features.","Social signal processing; Pattern Recognition; Quantitative analysis; Machine Learning; Social interactions; Conversation Quality; Synchrony; Turn-taking; Wearable Accelerometer","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-08-30","","","","","",""

The goal of SWKGroep is to improve this support of the development. In order to do this, and enrich their portfolio, they want to know the possibilities of measuring the development with the use of a physical game. <br/><br/>This report describes the design process of this game and the research to the possibilities of implementing the measurement in this game. Research, interviews and observations have shown that the social and emotional development domain at 6-8 year old children shows the most potential for a development measuring game, both because of the large changes in this domain for this age and the fit with the values of SWKGroep.<br/><br/>In current monitoring systems for the social and emotional development, supervisors observe children and score them on a list of statements. However, the supervisors do not always have time to monitor each child individually. Because of the role of the supervisor, this can also create subjective outcomes. Therefore, it is concluded that the game must measure independently.<br/>By combining two current social and emotional measurement systems, a full understanding of the social and emotional spectrum was created. With this, a list of 23 categories was setup which the game must include to measure.<br/><br/>By performing brainstorm sessions, current game analyses and collaborating with experts, a variety of game ideas have been created. After testing, improving and combining those, three concepts were created. By testing these with the target group, the most promising concept was selected.<br/><br/>After this, through a process of testing with the target group and iteration, the game was improved to be an entertaining and understandable game. In the game, teQ’s adventure, the players have to work together and execute assignments. Each assignment requires skill points, which each player has assigned to himself, to fit him best. The game can both be played on a board as in a ‘life size’ version. <br/><br/>After the entertainment level and understandability were confirmed, the focus shifted to the measurement. Throughout the entire design process, the 23 social and emotional categories were taken into account, but could now be improved further. The categories are implemented in the assignments. The decisions that the players make and the answers that they give to questions, create the data for the measurement. During the game, the players use an app to log their process and insert their answer and decisions. These are then used to transfer into measurement scores. The supervisor can now process them in the same way they do with the current system. <br/><br/>After the design of the game was completed, the game was evaluated. Because in the game the data is collected in a consistent way, through the app, the results have a high reliability. However, because this way of measuring is new and the implementations were created by a non pedagogical expert, the validity has to be assured through further research. <br/><br/><br","design; game; social/emotional development; children","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

Offshore wind is an important source of clean, renewable energy, and it plays a key role in the transition. 80% of the worldwide offshore wind is to be produced on locations in deep waters; here floating foundations are required, that to date are far more expensive than their bottom-fixed counterparts. To reduce costs of floating wind energy, reliable, detailed predictions of the system’s loads and motion response are crucial. Floating offshore wind turbine structures are designed using ’aero-hydro-servo-elastic’ software codes that simulate the dynamic response of a floating offshore wind turbine system to the offshore environment. Predictive accuracy can be improved by comparing simulation results from a model of a known system against measurements taken from the real-world system, a so-called model validation. One promising state-of-the-art aero-hydro-servo-elastic software code is BHawC/OrcaFlex, developed by Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy (SGRE). Due to its novelty, however, validation of the code has only been carried out to a limited extend, giving rise to uncertainty about the interpretation of simulation results. The purpose of this MSc. thesis project is to validate the performance of BHawC/OrcaFlex by comparing its simulated load and motion results to measurements on a real-world floating turbine from the Hywind Scotland floating offshore wind farm (Hywind). Measurement data and a description of the ’as-built’ system were made available by the wind farm owner Equinor ASA. In order to establish an achievable level of modelling accuracy and predictive value of BHawC/OrcaFlex, the code was verified against another aero-hydro-servo-elastic software code: OrcaFlex, by setting up a similar model of the Hywind system in both codes. Limited information is available on the performance of OrcaFlex in floating wind load and motion predictions. Therefore, it was in turn verified against a wide range of industry-standard aero-servo-hydro-elastic software codes, using a modeled system that closely resembled the Hywind turbine and load cases that step-by-step increased in complexity, to further isolate causes of discrepancies between the models. OrcaFlex predictions matched very well across all load cases. The main differences were attributed to differently modeled additional linear hydrodynamic damping, as the official damping prescription resulted in prediction errors. In the BHawC/OrcaFlex verification against OrcaFlex, both models were subjected to multiple load cases that step-by-step increased in complexity, to further isolate causes of discrepancies between the models. Simulation results from running both models appeared to be nearly identical, though some discrepancy was observed from due to the simplified aero-servo-elastic OrcaFlex code. The final validation of BHawC/OrcaFlex to full-scale Hywind measurements is performed at below-rated, rated and above cut-out wind speeds with multi-directional wave and current components. In general, BHawC/OrcaFlex motion frequency domain predictions appeared to correspond well to the actual Hywind measurements. Most phenomena in the low-frequency, wave-frequency and high-frequency region were captured by the simulations. However, large errors were observed in the mean surge, sway and bridle line tensions predictions. Most discrepancies were found originating from errors in the model set-up, e.g. lack of hydrodynamic damping, simplifications in the wave model or errors in the mooring system set-up. Tuning of the mooring system showed improvement of the results, but further improvements could be made. Several sensitivity studies were added on parameters, such as hydrodynamic drag, tower damping and mooring drag. This showed overprediction of the surge/sway and roll/pitch frequency responses can be mitigated by both additional linear and viscous hydrodynamic damping. The main recommendations for further research are to further analyse errors identified in the model set-up. In addition, some yet unexplained phenomena that are not captured by BHawC/OrcaFlex in the current model, are to be addressed. Finally, a the development of a standardized approach to relate model validation studies in the field of floating wind to cost improvements could further quantify the value of future comparison studies.","Model validation; aero-hydro-servo-elastic codes; floating offshore windturbine; floating wind energy; Wind Energy; Offshore Wind Energy; model verification; BHawC/OrcaFlex; OrcaFlex; OC3-project; Hywind; Hywind Scotland; model set-up; climate change; energy transition; siemens gamesa; Hydrodynamics; load and motion prediction; predictive accuracy; Numerical model; full-scale measurements; mooring line tensions; wind turbine motions; dynamic analysis; Dynamic response offshore wind turbine; Validation and Verification; validation method; hydrodynamic damping; Sensitivity Analysis; load case; power spectral density; tower bending; Structural Dynamics; Aerodynamics; mooring system; model tuning; potential flow theory; Morison's equation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","European Wind Energy Masters (EWEM)","",""

Currently, companies produce data for their own usage and store it in data silos afterwards. This hinders secondary data usage, when companies reuse external data. Data marketplace owners enable data trade across companies, but companies rarely trade industrial datasets on multilateral data marketplaces. Data marketplace owners apply business models to transform technical ideas into functioning value propositions. Research about business models of data marketplaces is required to further advance the development of data marketplaces. Literature mainly focuses on one type of data marketplace with a market orientation and independent ownership, whereas those data marketplaces do not move past the conceptual stage. To find viable business models of data marketplaces, we researched various types of data marketplaces that range from hierarchical to market orientation and private to independent ownership in the B2B automotive industry. The research question states ""What business model archetypes are applied by data marketplace owners from different types of data marketplaces in the B2B automotive industry?"" To answer this question, we created a taxonomy in which six data marketplaces are classified. Based on business model patterns in our taxonomy, we derived four business model archetypes. These are (i) the aggregating data marketplace archetype, (ii) the aggregating data marketplace with additional brokering service archetype, (iii) consulting data marketplace and (iv) the facilitating data marketplace archetype. Owners of data marketplaces with a market orientation and independent ownership, the data marketplace type that remains conceptual, apply the facilitating data marketplace archetype. They perform a data brokering service, but fail to attract customers. We advise them to complement their data brokering service with value-adding services such as a customized map service, data quality reviews or personal consults about data sale and purchase at their platform to attract more customers. Future researchers are recommended to extend our taxonomy by classifying additional data marketplaces from various orientation and ownership types. This may validate our results or generate new business model dimensions and characteristics.","Data marketplace owner; Business model; Taxonomy; Archetypes; Trading structures; Automotive industry","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

The pipe is placed in the underground path formed by horizontal directional drilling (HDD). During power transmission, the generated heat from the cable is dissipated by natural convection of water in the gap between cable and pipe. In this project, the first part focuses on the analysis of natural convection in water in the annulus space formed by a cable-pipe boundary. The second part simulates the heat dissipation process of the underground cable-water-pipe system with the influence of the layered soil. The temperature distribution along the HDD path shows an abnormal variation due to different thermal conductivity of soil layer, which causes some hotspots to form on the surface of the pipe.<br/>Heat transfers by conduction, convection and radiation. In this project, only conduction and convection are considered. The thermal radiation analysis is not considered and reserved for future study. Convection can only occur in fluid (liquid or gas). In convection mode, the fluid near the heat source which gains energy become less dense and rises forming a convection flow. The thesis covers two main sections. The first section covers analysis of two problems: the first one is the study of natural convection in the concentric annulus (corresponds to the geometry of cable at the centre of the pipe) and the second one is the natural convection analysis in the eccentric annulus (corresponds to the geometry that cables touches the pipe bottom due to gravity). For the concentric annulus, the highest temperature occurs in the top region of the annulus. For the eccentric annulus, the highest temperature occurs in the narrow region where the inner cylinder touches the outer cylinder. Generally, in the laminar flow regime, the eccentric annulus has a poorer heat transfer rate compared to the concentric annulus. In the second section, a time-dependent model based on the HDD scenario is built in COMSOL, taking into account the influence of natural convection in water and inhomogeneous thermal conductivity of layered soil. The heat transfer process from the cable to the soil along the HDD path is simulated. The heat dissipation rate from the pipe to soil varies due to different thermal conductivity of each soil layer, which causes unpredictable temperature changes at different position of the pipe surface. Hence, some hotspots form on the surface of the pipe. The location of hotspots is detected by numerical modelling in COMSOL. The simulation model can be used in the future for localization of potential hotspots and cable life calculation.<br","Convective heat transfer; Natural convection; Layered soil","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-12-31","","","","Electrical Engineering | Electrical Power Engineering","",""

This type of impact, defined by extreme pressure peaks and a very short duration, is not only caused by breaking waves, but also by non-breaking standing waves on structures with an overhang, such as culverts and steel gates. In this study, the capabilities of the Lagrangian numerical tool Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) are validated by means of experimental research conducted at the Hydraulics lab of the Delft university of Technology, in which two short overhang configurations were subjected to multiple non-breaking wave conditions. SPH distinguishes itself by discretizing the numerical domain in particles instead of a grid, unlike traditional computational fluid dynamics (CFD). In doing so, it excels in free surface modelling and complex wave-structure interaction. In this thesis, the theory of pressure-impulse is applied, which is defined as the integral of the pressure over the impact duration. This method is more stable than using pressure peaks and can be used to obtain the reaction forces on hydraulic structures. However, the theory is in development and subject of recent literature. This research includes the theoretical pressure-impulse model, which is based on the Laplace equation and solely includes the vertical impact by assuming a circular profile under the overhang with a constant impact velocity. Furthermore, a new conceptual model is introduced, which is based on integration by the particle velocities in both horizontal and vertical direction as described by Linear Wave Theory. The assumptions of the velocity fields of both models are assessed by the SPH method. As a result, modifications are proposed to the conceptual model and validated with the experiment. SPH shows good agreement with the experiment in terms of wave generation, pressure distribution and pressure-impulse profile. However, the lack of air in the numerical model result in overestimations of the pressure peaks. The more air is entrapped in the experimental wave impact, the higher the deviation. That said, the impact duration also becomes longer the more air is entrapped while the SPH model shows a somewhat constant and shorter duration. As a result, the pressure-impulse profiles shows corrective behavior over the vertical, mitigates the absence of air and thus greatly increases the accuracy and stability of the results. Finally, an analytical validation is performed in which the theoretical models for overhang configurations and design formulae for vertical walls are compared to SPH and the experiment. <br","Smooth particle hydrodynamics; Wave impacts; Pressure impulse; Numerical modelling; Hydraulic structures","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering | Hydraulic Structures and Flood Risk","",""

The model is based on a set-partitioning mixed integer linear program formulation with an itinerary generation pre-processing step whose goal is to limit the number of possible itineraries per booking and hence the computational effort. The problem is solved for three different cases from a European airline. The three cases are, a flight cancellation, an aircraft swap, and an aircraft swap with ULD configuration.

The ball-screw drives allow for two translational degrees of freedom of the machine tool. This thesis is focused on the dynamics of the stacked ball-screw drives, the so called cross-slides. First, the relevant eigenfrequencies are measured and simulated. Based on the eigenfrequencies, plant transfer functions are determined. When implementing the control elements, the closed loop behaviour has been simulated and compared with experimental data. The influence of disturbances, for example non-stationary cutting forces, has been studied. Also, discrepancy of movement of the slides with respect to movement of the machine tool has been characterized with frequency dependence. It has been measured experimentally with multiple accelerometers at different positions. It has also been simulated using dynamic substructering, modelling the ball-screw drive partly with analytical expressions and partly with a dynamic finite element model. With all the gained knowledge a design cycle of optimal (stacked) ball-screw drives design has been proposed. The design cycle allows for both geometrical changes as well as for the selection of varies control strategies. Using the cycle several designs have been created, with the goal to find a design with maximised closed loop position control usable frequency bandwidth. In the x direction an increase from 40 to 110 Hz was realized, in the z-direction an increase from 50 to 90 Hz was realized. Also, the influence of design changes on the disturbance response and the costs have been indicated.

(mentor); Cazaux, S.M. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","This thesis aims to improve our understanding of the role of ices in planet forming discs, known as protoplanetary discs. Computer models of such discs have been used extensively by the community to understand and predict the observational data. It has always been a challenge to observe ices in the discs and their optical appearance is largely omitted in the disc models. This is due to the complexity and high computational power requirement for computing the opacities while the chemical composition and abundance change at every point in the disc. This work is focused on providing a computationally efficient way of estimating the optical properties of ices in the state-of-the-art Protoplanetary Disk Model (ProDiMo). Although observations of ices are rare, some observations particularly for the 3 micron water ice feature are available. These have been studied by means of different radiative transfer disc models, however, the effect of the position-dependent ice opacities on the physico-chemical disc structure has not been considered. In this work, it is found that the optical properties of dust depend on the ice composition, the ice abundances and how the ice accumulates on the refractory dust grains. It is shown that using a pre-calculated opacity grid and performing interpolation between these grid points provides an accurate and computationally efficient estimation of position dependent ice opacities in protoplanetary discs. Further, it is found that the inclusion of chemically consistent ice opacities calculation in the disc model does not have a significant effect on the physico-chemical structure of the disc. However, the appearance of the disc changes significantly. Dark bands appear in disc images at wavelengths corresponding to ice absorption features. These features are stronger when the thickness of the ice layer on the refractory dust grains is assumed to be constant but weaker when the ice/refractory volume ratio is assumed to be constant. The predicted disc spectra are analysed considering the spatial resolution offerred by spectrographic modes of Near-InfraRed Spectrograph (NIRSpec) onboard James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), expected to launch in 2021. This shows that the ice features can be observed, particularly when the disc is seen against a distant background source (silhouette discs). Thus, silhouette discs are promising observational targets to study ices in discs.","Protoplanetary disk; Planet formation; Opacity; James Webb Space Telescope; Numerical","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-07-01","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","class=""MsoNormal"">Aito has developed a technology that can be placedunderneath surfaces to give haptic feedback. They make use of piezoelectricdiscs to sense a pressure difference and actuate a pulse if this differencereaches a certain level. This system is possible because of the piezoelectriccrystals in the discs. These crystals create current from movement for thesensing action, and create movement by adding current for actuation action.These properties, combined with the way Aito layers the structure to supportthe piezoelectric discs, allow for this type of haptic feedback which mimicsthe press of a button. While the technology of Aito currently focuses on asingle pulse to simulate the feeling of a button, it is possible to send acontinuous stream of vibrations through the piezoelectric discs. This streamcould be a pulse that is being repeated over and over, or it could be avariation of pulses which creates music. This last possibility is explored inthis graduation project by a state-of-the-art review, objective measuringtechniques and subjective measuring techniques. With Aito’s current structure, it seems possible to create aspeaker in which the surface is vibrated to create audio according to thegathered literature in the state-of-the-art review. The literature describestwo types of speakers with a similar structure as Aito, which are the distributedmode loudspeakers and multiactuator panels. These speakers use a vibrationmodule (an exciter), to move the surface they are attached to. The differencebetween these two speakers is the placement and number of exciters. Both thesespeakers have a different designing approach than the standard design processof coil-based speakers. The design approach for distributed mode loudspeakersand multiactuator panels is used in this project but incorporates sometechniques from the usual procedure. The main elements that are adopted fromthe standard audio engineering approach relate to the validation of the setupwith users and measurements.The traditional approach of audio engineers to involve usersinto the design process, is by letting participants participate in listeningtest to define the audio quality perception of the speaker. This approach isadapted in this project into an approach which allows users to define theiraudio quality expectations; this involves users earlier on into the designprocess. By letting users participate early on in the process, the audioquality experience can be changed efficiently. The perceptions could improvethe experience at the end of the process, while the expectations change it inthe beginning. The expectation that is explored during this research involvesfoldable laptops and tablets. This approach shows that the audio quality of foldablelaptops is expected to be higher than foldable tablets. The whole foldablegroup is expected to perform lower than a laptop, but higher than a smartphone.The expected speaker placement also showed a difference between foldablelaptops and foldable tablets, which shows similarities to their non-foldable devicegroup. Therefore, a speaker that is integrated into the surface would ensurethat the speaker location is most optimal in both the laptop position as wellas the tablet position of a foldable device.  For the measurement validation, various tests were donebased on the approach of audio engineers to define how Aito’s structureperforms for audio functionalities. This approach was chosen to compare theresults to the requirements of the industry; these take volume levels andfrequency range of the audio into account. When these requirements arecombined, a grading system is created to help in selecting the correct speakerfor specific experiences. The tests were done with simplified models of afoldable tablet because this product group is the best fit for a haptic andaudio combination. In total, there were eight individual models used during thesystem performance testing. All these models originated from one basic model,which was a simplified foldable tablet structure; this model can be seen infigure 1. Its structure is separated into two identical halves to be able tocreate stereo audio when both halves are used. In the individual models,changes were made to test the effects of different surface materials, surfaceedge fixtures, piezoelectric disc layouts and uses of the space behind thesystem. These changes were mainly based on the design principles of distributedmode loudspeakers and multiactuator panels but were combined with some designprinciples dictated by Aito and the speaker industry. This research was a first step in the direction of audiowith Aito’s current setup. From the performance of eight models in combinationwith the user expectations on foldable laptops and tablets can be concludedthat the technology is not yet there. However, for less demanding products,such as intercoms, the audio quality can be deemed good enough as is with somesmall improvements. There is also the possibility to use the system only forhigher frequencies and haptics and add another speaker to generate lowerfrequencies. ","Piezoelectric speaker; Distributed mode loudspeaker; Audio expectations; Audio measurements; Haptic feedback","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","C-Job Naval Architects, a naval architecture company committed to developing sustainable ship designs, received a request from the coastal tourist agency IJmuidense Rondvaart to study the feasibility of a Sustainable Fast Ferry for Commuters concept design. This passenger-only ferry is featured by operating at high speeds (22 knots) between the metropolitan areas of IJmuiden and Amsterdam, being completely zero-harmful-emission and carrying a maximum of 40 commuters and 15 bicycles.<br/><br/>Based on the high levels of traffic congestion reported in the historical center of Amsterdam, the City of Amsterdam announced in its policy Traffic and Transport the implementation of more ferry services in the IJ waterway as one of the measures to battle this issue. In addition and considering the negatives effects of traffic congestion with regards to the concentration of air pollution, the City of Amsterdam also aims to establish zero-emission areas within the city between 2020 and 2030 as part of the measures announced in the policy Clean air.<br/><br/>Therefore, the necessity of a zero-emission ferry service within the Amsterdam area to reduce traffic congestion and air pollution exists. In order to achieve a feasible design, a Systems Engineering approach was applied. This methodology provides a solid base and structure to manage the constraints and complexity that a zero-emission design involves, highly related to weight and range.<br/><br/>Thus, an initial analysis of the applicable current technology was carried out. This analysis allowed to determine and examine the most effective technology to achieve a feasible design. In addition to examine the available technology, previous sustainable ferry designs were studied as well in order to observe the limitations, challenges and solutions taken by other ferry designs.<br/><br/>Considering the challenges observed from previous designs and the examination of the current technology, different candidate systems were explored. From this exploration three systems highlighted as the most suitable, in which Model 18 was the selected candidate system for being capable of meeting the weight and volume requirements as well as for standing out because of the greater sustainability and lower costs.<br/><br/>Lastly, a more detail description of the characteristics of this model was given. This description indicated the general arrangement showing the lay-out of the different compartments, analyzed the stability performance of the hull design and made a simplified study of the economical feasibility, in which the minimum fare to cover OPEX was determined and compared with the competition. Moreover, an estimation of the approximated payback period was performed too.<br/><br/>Overall, this feasibility study proved that a technical feasible design is achievable and, depending on the acceptability by the public opinion, i.e. operational capacity, an economical feasibility might be also possible.","Zero-emission; Ferry; Systems Engineering; Sustainable Design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(TU Delft Industrial Design Engineering)","Schifferstein, H.N.J. (graduation committee); Schot, M. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","Today more deaths are linked to obesity and weight gain than famine and malnutrition, especially with children a concerning increase in global childhood obesity has developed. Currently, many programs have been implemented in the Netherlands to address childhood obesity, however, few go beyond awareness and involve a physical experience. To address this gap this project researched and designed a product experience to support families to develop a healthier relationship with food. The primary aim of the research was to gain a better understanding of how food, play, and parent-child interactions influence eating habits and behaviours in families, especially with regard to toddlers and younger children. Through this research a design was created for the year 2025 and tested with families.<br/><br/>In the first phases of this project, research was conducted through a literature review and qualitative studies with domain experts as well as parents with children between the ages of 1 and 4. These research studies focused on gaining a deeper understanding of specific values, beliefs, and parental experiences within a family in order to better understand the conflicts that exist in the home food context. The insights gained through these studies were gathered and categorized based on how they contribute to what family interactions around food moments will look like in the year 2025. For example, one insight is that parents struggle to set clear boundaries; they often sacrifice their own well-being in order to be more engaged in their children’s lives. Most families are child-centred, where the children hold priority over their parent’s time, energy, and attention. When reviewing these categories, the need for flexibility was a surprising yet important concept.<br/><br/>Once a clear formulation of the home food context was established a series of design interventions were developed and tested. Interventions were tested by myself as well as other families in order to identify and establish which designs positively influence our relationship with food. The design interventions were inspired by the themes of rebellious play, mindful eating, and the promotion of playful exploration, guided independence, trusted relationships, and family harmony.<br/><br/>After testing of prototypes, a final concept was developed and tested by families with children. The final concept called Happi Hanily is a family food play experience that facilitates the reflection of family food values, supports mindful eating, and creates an atmosphere that fosters harmony among family members—all of which promote the development of healthy eating behaviour for the family over time. The design has three elements, the digital Food Finder which is an online recipe platform, the Spill Supporters which are customized napkins, and the Wackey Wavey Wheel of food which is the central serving and eating dish.<br/><br/>The final concept was tested with three families using the qualitative methods of observation, questionnaires, and interviews. During testing it was found that the design facilitated a harmonious dinner experience with the qualities of playful exploration, guided independence, and trusted relationships being enhanced. Due to the timeframe of the project it was difficult to measure whether families were able to develop a healthier relationship with food. However, based on parental feedback it appears that children are more engaged while eating with the Happi Hanily and that this product is something they would adopt as a ritual. The design facilitates a more relaxed and stress-free dining experience which is important when introducing new food to children and when helping them to develop a healthier relationship with food.","Healthy Eating Behaviour; Behaviour Change; Playful Interactions","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

Inspired by the natural phenomenon of bird flight, formation flying has proven to reduce the aerodynamic drag of trailing aircraft that follow the wake of a leader. We investigate the network scale fuel-savings potential of this operational concept, which could be implemented in the existing global airline fleet. In order to realise the benefits of formation flying, a concept of operations is required that accounts for the strategic nature and interests of flight operators. We propose a concept of operations that coordinates formation flying for flight operators who are strategic, intelligent, and social. A multi-agent negotiation coordination mechanism is developed and evaluated, which enables competitive flight-agents to maximize their utility by engaging in flight formations. This paper presents an adjusted Contract Net Protocol that governs formation task and role allocation, where the agents reason through heuristic strategies and learning capabilities. We show that self-interested formation managers are likely to coordinate towards socially desirable outcomes. No preferable bidding strategies have been found, as they are shown to depend on non-local qualities. The proposed concept of operations achieves a 5.8\% fuel-flow reduction for a large-scale transatlantic flight network.","multi-agent system; coordination; negotiation; contract net; learning; value allocation; formation flying","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-12-31","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Most research focusses most of its efforts on improving the accuracy and flexibility of prognostic models. Making them increasingly capable of forecasting different sets of data with high precision. However there is a lack of integration of these newly developed models within a practical maintenance architecture. This research will aim to fill this gap in the state-of-the-art. It will do so by implementing a data-driven Grey model (GM) in a CBM framework and evaluate its financial benefits over a run-to-failure maintenance paradigm. Not only will this research focus on this alone, but a comparison will also be performed on different optimization strategies of such an integrated CBM system. Simulated turbofan run-to-failure data from the NASA PHM-08 data repository was used for this study as it provides an unique insight on degradation propagation until failure of a vital and expensive aircraft sub-system. This study shows that an integrated CBM model can lead to greater maintenance cost savings than a more traditional segmented approach. Furthermore it shows that the system configurations that focus on reaching local optima on the individual components of the CBM system does not lead to overall optimal system performance.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

The assist-as-needed paradigm for rehabilitation robotics was based on a single-state model of human adaptation to a neurological handicap. Recent studies have shown that human motor adaptation consists of two or more parallel adaptation processes. A two-state model of adaptation based on the presence of a fast process and a slow process has been widely adopted. The fast process adapts faster than the slow process but has a lower retention than the slow process. Designing training methods that can influence the individual adaptation processes could help make sure that patients retain what is desired (how to adapt to a neurological injury) and forget what is detrimental to rehabilitation (dynamics of the robotic assistance for example). The goal of this work is to design an optimal control paradigm for selectively influencing the slow and fast processes.<br/>A feedforward discrete-time linear-quadratic tracking controller was designed for a 2-state linear time-invariant model of sensorimotor adaptation to increase the contribution of the slow process to the net adaptation at the end of training. This control signal was implemented as the sequence of visuomotor rotations in an upper-limb reaching task. This sequence of visuomotor rotations were dubbed the Adaptation-State-Tracking (AST) perturbation. The retention behaviour after this AST perturbation was compared with that after a non-adaptive (constant-level) perturbation. A between-subject comparison of the retention behaviour showed that the AST perturbation exhibited better retention than the constant-level perturbation (p=0.0415). As far as the author is aware, this is first time the 2-state Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) model has been used to design a perturbation and to predict the subsequent behaviour of the participants. The sufficiency of the control based on the 2-state LTI model and the possibility of improving retention with optimal control could positively impact the domain of robot-assisted rehabilitation.<br","Rehabilitation; Adaptation; Linear model; Motor adaptation; Humans; Optimal Control; Linear-Quadratic Tracking; 2-State Model; Fast Process; Slow Process; Explicit; Implicit; Models, Neurological; Sensorimotor Adaptation; Visuomotor Adaptation; Personalisation; Robot-assisted; Retention; Savings","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-07-31","","","","","",""

However, MTDC network also comes with the protection challenges resulting from dc faults. Hence, the dc circuit breaker (DC CB) is imperative in such a network. In these recent years, several DC CB technologies have been proposed and demonstrated by different manufacturers. Besides, these DC CB technologies differ from each other in terms of the speed of operation, interruption capability and costs. Hence, for the optimal performance of the MTDC network, a study of the co-ordinative operation of different DC CB technologies is required. In this thesis, two typical types of DC CBs are modelled in detail and implemented in a 4-terminal MTDC network in PSCAD environment, by considering operation time, interruption capability and interruption characteristics. The obtained results are used for DC CB’s selection optimization methodology for the future MTDC networks. Similarly, a scaled model of DC CB has to be analysed in terms of its interruption capability in MTDC network considering various scenarios. Therefore, in this master thesis, technical performance of DC CB technologies is conducted for a test and multiterminal dc network in EMT based software environment.<br/><br/>The DC CB is the key to unlock the reliable operation of a Multi-terminal direct current network, whereas fast, effective and accurate models are frequently needed for system-level studies. Due to higher subsystem components in DC CB, a detailed DC CB model creates a bottleneck in the network analysis. This thesis also proposes and compares, an average model with a detailed model of Voltage source converter Assisted Resonant Current (VARC) and Mechanical DC CB in MTDC Network in terms of their performance and computation time for two typical simulation cases. The average and detailed model is modelled and simulated on the PSCAD/EMTDC electromagnetic transient platform. Decisively, this thesis concludes by presenting an accurate response of the average model during the fast transient event, showing additional computational advantage.<br","Multi-Terminal HVDC; DC circuit breakers; VARC DC CB; Mechanical DC CB; Average model; Co-ordinative performance; offshore windfarm; circuit breaker performance; Re-strike; multi-column surge arresters","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2025-07-28","","","","","",""

It also looked into their behaviour with blockchain technology, and current support that blockchain technology provides to a circular economy, namely, supply chain transparency and others. The new target segmentation was created according to literature, and user research was done with the target group. Contextmapping method was used to collect the user’s insight, and qualitative data were analysed. The results showed that consumers lack trust in sustainable claims that were advertised by brands, consumers lack motivation since the sustainable impacts are not clearly measurable, and more. The research also showed that blockchain technology in supply chain transparency could provide consumers with trustworthy sustainable data to support their purchase decision of the product. <br/>Based on these insights, new target segment (end-consumers), brand identity, platform design, and a roadmap of implementation plan were created with value exchange between consumers, brands, original equipment manufacturers, part manufacturers, material manufacturers, and recyclers in the future.<br/>This thesis aims to empower consumers by translation blockchain’s sustainable claims from manufacturers, into product storytelling. With accumulated value, it also proposes a long-term strategy to connect the consumers to the supply chain.

To achieve this goal, the focus of the project was on developing a toolkit for sketching in remote workshops. The development of the toolkit was divided into three phases - a research phase, an experiment phase and a synthesis phase. <br/><br/>In the research phase several benefits of sketching that the toolkit should promote were found, as well as drawbacks of sketching that the toolkit should mitigate. The Integrated Creative Problem-Solving theory was studied, to identify how the toolkit can be integrated with the creative process of Idean’s workshops. Remote collaboration was studied in order to identify which considerations had to be taken into account when moving from face to face to remote workshops. In addition to this, the Theory of Planned Behaviour was studied, in order to figure out how the toolkit could promote the use of sketching in remote workshops. <br/><br/>The experiment phase was conducted through three sprints where the toolkit was developed. The first sprint was concerned with the practical challenges of creating and collaborating by means of sketches in a remote workshop. The second sprint tackled the challenge of creating meaningful activities around sketching in remote workshops. Finally, the third sprint further developed the activities, in addition to tackling how to warm up the participants’ sketching abilities and how to capture the value of the sketching activities for use beyond the workshop. <br/><br/>In the synthesis phase the different solutions that were developed in the experiment phase were revised based on the insights from all three sprints, and the solutions were compiled into a toolkit. <br/><br/>The toolkit includes sketching instructions, a method for creating and collaborating around sketches, sketching activities, guidelines on how to structure the activities and guidelines on how to capture the value of the activities for use beyond the workshop. The different components of the toolkit provide structure to the different aspects of including sketching in remote workshops, while promoting the benefits of sketching.

A grounding system is generally designed: (1) to reduce voltages occurring in the grounding system for short circuit situations (at power frequency) to an acceptable level in terms of step and touch voltages and to prevent damage to systems, (2) to provide good connection and a conducting path for the lightning protection system to function correctly and (3) for Electro- Magnetic Compatibility (EMC) based on generic rules to reduce the risk of damage and<br/>interference of systems.<br/><br/>More specifically, the grounding system is crucial for the good protection of the primary components (mainly the power transformer) against overvoltages caused by lightning strikes, usually with the aid of surge arresters.

However, literature suggests that this fails to take into account the properties of a grounding system and that their transient behaviour should be studied more extensively.<br/><br/>The lightning response of grounding grids can be assessed by means of simulations and by experimentation results. To performsuch studies, TenneT has different software tools available. By using the XGSLab software tool, the behaviour of grounding systems was studied.

However, the disharmony between water and urban life is looming especially after over thirty-year rapid urbanization in China with notable global climate change. Faced with water-related issues, e.g. flooding, water pollution, water shortage, etc., Government of China initiated a so-called Sponge City Program (SCP) in 2014 for constructing ‘sponge-like’ water-resilient cities. Nevertheless, challenges and gaps lie in practice of SCP, one of which is that an operationalizable design approach of a sponge city to realise its multiple objectives is neither available in current guidelines, nor thoroughly studied or proposed in recent literatures.<br/>The aim of this master thesis was to formulate an improved approach, as well as to improve planning &amp; design framework for supporting integrated sponge design process and enhancing the involvement of various stakeholders. Literature study, the study of current guidelines and sponge plans of Nanjing, and interviews with sponge city practitioners were performed to evaluate current Sponge City (SC) concept and assess SC planning &amp; design practice. Analysis of SC concept development showed that SC has been evolving from a term mainly describing measures with ecological benefits towards a more inclusive urban development paradigm, considering not only water ecology, but also water safety, water environment and water resource. Analysis on SC practice identified the gaps in current SC water management contents, including a lack of design method for calculating storage capacity against pluvial flooding, ignorance of extreme drought assessment, missing groundwater management, etc. Challenges that might impede comprehensive sponge city planning &amp; design process were also enumerated, including data availability and accessibility, the bond between SC and other sector plans, etc. <br/>Based on the identified challenges and gaps, improvements on current planning &amp; design practices were given and a new design approach was proposed, including changing collaboration method, introducing a co-design workshop and using a sponge design toolbox to facilitate planning &amp; design process. The approach provided a method to calculate the required sponge capacity for not only preventing flood damage but also mitigating water shortage in dry spells, as well as quantifying other co-benefits. The improved design approach was tested by a case study in Nanjing, in the Qinhuai District sponge city planning project. Case study results showed that most steps in the proposed design process were successfully taken in Qinhuai project, and the toolbox was able to facilitate planning and design of sponge measures to have functions not only for pluvial flooding prevention and control, but also for water shortage mitigation, ecological benefits and other day-to-day values. The design process also demonstrated the collaborative contribution to a sponge city plan from water managers, water engineers and landscape architects. Therefore, the new design approach can contribute to a more integrated SC planning and design.","Sponge City; Design approach; Urban planning; Model; Urban water management; China","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Water Management","","32.0391, 118.7948"

This allows for the modeling of permanent deformation in the tissue as a result of the presence of tumor cells. The work done in this project can be divided into two parts. In the first part we review existing models for elasticity and build corresponding finite element models. The aim of the first part is to gain understanding in the behaviour of morphoelasticity and poroelasticity. In morphoelasticity the deformation tensor is decomposed into an elastic and plastic component, allowing for permanent deformations to occur in the tissue. The theory of morphoelasticity describes the interplay between a fluid in a porous tissue and the tissue's elastic properties. A common problem in poroelastic models is the occurence of non-physical oscillations in the pressure. The second part of this project contains novel work. First, a rigorous mathematical derivation is presented of the tuning parameter found in the diffusive stabilization method for poroelastic systems. Secondly, we present a finite element model for the novel combination of morpho- and poroelasticity. The derivation concerning the diffusive stabilization is also applicable to the morpho-poroelastic finite element model. We obtain a promising tumor growth model by combining a biochemcial tumor growth model with morpho-poroelasticity. This biochemical model is based on a nutrient transport equation and a tumor cell density evolution equation. Some example output of the tumor growth finite element model is shown.

(mentor); Berghuis, G.H. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","This graduation project was initated in collaboration with Nibud to explore and imagine possibilities to facilitate a value-driven approach to financial decision-making. Several factors stress the relevance of this challenge, in particular regarding millennials as a target group. From an economic point of view, millennials are facing an affordability crisis (aging population, student debt, expensive housing, flexibile contracting and a looming recession). From a psychological perspective, a disparity seems to exist between what people expect will increase their wellbeing versus what types of consumption actually succeeds in doing so. Therefore, prioritizing saving over spending can be seen as an alternative way of sustainably increasing wellbeing. Millennials their early stage of life, digital nativity and strong sense of autonomy allows for opportunities to unburden them from financial hardship, yet the field of personal finance has seen surprisingly limited technological development aimed at this potential. With cash slowly being replaced by thoughtless payment, digitalization has left people with obscured and chronologically fragmented financial transactions that provide little feedback on their consumption pattern. This limited facilitation to prioritize saving over spending raises the threshold for attaining a financial overview up to a level that is only accessible to a happy few that is both highly motivated as well as tech-savvy. Furthermore, current solutions offer limited connection between short-term decisions and prospective long-term wellbeing (saving goals) and instead remain oriented towards retrospective micro-management. Lastly, commercial parties extracting sensitive personal data can count on public distrust, which is less of an issue for an independent foundation like Nibud. Using a ViP inspired approach, many factors were turned into six clusters that provided interesting directions in which to generate ideas on how Nibud can grab the opportunity of increasing millennials their agency to proactively prioritize saving over spending and thus unburden their lives from financial stress. The final design proposal is a participatory savings program called ‘meesparen’. Besides setting, tracking and comparing efforts at reaching saving goals, the application also supports a clear overview on recurring expenses, free spending and saving goals, which can be compared to peers that are motivated to start saving as well. The design was evaluated and redesigned to clearly demonstrate its potential to help millennials put money back into their hands.","personal finance; saving; nibud; money; cash; PSD2; millennials","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

This construction boom has happened in alignment with the phenomenon of the increasing urbanization of cities worldwide. A tall building offers the capability to accommodate large volumes of people and satisfy both their residential and business needs in cities with limited margins of horizontal expansion. Consequently, tall buildings can act as a solution to the phenomenon of increasing urbanization. This thesis enriches the pool of existing knowledge with additional quantitative data, from a global viewpoint. Main objective is to understand what determines the development of tall buildings and especially their height. A quantitative research methodology is employed, where a database of 4826 tall buildings is created. This includes tall buildings taller than 150 meters, constructed after 1960 and still standing, worldwide. Factors that determine the height are investigated with the use of Multiple Linear Regression, having four perspectives as guide. These are: economic-related, building-related, location-related and height competition. The effects of space and time are also taken into account with appropriately constructed variables and the regression models created turned to have moderate explanatory power. Findings suggest that the decision to develop a tall building is based on the location itself, complemented by the current economic conditions and depending on the function the building is designed to serve.","Tall buildings; Height; Determinants of Height","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

Operating the network is difficult, especially predicting the effect of changes in the network or finding the optimal operating mode where costs are minimized. The aim of this study is to create a model of the steam network which can predict these effects and able to find the optimal operating point.<br/><br/>The steam network is simulated in two models: one focused on hydraulic calculations and one on operational cost optimization. Both models are created in the software i-Steam from PIL, which is specialized in simulating and optimizing steam utility systems. The hydraulic model incorporates the pipelines and all steam producers and consumers connected to the network. The model is validated for four scenarios which arechosen to include varying ambient conditions and operating modes. The model is applied for testing the<br/>effects of a new unit which must be connected to the existing steam network. The optimization model is focused on steam and electricity production and uses the current market conditions, such as the prices of natural gas, electricity, water and CO2 emission. Another factor in optimizing the system is by comparing the<br/>steam production price with the steam price which can be taken in from the power generation plant 2 (PGP2).<br/>The software uses GAMS as an optimization tool which applies multi integer nonlinear programming to find the operating mode with the minimal operating cost.<br/><br/>The pressure and temperature validation results for the hydraulic model are mostly within the 2.83% accepted uncertainty window.

The adoption of hydrogen as an energy carrier beyond its current non-energetic use is however faced with deep uncertainty, making decision-making on policy support difficult. The state-owned enterprise (SOE) is evaluated as a particular type of policy support that may be implemented. SOEs are generally uniquely positioned in the energy system, due to their connection to policy-makers, their access to capital and their ownership of existing assets. An agent-based model (ABM) is created to evaluate the effects of SOEs on the emergence of a sustainable hydrogen economy. The model is experimented with using an exploratory modelling and analysis (EMA) approach. The results show that the SOE can strongly reduce the carbon intensity of hydrogen production, depending on the specific mandate used. A national carbon tax can achieve this effect as well, but the SOE has the added benefit of providing capital to asset investments, stimulating knowledge sharing and enabling investment in riskier technologies. This last benefit is especially important if the SOE is used to enable early deployment of electrolyser technologies. Further measures would have to be taken to facilitate this deployment, because in the coming decades electrolysers will remain far from cost-competitive under most market conditions.","Agent-based model; Exploratory modelling; Hydrogen economy; State-owned enterprise; Energy policy simulation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","Globally, water demand is rising and resources are diminishing. In the context of climate change and a growing world population, a further increase in water scarcity seems inevitable. Aiming towards a sustainable future, water should be used as efficiently as possible by minimizing water losses, which can be higher than 50% in some drinking water networks. To minimize water losses it is crucial to detect, localize and repair leaks as soon as possible. Leaks can be efficiently and automatically tracked down in the early stages by using leak detection and localization techniques. These techniques are based on coupling information from flow and pressure measurements with the hydraulic model of the drinking water network. The success of such methods depends to a great extend on the estimation of the uncertain water demand in the area. The water demand within a hydraulic model is usually estimated in a deterministic fashion, which lacks the ability to realistically describe the fluctuations in water demand. To include realistic fluctuations in water demand, this study proposes a novel approach by estimating the water demand in a stochastic way by simulating it with SIMDEUM. This stochastic demand model uses information of water users and water-use appliances from Dutch statistics to simulate realistic domestic drinking water demands and its stochastic variations. With this approach, this study aims to assess the influence of a realistic stochastic demand model on the robustness of leak detection and localization algorithms. The applied case study is a residential area in the Netherlands, consisting of a drinking water network with an inflow and six pressure sensors. The corresponding hydraulic model uses stochastic demand loading conditions as inputs. The model represents the network reliably when the SIMDEUM software with local statistics is used instead of average Dutch household statistics. By conducting a Monte Carlo analysis, the influence of stochastic demand on the variability of simulated flow and pressures is determined. Artificial leaks are simulated and the influence of stochastic demand on the performance of leak detection and leak localization is analyzed. The leak detection method consists of setting up confidence intervals per sensor from Monte Carlo simulations and checking whether data falls within these intervals. The leak localization method is based on simulating artificial leaks on all possible locations in the model and comparing the resulting simulated pressures for each simulation to the observed data by using Pearson’s correlation coefficient. The position of the leak in the simulation most similar to the observations is most likely to be near the real leak position. The results show that the stochastic demand variability is strongly linked to the performance of leak detection and localization. The leak detection and localization is most sensitive during the night due to low nocturnal demand fluctuations and least sensitive during the morning peak, when diurnal demand fluctuations are highest. Moreover, the results show that the position and size of the leak significantly influence the performance of leak detection and localization. This study shows that stochastic water demand can be used to quantify the influence of realistic demand variations on the performance of leak detection and localization. Hence, it is recommended to assess the robustness of more leak detection and localization techniques by using stochastic water demand. Furthermore, it gives insight into the expected variability in pressure throughout the network, hence, can prove to be useful in optimal sensor placement.","Leak localisation; Leak detection; Stochastic water demand; Water demand fluctuations; SIMDEUM; Uncertainty analysis; Duindorp; Calibration; Case Study; Stochastic and Robust; Water Distribution Network; Leakage; Leak; Leaks; Water leak; Pipe burst; Roughness calibration; background leaks","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Water Management | Hydrology","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","The maximal conversion efficiency on a single pn-junction solar cell is calculated to be 33.7% at a band gap energy of 1.34 eV. The main reasons for this maximum are the non-absorption of low energy photons and the thermalization of high energy photons. To counter this, multijunction devices can be constructed to make optimal use of the spectral range of the sunlight reaching the earth’s surface. While the introduction of thin film multi-junctions based on<br/>silicon has managed to overcome the problem of spectral mismatching, photons with an energy below 1.12 eV are still not able to be collected. Where usually a high current density is traded off against a high open circuit voltage in multi-junction devices, the addition of a low band gap germanium-based bottom cell (Eg = 0.67 eV) could improve open circuit voltage without limiting the current density in the device. The photon flux in the range of 0.67-1.12 eV is high enough such that a current density of 15.9 mA/cm2 can be produced when they can be effectively collected. This current density is so high that it will never limit the output current of a multi-junction device, making germanium a very attractive material for studying and integration in structures where the low energy photons are not yet utilised.<br/><br/>This thesis is focused around the growth and characterization of hydrogenated germanium films for future use as active absorbers in multi-junction deivces. The influence of a set of deposition parameters on the morphological, optical and electrical properties of the films is studied with the aim of finding a deposition regime where device quality germanium films can be produced within the CASCADE reactor in the EKL clean room. The thin films are all be deposited using the RF-PECVD technique. Uniformly deposited Ge:H films under a stable<br/>plasma can be deposited in CASCADE in the range of 1-5 mbar pressure and 5-30 W RF power at a fixed electrode distance of 20 mm. The films start to crystallize and form nc-Ge:H at a pressure of around 3-4 mbar and an RF power of 15-25 W when the germane precursor gas is diluted with hydrogen in a ratio of 1:400. A strong correlation between the refractive index and the presence of post deposition oxidation is investigated. Films with a low refractive index are characterized as having a low material denisty, making it easy for ambient water<br/>molecules to diffuse into the lattice and react with germanium dangling bonds present there. By studying the effect and extent of the post-deposition oxidation on other film properties it was found that the activation energy of the films decreases to values as low as 50 meV. Despite this, due to a significant decrease of the σ0 by 1-5 orders of magnitude, the dark conductivity is found to decrease by 1-3 orders of magnitude. With a high photo/dark conductivity of 5-6 as a result. These results have led to the belief that the formation of Ge-O bonds in the films decreases the amount of defective states in the film, but that the defect states are moved up to an energy level closer to the conduction band. The presence of Ge-O bonds also inhibits the development of low band gap absorbers as seen by the low E04 optical band gap. In the denser films without oxygen contamination, the lowest E04 that has been reported is 1.2 eV along with a Tauc gap of 0.93 eV and a photo/dark conductivity ratio of 3.4.","germanium; a-Ge:H thin film; nc-Ge:H thin film; PECVD; cascade system","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","DISCO",""

Some of the movable bridge leafs in these highway bridges were constructed in the 1960s and they are now close to the end of their intended life span. These bridge leafs were typically designed and executed with hardwood deck boards. In the initial design calculations, traﬃc loads were smaller, complex calculation by computer models did not yet exist. Therefore, some phenomena like for example fatigue and global hybrid interaction were never considered. Since some movable highway bridges are now due to be re-assessed, there is a growing need to gain knowledge on the way timber decks are functioning within the movable bridge leaf. These bridge decks have sustained all loads throughout the years without signiﬁcant damage, but we don’t know whether these timber deck boards help the main load bearing steel structure as well. Or in other words; do the timber deck boards interact with the steel girders in the current situation? In this research, the degree of hybrid interaction was measured in terms of the magnitude of the main girder deﬂection for the reference case of the Bridge across the Beneden Merwede. The main girder deﬂection for bolted connections, having a certain free slip and embedding stiﬀness, was determined by running a linear sequential secant stiﬀness analysis. This analysis approximates a physically non-linear analysis. The maximum deﬂection of the main girder was compared to the maximum main girder deﬂections for no hybrid interaction versus full hybrid interaction. The resulting global deﬂections from the Secant Stiﬀness Analysis have shown that practically no hybrid interaction can be found between the current deck and the steel structure. For retroﬁtting options, the level of hybrid interaction can be signiﬁcant. An increasing or decreasing degree of hybrid interaction did not only change the forces and moments in the steel girders, but also had a considerable eﬀect on the deck and its connections. There is a gain and a loss for every retroﬁtting option considered. Decision-making for retroﬁtting timber bridge decks should take multiple contradicting criteria into account. An optimisation could be necessary in order to take a well-advised decision.","Timber; Bridge deck; hybrid interaction; Movable bridge","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering","","51.824132, 4.705717"

Its existence negatively affects the maintainability of a system in numerous ways. In order to tackle the issues that come with it, various automated clone detection techniques have been proposed throughout the years. However, the vast majority of them operate using the entire codebase as input, resulting in redundant calculations and undesirable delays when this process is repeated for every new revision of a project. On the other hand, newer incremental techniques address this by storing intermediate information that can be reused across revisions. However, all these approaches are language-specific, utilizing language parsers to generate more sophisticated source code representations, in an attempt to detect more complex types of clones. As a result, less popular languages, for which finding or building a parser is challenging, are unfortunately not supported. <br/><br/>In this study we propose LIICD, a language-agnostic incremental clone detector, capable of detecting exact-match clones.

However, with hybrid solvers, which combine both SAT and CP, dominating recent benchmarks it is surprising that no research has been done yet to apply those machine learning approach to improve hybrid solvers.This research proposes using a machine learning technique called unsatisfiable core learning to improve the performance of the Lazy Clause Generation solver Chuffed.

These technologies create the need for management of the upcoming risks and uncertainties. Safe-by-Design is a strategy to build in safety measures in an effort to mitigate and anticipate risks in synthetic biology applications. This study aims to portray a nuanced review of the opportunities and challenges posed by Safe-by-Design through a case study on this year’s iGEM project, the application of gene and microbiome therapy principles to mitigate the issue of Desert Locust swarms. To gather an all-round perspective on the current state of synthetic biology, bacteriophage-based therapies, and Safe-by-Design, these aspects are assessed in terms of governance. Synthetic biology regulations have long ensured safe research practices, but the lack of adequate regulations for novel phage-based technologies hampers the development of this field of research. In further detail is discussed how the use of the precautionary principle guarantees biosafety but also limits the discovery of risks and uncertainties. Downstream Safe-by-Design is proposed as a method to facilitate policy-making and to tackle concerning issues such as transnational regulations and public perception of biosafety. In this report, the risks associated with the application of bacteriophages for non-therapeutic purposes are determined and multiple Safe-by-Design approaches are analyzed to mitigate these risks and uncertainties. This resulted in the collection of quorum sensing, kill switches, encapsulation, anti-CRISPRs, and auxotrophy as suitable Safe-by-Design measures for this project. Furthermore, the challenges and limitations regarding the application of Safe-by-Design are reviewed. This analysis concludes that uncertainty and a lack of knowledge of the intricate synthetic biology systems are the main constrains on Safe-by-Design for synthetic biology. Lastly, it is concluded that Safe-by-Design is a promising strategy to ensure biosafety because of its dynamic and proactive character, and recommendations are made to stimulate future progress in this area of research.","Bacteriophages; Safe-by-Design; Biosafety; Gene therapy; Microbiome Therapy; iGEM","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Life Science and Technology (LST)","",""

This research project constitutes the MSc Thesis of the writer, towards the graduation of the MSc Aerospace Engineering at Delft University of Technology (Air Transport &amp; Operations). The subject of this project lies in the area of aviation safety and quantitative risk assessment. In specific, the study deals with the safety issue of fuel planning and fuel management in airlines’ operations (Commercial Air Transport). As the air traffic growths rapidly, it is a challenge to keep the current safety levels and further improve them, achieving the EU’s vision safety target, which is less than one accident per ten million flights by 2050. Amongst the various accidents and incidents categories, this project researches the accidents and incidents related to fuel. In specific, we investigate two fuel-related events; the probability that a flight lands with less than the minimum regulated fuel amount (called FRF - Final Reserve Fuel) and the probability of fuel exhaustion. So as to analyse and assess the safety risks, we followed the steps of the TOPAZ methodology. Based on previous research on the subject, an extensive hazards list was created, as well as an agent-based risk model was developed and implemented as a Stochastic Dynamically Coloured Petri Nets (SDCPN) model. The risk model was algorithmically implemented in JAVA programming language, in the direction of conducting Monte Carlo simulations. The first event's (FRF) probabilities were estimated through regular (straightforward) Monte Carlo simulation, whilst for the second (fuel exhaustion) regular Monte Carlo proved to be insufficient. Indeed, fuel exhaustion is a rare event and, consequently, an acceleration method was needed to be implemented. The acceleration method chosen is the Interacting Particle System (IPS). Finally, through the simulations, we estimate the probabilities of these rare events for several operational scenarios. The fuel-related risks were assessed for their acceptability, eventually proving that for all scenarios the risks are either tolerable or acceptable, while also the most prominent safety bottlenecks are identified and analysed.","Risk Assessment; Aviation Safety; Aircraft Fuel; Final Reserve Fuel; Airlines; Monte Carlo; Agent-based modelling; Petri Nets; IPS; TOPAZ; SDCPN","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","In the ocean resides a large amount of plastic. This has severe environmental consequences for the oceans. To be able to clean up all this plastic the location of the plastic is needed. A lot of times plastic is cleaned up at the source, but to clean up here this location needs to be known. However, what if the start location is not known and only the end location is known. This thesis looks at the following research question: Can the method of particle filtering be used to find the start location of a plastic particle of which the end location is known?. The method of particle filtering compares the end locations of the released particles and the end location of the end particle. (The end particle is the particle of which the end location is known and we want to know the start location.) The method calculates weights on the basis of this comparison for each of the released particles. Then the weights are used to calculate a probability density function that gives the likelihood of possible start locations being the right start location of the end particle. The method is applied to the MSC Zoe case, which is a container accident, and a simplification of this case. The MSC Zoe lost in this accident hundreds of containers above the Wadden Islands in the Netherlands, in these containers were bags of plastic particles. A lot of these particles washed ashore on the Wadden Islands. However, it is not known exactly where all the containers fell overboard. So the start location of the plastic particles that washed ashore is not known. The method of particle filtering applied to the simplification showed that it can indeed be used to find the likelihood of possible start locations. However, it also showed that for some values of the variables it was possible to get multiple peaks with weights that are zero in between. This is not a desired outcome for a probability density function (pdf). So a kernel estimation is used to smooth out the pdf's. It uses the weights calculated in the method of particle filtering to estimate the pdf. This gives results that also in this way the likelihood of possible start locations can be found and now without multiple peaks. The kernel estimation was also applied to the MSC Zoe case and the results were calculated for multiple end particles. The locations that came out of this were very close to a few of the possible main locations were containers fell overboard. These possible main locations came from the international investigation into the MSC Zoe accident. A simplification of this research is that the start location is found for one specific plastic particle. For future research it could be interesting to look if the method can be adapted to find the start location of concentrations of plastic particles.","Particle Filtering; Plastic Particles; MSC Zoe; Random Walk Model; Stochastic Differential Equations; Start Location; Kernel Density Estimation","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics","",""

The growth of this industry is causing several challenges. These include a larger number of parcels delivered at service points and the CO2 emitted in the parcel delivery. Especially the last mile delivery is a CO2 intensive process. The sector is innovating to reduce their emissions, but the choices made by the consumers also have an influence on the total emitted CO2 per parcel. DHL, a domestic and international shipper, decided to take their responsibility by lowering the CO2 emitted in the transportation. They stated that all transport-related emissions need to be brought to zero by 2050. In order to create a delivery system which is safe, free of emissions and resistant to future developments in a city the current last-mile delivery system needs a critical look. A sustainable last mile delivery system that fits customer needs will be designed for 2030 to inspire DHL with a strategy for reducing their CO2 emissions in the last mile. This thesis aims to create an overview of the context DHL is operating in. In the problem analysis, this context is researched and defined. A CO2 analysis showed that delivery to a pickup point is the most environmentally friendly delivery option and besides renewing the old fleet for electric vehicles, efficiency gain can play a part in reducing CO2 emissions. In the user analysis, consumers are investigated and a customer journey is created. A target group is chosen to focus the solution on and accordingly the design statement for this project is defined: Design a parcel collecting point for high rise apartments buildings in the city centre which meets customer needs. With a traditional design approach, this design statement was solved and 4 concepts are presented. However, the presented concepts are not bold enough for the context of 2030. Another iteration in this design process is done and a different design approach showed how more value can be created for cities and citizens through the design of a new parcel locker station. This locker station is fitting customer needs and convinces important stakeholders. A plan for implementation is worked out in a roadmap, which gives a step by step approach for DHL on how the concept can be realised. The design of this Powerhouse is validated through co-creation sessions with residents, which resulted in a modular design of the Powerhouse that fits a variety of urban locations in the context of 2030.","Parcel Delivery; sustainable mobility; Sustainable Energy; Parcel Lockers; Customer-centric","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

A unique characteristic that these data encompass is the coupling between the data values and the underlying network structure on which these data are defined. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been designed as tools to extend the benefits of deep learning approaches to network data. One crucial component of GNNs is the nonlinear component, also known as the activation function. The activation function allows capturing the nonlinear relationships present in the input data. However, in the current literature, the essential data-network topology coupling is ignored in the nonlinear component of the GNN. To address this limitation, we propose in this thesis a new family of activation functions for GNNs that account for the graph structure and capture the data-network topology coupling, while also allowing for a distributed implementation. Specifically, we propose an initial diffusion of the data over the graph, prior to the local nonlinearization operation. The nonlinearization is designed in a form akin to graph convolutions. The latter leads to a graph-adaptive trainable nonlinear component of the GNN that can be implemented directly or via kernel transformations, therefore, enriching the class of functions to represent the network data. Whether in the direct or kernel form, we show the permutation equivariance property is always preserved. This ensures the output of the GNN is independent of node labeling and that the GNN exploits graph symmetries to generalize to different graphs sharing similar symmetries. Numerical experiments with distributed source localization, finite-time consensus, and distributed regression demonstrate the applicability of the proposed graph-adaptive activation functions in distributed scenarios and show improved or comparable performance to pointwise as well as state-of-the-art localized nonlinearities. Our findings also suggest the benefits of the proposed activation functions in situations where the communication resources in the network are limited.","activation functions; graph neural networks; graph signal processing; permutation equivariance","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science | Data Science","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is one of the promising near-term algorithms designed to find approximate solutions for combinatorial optimization problems. The algorithm prepares a parametrized state that is aimed to maximize the expectation value of the objective function of the problem. The circuit for QAOA consists of p layers, and it depends on 2p parameters, the determination of which can be carried out using a variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) subroutine. This is a variational approach for finding optimal parameters, where the quantum state is prepared with a quantum computer, and a classical computer is used for calculating the corresponding objective function value and performing an outer loop optimization routine in order to find optimal parameters. Earlier work on the algorithm has shown that QAOA is closely related to the Quantum Adiabatic Algorithm, which results in noticeable patterns in the optimal parameters. To this purpose, two methods, INTERP and FOURIER, were proposed to exploit this structure by Zhou et al. (2018). In this thesis, I extend upon these results by examining the effectiveness of one of their methods, the INTERP method, on the Max-Cut problem from graph theory. The performance of QAOA using this method was studied on several classes of graphs and benchmarked against the currently best-known classical algorithm Goemans-Williamson, which achieves an approximation ratio of ρ ≈ 0.878 on arbitrary graphs. The classes of graphs examined include cyclic, weighted and unweighted 3-regular, and Erdős–Rényi graphs with edge probabilities of 0.5 and 0.75 and graph sizes ranging from 4 to 16. Moreover, it was investigated if the INTERP method offers an advantage compared to random initialization of parameters and whether or not the method is polynomial in p. It was found that different graph classes lead to similar but different parameter patterns. Furthermore, the performance of QAOA using the INTERP method was dependent on the graph class considered. For the small graphs investigated it was found that QAOA outperforms Goemans-Williamson on ER-0.50, ER-0.75 and weighted 3-regular graphs from p=7 and beyond with respect to how well the expectation of the objective function approximates the optimal value, while for unweighted 3-regular graphs p=6 suffices. However, the calculation of the parameters is costly and requires a number of function evaluations that is on the order of the number of possible bipartitions of small graph with sizes n ≤ 16. Moreover, the numerical results suggested that indeed the method is polynomial in p advocating that the algorithm might be a strong alternative to Goemans-Williamson for large graph sizes, once hardware allows it.","Quantum algorithms; QAOA; Optimization; Maximum cut","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics | Applied Physics","",""

Spatial and temporal dependencies characterize these data and, therefore, conventional machine learning tools often fail to learn these joint correlations from data. On the one hand, hybrid models to learn from time-varying network data combine several specialized models able to capture these dependencies separately, thus ignoring their joint spatio-temporal interactions. On the other hand, state-of-the-art approaches for jointly learning time-varying network data do not exploit the useful prior provided by a graph-time product graph. This prior structural knowledge can aid learning and help the models improve their performance. For this reason, we propose a novel neural network architecture to learn from time-varying network data using product graphs and graph convolutions, thus exploiting this prior during learning. In particular, our architecture (i) learns the most suitable graph-time product graph to represent the time-varying network data and model the graph-time interactions; (ii) performs graph convolutions over this product graph to learn the graph-time interactions from data; (iii) employs graph-time pooling to reduce the dimensionality over layers. To the best of our knowledge, no research has yet attempted to capture spatial and temporal dependencies using graph convolutions over product graphs. Results on synthetic and real-world data show that the proposed method is useful in learning from time-varying network data for both regression and classification tasks. For classification, we cure a real-world dataset for earthquake classification and compare the proposed approach with state-of-the-art models. Results indicate that graph-aware models outperform graph-unaware models on this task. For regression, we evaluate the proposed method on two real-world temperature datasets and compare our architecture with graph-aware and graph-unaware models. Results on the smaller dataset show that linear models outperform neural-network models. On the larger dataset, we find that prior knowledge about graph-time interactions seems to be less beneficial in case of abundance of data. For the synthetic experiments, we find that (i) learning the structure of the graph-time product graph from data improves the performance compared to adopting a fixed type of product graph; (ii) learning sparser graph-time product graphs further improves the performance; (iii) the proposed graph-time pooling technique contributes to the model's generalization capabilities.","time-varying graph signals; graph convolutional neural networks; graph signal processing; product graphs","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-07-23","","","","Computer Science | Data Science and Technology","",""

(mentor); Aschenbrenner, D. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","This project is an exploration of potential applications of Conversational AI Agents (CAIA) for industrial maintenance. Specifically, it involves the scientific validation and development of a CAIA for a promising application: the automatic creation of information-rich maintenance reports by conversing with a technician while they perform industrial maintenance. The choice for this application was based on literature research, (in-situ) context analyses and a review of CAIA frameworks and design guidelines. These revealed that maintenance workers rely heavily on their own experience and intuition when solving problems but mechanisms for capturing and accessing this were non-existent. This knowledge is highly valuable and can represent a significant part of a company’s worth. Furthermore, maintenance technicians reported that the existing reporting mechanisms were a nuisance. Lastly, audits revealed that maintenance reports were frequently incomplete or of poor quality. In turn, CAIAs (Conversational AI Agents), have various affordances that make them well-suited to the context of industrial maintenance. They are (1) hands and gaze-free, (2) highly efficient (faster than writing or typing, facilitate multitasking and they provide faster access to specific information), (3) they can adapt to the skill level of the user and (4) impose a minimal cognitive load.<br/>A between-subjects experiment with 24 participants, which involved changing a bicycle inner tube, was used to test three hypotheses regarding the potential value of the application. All three hypotheses compare using a CAIA for reporting whilst performing maintenance, as opposed to writing the reports on paper afterwards. They posited that using the CAIA would result in (1) reports of higher quality (more information relevant to the understanding of the task), (2) time saving, and (3) a lower perceived workload (NASA TLX). T-tests confirmed that all three hypotheses were true. These results indicate that using a CAIA for live-reporting has a clear value proposition for the industrial maintenance domain. Critically, it demonstrated that it could facilitate the capture of valuable “expert knowledge”. Future research could explore integrating multi-modal information capture (e.g. through smart-glasses), identify additional uses for the captured data (e.g. for prescriptive maintenance or providing tips to maintenance technicians) and improve the functionality and usability of the existing application. A prototype was built using the open-source frameworks, Rasa and Mycroft, to demonstrate the technical feasibility of the functional requirements. These requirements include (1) uttering “continuers” in response to the user describing their work, (2) tracking conversational context, (3) asking for clarifications when there is a lack of mutual understanding and (4) asking for status updates when the user is silent for more than a set amount of time. The main challenges for the future development of the prototype are (1) reducing the response time of the CAIA, (2) the accuracy of the intent classifier and entity extractor and (3) improving the handling of fragmented/lengthy user input. Some of the prototype’s features rely on inflexible, hard-coded logic, therefore, future work should collect more conversational data and explore the use of machine learning algorithms.","Conversational Agents; Industry 4.0; Maintenance reporting","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","DIAMOND",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","Pneumatic cylinders provide an environment-friendly actuation means by minimizing the leakage of any harmful industrial fluids, as occurs for hydraulic actuators. Thus, pneumatic actuators require less maintenance, compared to hydraulic actuators. Moreover, for a similar weight of hydraulic actuator, the cost of a pneumatic actuation system is less. However, pneumatic actuation has not been utilized widely for industrial applications due to its highly-nonlinear nature. The compressibility property of air, friction forces in the cylinder and the switching dynamics of air flow-rate through the valve are some of the causes for this non-linearity. Therefore, these characteristics can often make the implementation of a model-dependent controller for a pneumatic system difficult. Incremental nonlinear dynamic inversion (INDI) is a control approach which uses less plant-model information, and is thus inherently robust to mismatches in the known plant-model, and also to external disturbances. INDI has recently gained popularity, especially in the aerospace-control research community, but it has never been implemented for controlling a pneumatic system, which necessitates additional research. Therefore, developing an incremental nonlinear controller for a pneumatic system is the main focus of this research article which is accomplished by utilizing a cascaded-control approach, where the inner-loop INDI tracks a given force and the outer-loop NDI is for controlling the piston-position. Moreover, realistic sensor noises have been added in the simulation and the robustness of incremental approach is demonstrated with respect to a baseline PID controller. Besides this, the external load attached to the cylinder-piston is increased by five times and also made variable, in order to show the effectiveness of the incremental control approach. Furthermore, a first-order filter is used for attenuating the sensor noise and the pneumatic valve is simulated using a first-order model. Finally, a series of recommendations is discussed at the end, for future works.","Pneumatic Actuator; Incremental Nonlinear Dynamic Inversion; INDI; Robust Control; Cascaded-Control","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-07-31","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

(mentor); Wagemaker, M. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","With the advent of the sustainable energy transition, the deployment of renewable energy sources is rapidly growing. One of the main problems for sustainable systems like wind and polar power is the fluctuating and intermittent behaviour of these sources. In order to make these systems more reliable energy storage is needed to compliment these systems. A multitude of different systems are now in development at different institutions and companies in order to fulfill this need, one of which being the Greenbattery under development at AquaBattery. The Greenbattery is an Acid Base Flow Battery (AB-FB), which is a further iteration of their original Concentration Gradient Flow Battery (CGFB or Bluebattery). The AB-FB shows promising market potential due to its low impact on the environment, relatively low cost and being easily scalable. Currently the AB-FB is on par in energy densities with systems such as Pumped Hydro Storage and Compressed Air Storage, while not being dependent on geological features or scale of size. However, the AB-FB still needs improvement as co-ion transportation degrades its potential energy density over time. In order to make this technology more viable parameters must be found in order to limit the co-ion transportation. During this thesis research is performed to identify any other potential losses, as well as testing the operational limits and behaviour of the membranes. After this the battery is subjugated to conditions simulating real life operation. During these tests the charge/discharge density, as well as depth of charge, is incrementally changed. By doing this insight is gained in the amount of co-ion transportation that is occurring and whether or not this improves the battery lifetime. The results show the battery can last up to twice as long before falling below 80 % of its original energy density. This is done by reducing the upper and lower limits of the state of charge. However, as a trade off, there is reduction in the energy density of the battery. Following this, research has been performed into the viability of resetting the system, which led to promising results. With this knowledge the operator gains insight whether he wants to put priority in higher energy density or longer lifetime, as well as when he should reset the system to keep it at maximum potential energy density. This gives flexibility to the AB-FB and hopefully help AquaBattery sell its product in the coming years.","flow battery; Co-ion; Energy; Electrochemical","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-07-28","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

(mentor); Limodio, G. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","Thin-film photovoltaic technologies are gaining momentum over the currently dominated crystalline silicon technologies. In addition to the competitive prices, flexible thin-film technology especially has the added advantage such as in building integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) due to its flexibility and light weight. HyET Solar B.V. is a company based in the Netherlands which state-of-the-art Roll to Roll (R2R) technology to produce such flexible solar cells. A temporary aluminum foil is used as substrate on to which FTO/p-i-n solar cell stack is deposited. The temporary foil is etched away, and the layers are encapsulated in low cost polymer foils. This thesis is part of the on-going FlamingoPV (Flexible Lightweight Advanced Materials In Next Generation of PV) project in collaboration between HyET Solar and TU Delft, to develop single, tandem and triple junction cells with 12, 13 and 14% efficiencies and a lifetime longer than 35 years. This thesis is inspired by the work of Tan et. al [8] where record efficiency cells were achieved on solar cells deposited on ‘Modulated Surface Textured’ (MST) glass substrates. In MST, increased light scattering is obtained by superposition of various scattering mechanisms which is achieved by introducing different textures at different interfaces and stacking them together. The requirements of the MST are two-fold: to provide efficient light trapping and to aid in the growth of high-quality layers. The aim is to introduce MST in the R2R process by developing micro sized crater-shaped features on the temporary Al foil on to which naturally nano sized V-shaped textures of FTO is deposited. The crater-shaped features are developed on the Al foil (~110 um) using wet chemical etching techniques. Various acid and alkaline based etchants are experimented. The etching parameters- concentration and temperature of the etchant and the etching time are varied to achieve the optimum recipe. These parameters should be varied such that the features have a correlation length (an estimate of how wide the feature is) 3-4 um and an aspect ratio (ratio of RMS roughness to correlation length) of 12-14%. These features are characterized using SEM and AFM to measure the aforesaid parameters and reflectance and angular intensity distribution measurements to measure its effectiveness of scattering. Alkaline based etchants (KOH and NaOH) resulted in crater-shaped features unlike acid etchants which resulted in pyramidal features. It was observed that there is an initial ‘induction period’ before which the etching started. For lower temperature, time and concentration, the induction period is longer. To ensure mechanical stability during deposition stages, the foil needs to be thicker than 70 um on lab-scale. The above-mentioned etching parameters were varied, and the best recipe was found to be 1.78M KOH at 70°C for an etching time of 2 minutes, 1.78M KOH at 60°C for 3 minutes and 1.42M NaOH at 70°C for 2.5 minutes. These samples displayed a correlation length 4-4.6 um and aspect ratios from 12-14% which is close to the targeted values and are higher than the existing texturing at HyET (‘factory baseline’) which had correlation length and aspect ratios of 500 nm and 5.7% respectively. These samples also showed higher scattering compared to the factory baseline. The nc-Si:H and a-Si:H/nc-Si:H layers deposited on to these samples resulted in dense high-quality layers. The TCO/p-i-n layers deposited also adapted the texturing pattern of the Al foil, unlike the factory baseline where the Al surface morphology was not adapted by the other layers as the features were significantly smaller. Further, to enhance the uniformity of texturing, various ‘chelating agents’ and ‘surfactants’ such as gluconic acids and glycols as well as varying the speed of etching to ensure homogenous contact of etchant with the foil was carried out. Both these techniques resulted in in an increased etch rate as well as an increase in the density of the craters on the foil. Considering the limitations of the R2R process, the best lab recipes were adapted (50°C, 1.42M NaOH, 1.8 minutes) to implement on the R2R etching machine. The resulting Al foil had higher surface morphology parameters and scattering compared to the factory baseline. The cells deposited on this texturing adapted the morphology of the Al foil. Optical simulations were done using GenPro4 where the AFM data of the textures were given as the input. The best lab samples as well as the R2R testing recipe showed larger absorption in the higher wavelengths in both nc-Si:H single junction and a-Si:H/nc-Si:H tandem cells, compared to the standard factory baseline texturing.","Thin-film silicon solar cells; Flexible solar cells; Flexible substrates; Aluminium substrate; wet etching; modulated surface texture","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-07-23","","","","Electrical Engineering | Electrical Power Engineering","Flamingo PV",""

Despite offering enough dexterity to be adapted for composite deposition, industrial manipulators are nontrivial to integrate into other applications than those originally envisioned, especially when complex curvilinear cartesian paths are desired. Further improvements in layup control and performance are necessary to induce an accurate tracking of fiber tow courses. The goals of this thesis were to a) reduce variability of layup control, b) eliminate experimental iterative steps associated with programming tow courses and c) enforce a constant laydown speed that aids consolidation quality. To achieve such objectives, a framework entitled LayLa (Laying Laminates) was developed as an offline programming tool that automatically computes the series of continuous robot motions to perform a tow course at a desired laydown speed. Experiments with LayLa were conducted for Automated Fiber Placement (AFP) using a six degrees-of-freedom KUKA manipulator, without actual deposition. From a VSL design algorithm, two fiber tow courses with a reduced turning radius were selected to be performed at a laydown speed of 0.1m/s. The overall results revealed reasonably accurate trajectory tracking of both joint and operating space variables, with errors at the end-effector position around 0.05mm and at the laydown speed of 3.2mm/s, corroborating the use of LayLa to create external commands for composite deposition.","variable stiffness; in-situ consolidation; offline programming; industrial manipulator; robot operating system","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Due to a perceived gap in the design field, both in education and practice, the aim of this project is to support designers in becoming more aware of power dynamics in their work in order to motivate them to challenge, rather than reproduce, existing inequities. As the result of a number of research activities, a framework for power literacy was developed to meet this aim. In the context of design, power literacy is the ability to be self-aware of, sensitive to and understand the impact of power in the design process, and to then act in a way that aligns outcomes with intentions. The framework focuses on the development of power literacy through the practice of reflexivity—the capacity to identify underlying social structures internalized by yourself and others around you, and to then recognize their impact on power dynamics and equity. By building these skills and making these underlying dynamics more visible, designers will be better equipped to create design processes that are socially just, decolonial and democratic. The framework includes four power literacy skills (recognize, name, understand and act) and five forms of power in the design process (privilege, access power, goal power, role power and rule power). Based on the research and the resulting framework, a design goal, target user group and a number of design requirements were set at the start of an iterative design cycle of ideating, designing and testing. Subsequently, a field guide for power literacy was designed as the final deliverable. The field guide helps designers navigate through the power literacy framework in an educational, interactive and impactful way, supporting them in the development of a number of reflexivity skills. From initial evaluations of the field guide detailed in this report, the design has been able to provoke a deeper (and at times uncomfortable) awareness of power and privilege for designers working on social and public sector projects. Moreover, it has brought about a number of ‘aha’ moments for designers, sparking a greater motivation to challenge inequities within their own design practice.","design; designers; democratic; Decolonization; social justice; power; privilege; reflexivity; equity; social design; Social innovation; action research; Design for Social Transformations; government; public innovation; civic design; participatory design; participation; urban design; Participatory City Making; design justice; liberatory design; Systems thinking; Systemic design; Systems Theory; Intersectionality; Matrix of Domination; Black Feminist Thought; Network Theory","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

Three methods are evaluated to find which one is the most appropriate when measuring the shipyard's competitiveness. To find which method is the most appropriate, the author conducted the Analytical Hierarchy Process and found that benchmarking analysis is the best method. Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) is chosen due to its versatility, cautious estimation, and non-parametric characteristics. Data Envelopment Analysis is an operation research method that uses mathematical formulation to find benchmarks among units under study. The first model uses deliveries as output, dock area and number of employees as inputs. The second model uses price/CGT and duration/CGT as inputs, and new contracts as outputs. The models investigated 20 shipyards from Japan, China, South Korea, and Vietnam. The results show that Chinese yards are very efficient when it comes to attracting new orders. However, in terms of allocating its resources, Chinese yards are very inefficient. Japanese yards are very efficient in both models. Most of the Japanese yards are frontiers. Korean yards, on the other hand, are the winner for mega-sized yards, but not in the medium-sized shipyards. Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA)'s results show the efficiency between the output and input of a system with a quantifiable value and provide a point of improvement by increasing output (for output-oriented) or decreasing input (for input-oriented).

One particularly interesting application of such devices is in solar-to-fuel conversion. In light of this, the goal of this thesis was to suggest ways to better design multijunction devices based on thin film silicon. Three main research objectives were identified.<br/>The first objective was the development of a high VOC top junction. Cells based on a-Si and a-SiOX were optimized by varying gas flows during the deposition of the intrinsic absorber layer. A maximum VOC of around 890 mV was obtained from cells based on both absorbers. Based on these results, it was possible to identify unique advantages of using either a-Si or a-SiOX as the top junction. For the second research objective, solar cells based on a-SiGe were studied. The impact of varying the bandgap profile in a-SiGe absorbers on the device performance was investigated with a set of experiments. Subsequently, a set of semi-empirical equations were motivated and fitted to the experimental data. These relations could approximately show how bandgap profiling affects device performance in a more general way. The presented approach may be used to expedite the design of a-SiGe based cells for use in different types of multijunction devices. Finally, a systematic optimization of tunnel recombination junctions (TRJ) was conducted. Experiments were done to study the impact of using different TRJs in two types of tandem devices: a-Si/a-SiGe and a-SiGe/nc-Si. Different features of the TRJ were varied separately: p-doped layer(s) used, thicknesses of the p-doped layer(s), and the n-doped layer(s) used. The best performing p-doped layers was identified among the studied combinations. For the n-layer(s), the experimental data suggested the different roles played by n-a-Si, n-nc-SiOX, and n-nc-Si in the TRJ. This observation could be used to design an optimized combination of n-layers for the TRJ. Collectively, the work done as part of each research objective aims to contribute to the better design of multijunction devices based on thin film silicon alloys.","thin film silicon; multijunction; optical simulation; tunnel recombination junction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","DISCO",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","In this report we present a model to simulate the performance and robustness of the Charge-Resonance Check (CR-Check) in the Nitrogen-Vacancy (NV) center. The CR-Check is a routine which verifies that the charge state of the NV center is NV$^-$ and that the lasers, addressing the NV center, are on resonance with the optical lines. This is done by shining a red (λ=637 nm) laser on the NV center and measuring the amount of fluorescence photons, since they are dependent on the resonance frequency being near the frequency of the laser. If these counts do not pass the threshold for success, then either a new measurement of the photons is done or the system is repumped with a green (λ=532 nm) high intensity laser if they are below the repump threshold. The most important parameters are the duration of the red laser (dt) and the spectral diffusion of the NV center (sigma), which is an intrinsic property of the NV center. The model was implemented in Python, where also Numba, a high-performance Python compiler was used. An algorithm for finding the optimal values is included, so that different implementations can be compared. Then parameter sweeps were performed to get insight on the effects of the parameters. The distribution of frequency spectrum was investigated, it follows the shape of the Generalized Normal distribution with a disturbance due to the memory parameter. We observed that the mean time till success goes up linearly with the sigma after it is higher than 80 MHz for dt. This effect can be explained by taking into account the Normal distribution which was used to determine the resonance frequency. It became clear that the N_thr_repump and N_thr_success often come as pairs, which have been shown to be linearly dependent on the rate. Also it has been observed that after a certain sigma amount the N_thr_repump and N_thr_success do not change anymore. We noticed that for fixed sigma there is a optimal value of dt. This optimal value of dt is dependent on sigma. Average number of photon counts was nearly independent of sigma and only linearly dependent on dt. This is a sign that the CR-Check can always bring the NV center sufficiently on resonance. It has been observed that when the NV center's spectral diffusion is below 40 MHz, it is significantly faster to use the CR-strategy with dt = 25 μs compared to the standard dt of 50 μs. Lastly new implementations, where p-values are used rather than the measured counts, were shown to be capable of performing a CR-Check procedure. These implementations have used either the cumulative density function (cdf) of the Poisson distribution or the t-test or the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. The test using the cdf performed very similar to the current implementation. The other two test were slower with regards to the mean time till success, as they seem to require a lower spectral diffusion than was mandated.","NV-center; NV-centre; CR-Check; Charge; Resonance; Python; Simulation","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics | Applied Physics","",""

This stimulates the shift towards data-driven predictive aircraft maintenance, which is enabled by prognostics. This study proposes a model for maintenance scheduling of a fleet of aircraft based on component Remaining-Useful-Life prognostics and a limited stock of available spares. A discrete-time, rolling horizon approach is proposed, resulting in a sequence of scheduling time windows. For each time window, the goal is to find an optimal maintenance schedule. Moreover, the scheduling model considers three stages in decreasing order of maintenance priority, from critical aircraft leading to grounded condition, to predictive alerts, to non-critical failures. The results show that a cost-efficient maintenance schedule for a large fleet of aircraft is generated with an outstanding computational performance. Moreover, the aircraft operating costs are significantly reduced in the long-run, even when considering limited spares.","Aircraft maintenance scheduling; Prognostics; Spare parts; Adaptive large neighborhood search","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2025-07-22","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

TrustChain is an academic peer-to-peer networking stack supporting SSI. It delivers passport-grade assurance by integrating with Dutch government. However, end-user control requires a programmed user agent with a human interface and protocols that enable meaningful communication with issuers and verifiers of identity data. This agent must be inter-operable with a large variety of parties and credentials. TrustChain lacks such an interface and protocols.   This thesis makes three main contributions. First, a theoretical framework is proposed for aligning notions of self-sovereignty across contexts, borders and cultures. It provides more detailed, focused and structured discourse than other work and helps consolidate design efforts. Second, a design project is done in collaboration with the Kamer van Koophandel (KVK). It focuses on `authorisation by legal entities', a class of identity problems that have no satisfactory solution yet. Third, a generic common `semantic layer' is prototyped, consisting of a smartphone based user agent and communication protocols. Its wallet-centric approach allows end-users to retrieve their data without leaving the app. The practical value of this prototype is evaluated at a construction site.  The case study shows that the Kamer van Koophandel, like other government institutions, can be a valuable data provider. However, their current legal framework and business model may restrict them. Absence of such vital institutions invites commercial parties to close the gap, threatening privacy and independence of end-users.   Finally, this work has three implications for TrustChain. First, attestation metadata must be considered confidential. Second, single-sided public revocation is required to ensure credential actuality without re-issuing. And third, non-interactive verification enables the construction of chains of untrusted issuers. This is a valuable feature as it enables individuals, not just organisations, to issue claims to others.  ","Self-Sovereign Identity; Distributed Systems; Legal Entities; Authorisation; Kamer van Koophandel","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science","",""

Additionally, a discontinuity in the displacement field needs to be applied on the skeleton curve. Since the iso-0 curve that determines the skeleton curve can be arbitrary, the displacement jump also needs to be designed for an arbitrary skeleton curve.<br/><br/>For the deterimination of the location of the skeleton curve, this thesis relies on a combination of the shrinking ball method by Ma et al. and Prim’s algorithm.

Having mapped the skeleton curve onto the mesh, the displacement jump is then modeled using the phantom node method by Hansbo and Hansbo.<br/><br/>During verification of the model, it is shown that the skeleton curve could be<br/>found for virtually any acyclical iso-0 curve. If the iso-0 curve was not acyclical, a single segment would be missing from the skeleton curve. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the phantom node method can be used to define the displacement jump on the skeleton curve. Lastly, a mesh refinement study has been performed, which compared the results of the proposed model for 5 different mesh sizes. It was found that, for the rail shear test that was used to perform the verification, the shape of the iso-0 curve can vary randomly when the mesh is refined. The load-displacement curves, however, do not show significant dependence on the mesh size.","Thcik Level Set Method; Phantom Node Method; Damage Mechanics; Skeleton Curve; Shrinking Ball Algorithm; Fibre-Reinforced Polymer","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","With 2,975 safety violations in the US alone, the lockout safety routine, one of the most important safety methods in the industry, remains unsafe. This is caused by the limited adherence of companies employees to the preset protocols. Heavy industries primarily focus on the efficiency of their processes and recognise the rising potential of smart product solutions to serve their key safety as efficiency interests. This project aims to meet the demands of the industry by the design a smart lockout use case that enhances the lockout process in terms of safety and efficiency, and that can be adopted by the heavy industry. For the company of TWTG this thesis researches the potential of this product and establishes a digital lockout use case and smart concept design to evaluate the value delivered to the industry. Through an empirical research study knowledge is gathered on the unknown user behaviour in the lockout process and corresponding lockout materials handlings and methods. This qualitative research study uses protocols reviews, user observations and field studies to provide real-life insight on the manifestation of behavioural routines for a leading industry. Consequently, expertise on lockout routines and smart product innovations in the industry is gathered through consultations with ten industry experts to gather verifiable evidence on unsafety and the potential of smart product solutions in the lockout process. This research concludes safety in the lockout process is highly dependent on the correct interpretations of the user. A false perception of safety is easily established when activities are not correctly executed. Positively, smart product solutions provide severe potential for the industry to support correct behaviour of operators and identify the life-threatening violations of the lockout procedure. Moreover, interviews with managing and external stakeholders from the industry state a marginal impact on existing industry materials and lockout routines are demanded in order to introduce smart product solutions successfully. Through a variety of use case evaluations with both managers and operators related to the lockout process, the desired level of disruption to these materials and routines is evaluated for the industry of Royal Vopak. From these insights, a smart lockout use case is established for a sizeable market. The selected smart lockout routine provides pro-active feedback on operators activities and real-time validation of a safe work environment. The ease of implementation is supported by the investigation of compatible solutions with existing materials, low battery power solutions, the LoRa network and wireless communication technologies, allowing to meet the identified context requirements and deliver a feasible product solution. An appearance model of the smart lockout product is developed to allow the industry to emphasise with the developed concept. The safety and efficiency value of the smart lockout use case is revealed through an objective evaluation with eight respondents representing the majority of directly related employees to the lockout process from three industry locations. Consequently, consultations with the deployment and innovation leaders from the industry advocate the establishment of the smart lockout routine. With this study, the company of TWTG desires to deliver a unique safety product for the global market.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

Maximizing profit relies on optimization of using resources, production capacity and available time. To reach this goal, companies are typically reliant on planning and production schedules. This problem is known as the project portfolio selection and scheduling problem (PPSSP). The PPSSP can be solved using an integer linear programming (ILP). However, solving an ILP for complex cases with a large number of variables takes a lot of time. Solving the PPSSP using a heuristic method provides a good alternative. Due to the structure, an adapted version of variable neighborhood search (VNS) is chosen as heuristic method. The adapted VNS is combined with tabu search to obtain an alternative for solving the ILP. The solution obtained with the heuristic method is represented as an activity list which is a specified order of planning tasks. The schedule which is represented by the activity list can be obtained using the serial schedule generation scheme (SGS). Serial SGS represents every optimal schedule in the non-preemptive case. When preemption is allowed, schedules might not be represented by an activity list in all cases. The overall profit of the optimal schedule is never smaller than in the non-preemptive case. Because of this, a solution is represented by a selection and an activity list from which the schedule can be obtained through using the preemptive serial SGS. The heuristic is used to obtain some results for less complex instances which are compared to the results obtained by solving the ILP. In some cases, the ILP could not solve the problem in a short time span. It turns out that the performance of the adapted VNS in combination with tabu search provides good estimates close to the real optimum.","Project portfolio optimization; Project portfolio selection and scheduling; Variable neighborhood search; Selection; Scheduling; Projects; Metaheuristics","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics","",""

(TU Delft Aerospace Engineering)","Cervone, A. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","The Micropropulsion Group of the department of Space Systems Engineering of the Delft University of Technology is developing resistojet thrusters for small satellites operating on the vapourisation of liquid water via an electric heater and its subsequent expansion via a nozzle into vacuum for the generation of thrust. As the water vapour expands in the nozzle, its pressure and temperature drop, leading it to cross the saturation limit of water and raising questions on whether the vapour will transition back to liquid in the nozzle’s divergent section. The spontaneous condensation of flowing steam in supersonic nozzles is a well-known phenomenon that results in the release of heat, in turn downgrading the nozzle’s performance and efficiency.<br/><br/>This has motivated the present numerical study to assess the likelihood of the phenomenon’s occurence inside the resistojet micronozzles. To that end, a condensation model is implented in the open-source platform OpenFOAM, by heavily modifying an existing compressible solver to account for the mild degrees of rarefaction in the nozzle, the real-gas thermodynamics of water and the phase-change phenomenon itself. The condensation is modelled as a two-step process, whereby liquid clusters first nucleate out of the vapour and then proceed to grow by gathering further vapor molecules. A baseline micronozzle case is defined as one with a 100 μm-depth nozzle with an expansion angle of 30 deg and stagnation pressure and temperature of 3 bar and 473 K. The simulations are run for three stagnation pressures (1, 3 and 5 bar), three stagnation temperatures (473, 573 and 673 K), three expander angles (15, 30, 45 degrees) and two nozzle depths (100 and 200 μm). The outputs are in each case compared to the baseline case, to extract conclusions on the effect of nozzle geometric and flow topological features on the occurence of condensation.<br/><br/>The results show that the onset of condensation is in most instances a likely scenario, but not necessarily a consequential one. The extremely fast cooling rates (10^8-10^9 K s−1) drive the vapour to unusual degrees of supersaturation (10^3 or more) before condensation occurs. When the birth of droplets eventually<br/>takes place, it does so in impulsive fashion, with large numbers of miniscule liquid clusters (radii in the order of 10^(−10) m) appearing simultaneously in mass fractions in the vicinity of 2%. Even so, the macroscopic result is typically small, with the thrust and specific impulse changing only by 1-2% at most. This holds true for the variation of all above design parameters except for the nozzle depth: it is shown that doubling the depth decreases the wall’s heat influence and leaves room for substantial condensation to occur, that degrades the thrust output by more than 5%.<br/><br/>The general conclusion to be drawn is that assessing the impact of condensation on this type of nozzles is not as straightforward as in their conventional-scale counterparts and it is difficult to note consistent trends. If it does occur, the condensation process will enter a complex interaction mechanism with the heat supplied from the walls, the viscous layers developing on these walls and the degree to which the expansion can overcome either or both. While in conventional scale nozzles the occurence of the phenomenon typically guarantees a reduction in thrust and efficiency, here there is no general tendency and the nature of the influence depends on the extent to which the release of latent heat and its by-products can match in severity the rest of the phenomena inside the micronozzles. Overall, the analysis indicated that the geometric configuration of a 100 μm-deep thruster with a 30-deg expander angle strikes a good balance in generally avoiding the occurence of substantial phase change (that would cause a ≥ 2% change in macroscopic performance metrics) and also containing other contributing effects, such as the growth of viscous layers and expansion losses. The choice of stagnation conditions is mission-dependent and no recommendation can be given, but some suggestions are provided on approximate methods to select them such that condensation is avoided.","Micronozzle; Condensation; Metastable steam/water vapour; OpenFoam; Spacecraft propulsion; Numerical simulation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering | Space Flight","",""

The widespread implementation of neural networks as controllers in the field of systems and control is however being hindered by the lack of verifiability of these controllers. One type of controller that does not lack verifiability is the correct-by-design controller. The main drawback of correct-by-design controllers is that they inherently produce large data structures in order to store their control rules. In this work, a novel methodology to synthesize correct-by-design neural network controllers is presented in order to alleviate these issues. This methodology combines reinforcement learning techniques and abstraction based correct-by-design control verification techniques in order to synthesize neural network controllers that are correct-by-design. The procedure does so by alternating between a controller training routine and a controller verification routine in a system abstraction framework. This framework ensures that numerical training and verification results in a controller with formal guarantees applicable to real systems. Using the proposed methodology, neural network controllers are synthesized and verified in order to prove that the methodology works. In addition to this, the resulting correct-by-design neural network controllers are compared to conventional correct-by-design controllers in order to judge their performance and data requirements. This comparison also includes alternative structures used to store these different controllers. Based on this comparison, a conclusion is drawn regarding when to use which type of controller. The proposed methodology is implemented into a correct-by-design neural network synthesis framework called COSYNNC. This framework is intended as a basis for further research into correct-by-design neural network control and is publicly available.","Correct-by-Design; Neural Network; Controller Design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

The lattergives ranging data two orders of magnitude more accurate compared to theclassical K-Band ranging data <i>(Dahl C et al. 2016). </i>This gives a newopportunity for analyzing KBR noise by defining KBR noise as the differencebetween the KBR and LRI ranging data. In order to get a realization of KBR noise, the KBR andLRI epochs should be aligned and outliers have to be removed. An interpolation on the LRI data to make the LRI epochsaligned with the KBR epochs did not give sufficient results. Therefore only theoverlapping epochs were used as input for the next step of outlier detection, atotal of 2,250,000 epochs. The outlier detection method starts by taking theabsolute difference between the KBR and LRI range-rates. The largestdifferences were investigated where the original range-rate was compared to anestimation of the true value. This ‘true’ value is found by the use of a thirddegree polynomial function through the six range-rates that lie next to thesuspected outlier. The outlier detection method removes LRI range-rates thatdiffer more than 2.0*10<sup>-8</sup> m/s from the estimated true value and KBRrange-rates that differ more than 7.7*10<sup>-7</sup> m/s. 3764 LRI epochs and362 KBR epochs were labelled as outliers. After the outlier detection a histogram was made for theKBR range-rate noise. It was found that in order to get a normal distributionof KBR range-rate noise, the interval had to be in the range of &lt;-3*10<sup>-7</sup> m/s, 3*10<sup>-7</sup>m/s&gt;. 59,000 still fell out of this noise range. 54,000 of these pointsformed 10 major clusters together where a subtraction of the KBR and LRIrange-rates did not give a realization of noise, but a trend similar to theoriginal signal and are therefore likely related to a clocking error. These54,000 points were therefore also removed from the dataset. To the remaining KBR range-rate noise values a thresholdof 3  was applied, removing an additional 4972 noisevalues that were larger than 4.03*10<sup>-7</sup> m/s. Finally , an estimation of the PSD of the KBR range-ratenoise  was made and compared to an oldPSD image of December 2008 of  the GRACEmission. The PSD plot of this project shows three peaks between 10<sup>-4</sup>Hz and 10<sup>-3</sup> Hz. These peaks are not present in the PSD plot found inliterature of the GRACE mission. Except from the second and the third peak, thePSD values of the KBR range-rate noise of this project were lower, up to twoorders of magnitude in the lower frequency range (around 10<sup>-4</sup> Hz)and one order of magnitude in the higher frequency range (around 10<sup>-1</sup>Hz).","","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Of this, 70% is covered by heavy-maintenance. Reduction of these costs and improving efficiency could, therefore, be significant for an airline. A possible solution is the optimization of the long-term schedule of heavy-maintenance checks. Current approaches are found to be reliant on manual input and operator experience. Next to that, revisions to the initial schedule are made continuously due to the inherently stochastic nature of aircraft maintenance through non-routine maintenance. Taking this uncertainty into account could offer more robust schedules, saving cost and improve quality of service. <br/><br/>This study proposes a genetic algorithm that can generate robust and efficient C-check schedules for a fleet of heterogeneous aircraft. Uncertainty in check duration and utilization are taken into account by assessing multiple scenarios through min-max optimization. This study is the first to address the long-term scheduling of heavy-maintenance checks while taking uncertainty into account. The proposed genetic algorithm finds robust and efficient C-check schedules for a case study of a European airline for a fleet of over 40 aircraft in under 30 minutes. The total number of C-checks is reduced by 7% while increasing utilization by 4.4%. This could lead to a reduction of direct annual maintenance costs of $122.5K - $612.5K and an additional $1.8M - $7.1M in annual revenue due to the increased availability of aircraft.

Generally, the connection between different users in the network is established through preference, and this phenomenon leads to a power-law behaviour of the degree sequence of the random graph. Other than studying this feature, the thesis also focuses on the decay of degree sequence itself and the height of the random graph models. Researches are conducted on four kinds of random graph models, including two fully studied modes as benchmarks, the Preferential Attachment Model (PAM) and Random Recursive Tree (RRT), and another common model, the Bianconi-Barabási Model (BBM). Previous researches show that the degree sequence of PAM follows a power-law with coefficient -3, and the degree sequence of RRT has an exponential tail in contrast. In BBM, each node is assigned a fitness value from a certain distribution, once the node is generated, and researches show that the degree sequence of BBM follows a power-law with coefficient depending on the fitness distribution but close to the one of PAM. Then, the thesis aims to find a random graph model with fitness interpolating between RRT and PAM. Thus, a new Recursive Fitness Model (RFM) is developed by using a recursive formula to generate fitness values instead of the fixed distribution in BBM. By simulation we conjecture that the degree sequences of RFMs still follow a power-law with coefficient close to that of PAM. The simulation further shows an interesting phenomenon: a special linear height increment of a particular RFM, the Plus-1 model, appears, in contrast to other RFM models. Finally, the thesis invents a new Preferential Attachment Inverse Model (PAMinv) by using the expectation of degree sequence of PAM. Degree sequence of PAMinv shows a different behaviour from PAM and RRT, and it could be the tool to interpolate RRT from PAM.","Random Graph; Time-Varying Fitness; Power-Law; Height; Degree Sequence","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics","",""

The Keukenhof, one of the biggest tourist attractors in the region, already welcomed 1.5 million visitors in the eight week during flowering season in 2019, which is almost twice the visitor count of 10 years ago. Because of this growth, the local population’s day-to-day businesses become increasingly disrupted. The pressure of these disruptions is mostly felt in three sub-contexts: •The flower fields; tourists that trample flower bulbs while making pictures •Regional accessibility; tourists causing traffic congestions which burdens the local population that has to travel to or from Lisse •Retail shops in Lisse; reduced accessibility causing regional shoppers to avoid Lisse, leading to less revenue. The choice has been made to merely focus on the last of these three sub-contexts. Although tourism was found to be a burden for the retail shops of Lisse, quantitative and qualitative research showed not only temporary inaccessibility through tourism threatens the centre of Lisse, but also online shopping, attractiveness of city centres and vacant stores pose a threat. At this moment, the strengths of the centre of Lisse as a regional shopping area can no longer outweigh the pressure that comes with these threats. This causes the centre to slowly degrade, manifesting itself in an increasingly amount of vacancies and shop owners that do not feel motivated to collaborate and invest in the centre any more. To counter this effect of degradation, a transition should to be made where Lisse is no longer regarded as just a regional shopping area, but as a village centre that is rich with experiences and where it pays off to do effort for the centre by taking ownership. The value of ‘the centre’ stands or falls by the amount of stakeholders that feel that they are part of the whole and have a responsibility to that whole. If this is present, ‘the centre’ will provide experiences to the customers and a positive business climate to the shop owners. In this way, the whole becomes more than the sum of the individual parts. For implementation, it is important to put focus on the symbiotic relationship that exists between individual stakeholders and ‘the centre’. For the short term, the benefits of investing in experiences can be demonstrated through pilots in individual stores. Eventually, the long term goal is providing a richness in collaboratively made experiences that bind the whole of the centre together, making current threats insignificant while providing positive spill over effects for the local entrepreneurs and customers. Stakeholders that have a purpose in governing the region such as HLTsamen should take a role in facilitating and orchestrating the transition.","System design; Tourism; Holism; Organizational design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

A simulation model provides the means to gain proper insight in the effect of future expansions. Macomi, a company specialized in simulation and optimisation, has been working on a simulation model to aid the Port of Antwerp in their port planning. One important issue in this simulation model is how the berth allocation of vessels is handled. Berth allocation is the problem of assigning vessels a time and location at the quay wall where the vessel can be loaded and unloaded. In this thesis, the aim is to develop decision models for both the preliminary berth planning and the real-time recovery of this plan during simulation. For the first part, a cyclic baseline berth allocation plan is created which takes into account the tidal dependencies vessels have when entering the port of Antwerp. This preliminary berth plan is used as a basis for the simulation model as the arrival times are based on this plan. However, during the simulation disruptions might occur; vessels can arrive earlier or later or take longer to load and unload. To deal with these disruptions a real-time disruption management decision model is proposed which aims to solve all disruptions while staying as close to the theoretical berth plan as possible. Using the proposed models, several experiments have been conducted regarding the influence of uncertainty, occupation and robustness on the quality of the solutions that the decision models found. Regarding occupancy rates, results show that a tipping point exists where the recovery model has more difficulty to find a good solution. Results also show that when the expected occupation of a terminal is higher, adding robustness has more effect and is therefore more important. The decision models presented in this thesis have been implemented in the Macomi port simulation model and have been demonstrated to the Port of Antwerp. Both parties have expressed their satisfaction with the models.","Berth planning; Disruption management; Simulation; Port planning; Constraint Programming","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","51.268665592,4.335331992"

Armour units on a breakwater slope under wave loading can sometimes start to move back and forth, this phenomenon is known as rocking. Rocking can lead to significant impacts between armour units, which can result in breakage. This is especially important for single layer armour units, like the Xbloc. The development of the smart Xbloc makes it possible to measure accelerations and angular velocity with a stand alone sensors at a sampling frequency of around 100 Hz. The current literature does not provide the spatial distribution of the number of impacts and the impact velocities due to rocking. Furthermore, only limited knowledge is available on the distribution in time. The research aim of this thesis is: Determining the spatial and temporal distribution of the number of moving armour units, the number of impacts and the impact velocity of rocking armour units. To achieve this aim a physical scale model was set up and model tests have been performed with 10 smart Xbloc units to measure rocking. The collected data, analysis and results provide a unique look into the behaviour of single layer armour units. The results can be used to validate rocking models and provide valuable statistical information on the number of impacts and the impact velocities. <br/><br","Breakwater; Armour layer; Rocking; Concrete armour unit; Single layer armour unit; Smart Xbloc; Impact velocity; Physical model tests; Coastal Engineering","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-07-31","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering | Coastal Engineering","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) turbulence models are in widespread use in the commercial application of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), but lack the capability to accurately compute unsteady flows and aeroacoustics due to its implied averaging of turbulent effects. In order to compute these kinds of flows, Large Eddy Simulation (LES) may be applied. However, this comes with a large computational cost. Hybrid RANS/LES aims to combine the turbulence-resolving aspects of LES, while attempting to approach the computational efficiency of RANS by applying a RANS turbulence model near walls. The X-LES turbulence model developed at NLR has been successfully applied to massively separated flows. A future application of the method is to obtain aeroacoustic predictions of turbulent noise near sharp edges and wakes. In anticipation of this goal, this work aims to assess the accuracy of the X-LES model when it resolves part of the near-wall turbulent spectrum of Turbulent Channel Flow (TCF).<br/><br/>Multiple TCF simulations have been performed at a variety of friction Reynolds numbers. It was found that the presence of resolved turbulent stress in the RANS-domain is not detrimental to the velocity profile in this domain, as it still conforms to the laws governing the viscous sublayer and the log-layer. The presence of so-called superstreaks causes a flow system where streamwise ribbons of high eddy viscosity, originating from within the RANS-domain, are transported away from the wall into the LES-domain. Here they contribute to the lack of development of turbulent stress, leading to an undesirable increase in velocity in the log-layer known as the Log-Layer Mismatch (LLM). Applying stochastic forcing led to a reduction in the LLM and broke up the large streamwise regions of eddy viscosity. It remains unclear in which proportion the disappearance of the high eddy-viscosity regions, and the stochastic forcing itself, contributed to the reduction in LLM.<br/><br/>An attempt has been made in formulating a consistent hybrid RANS/LES framework in which the effects of turbulence on the mean and fluctuating flow are governed by separate turbulence models throughout the entire domain. The initial results are presented in this report, which may be used to further develop the model in the future.","hybrid RANS/LES; turbulent channel flow; X-LES; CLES; turbulence modeling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

This is done by first doing a neural network comparison and then doing a case study. In the neural network comparison, a look is taken into which of the neural networks that are capable of working with point clouds is best suited for our experiments in the indoor scene, based on the training speed, accuracy, ease of use concerning training on external datasets and setting up the network and space efficiency. After the comparison, we chose to continue with the PointCNN network during the case study. The case study is performed on data the NS (Nederlandse Spoorwegen) provided to us and all test results we got from our experiments can be visualized using the web application we developed along with this project. The purpose of the case study is to add extra value to the indoor LiDAR point cloud the NS has captured from Amersfoort Station by using deep learning to automatically classify assets present in their data. The value is in purposes, such as asset management, where the data does not need possibly hundreds of man-hours to be labelled. This saves a lot of time and also money each time a scan is made.

With recorded speeds over 5 Gb/s it has shown to be an alternative for radio communication. In the CubeSat market this technology is new, underdeveloped, and could lead to new missions that were not possible before. As such, TNO and Hyperion joined forces to create the CubeCAT LCT (Laser Communication Terminal). The core part of this LCT is the high-speed digital data path, which was not implemented. This thesis discusses the design, implementation, and verification of the high-speed data path of the CubeCAT LCT (Laser Communication Terminal) that has a targeted speed of 100 Mb/s, with a future upgrade path to 1 Gb/s. The CubeCAT module consists of multiple modules, of which the DMU (Data Management Unit) hosts the high-speed data path. As the DMU was not implemented, a design for the DMU is proposed in this thesis. For this design multiple architectures, interconnects, and components where considered. The proposed design is based on an Hyperion CP400.85 microprocessor connected to a Lattice ECP5-5G FPGA, together with extra external memory and external storage. Then, an implementation of the high-speed data path was made that is based on a QSPI link between the microprocessor and the FPGA. This implementation is based on streaming the data from the microprocessor to the FPGA, in which the data is encoded according to the TNO3k FEC (Forward Error Correction) scheme. After encoding, the data is outputted as an LVDS signal to the laser output. The implementation of the high-speed data path was verified by simulation and on a development setup. This was done by first verifying all submodules, with focus on the QSPI link and the TNO3k encoder, and then as a whole system. All submodule tests were successful, with a note to the verification of the QSPI link. It was found that the development setup was limited to a SPI frequency of 41.50 MHz due to signal integrity issues. During the system test it was found that the there was a lack of LVDS test material. As such the LVDS output was replaced by a UART output. With this output the whole system has been validated for a QSPI link speed of 119.2 Mb/s and an internal FPGA speed of 3.2 Gb/s. The system, with LVDS output, is estimated to consume 1 watts of power. With the validation of the whole system, the high-speed data path of the CubeCAT LCT has been implemented. The design of the DMU allows for a later, 1 Gb/s upgrade of the high-speed data path.","CubeCAT; Cubesats; Hyperion; Hyperion Technologies; Laser Communication; Laser Communication Terminal; LCT","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-07-20","","","","Computer Engineering","CubeCAT",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","While multiprocessor platforms have been widely adopted by the embedded systems industry in the past couple of years, there are still fundamental challenges about their timing predictability for applications with real-time timing constraints. The common-off-the-shelf (COTS) multiprocessor platforms typically use complex hardware components, interconnects and multi-level caches which are designed to deliver higher average-case performance. However, these features negatively impact the worst-case performance as they increase the interference of tasks on shared hardware resources. One effective software-based solution to counteract these issues is to use the non-preemptive execution model. <br/><br/>Despite its positive impact on timing predictability, non-preemptive execution causes a potential blocking problem which can decrease the ability to guarantee all timing constraints of the system. It is also known that scheduling non-preemptive periodic tasks on multiprocessor platforms is an NP-hard problem. <br/><br/>In this thesis, we focus on non-preemptive execution of sequential as well as parallel real-time tasks upon multiprocessor platforms and investigate, extend, and improve the state of the art on global, partitioned, and semi-partitioned scheduling approaches for the problem. <br/><br/>We provide the first necessary test for partition-ability, i.e., a test that can determine whether a given task set cannot be partitioned on a given number of cores regardless of the partitioning policy. This test allows us to quantify the pessimism of the existing partitioning heuristics as well as obtain the limits of partitioned scheduling. <br/>We further introduce the first non-work-conserving global scheduling policy and show that despite the fact that it improves over the existing global scheduling policies, it is not as effective as the partitioned scheduling strategies. <br/><br/>We extend a sustainable scheduling algorithm designed for uni-processor platforms to multiprocessor ones to improve the performance of partitioning heuristics. A sustainable scheduling algorithm does not have timing anomalies and hence it is easier to analyze and can have better scheduling results. <br/><br/>Furthermore, we introduce the first semi-partitioned non-preemptive scheduling solution for multiprocessor platforms. Our solution is able to schedule some of the task sets for which it is impossible to find a partitioning solution. Finally, we compare the overheads and memory consumption of various scheduling approaches (including ours) on a bare-metal multiprocessor hardware platform, i.e., a 4 processor Raspberry Pi board. We show that our sustainable scheduler has a very low overhead while it out-performs other solutions in terms of schedulability.","real-time systems; non-preemptive scheduling; multiprocessor platforms; embedded systems","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Embedded Systems","",""

Their long-term survival is continuously endangered. A strong brand positioning is important to secure survival and deeply connect with customers. However, changes in consumer needs and expectations call for new ways to stay relevant and stay ahead of these changes. At the same time, it is important to look ahead and make informed predictions regarding the direction society and customers are moving. Thus, future studies - more specifically strategic foresight - has gained growing attention within both academia and industry. With the amount of data collected today, novel ways of analysing and predicting customer behaviour and trends are emerging. Artificial intelligence (AI) has recently gotten a new breakthrough due to its ability to gather, monitor and analyse these vast amounts of data. The intersection between the three - branding, strategic foresight and AI - holds great potential to create and maintain a strong brand positioning. Therefore, this thesis aims to investigate this main question; how can artificial intelligence and strategic foresight be applied to the improvement and/or maintenance a future-proof brand positioning? This project is done in collaboration with Deloitte Digital who consults a number of well-established brands. Thus, this project is relevant for Deloitte Digital as it can future-proof the brands of their clients. Through a literature review and eight expert interviews regarding the three areas and the relations between them it is discovered that there is potential in further focusing more specifically on (1) the emotional connection between brand and user, (2) the Generic Foresight Process and (3) natural language processing (NLP). These insights are translated into design requirements and a design vision which then guide the creation of a solution. The solution proposed is called MindMatch and falls into the category of social listening tools. The digital platform contains three main USPs; (1) an analysis of the match between brand identity and brand image, (2) sentiment analysis and emotion recognition and (3) digital co-creation connected to the analysis insights. An interactive prototype of both a marketing website and the digital platform was developed and iterated upon based on feedback from Deloitte colleagues. When finalized, the solution was validated through interviews with three Deloitte colleagues and one crown jewel client, DSM. MindMatch embodies the answer to the main question of this thesis. By applying NLP techniques (including topic modeling, sentiment analysis and emotion recognition) and the Generic Foresight Process (including the six steps of the process, weak signal detection and forecasting) to social media data, the solution assists Deloitte Digital in improving and/or maintaining the emotional connection and co-created meaning between brand and user - resulting in a future-proof brand positioning.","Artificial intelligence; foresight; Digital platform; social listening; branding","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

Taking into account time constraints and customer expectations, the scope of the project is narrowed down to KPN in-home services and products in 2C market.<br/>Literature review on circular economy and sustainability and green marketing is further conducted, which further proves the value that sustainability communication can bring to the company. The existing research of KPN shows that customer’s perception of sustainability is relatively low when experiencing KPN services and products. To better understand the context and the reason behind this research result, desk research and customer journey analysis are conducted. Various findings lead to that the main problem in the current situation is sustainable information asymmetry, and the design should focus on installation, daily use and maintenance phases where customers have the highest opportunities to reach sustainability information.<br/>This thesis adopts the 10 principles for providing product sustainability information from United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and International Trade Centre (ITC) as the design guideline. These principles are further developed to detailed design requirements and desires, which lay a foundation for the latter ideation.

Many cities are therefore equipped with networks of microphones, which are merely used to identify loud areas and less loud areas. Additional information, other than the sound levels, is not derived. It is unknown which sound events are responsible for the recorded sound levels. This thesis aims to cluster sound events in an unlabelled audio recording, to distinguish which sound sources cause the recorded sound levels. In order to cluster sound events, audio features are required. As it is unknown which (possibly large number of) sound events to expect, many audio features are extracted from the data. This results in high-dimensional data which introduces several challenges for clustering. To overcome these challenges, it is assumed that relevant features are dependent on the sound event. Each sound event cluster is searched in a different subset of the full-dimensional space. This method, called subspace clustering, is evaluated. In order to evaluate a subspace clustering algorithm, evaluation techniques are used. As evaluation on an unlabelled dataset is difficult, a labelled audio dataset is used, namely the ESC-10 dataset. For unlabelled datasets, an internal metric is proposed. Still, evaluation of a subspace clustering algorithm on this labelled dataset is not straightforward. Because (subspace) clusters are not assigned to any class, a label search is derived. This label search assigns the best subspace clusters to a label. This enables a comparison between a subspace clustering algorithm and a full-dimensional base model, i.e. k-means clustering. The subspace clustering algorithm, SUBCLU, indicates considerable performance improvements when compared to k-means on the labelled ESC-10 dataset. The overall accuracy of k-means is 33% while SUBCLU achieves an accuracy of 47% on this labelled dataset. Although there are some limitations of the implemented methodology, this research demonstrates that subspace clustering is beneficial for clustering (unknown) sound events in audio recordings.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Signals and Systems","",""

Especially when risk is involved, trust will create a bridge between you and an opportunity and will enable that crossover. I believe design can form such a bridge, and in this project I explored how design can create trust.<br/>This project was done in the context of a connected farmer platform for Rabobank. The bank wants to move from a service provider to a connector between clients. This will change the relationships they have and new relationships will be established. These new types of relationships are unknown and trust does not exist here. Rabobank, like many other cooperations, used to be able to produce and control trust themselves. Now, this way of creating trust no longer works, and people are looking for other ways to create trust relationships. Technology enables a new type of trust in which people place trust in one-another in stead of a service provider. This creates an interesting opportunity for Rabobank as a connector, because it enables the establishment of trust between clients with Rabobank as facilitator of that trust relationship.<br/>Two main strategies for creating trust can be defined. Contextual trust relies on contextual properties to inform a person about their trustworthiness. Contextual trust is confirmed by control mechanisms such as formal agreements and structural controls. Very different from that we can define intrinsic trust. This type of trust is centred around one’s intrinsic motivations and is communicated through observable actions that eventually accumulate into a reputation.<br/>The strategies enable different types of relationships and collaboration structures. Contextual trust works best in situations with hierarchy and authority. Intrinsic trust is very different and enables self-coordination though autonomy. These strategies are very different but also go well together. Most relationships leverage both strategies to create trust. But also it is important to be cautious with them because contextual trust mechanisms can potentially hurt the foster of intrinsic trust. A historical analysis shows how Rabobank has always been able to work from a trust relationship. The way the bank works has changed immensely and these types same relationships are no longer an option. The bank is still very allied to the agricultural sector and a new dynamic between bank and sector has to be found in order to work together. Rabobank is a cooperative bank, and even though not many people really understands what this really means it tuned out to be an interesting asset. Especially because farmers are so very used to work in these types of structures. A cooperative structure enables new ways of working, and enables a new structure in which Rabobank has to define its role. All findings and insights were synthesised into a design proposal (Figure 2) for a data sharing platform for Rabobank. The setup of the platform also highlights Rabobanks role (Figure 1), with its many trust consequences. The visualised platform highlights many trust mechanisms and shows what they would look like in this context.","Trust; Design; Data sharing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(mentor); Dokter, Laura (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","Many non-profit organizations (NPO’s) in the Netherlands have lost a large amount of donors over the last years. This thesis explores the use of behavioural influence design, applied in an online solution, in order to improve donor engagement for the well-known NPO WWF. The thesis focuses at creating long-term engagement with donors in the age class between 18 and 35. People in this target group want to be flexible when it comes to making donations, want their own impact to be specific and tangible and rather take action themselves, in a personal and individual manner, when it comes to environmental goals. Furthermore, this is an age group that is very active online, especially on social media, which is interesting for the online solution space. As WWF-NL wants to create a society-wide movement, showing people that there are more ways to contribute to their mission for a sustainable society, beyond donating (like adjusting sustainable behaviour or investing time), it seemed an interesting opportunity to improve engagement with this group and connect with them on the common interest of contributing beyond donations. With the help of literature and successful exemplar cases on engagement, guidelines haven been created for improving the different levels of engagement (cognitive, emotional and behavioural) in relation to the target group. Also, the field of behavioural economics, which assumes the irrational thinking and decision making processes of human beings, has been explored to see how behavioural influence design could be applied to improve the (different levels of) engagement. The conclusion of this exploration is that behavioural influence design should not (just) be implemented in the smaller details of online expressions; it should be part of the broader strategy, where it is used to improve individual (in this case sustainable) behaviour of the target group. Again, with exemplar cases and literature, guidelines for improving engagement with the help of behavioural influence have been created. The guidelines and insights for improving engagement with the help of design for behavioural influence are combined in a strategy. Its details, that make it a WWF-specific approach, are shown in a roadmap, with supporting directional concepts. To successfully reach the vision of this roadmap, all parts of the horizon must be followed carefully. The remainder of the project focused on horizon 2 of the roadmap, to provide WWF with a specific and tangible project to pick up and carry on after my graduation; the development of the WWFxYOU app. The goal of this app was to create a personalized relationship between the target group and WWF, based on the motivation to create impact (on an individual level). A first test, with 10 in-depth interviews with participants from the target group, had promising results; the app was described as a personal, approachable, (inter)active and involving way of contributing to WWF and seemed more attractive than current (WWF) donorships. A redesign is made based on the interviews. For further validation, I recommended to improve and test this design with a larger participant sample, before actual implementation.","Behaviour change; Design Strategy; Consumer Behaviour; Engagement; Nudge; App Design; Consumer research","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

Zeolites have been confirmed as a selective adsorbent and can effectively remove target OMPs. To achieve sustainable application of adsorbents, regeneration of zeolites is required. <br/>The objective of this study was to investigate the regeneration performance of dried OMP-loaded granular zeolites through gaseous ozonation process, and the regeneration feasibility in long-term adsorption-regeneration processes. Three types of zeolites (MOR, MFI and BEA) were applied for target OMP (benzotriazole, methyl-benzotriazole, carbamazepine, diclofenac hydrochlorothiazide, sulfamethoxazole, metoprolol, sotalol, trimethoprim, propranolol, and clarithromycin) removal. A sequential process coupling zeolite adsorption and oxidation by gaseous ozone was established in batch mode. To assess the ozone effect on OMP degradation and zeolite itself, ozone bubbling tests and adsorption isotherm experiments were executed as pre-experiments. The relative adsorption capacity obtained through regeneration was used to demonstrate regeneration performance. Operating conditions, adsorption duration and regeneration duration were determined and applied. Ultimately the regeneration performance in long-term adsorption-regeneration processes was investigated.<br/>Experimental results showed that all target OMPs were not resistant to ozonation in the water phase. Gaseous ozone was showed no influence on the adsorption capacities of zeolite granules. 120 hours and 500 mgL-1 zeolite granules were applied in OMP-loading adsorption experiments. Zeolites always showed high adsorption capacities of metoprolol, trimethoprim and sotalol, which regeneration effect was not evidenced. 60 minutes of ozonation was effective and sufficient for regenerating low and medium adsorption OMPs, except for carbamazepine. The regeneration of carbamazepine probably required a longer regeneration duration. In four cycles of adsorption-regeneration experiments, regeneration of sulfamethoxazole could be achieved after four rounds of ozonation. Regarding carbamazepine, diclofenac, benzotriazole, and methyl-benzotriazole, the regeneration performance were significantly reduced after the first cycle of regeneration. The ozonation duration is supposed to be extended above 60 min in long-term regeneration experiments. Intermediates were potentially responsible for the reduction of regeneration performance in ozonation and adsorption processes. Particularly, the effect of intermediates accumulation might be the main factor that hampered the regeneration performance of low and medium adsorption OMPs in long-term operation.","zeolite; regeneration; ozone-based oxidation; organic micropollutant; adsorption","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Environmental Engineering","",""

Growing threats like sea-level rise and intensity of storms require solutions to be adaptable and resilient. Nature-based solutions have shown to tackle these challenges while providing social, environmental, and economic benefits. The role of vegetation in coastal protection is increasingly recognized. Aquatic vegetation reduces erosion, storm surge, and incoming wave height. <br/><br/>Large-scale modeling of waves with spectral wave models such as SWAN is indispensable for the design of coastal structures and the assessment of flood risk. Wave dissipation due to vegetation can be modeled in SWAN as increased bottom friction (implicit modeling) or as an additional dissipation function (explicit modeling). The second assumes that vegetation can be represented as rigid cylinders or plates (canopies) with different properties. While some studies concluded that implicit modeling reproduces the spectral evolution of field measurements more closely, others concluded the opposite.<br/><br/>Within the BE-SAFE project, field campaigns measured the spectral energy distribution over salt marshes in the Dutch Wadden Sea during several winter storms. The vegetated foreshore in front of the coastal dike got submerged over 2 m of water during high tide and storm surge. The measurements deployed wave gauges over the study transect, which was defined between the pioneer zone marsh edge and the near-dike location (300 m behind the salt marsh). Calibrating the implicit and explicit models in SWAN brought the modeled total wave energy decay closer to the measurement. Nevertheless, the spectral shape, which describes the energy distribution over frequencies, still showed significant and not yet understood differences near the dike.<br/><br/>A methodology was executed to investigate the mechanisms that could reduce the spectral mismatch between the SWAN wave model and measurements over vegetation. First, the literature highlighted possible mechanisms that could be incorporated for this purpose. Next, a new frequency-distributed explicit dissipation model of Jacobsen et al. (2019) was implemented in SWAN and compared to implicit and explicit models using lab and field measurements.<br/><br/>The results showed that the newly implemented model accurately captures the physics and the change of spectral shapes for all experimentally tested wave conditions and submergences. In contrast, the existing implicit and explicit dissipation models in SWAN reproduce the spectral evolution only under certain circumstances. In the validation and comparison to the field measurements with a much larger water depth than the vegetation height, the model of Jacobsen et al. (2019) correctly captured the vegetation's physical representation and the dissipation on the wind-sea frequencies. Nevertheless, the amount of energy on low frequencies was largely underpredicted by all frequency-distributed models. Therefore, the model of Jacobsen et al. (2019) was modified to include flexibility in a frequency-dependent reduction factor that reproduced the energy decay of the measurements in all frequency regions. Other mechanisms that could be responsible for the mismatch before and over the marsh are the redistribution of energy by non-linear triad interactions, generation of infra-gravity waves, and near-shore currents caused by horizontal variations on the vegetation properties.<br/><br/>The present research provides the range of conditions in which the tested explicit and implicit energy dissipation functions in SWAN are able to simulate the spectral evolution over rigid canopies and flexible salt-marsh vegetation. A new version of SWAN includes a new frequency-distributed explicit model that performed more accurately than existing models for rigid canopies. The physical insights from the research contributed to developing additional versions of SWAN, which performed closely to the energy distribution of the measurements over deeply submerged and flexible salt marsh vegetation species. <br/><br/>References:<br/>Jacobsen, McFall, Van der A (2019).

By developing economical detailing, with design guidance based on Eurocodes, the market share for new buildings, renovation and for additional storeys on existing buildings will increase. Within the INNO3DJOINTS project an innovative plug-and-play joint is developed, allowing for modularity and industrialization for low to mid-rise buildings. This solution will increase the competitiveness and sustainability of steel construction. The goal of this MSc thesis is to characterize the behaviour of the plug-and-play joint using the component test; T-plug bending around weak axis. The strength, stiffness and deformation capacity following the EC3-1-8 component method approach are investigated.<br/><br/>An experiment is designed for testing in the Stevin-II laboratory at Delft University of Technology. This work includes both the design of the set of test specimens and laboratory set-up. Secondly, a numerical study is performed to predict the experimental results and an extending parametric study is performed to derive new components, using the finite element software of ABAQUS. The influence of geometrical properties; thickness ratio (reverse channel vs. T-plug web), use of stiffeners, use of tubular sections and length of the T-plug web, is studied for a steel grade S355. The numerical study is validated for three configurations using the component test; T-plug in tension, provided by the INNO3DJOINTS project. As the parametric study is based on an elasto-plastic material model, these numerical results are directly used to derive new analytical expressions/models and characterize new components and component interactions for design verification. The numerical study resulted in the identification of seven active components for the plug-and-play joint, consisting of basic EC3-1-8 components and tubular components from the CIDECT report 16F: Component method for tubular joints. In addition, two new components are introduced namely, the reverse channel in bending and T-plug in bending. Based on a total of 127 unique joint configurations, new analytical expressions are derived to characterize the behaviour of the new components for resistance and stiffness. The component interaction is established by proposing a physical spring model and a component model suitable for Eurocode implementation. This results in the characterization of the joint behaviour for the experimental configuration C-SHS200 with a 7.5% deviation on the resistance and a 20.5% deviation on the stiffness compared to the numerical result. The accuracy of the joint stiffness can be improved if the component stiffness derivation also includes non-governing configurations and a wider range of parameters is studied, such as the position of the bolt holes along the net-section and the use of tubular section. The results, derivations and the physical spring model contribute to the INNO3DJOINTS project and could be used for implementation in the software tool, to be developed by the French Institute CTICM. Besides, the Eurocode aligned component model is recommended for practical use in design standards, but further research should be performed on the verification of the rotational stiffness on the joint level.","Steel Joints; Plug-and-Play Joints; Steel Structure; Bending; Numerical Analysis; Component Method","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering","INNO3DJOINTS",""

(mentor); Verburg, R.M. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","In an ever more interconnected and integrated world, supply chains are undergoing continuous radical redesigns triggering in turn transfers of products and technologies between suppliers across the globe. This multi-year, cross-functional process, referred to as product technology transfer is determinant for the success or failure of a supply chain redesign and involves three stakeholders: the focal company, the sending site and the receiving site. The focal company is the initiator and leader of the process and owns the products to be transferred. The sending site is the current manufacturer, knowledgeable about products, technologies and processes. Finally, the receiving site is the future manufacturer of the object of the transfer. The product technology transfer successful completion depends on the outcome of three subsequent phases: pre-transfer, implementation and launch. The first one includes the processes for knowledge exchange and supplier selection. The sending site shares with the focal company the knowledge on the products in the scope of the transfer. Moreover, the focal company selects the receiving site among a set of candidate suppliers and distributes to this new manufacturing plant the acquired knowledge. During the second phase, the receiving site implements the transfer in a process supported by the focal company. Finally, in the third phase, the receiving site ramps-up the production and starts distributing the products to the market: the transfer is complete. This thesis project intent is to deliver a manual aimed at supporting practitioners in handling the pre-transfer phase of product technology transfers. The manual tackles the procedures for both knowledge exchange and supplier selection, the two intertwined groups of activities which precede the implementation of the transfer. Overall, the recommendations, guidelines and tools provided answer the following research question: “How can companies effectively design the pre-transfer of a portfolio of products and their technologies?” The manual has been developed through participation in several product technology transfers within a single company at different stages in their lifecycle. Crucial have been observations, brainstorming sessions, workshops, and prototypes development and testing. The early stages of this thesis project have focused on the situation analysis, including the processes of ideation, objectives discovery, stakeholder analysis and requirements identification. Subsequently, the process entered the design phase, which has been divided into three steps: conceptual design, preliminary design and detailed design. Throughout, the approach has changed from descriptive to prescriptive and from simplified to elaborated. Finally, the manual has been validated. It has been discovered that knowledge exchange is exceptionally challenging because the market for knowledge is imperfect. Indeed, knowledge is partly tacit and often perceived as complex and new. Furthermore, organisational, physical, cultural and normative distances between the parties involved in the transfer pose a real challenge to an adequate knowledge flow, especially for international transfers. Acknowledging these factors, the manual provides recommendations to improve the effectiveness of the knowledge exchange. Practitioners need to focus on experience, expertise and absorptive capacity when designing the team for the product technology transfer project. Furthermore, they ought to maximise the quality of the multi-party interactions which occur throughout the process by leveraging on communication, cooperation and coordination. Enhancing these relational levers requires considering both direct and indirect forms of interconnections. The former group includes online and face to face meetings, training and workshops. Indirect interconnection refers instead to the shared platforms over which knowledge flows between sites in the form of documentation. These platforms should be user-friendly, easily accessible, and logically organised, reducing redundancies and ensuring comprehensiveness. They should also be easy to maintain and standardise to be re-used in new projects. When thought as a process, supplier selection is the procedure through which a company contacts several short-listed suppliers, ask them to prepare a bid for the object of the transfer, analyse and negotiate the proposals, and finally select the best candidate. The process involves both commercial and technical functions, the latter providing fundamental inputs throughout the procedures. It has been discovered that these inputs form a dense network of interconnections between knowledge exchange and supplier selection to the point that the two processes need to evolve together. In this context, this thesis project delivers a comprehensive tool and recommendations to structure the supplier selection process, by focusing on the factors which have proven to be most important: standardisation, automation, maintainability, time- reductions, resiliency, complexity management and cross-functional cooperation. This project contributes to the literature in several ways. Firstly, by addressing in a single study both knowledge exchange and supplier selection, it brought light to the impacts interconnections and dependencies between the two processes have on a product technology transfer. Secondly, this study enriches the body of literature on knowledge exchange: researches on the topic have mostly concerned early-lifecycle technologies transfers from universities to the industry. In contrast, this study addresses exchanges of knowledge for mature products and technologies between suppliers (the sending site and the receiving site), initiated and led by the company owning them (the focal company). Thirdly, studies on supplier selection procedures are scarce and mostly concern transfers of software. This study contributes to the topic by developing a management tool for transfers of product and technologies. This tool satisfies a uniquely wide range of requirements including some related to cross-functionality, an aspect of supplier selection procedures which has been largely neglected so far. In terms of practical contributions, this thesis project addresses the lack of a structured and re-usable approach to handle the pre-transfer processes. Particularly, the manual has been designed to cope well with large-sized transfers of different nature, while still performing at its best in small-scaled ones. Moreover, practitioners are provided with greater visibility on the range of dynamics and interconnections occurring during a product technology transfer. Developed in the context of the pharmaceutical industry, this thesis project is a first attempt at framing into a unified picture the processes of knowledge exchange and supplier selection, by recognising their complementary nature. The manual provides tools, recommendations and guidelines on the pre-transfer that go beyond the boundaries of this sector. On the one hand, practitioners can and are encouraged to apply the manual to industries different from the pharmaceutical. On the other, researchers are invited to enrich it by re-validating, refining and enhancing it in different contexts.","knowledge exchange; supply networks; Supply Chain Management; knowledge management framework; Technology management","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

These complexes are able to sequester a transposon, localize a genomic target specified by a CRISPR RNA (crRNA), and integrate the transposon near the targeted site; thereby bypassing homology directed repair. In this study we aimed at developing a screening method using a CRISPR- associated transposase known as CAST, to detect integration events based on the disruption of lacZ. During the development, we found that CAST is unable to integrate a cargo in this highly active gene, most likely due to RNA polymerase-mediated dislodgment of the complex, and physical impediment for transposition proteins to reach the target DNA.","CRISPR-Cas; Transposase; Transposon","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Sciences | Nanobiology","",""

Achieving nearly zero energy buildings is a major goal for the near future. The design of an integrated electrical and thermal system can substantially help to reach such objective. The façade is the biggest area of a building and could be utilised to convert incident solar energy to electrical and thermal energy. In previous work (2019), the combination of building integrated PV modules with solar chimney on a façade was investigated to study its energetic performance. One of the main findings was that using the thermal energy from the photovoltaic modules on the air inside the cavity of the chimney is not possible due to its low quality of heat. It was concluded that the utilization of heat could be better by using auxiliary systems, like photovoltaic thermal systems for water heating. The aim of this work is to create a computational model to calculate the thermal and electrical performance of PV thermal (PV/T) modules combined with a solar chimney. Two new designs for better heat utilization where considered and compared. The first design is for the PV modules to be installed at the front of the solar chimney with fins (Fins design) and the second design is to couple the PV modules installed on the wall inside the solar chimney with water pipe system (Water pipe design). These designs are also compared with the same configurations but without the thermal systems (No fins &amp; No water pipes designs). In addition, two new strategies are introduced to improve the performance of the model. The first strategy is the optimization of the solar chimney openings with respect of time for the highest power generation. The second strategy is the variation of the water mass flow with respect to time for highest water-thermal energy and optimum cooling of the PV cells. The model was developed in MATLAB and it is based on 2D finite difference transient implicit method. To reduce the computational time, the density of the nodes varies in respect of temperature gradient. In addition, secondary models were created to increase the accuracy and sensibility of the model such as water tank and water pump models. The models were studied for a building in Delft, Netherlands, and the scale of the chosen system is 10m2. It is concluded that Water pipes design provides the overall best energetic performance mainly because of the high water-thermal energy with yearly energy efficiency of 64.3%. However, the best electrical performance is observed from the Fins design and the best air-thermal performance from the No water pipes design.","Solar chimney; PV/T systems; Thermal modelling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-08-31","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

This thesis aims firstly to quantify WWR in interest rate swaps (IRSs) using a copula model, where a copula is used to couple the PD implied by credit default swap (CDS) spreads and the 10 year swap rates. Specific attention is given to choosing and fitting a copula. For datasets obtained from periods of regular economic conditions and periods of financial crisis, the t copula is found to be the best fit. In general, negative dependence between the log-returns of the implied PDs and the log-returns of the swap rates is observed, especially in the tails of high PD log-returns and low swap rate log-returns during regular periods. This means that the general demand for loans is lower during a worsening economy. During crisis periods however, the dependence is weaker than in regular periods; implying that loans are in higher demand in these times, e.g. because companies need loans to survive.<br/> The second purpose of this thesis is the introduction of a novel product aimed at hedging WWR in IRSs. This product, named an IRS partial insurance contract (IPI), introduces an upper bound to the credit losses on an IRS. If this bound is exceeded, the amount by which the losses exceed the bound is paid out by the IPI seller to the IPI buyer. An analytical expression for the no-arbitrage price of an IPI is obtained, using a copula model for WWR. This expression shows that an IPI can be replicated by a portfolio of swaptions and CDSs.","Wrong-way risk; Copulas; Interest rate swaps; Derivatives","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics","",""

As reverberation chambers strive to have high electric field uniformityto meet field uniformity standards, high electric fields, having the property of being naturallymore uniform, are out of the scope of interest. Additionally high frequencies require more computational memory and CPU time.The model is made using a finite element method based modelling software called Comsol Multiphysics. The modelled reverberation chamber consisting of an antenna, a reflectiveshielded chamber and a Z-fold mode-stirrer is gradually build up. This means that first ananalysis of only the antennas will be made, thereafter the antennas will be put into a reflec-tive shielded chamber environment and finally the antennas are put into a reflective shieldedchamber environment with a z-fold mode stirrer. Furthermore, an extra situation will be considered in which a dielectric object will be added to a shielded chamber environment excited by an antenna without mode stirrer. The effect of an added dielectric object will be studied because of physical interest and completeness and not as added intermediate step to build a reverberation chamber environment. As all situations have similar difficulties in modelling and measuring, the gradual development of the reverberation chamber will allow for the best error analysis of the model. The model replicates the setup of a real reverberation chamber located at Comtest, Zoeterwoude. The reliability and accuracy of the model is studied by comparing the modelled electric field to the measured one. It was found that all models showed a good resemblance between simulated and measured electric fields above 60 MHz except the most complex reverberation chamber model. The simulated field uniformity expressed as standard deviationis twice as high as measurements suggest. The model can therefore only be used as worst-case scenario prediction for the field uniformity. Two kinds of antennas are used during the modelling and measuring phase, a 3104c biconical antenna used in the frequency range 25-200 MHz and the 3146a log-periodic dipole array antenna in the frequency range 200-1000 MHz. The electromagnetic radiation pattern in the far field domain was modelled and corresponded to the expected omni-directional and directional field pattern respectively. Next the antennas were placed in a highly reflective shielded chamber with dimensions (4.05 m×2.55 m×2.925 m). By taking data in specific slices from the model and comparing these to the measurements at the same points it was concluded that the model does not ac-curately predict the electric fields below 60 MHz. Above 60 MHz the model does predict the general electric field pattern in the chamber. It however does not predict local maxima or minima of the electric field.The same comparison was done for the situation in which a dielectric object was added to the setup. The dielectric object was chosen to be a container filled with water (0.27 m×0.565 m×0.269 m). This container is placed in the formerly empty shielded chamber to change the inner electric field. Water was used due to its favourable properties for reflectivity. The same behaviour of the model was observed with this added dielectric object. Finally the electric field in the reverberation chamber at Comtest (5.03 m×3.97 m×2.85 m) was modelled and solved using a GMRES algorithm with geometric multigrid preconditioning.The preconditioning in the GMRES allows for faster convergence. The field uniformity wascomputed for both the model and the measurements as outlined by IEC 61000-4-21. This wasdone for 4 and 12 stirrer rotation positions. Both showed that the model had a less uniform field compared to the Comtest reverberation chamber. The Comtest reverberation chamber complied with the electromagnetic compatibility requirements for measurements using 12 stirrer positions whereas the model did not. However the 4 stirrer position model, which made use of perfect electric conductor boundary conditions, showed a maximum of 13% increase in field uniformity when steel walls were used instead. To show a glimpse of an innovation that put the Delft University of Technology on the map, the shifted laplacian preconditioner is briefly discussed. As an intermediate step in solving a problem with little to no damping, a complex preconditioning matrix is used. It is shown that for an increasing imaginary shift in the Helmholtz problem, expressed as an increasing electrical conductivity σ, the number of iterations needed to reach a relative tolerance smaller than 0.01 decreases. At last, the effect of a shifted laplacian contribution to a multigrid preconditioning on the convergence speed is studied for an non-damped pressure acoustic Helmholtz problem. It is shown that the added contribution slows convergence in a simple geometry, while a more complex geometry cannot be solved without this contribution.","","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics | Applied Physics","",""

(TU Delft Civil Engineering and Geosciences)","van der Meer, F.P. (mentor); Dekker, R. (mentor); Pavlovic, M. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","Crack growth is an important failure mechanism in many engineering materials. Numerical models for crack growth have been developed within the framework of damage mechanics. All these models aim for the same goal, obtaining accurate results for crack growth under various loading conditions. Many damage models are based upon the cohesive crack approach. However, level set based models provide advantages compared to the cohesive crack models with regard to fatigue analysis. An alternative method to the existing thick level set (TLS) method was proposed, the interfacial thick level set (ITLS) model. The use of interface elements made the model more suitable to simulate several failure processes. In this thesis it is demonstrated that this method suffers from a dependency on the initial interfacial stiffness for the global response of a system by conducting a parameter study under quasi-static loading conditions. This parameter study proves that for a varying value of the initial interfacial stiffness parameter K the global response varies as well. This gives motivation to conduct further research on the removal of the initial interfacial stiffness from the current ITLS model. Two methods are developed to overcome the initial interfacial stiffness dependency. The first method assumes that the initial interfacial stiffness dependency is caused by the current formulation of the constitutive<br/>law of the interface. A new expression for the interfacial stiffness is adapted after which all constitutive relations are updated. The new method shows a<br/>perfect agreement with the current ITLS model, which validates the method as an accurate alternative. Compared to the current ITLS model, method 1 allows for the control of the initial stiffness of the undamaged part of the interface by changing the lower bound damage without affecting the global response. However, when executing simulations for a varying initial interfacial stiffness K the same problem as for the current ITLS is observed. It can be concluded that in a way this method removes the dependency on the initial interfacial stiffness but the initial interfacial stiffness parameter K should then remain constant. Furthermore, the calibration process is not simplified compared to the current ITLS model. For this reason method 1 is rejected as the final solution to the problem and a second method is proposed. The second method assumes a direct relation between the damage parameter c1 and the initial interfacial stiffness parameter K. This damage parameter is responsible for the steepness of the damage profile. The results from the parameter study showed that an increase of one of these parameters results in opposite behaviour for the initial stiffness of the global response. The leading hypothesis becomes that an increase in the stiffness parameter K can be neutralized by an increase in the damage parameter c1. Proportionality between both parameters is assumed. By trial and error the proportionality is found to be one to one. When using this proportionality condition, simulations with different values for the initial interfacial stiffness showed a perfect agreement for the load-displacement and the crack growth responses. Moreover, the proportionality condition is accurate for both a linear elastic (LE) material and an elastic-plastic (EP) material. The proportionality condition is proven by elaborating the interfacial stiffness over the damaged zone. This elaboration is done both numerically and analytically and proves that there is a one to one proportionality between c1 and K, which validates the replacement of c1 by a constant c multiplied with K. Lastly, the method should be compared to a response obtained through a different type of analysis. The method is compared with the solution of an analytical analysis resulting in a very good agreement for both a LE and an EP material. Therefore, method 2 can be approved as a solution to the initial interfacial stiffness dependency problem.","FEM; Damage mechanics; ITLS model; Fatigue; Crack growth; Fracture mechanics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","Classical aerodynamic wind tunnel tests are performed with stiff or rigid wind tunnel models. Over the years wing structures have become more flexible, and with the rise of non-conventional designs, such as strut-braced wings featuring high aspect ratios, even more flexible designs have risen. To capture the aerodynamic performance of these concepts under varying load conditions, resulting in different flight shapes, a static aeroelastically scaled wind tunnel model is required. The thesis research objective is to structurally design a static-aeroelastically scaled wind tunnel test model using optimization routines to find the optimal scaled aeroelastic characteristics representing the reference wing in wind tunnel test conditions while incorporating the safety constraints. Use cases included in the research are both an unconventional high aspect ratio strut-braced wing as well as a highly flexible cantilever wing. <br/><br/>To obtain aeroelastic and aerodynamic similarity, the aerodynamic similarity parameters should be the same and the elastic properties of the structure should adhere to static-aeroelastic scaling laws, which were found to solely depend on the length and pressure ratios. For finding a structure that has those elastic properties, design optimization is needed. After length scaling for the wind tunnel, little room for structural elements is left, especially in the slender strut-braced wing concept. For this reason, a composite shell with solid foam is used, as composites allow control over the directional stiffness. However, the discrete nature of composites, consisting of various layers with each a variable ply direction, complicates the optimization. To overcome this complication, lamination parameters are used to make the design space continuous, allowing the use of gradient-based solvers. An optimization framework was developed to optimize the lamination parameter space including a finite element solver in combination with scaled aeroelastic loads. The design variables considered in the optimization are the lamination parameters and the thicknesses of the laminate with the root mean square of the difference in deformation as objective. After optimizing in the lamination parameter space, the stacking sequence is retrieved using an open-source tool, OptiBless. <br/><br/>The results showed that the design space of the unconventional strut-braced wing configuration is highly non-convex which results in finding local minimum solutions. For a cantilever wing, the optimization is much more robust, as the optimization yields comparable results for multiple starting points which can be considered as the global optimum. The optimization framework developed was able to design a static aeroelastically scaled wind tunnel model, consistently resulting in a representative match in terms of deformation with the full-scale design for the cantilever wing. For the strut-braced wing, a representative match can also be found but these results were inconsistent. The optimization framework proved to be successful to optimize composite designs for cantilever wings. For non-conventional designs, this method is less powerful as using a great number of starting values is required, diminishing the computational benefit of using a gradient-based solver, and other strategies could be considered that may yield better results.","Aeroelasticity; Scaling; Composite Optimization; Wind tunnel testing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

The initial brief from the client side was an interest in the hearing aid market and how Cambridge Audio can enter this industry. The project follows the double diamond approach, starting with an extensive research surrounding the initial brief. The context research revealed certain opportunities in the market and ways for Cambridge Audio to take advantage of these opportunities.The time taken by an average consumer to start using hearing aid from the first moment of hearing loss is more than 4 years and there are a number of reasons behind this delay. The access to hearing aids is traditionally difficult in major markets - barriers being time, money and stigma. Consumer research revealed some major themes of friction in their interaction with the hearing care industry:1. Hearing aids were not up to the mark in noisy environments2. Consumers were not empowered with shared decision making and learning to control the aid.3. Hearing care is designed for the elderly population with outdated design &amp; medical approach.The research also revealed the true cost of hearing aids vs the inflated retail price charged by audiologists. These findings coupled with other trends redefined the problem statement to “Develop an easily accessible hearing care solution for the modern, technology oriented and price conscious netizens experiencing mild to moderately high hearing loss, which guarantees high consumer satisfaction at an affordable price and gives consumers the joy of enjoying their life to the full again.”The design is a reimagined hearing care service with an online presence at an affordable price point where accompanying hearing aids are designed to be ‘consumer electronics’ of the 21st century with modern features. This is one of the first ever internet based hearing care provider in the UK. In the US, the differentiating factor from other ‘online’ hearing aid companies is the focus on ‘personalized care’ instead of generic hearing aid along with cost advantage. It brings the quality of hearing aids in the consumer electronics segment and brings the feature set of true wireless earphones to the hearing care realm.The brand is also designed with a focus on three main qualities: High Consumer Satisfaction, Low access barrier (time, information, cost) and positioning CA Assist closer to consumer electronics as a brand and product. A quick and early validation with consumers verify strong interest in this service and has helped iron out the rough edges of the service. The report also includes examples of mar- keting material and an early website / landing page manifestation.","Innovation Strategy; Design; service design; marketing; Product launch","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-07-17","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

However, PtG currently lacks the technical adaptability to match the intermittency of these sources caused by daily and seasonal weather patterns, and suffers from a low turndown ratio (TDR) as a consequence.<br/><br/>Zero Emission Fuels (ZEF) B.V. aim to adapt this process to create an autonomous, dynamically operated solar panel add-on known as a micro-plant that will produce methanol from CO2 and H2O in the atmosphere. In doing so, the company looks to extend the TDR, but requires the micro-plant and by extension, its AWE unit to operate in wider partial load ranges, in which lower current densities dominate. These cause a rise in gas crossover within the electrolyser, creating impure and potentially flammable H2-O2 mixtures in the outlet that hinder the functionality of the micro-plant. Specifically within the AWE unit, the risk of oxygen crossover has been qualitatively identified as a likely safety hazard. Therefore, the focus of this thesis was set on studying the feasible development of a prototype (gas scavenger) that can remove trace O2 within the techno-economic scope of ZEF’s micro-plant and electrolyser.<br/><br/>To determine a viable method that meets ZEF’s constraints on cost, size, weight and efficiency, industry techniques were studied that either purify hydrogen gas streams or destructively remove flammable H2-O2 mixtures. Based on a subsequent numerical estimation on each method’s limiting factors, a local combustion process in the form of a micro-combustor was identified to be the most suitable method.<br/><br/>To quantitatively estimate the safety risk crossover poses, two models were developed: a non-dimensional model to analyse how 50 bar pressure influences crossover during operation, and a two-dimensional, transient diffusion model to analyse the extent of trace O2 contamination overnight. Results indicate that to mitigate dangerous impurity levels, a gas scavenger needs to be implemented: (a) above a 0.1% difference in pressure between electrolyser half cells during operation, and (b) upon start-up to remove overnight gas accumulation that may not pose an immediate severe risk at 0.079 mol% contamination relative to amount of stored hydrogen, but has the potential to build-up on a monthly timescale.<br/><br/>Finally, the feasibility of the micro-combustor was preliminarily characterised at 50 bar and 80 ⁰C through flame simulations. The variability in low amounts of trace oxygen content show that the mixture is normally non-flammable. Further studies on geometry design and control strategies of the micro-combustor must consider how to achieve optimal ignition conditions, determined to be at richer fuel mixtures between 휙 = 1.03−1.40, and how to contain the flame within a well-defined region. Initial suggestions include using a small volume to induce ignition and relying on wall effects to promote flame quenching.<br","alkaline electrolysis; high-pressure electrolysis; hydrogen combustion; gas crossover; diffusion; power-to-x","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-07-17","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","Zero Emission Fuels B.V.",""

Moreover, infrastructure projects in densely populated areas, such as The Netherlands, suffer from increased complexity due to interdependencies of infrastructures which impact performance of projects (NGinfra, 2017, pp.1-3; Hertogh et al., 2018). Infrastructure operators are limited to handle such complex dependencies individually, as they need to collaborate closely with other asset owners in the entire life cycle of projects, especially in the design phase, to execute the projects successfully and add value to their infrastructures.In this light, inter-organizational collaboration (IOC) and multi-actor perspectives are driving growing attention among management scholars and practitioners to understand the complex nature of collaborative networks (Keast &amp; Hampton, 2007; Keung &amp; Shen, 2013; Dietrich et al, 2010; Storm, 2018). Currently, literature on IOC has many different approaches; however, its dominant focus has been within a framework of ‘problem owner’ – ‘problem solver’ relationship or an ‘owner-to-contractor’ perspective. This research project is conducted from an ‘owner-to-owner’ perspective or a horizontal collaboration perspective. The objective of this research is to investigate the required criteria to assess levels of horizontal collaboration between infrastructure owners in the design phase of projects by identifying appropriate frameworks in literature that focuses on social relationships and interdependencies, such as collaborative network and resource dependency theories. The expected result of this research study is to deliver an Inter-organizational Collaboration Assessment Tool (ICAT) to assess their levels of horizontal collaboration. The research is guided by the following research question: How can integrated collaboration between infrastructure owners be assessed on infrastructure projects? The research project will be examined through the lens of exploratory case study. The results reveal that asset managers need the knowledge of new soft mechanisms of social and cultural collaboration to deal with the increased complexity and dependencies of their infrastructure projects. Clients need to pay attention to their collaborative capacity at three different levels: individual, relational and organizational capacity to improve project performance.","inter-organizational collaboration, collaborative assessment tool, interconnected infrastructures, collaborative networks, horizontal collaboration; collaborative assessment tool; interconnected infrastructures; horizontal collaboration","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-02-17","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","Using data streams to support the integrated design of interconnecting infrastructures",""

With DTSM customers arrive over time and place orders. They get presented with a set of time slots and the customer picks the time slot in which he wants the goods to be delivered to his home. A DTSM system creates a time slot offer for the customers based on the current delivery schedule, which is a solution to a Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP). Each accepted customer is added to this delivery schedule. This delivery schedule gets periodically optimized by an optimization algorithm. During this optimization, new customers may arrive and receive time slots based on the non-optimized schedule, which causes a discontinuity in the system. In this thesis, five different procedures have been created that deal with this problem. The impact of the different procedures is analyzed by simulating the DTSM system and comparing the final delivery schedules. Solving the problem by leaving out the optimization or insertion step of the DTSM system is outperformed by all procedures. Procedures that barely make use of the optimized schedule accept the least number of customers. The procedure that delays customers, which makes it similar to the theoretical setting, accepts the most customers, but this comes at the cost of poor customer service.

We apply the policy within the popular open-source solver SCIP. Empirical results on four MIP datasets indicate that our node selection policy leads to solutions more quickly than the state-of-the-art in the literature, but not as quickly as the state-of-practice SCIP node selector. While we do not beat the highly-optimised SCIP baseline in terms of solving time on exact solutions, our approximation-based policies have a consistently better optimality gap than all baselines if the accuracy of the predictive model adds value to prediction. Further, the results also indicate that, when a time limit is applied, our approximation method finds better solutions than all baselines in the majority of problems tested.","mixed integer programming; node selection; machine learning; approximate pruning; imitation learning; SCIP","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This phenomenon is known as the Von Neumann bottleneck. Modern computer architectures utilize for example hierarchical memory architectures and pre-fetching schemes to alleviate the Von Neumann bottleneck.

(graduation committee); Ruijven, Edwin (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","In this paper the suitability of compressed hydrogen gas storage in salt caverns is analysed. The presence of microbial sulfate reducing bacteria create a contamination risk of H2S inside the cavern. Key cavern parameters that influence the production of H2S are highlighted by a chemical model. The model uses empirical data provided by Vattenfall, in order to predict what would happen inside an actual cavern. By doing so, it can be understood what cavern conditions are suitable for the storage of hydrogen. An analysis is done on the above ground process of a salt cavern storage plant to determine what extra separation steps are required to reach ISO limitations for hydrogen gas. The research is done by answering the following research questions: What are key cavern conditions that influence the suitability of hydrogen storage in salt caverns and for what purpose can the storage plant be implemented? The sub-research objectives are formulated as follows: 1. What are the potential process risks when storing hydrogen in salt caverns? 2. Are there substantial risks of contamination with subsurface hydrogen storage? What are the defining variables that contribute to said contamination? 3. How do these impurities build up when the salt cavern is used? 4. Is the equipment currently used in the gas storage facility in Epe useable for hydrogen gas storage? What changes should be made to the current storage process? When analysing future utilisation demands of hydrogen, one of the primary applications is energy con- version by fuel cells. There are severe limitations set by the International Organization for Standardization on the maximum amount of H2S in hydrogen gas used by fuel cells. This paper uses a chemical model based on PHREEQC to predict the chemical reactions in the cavern. In order to get close to actual results, the model input is constructed following empirical data of an existing salt cavern. With the chemical model different cases can be constructed each highlighting an important cavern constraint. What are the positive and negative forces on the production of H2S in salt caverns and what could be theoretically done to prevent H2S contamination? Primary aspects that positively contribute to H2S production, when the cavern is modelled as a batch reactor, sorted by significance are: • Bacterial growth and reduction rate • Brine volume and sulfate concentration. • Brine pH and ionic strength. • Cavern pressure and temperature. • Fe2+ and Fe3+ concentration. The chemical model only predicts what will happen in the cavern when there is no gas coming in or out, like a batch reactor. For this reason a dynamic model is constructed which predicts H2S outflow in the gas when applying different demand-cases to the cavern. The model results showed that with applying a maximum use case, which fluctuates between the maximum pressure and minimum pressure, there is still a minimum H2S output that is higher then the allowed limits. A demand curve is simulated where the cavern is used to power a hydrogen gas-turbine to profit from seasonal energy price changes. In this demand curve the cavern produces significantly less and less often, giving time for the H2S to build up. In two years, the H2S production reaches levels above the allowable limits set for hydrogen gas turbines. A gas process facility is required to eliminate H2S contamination, in order to size such a facility it was modelled in Aspen Hysys. The model is validated by using data from literature. After analyses of resulting process equipment and gas streams, the absorber tower’s efficiency is most dependant on its temperature its pressure and the absorbent flow rate. The water concentration is above ISO levels when withdrawn from the cavern. So to follow these limitations, an additional dehydration step is required. In conclusion the process is capable of accurately separating the H2S to below ISO limits. The process works using 6% of the potential chemical energy of hydrogen. The process is unable to purify the water concentrations. As a result of this research some conclusions can be made. When using salt caverns for long term hy- drogen storage can be a significant risk of H2S contamination as a result of microbial sulfate reduction. For the reference case the H2S concentrations reach above the levels set for fuel cell use and concentrations will increase in significance when utilisation of the cavern is decreased. For fuel cell application, a separation pro- cess based on MDEA gas sweetening can be used to get the hydrogen up to the demanded H2S purity. But a more economical solution would involve extensive testing of the cavern soil for any microbial activity. If there are no sulfate reducing bacteria there will be no problem. Other pre-process steps could involve increasing the pH of the brine in the cavern to avoid H2S production. As well as increasing the iron concentration in the brine.","Hydrogen; Storage; Salt cavern; sulfate reduction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Building integrated Photovoltaics (BIPV) have the potential to eventually contribute to 50%-70% of the total energy demand. However, one of the main barriers that hinder the acceptance of solar energy systems as an integrated part in the buildings’ envelope is the limited aesthetics. The common black and blue panels with visible cells usually cause incompatibility with the outer appearance of architectural structures. Consequently, the combination of BIPV technology with colored PV modules will provide solutions to architects and stakeholders who are often skeptical on embed PV systems in buildings attributable to their appearance. To overcome this barrier, different techniques have been developed to provide color to photovoltaic modules. One of the most promising technologies are optical filters. These devices selectively reflect light via interference effects, thus providing the possibility of changing the color appearance of a module. Light reflection, however, reduces the current generated by the solar cells, but also, reduces thermalization losses that negatively impact the cell performance by increasing its operational temperature. In this thesis, a spectrally resolved thermal model in MATLAB has been developed to fully assess what is the real impact of different optic filters under real operational conditions in terms of temperature, efficiency and energy yield. The model considers the angular dependence of optic filter’s on PV modules on both appearance and performance for installations on a façade, roof and free mounted PV (BAPV). In addition, the optimum optic filter thicknesses for ten main colors has been determined based on maximum energy yield.<br/>The model has been validated for three consecutive days and the simulated results for colored modules and module without optic filter were proved to be very close to the corresponding measured values; deviation of 1.5 degrees of simulation models have been obtained during the temperature peak of the modules. The simulation results show that the performance of the optic filters changes depending on the location, installation layout and the incident irradiance. More specifically, temperature drop of 9 degrees has been observed on roof installations from colored modules compared to the corresponding standard module. In addition, the implementation of air gap between the module and the roof has been verified to decrease up to 20 degrees the working temperature and significantly increase the overall energy yield for both colored and standard modules. Nevertheless, in terms of yearly energy yield (kWh/m2), from the tested colors the relative decrease with respect to the standard module was found approximately 16% observed from the most lossy colors.","Colored Photovoltaic; Optic Filters; Building integrated Photovoltaic; Spectrally resolved thermal model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-08-31","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

In order to stay relevant, Port of Rotterdam (PoR) should invest in developing new port infrastructure; digital connections that facilitate data exchange between logistic chain stakeholders. A strategic digital opportunity was found for PoR, design a platform that is focused on container data, which contributes to the competitive position of the port of Rotterdam and the business model of PoR. The thesis explores the design of the platform Cadex, a data platform that facilitates cargo data exchange between data suppliers, e.g. terminals and data demanders, shippers. Cadex offers shippers real-time data about their containers that enables shippers to act upon containers that deviate from the planned schedule. By making cargo data easy accessible it could save shippers significant costs that come with transport, the deprecation of their goods, the management of their logistics and their inventory. Especially in time sensitive trade, like fresh goods or factory parts this data is valuable. In addition, it could also contribute to a lower carbon footprint of shipments. The platform enables users to get data directly from the data owners (data supplies) like sea-port terminals and hinterland terminals and can therefore be labeled as reliable data. The data suppliers benefit from the revenue model the platform offers for their data and they are allowed to set their own asking price for this data, furthermore they benefit from the data they receive about their clients. PoR would directly benefit from the data exchange by charging a percentage of the price. In addition, PoR receives historical data about its clients, which improves their knowledge about the clients they serve and could be input for improvements in the port of Rotterdam. Moreover, a better customer service is offered to shippers that make use of the port of Rotterdam. The new port infrastructure Cadex offers, could improve the score of the port Rotterdam on the selection criteria and therefore, contribute to a higher competitive position. Developing this new port infrastructure is a long-term investment since the connections hold value. Once built, the infrastructure can be reused by other parties or other digital purposes with some adjustments. This makes PoR a relevant party in the digital transition. Without this new port infrastructure, PoR is more likely to be bypassed by other competing players who will reap the benefits of the digital transformation in sea-ports.","Data platform; Port of Rotterdam; Port of Rotterdam Authority; Strategic Design; Digitalization; Brand Archetypes; Design for trust; Port Competition","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

This improvement of consistency diminishes when using time series longer than 40 years. We find indications of a break-point in trends in the period 1978-1998.

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","The control surfaces of hypersonic lifting vehicles are some of the hardest parts to design. The reason for this is the very strong shock wave boundary-layer interactions present in front of the control surface. These interactions cannot only reduce the controllability of the vehicle, but they also cause considerable aerodynamic heating. It can even happen that the heat loads on the control surface exceed those at the stagnation point at the nose of the vehicle. The aerodynamic heating on the control surface is one of the driving aspects of hypersonic vehicle design. This aerodynamic heating is influenced greatly by the state of the boundary-layer. A descending vehicle from space encounters different combinations of atmospheric density and velocity, resulting in a considerable range of Reynolds numbers. This results in a varying boundary-layer state during the descent. A potential peak in aerodynamics heating is found when the boundary-layer is transitioning from laminar to turbulent. The effects of such a transitional shock wave boundary-layer interaction on the flow topology is investigated using various compression ramps on a large flat plate. This creates a shock wave boundary-layer interaction with clear transitional structures. Schlieren imaging is used to get more insight in the separation length, separation angle and growth rate of the transitional structures. Next to that, a Quantitative InfraRed Thermography study is performed to investigate the aerodynamic heating on the compression ramp. Overall, a good overview of the features found in a transitional shock wave boundary-layer interaction is presented.","SWBLI; HTFD","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

The aim of this work is to develop a method that simultaneously optimizes the topology of the modular stiffeners and their layout on a base shell or plate. This is accomplished by introducing a fixed number of module stiffeners which are subject to density based topology optimization and a mapping of these modules to a ground structure of stiffeners. To illustrate potential applications, several stiffened plates and shell examples are presented. After optimization, these examples were converted to three-dimensional physical structures using additive manufacturing.

Person re-identification (re-ID) with deep neural networks has made progress and achieved high performance in recent years. However, most existing re-ID works are designed for closed-world scenarios rather than realistic open-world settings, which limits the practical application of the re-ID technique. Currently, no dataset of cyclists exists. Directly applying a trained re-ID network on another dataset does not yield good results. Therefore, a new dataset of cyclists is introduced in this paper. Our dataset is different than most existing benchmark datasets as every person in our dataset has been blurred to respect their privacy. In this paper the effect of blurring on re-identification performance is evaluated. To evaluate the impact of blurring on the re-identification performance we first tested it on the Market1501 dataset. Here, the performance of the blurred version could easily be compared to the original version blurring. The experiments show that blurring the data only impacts the rank-1, and mAP score by 1-4% for the Market1501 dataset. This impact depends on the size of the blurring window that is used. Several state of the art performing re-identification models were rebuilt and evaluated on our new dataset and their performance was compared. Furthermore, different backbone architectures were evaluated, we found that EfficientNetB0 outperforms the standard ResNet50 backbone architecture for re-identification, while using fewer parameters. Next the effects of RandAugment and Cosine learning rate decay were evaluated for re-identification. It was found that including RandAugment increases the rank-1 and mAP scores achieved on our dataset by up to 3%, and that using cosine decay further improves the achieved score. The final scores achieved on our dataset are 89.8% rank-1 accuracy and a mAP of 81.4%. Next we show that the batch hard pairwise loss function increases the F1-score by 7% for open-world re-identification. It was concluded that combining the embeddings is necessary to achieve good performance for open-world re-identification.","Deep Learning; Machine Learning; Classification","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2025-07-16","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) and blue mussel (Mytilus edulis) presence on loose rock revetments was quantified. C. gigas and M. edulis are common shellfish species in the port area and act as ecosystem<br/>engineers. They require a certain salinity level, water temperature, phytoplankton ratio, and sufficient submersion time for daily feeding and respiration. The current presence of shellfish in the port area was predicted based on salinity levels generated by an OSR model. Outcomes were compared to qualitative measurements of C. gigas and M. edulis presence performed in the port area. C. gigas is present on revetments where salinity levels exceed 16‰, which is the case at Maasvlakte 2, Beerkanaal, and Calandkanaal. M. edulis were hardly observed in the port area on revetments. M. edulis can move relatively easily and detach from the surface after mortality occurs in contrast to C. gigas. They are, therefore, not considered a reliable structural addition, so only the effect from C. gigas was studied. C. gigas presence leads to binding of stones in revetments. This binding of stones will increase the stability of stones in the revetment. The relationship between the presence of oysters and stability upgrading is described using a connectivity model. The relationship between the presence of oysters and binding of stones is measured in the port area, these measurements are used to validate the model. Measurements showed that the cumulative coverage ratio of dead and living C. gigas decreases as one moves up to the intertidal zone from the mean low water level (MLW). The binding of stones increases when the coverage ratio of C. gigas is larger. This shows that there is a relationship between the coverage ratio of oysters and the binding of stones, and this assumes that there is a relationship between the coverage ratio of oysters and stability upgrading. The presence of oysters comes with structural, environmental, and ecological impacts. The conditions in the Port of Rotterdam as a system itself can pose various opportunities and threats for oyster coverage, such as global warming, pollution, and future port plans. Complementary measures can be implemented to mitigate the limitations and threats. The maintenance demand, and associated costs, decreases when oysters are present. Oysters are usually present naturally; their presence can be stimulated by enhancing C. gigas populations at locations with conditions that would allow potential oyster growth. Enhancement strategies depend on local conditions. Application is most promising when bow thruster or ship wave impact is normative because oysters are mainly found up to NAP +0.5 m. Additional enhancement costs are approximately equal to the expected reduction in maintenance costs. Possible ways of application in the Port of Rotterdam are summarized in a flowchart.","Port of Rotterdam; Shellfish; Pacific oyster; Stability; Revetment","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","51.957844,4.026648"

Currently, this estimation is only done preoperatively. However, multiple factors during the surgery itself could influence the duration, for example bleeding. Literature showed the possibility of intraoperatively estimating a surgery duration based on surgical progress. However, one of the main concerns was the usability of such a system in the operating room workflow. Therefore, this research was focused on two parts: (1) the creation of an automatic intraoperative remaining surgery duration estimation system and (2) the evaluation of such a system for the operating room workflow. Two types of surgeries were used for the estimation, the Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy and the Total Laparoscopic Hysterectomy. The estimation was created using multiple statistical regressor methods, such as linear regression and random forest, and progress-based methods based on the nearest-neighbors algorithm and Dynamic Time Warping method. The evaluation was done on two levels: the system level based on the error of the estimation, and the operating room workflow based on surgical data from 2016 to 2019 and interviews with the operating room program coordinators. Results showed that an intraoperative remaining surgery duration estimation system based on surgical phases was able to re-estimate the duration with an error of about 10 minutes, an acceptable error for the operating room workflow. Moreover, the third quarter of the surgery showed to be the essential part where an accurate estimation is needed. Furthermore, an automatic system showed additional benefits such as being unbiased, continuous, and reducing unnecessary disturbance in the operating rooms. Overall, this research showed that an intraoperative remaining surgery duration system based on surgical phases is promising for the operating room workflow.

Over the last decade, assessments of constructors’ collaborative behaviour have been used more widely as a partner selection method. One of the most intensive forms of evaluation on soft parameters can be performed via an assessment (centre), also called workshops, with the tenderer’s and client’s team. The purpose of this explorative study is to provide more insights by 1) collecting the client’s motives to use these collaborative tender criteria, 2) identifying the different formats of assessments, and 3) learning lessons from projects that have conducted behavioural assessments. Ten cases are selected across the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and Finland, all of which focus on the procurement phase of a medium to a large-scale infrastructure project. Eleven semi-structured interviews with project and contract managers are used together with five assessor-interviews to gather empirical information. These independent assessors are involved by a public client to score the tenderer’s team during the assessment on a predefined list of sub-criteria. The thematic analysis shows that the use of collaborative criteria can be linked to the development of relational contracting and early contractor involvement. Especially in alliance and design team models with an integrated project team, a high weight is assigned to collaboration in the tender evaluation. Clients also aim to stimulate bidders to be more aware of collaboration and soft skills. The team assessment is applied for this purpose: it assesses the authentic behaviour of key figures that will be working on the project instead of only focussing on written bids. Results reveals that the assessment puts ‘collaboration’ high on the agenda of all parties right from the start, brings the team-related points for attention upfront, and stimulates bidders to approach team composition in another way. Nevertheless, several other instruments could lead to (some of ) the same goals and ongoing attention is needed to utilise the benefits of the assessment. Hence, the attitude and reflection of the client’s team is considered to be crucial for proper implementation. This study shows that the team assessment has proven to enable clients to make a more informed choice for a contractor on its collaborative behaviour.

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","A lot of studies have been done on Acoustic Emission (AE) covering a wide range of materials and applications. Within a structure that is under loading, AE has proven to be useful in determining the type, location and accumulation of damage within a material. The general goal is to use AE for inservice monitoring of structurally loaded parts. However, more research is necessary before the method can be employed in real-time applications. The objective of this project is to contribute to the development of algorithms that classify failure modes real time in composites using AE. Composite material specimens are loaded under tension while recording AE, after which the signals that are recorded are used to create an independent damage mode signature. This leads to the ability to classify damage modes per time increment. Mechanical tests are performed on specimens while recording AE signals. Carbon fiber reinforced polymer specimen with unidirectional 90∘layup are loaded in tension up to failure to create a fingerprint of the matrix cracking damage mechanism. The same material with a crossply layup is loaded in tension under quasi static and fatigue loading. The fingerprint is then used to separate signals coming from this type of damage and other damage mechanisms. Next to the basic parameters of these signals,<br/>additional features are generated by processing the waveform of each signal. The wavelet transform is used to find frequency related features that characterize each signal. Machine learning algorithms are developed and used to cluster and classify the AE Signals. Overall, the real-time clustering algorithms have proven to be successful in clustering and classifying incoming AE signals in an efficient way. The system was able to correlate incoming data to matrix cracking data, within a very limited time frame. With room for optimization the proposed methods seem fit to be applied in real-time applications. Before this can be done however, more testing and validation of these methods is required. The most valuable addition to this study would be a proper validation of the clustering results. Regarding improvement of the system, the main bottleneck of the proposed algorithms is loading large datafiles. This can be solved by reading data in batches, but requires further development of the algorithms.","Acoustic Emision; Clustering; Classification; CFRP","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

The three-and four-dimensional analogue of these polygons are the regular polyhedra and the regular polytopes. There exist five regular polyhedra in three-dimensional space and these are called the Platonic solids. These five Platonic solids are the tetrahedron, cube, octahedron, dodecahedron and the icosahedron. In four-dimensional space, the regular polytopes are the 5-cell, the 8-cell, also called the tesseract, the 16-cell, the 24-cell, the 120-cell and the 600-cell. The main focus in this thesis is to describe the symmetry group of the icosahedron, to introduce the Icosians, which are related to the rotation group of the icosahedron, and to study the action of the symmetries of the 600-cell on the twenty-five 24-cells it circumscribes. Firstly, the symmetry groups of the Platonic Solids, the regular polytopes in three dimensional space are established. Then it will be shown that there eixsts a two-to-one map from the the group H<sub>1</sub> of unit quaternions to the group SO(3), the group of 3 x 3 orientation-preserving matrices. This map will be used to describe the binary groups, which are double covers of the rotation groups of the Platonic solids. After that, the symmetry group of the tesseract will be studied both via an isomorphism between G := {± 1 }<sup>4</sup> x S<sub>4</sub>} and the symmetry group of the tesseract as well as geometrically via rotation planes. Then, the 24-cell and the 600-cell will be defined as the four-dimensional regular polytopes whose vertices are the quaternions from the binary tetrahedral group and the binary icosahedral group, the Icosians. It will be shown that twenty-five 24-cells inscribe a 600-cell and that there are 10 ways to decompose the vertices of a 600-cell into the vertices of 5 disjoint 24-cells. Next, it will be shown that these 10 decompositions are chiral, 5 being 'left-handed' and 5 being 'right-handed'.

In comparison with the traditional reinforced embankments, integrated shores form a gradual transition from land to water where shore vegetation can establish itself. These nature-friendly shores have a positive impact upon the water quality, flora and fauna and the amenities of the shore. Some of the benefits of vegetation are its capability of reducing the hydrodynamic loads on the shore and its ability to increase the soil strength against erosion. Both effects have been investigated in detail in previous research and have been implemented for coastal protection designs in sandy coastal settings. But a designing tool for cohesive shorelines in lake environments is still missing. In this research, the different aspects important for the erosion of a vegetated cohesive shoreline are studied and the first steps towards a process-based design tool are taken. The model results show that the dominant processes for erosion can be found at the point of wave breaking and at the start of the run-up, as both combinations give the highest induced bed shear stresses. This can be used for a strategic placement of vegetation to dampen the wave impact and reinforce the soil through the roots. There are situations in which a partially vegetated shore is sufficient to withstand the daily wave attack. This allows the vegetation to grow naturally to full strength, which is required in a storm situation. In this way a financial benefit can be reached as well as a healthier vegetated shore, as a large part of the vegetation has grown naturally.","Process based model; Wave dissipation; Vegetation Flow","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","",""

Water behaves in a strong nonlinear way and the time available for the computation of the compensating segment displacements is short. Especially for the case where the wave height sensors are mounted on the surface of the segments. The current ARC algorithm of Bosch Rexroth is based on an approximation of the Biésel transfer function. Although this method gives fair results, it lacks performance regarding the absorption of oblique waves. This report introduces a wave model identification method based on the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). With the EKF having the ability to include measurement noise and determine model uncertainty, this leads to reasonable estimates of complex second order waves. This report does not only cover the identification part of the algorithm but the full ARC algorithm from wave height measurements to a time series for the segment displacements. Although the results are based on simulations, the algorithm shows a much improved absorption performance for a wide range of propagation directions. It shows decent results for tests with several different sets of wave characteristics. The identification process needs time to mature, which leads to a decrease in absorption performance in the early stage of the free-surface elevation time series. A hybrid method is designed, in which the short-term absorption is based on the current algorithm and, after a certain time interval, the model based algorithm will take over.","ARC algorithm; Wave generator; Wave model identification","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2025-07-01","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

There is thus an open question of whether there exist algorithmic approaches that offer useful strategies for improving social housing markets. To investigate this question, we introduce the Social Housing Market Problem, which integrates indifference, existing tenants, numerical preferences instead of ordinal ones, and a dynamic market, into the existing Housing Allocation problem. Here we distinguish between the constrained problem variant, where property chains and cycles are not allowed, and the unconstrained variant, where they are. We utilise an objective function that maximises the average numerical fit between all families in the market and their (lack of) houses. A variety of algorithms are adapted and developed for both problem variants; some of these serve as baselines meant to resemble current strategies; some are experimental; and others are of primarily mathematical interest. In particular, we develop an original and optimal algorithm for this problem which runs in exponential time. We compare our algorithms' performances on multiple problem types. The practical applicability of our research is limited by a number of design choices meant to simplify this complex real-world problem, but our results do suggest that some of our algorithmic approaches may indeed form the basis of better strategies for improving social housing markets.

The academic society grew interest toward this technology due to its high generation capabilities at low production costs. For the time being, most of the research efforts are limited to the lab performance of these cells. However, real life performance studies allow for better understanding of the design effects and yield potentials of this technology. The commercially available yield prediction tools do not involve energy yield prediction models for tandem modules. In addition, they fall short at modelling all the aspects influencing the PV energy yield. The PVMD Toolbox, developed by the Photovoltaic Materials and Devices group at Delft University of Technology, is proposed to serve this need. This thesis presents the work done to develop version 4 of the toolbox. A calibrated lumped element model (CLEM) was developed to simulate the electric performance at the cell level. The CLEM combines the accuracy of physical models with the speed of lumped-element models to generate hundreds of thousands of simulations within a single minute. Additional models were implemented in the toolbox to account for the effects of cell interconnections and metallization on the energy output. Besides, a cell mapping algorithm was developed to reduce the AEY simulation time. This algorithm proved beneficial by reducing the number of required electric simulations by 86% at the small cost of 0.226% bias. Afterwards, the accuracy of the thermal and electric models was validated against two datasets. The simulated results showed a great agreement to the measurements with total energy yield deviations from the measurement of 2.65% and 4.15%, compared to 7.43% in version 3. Therefore, version 4 of the toolbox offers more accurate simulations with a reduced computation speed by a factor of 45.<br/>The CLEM and cell interconnection models were utilized to perform energy yield simulations on tandem modules. Case studies were performed on c-Si/tandem modules to investigate the implications of design choices. After optimizing the STC output of four design options, the toolbox was used to simulate the energy yield for each of them. Then, the optical and electric performance of the modules were studied. The tandem modules proved advantageous, with energy yield increase ranging between 12.91% and 27.13% compared to SHJ modules. In addition, specific yield computations confirmed the sensitivity of tandem modules to meteorological conditions. The final result of this thesis is a first-time combination of modelling spectral irradiance, thermal, and cell and module electric aspects for energy yield simulations of tandem modules.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-01-31","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

(mentor); Visser, K. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","The global warming led to the development of the IMO strategy to reduce the emission of greenhouse gasses for international shipping. The increasing environmental regulation from both international and local governing bodies will ensure to limit accessibility to operational areas with current power plant configurations. These restrictions also apply to the cruise industry as cruise destinations are becoming Emission Control Areas (ECA). This thesis focuses on the implementation of alternative power plant configurations in a preliminary design phase of cruise ships. This allows to explore and evaluate power plant configurations that are conform environmental regulation in an early design phase. During this master thesis a model tool was developed to evaluate the feasibility of cruise ship power plant configurations for different future environmental regulation scenarios. For this reason the environmental criteria was parameterized. These environmental criteria are the Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI) or carbon dioxide criteria and the sulphur criteria. The EEDI is parameterized with the EEDI reduction factor, representing percentile change over time relative to the EEDI reference line. The sulphur is parameterized by regulating the maximum allowable sulphur in an operational area. The aforementioned future environmental regulation scenarios are created representing different future regulation paths. Four scenarios are spanning a period of 30 years with three checkpoints at 2025, 2030 and 2050. The four created scenarios are based on the adopted IMO strategy to reduce the emission of greenhouse gasses in combination with the analysis of carbon dioxide emissions of cruise ships. These scenarios are implemented in the model tool simulating the solution space of future feasible power plant configurations. This simulation can be performed with limited model input ensuring early design phase usage. The model tool generates a ship design based on trend lines and the required power. The required power includes a composition of propulsive power, Safe Return to Port (SRtP) power, bow thruster power, ice/polar power, operational power and support power. Three different load balances are created from these power demands representing the operational modes of a cruise ship. The model generated power plant configurations includes the assumption that an Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) will be a part of the configurations. From literature it was concluded that Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells (PEMFC) and Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFC) could be used as energy converters in marine applications. Furthermore, batteries can be used for the storage of energy. The algorithm creates a tree structure containing all possible power plant configurations. Thereafter, the algorithm creates a list containing all possible power plant configurations which are separately evaluated on environmental feasibility. The model tool is a result of this master thesis and it can be used in a preliminary design phase to evaluate different design considerations. In a short amount of time the consequences for power plant configurations regarding regulations for the operational area can be presented. The ability to perform fast iterations with different parameters ensures an advantageous position in the preliminary design phase to present a range of feasible power plants for different scenarios to a client. The model has the ability to be adaptive for future regulations and new energy carrier concepts. A solution space of feasible power plant configurations for three case studies is generated with the model tool for the different environmental scenarios. These feasible configurations are rated with the help of an objective function. The objective function uses the volume and mass of the energy carriers, batteries and energy converters. For the solution space it is concluded that the model tends towards volumetric and gravimetric dense power plant configurations. For the smaller cruise ships (&lt;25000 GT) it is concluded that LNG as an ICE energy carrier is more dominant compared to the other two case studies. For larger cruise ships (60000 GT) the ratio between ICE allocated power and fuel cell allocated power is lower compared to smaller cruise ships. This implies that the EEDI regulation has a larger impact on larger cruise ships. This observation also reveals the limitation of the EEDI formula. It does not matter where the carbon dioxide emission originates from, the ship will be penalized for it with the EEDI formula. For example the carbon dioxide originating from bio-fuels is penalized equal to diesel fuels where controversially hydrogen produced from coal will not be penalized as it emits no carbon dioxide. From the analysis of cruise ship carbon dioxide emissions and the aforementioned adopted IMO strategy it is concluded that the second of the four future environmental scenario, as mentioned in the report, is the most likely scenario to represent future regulation. This second scenario includes the contribution of smaller cruise ship to the carbon reduction. Based on this assumption and from the analysis of the model output it is expected that between 2020 and 2025 the familiar diesel fuels MDO and ULSFO will be part of the power plant configurations for cruise ships. It should be mentioned that the MDO configurations require a scrubber to satisfy the sulphur criteria. According to the model results, a transition is expected towards LNG as an ICE energy carrier from 2025 to 2030. The recent 19 billion dollar order for LNG carriers from Qatar Petroleum substantiates this conclusion. As open loop scrubbers are already banned by ports and countries it is expected that scrubbers will disappear from the power plant configurations from 2030, eliminating diesel fuels. The model suggests that methanol will be more competitive compared to LNG as ICE energy carrier from 2030 to 2050. With the dominant presence of fuel cells it is expected that a development will occur for fuel cell marine applications. This could result in the out-phasing of batteries as fuel cells are capable of providing the power for the emission free required time of the cruise ship. It is also expected that the tank systems for hydrogen will improve. This would ensure a more competitive position for hydrogen and could function together with ammonia as future energy carrier for the fuel cells. A transition is envisioned from LNG towards methanol in 2050 as methanol has a lower carbon factor resulting in a better EEDI performance. It is also expected that in 2050 power plants configurations using solely hydrogen in combination with an ICE or a fuel cell could provide the power demand for cruise ships as a result of the aforementioned developments. The 70 % carbon dioxide reduction in 2050 as described by the IMO can be achieved if international regulation keeps challenging the shipping industry. The aforementioned objective function did not take into account the efficiency in the three performed case studies. A sensitivity analysis was performed which includes the efficiencies of the energy converters. This analysis revealed that the previously best rated configurations with a PEMFC on ammonia are almost now equal to the less energy dense SOFC on ammonia configurations if the efficiencies are taken into account. The PEMFC requires almost pure hydrogen which decreases the efficiency as a result of the required conversion of ammonia. However, the best rated configurations still use fuel cells on ammonia. Subsequently, the ICE on ammonia has a less favourable objective function score because of the low ICE efficiency. From these findings the conclusions were somewhat adapted and it is suggested that further research uses the model that takes efficiencies into account. Overall it is concluded that alternative power plant configurations can be implemented in a preliminary design phase of a cruise ship using environmental adaptive modeling taking into account EEDI and sulphur criteria.","Cruise; Cruiseship; Cruise vessel; Environmental; EEDI; Sulfur; Sulphur","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Marine Technology | Ship Design, Production and Operations","",""

(mentor); Nikolic, I. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","Our contemporary society consists of increasingly complex systems-of-systems in which technical and social subsystems influence each other. Multi-models reflect this complexity and are useful to analyse these complex socio-technical systems. They consist of connected simulation models which may each have their focus on a subsystem or modelling paradigm. However, these models contain different types of uncertainties influencing the fidelity of the results. Several methods are available to identify and analyse these uncertainties. It is yet unknown if and how existing uncertainty analysis methods can be applied to multi-model ecologies. In this thesis, we aim to provide for an answer to the following research question: “To what extent can we apply existing uncertainty analysis methods to multi-models?” To answer this question, it is important to first identify additional uncertainties in multi-model ecologies compared to single models. Next, we identify and apply methods to analyse these additional uncertainties. As proof of principle, a multi-model is used which focusses on the expansion and decarbonisation of the energy grid in the Port of Rotterdam. There are three dimensions of uncertainty in simulation models: location, level, and nature. The different locations include the conceptual model, the computer model, input data, the technical model implementation, and the processed output data. In multi-models, we found an additional location: the interface. This is where the exchange of parameters between the models takes place. Within the multi-model locations, we identified some aspects that increase uncertainty. Epistemic opacity and computational expense are properties of multi-models that limit the analyst's knowledge of the multi-model and the feasibility of extensive uncertainty analyses. The methods we identified for analysing these types of uncertainties are divided into sensitivity analysis and calibration. Sensitivity analysis quantifies the contribution of specific uncertainties to the overall uncertainty in the model outcome. Well-established methods are extra-trees feature scoring and Sobol. Calibration methods are based on the notion of equifinality. Using a specified likelihood function, they determine parameter values that lead to results with a high likelihood. Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) methods are often used for calibration purposes. The applicability of these methods depends on the multi-model configuration. To describe these configurations, two limiting archetypes were used: directed graphs, and undirected graphs with feedback mechanisms over the model components. We found that uncertainty analysis of direct graphs can be carried out on both the model components and the whole. For undirected graphs, the research showed only added value in performing an uncertainty analysis on the whole multi-model. Otherwise, the changing context and emerging path dependencies cannot be included. The application of extra-trees feature scoring, Sobol, and MCMC on the case study model showed that methods for uncertainty analysis are applicable on multi-models by including uncertainties on the interface. Furthermore, it is possible to reduce computational costs by factor fixing, distinguishing between deep and stochastic uncertainties, and assessing the convergence of sensitivity indices. Epistemic opacity can be dealt with by performing multiple replications and by including uncertainties related to the technical implementation of the multi-model. MCMC methods are suitable for scenario discovery, which provides insight into parameter values that lead to specific model results. For future research on this topic, it is recommended to apply uncertainty analysis on multi-models with different network structures and a higher number of model components. This research offers a single case study multi-model, being an undirected graph with two model components. The role of uncertainties on the interface, epistemic opacity, and computational expense should then be further investigated in these different configurations. In addition, other uncertainty analysis methods in the context of multi-modelling could be investigated. Especially the application of moment-independent sensitivity analyses could be interesting to investigate further, since multimodal outcomes can arise from the interaction of heterogeneous models.","multi-modelling; socio-technical systems; uncertainty analysis; sensitivity analysis; simulation models; Port of Rotterdam; deep uncertainty; Exploratory Modelling and Analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","",""

In this network, a set of micro hubs located in the urban areas are used for deconsolidating shipments and transferring them from high capacity vehicles to light freight vehicles that eventually deliver to customer locations. Due to the shorter distances between the micro hubs and final customers, these networks can be combined with light electric freight vehicles with limited driving ranges to deliver shipments from micro hubs networks. Thus, logistics service providers can potentially adopt these networks for complying with new low emission zone policies that restrict diesel cargo vehicles to enter dense urban regions. However, before deciding to adopt these new networks over existing conventional ones, it is imperative to assess the performance of these networks towards achieving overall business objectives. Although optimization models can be used for the evaluation process, the existing models that can be used for urban transshipment networks are computationally complex, causing their limited application to real-life contexts. Thus, this research presents a new continuous approximation-based model in the form of a support system for LSP to evaluate the performance of urban transshipment networks in a simpler aggregate manner. The application of the support system to a synthetic case study revealed that the model was able to provide a feasible solution that was adequate for strategic evaluation and performance of urban transshipment networks was contingent on the density of customer points in LEZ","Transshipment network; Urban transport; Micro Hubs; Electric Vehicle; Low emission Zone; Performance Evaluation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

A nonlinear controller is designed to set the PGK actuator at an angle based on the guidance signals.

Developments in this modality are necessary for improvement of patient complications and survival. Aside from fractionation and precise irradiation, FLASH radiotherapy could be a third way to significantly increase the therapeutic window of radiotherapy.The FLASH effect is a biological, healthy tissue sparing effect that is found in tissue that receive a high dose (&gt;10 Gy) within a very-short irradiation time (&lt;100 ms). Although the mechanics behind the FLASH effect remain unknown, it is found to benefit a large variety of tissues and organs. Nevertheless, FLASH-RT still lacks clinical translation and implementation of FLASH irradiation is limited by current technology. However, the extremely high dose rates required for FLASH can readily be achieved using cyclotron accelerated proton transmission beams. Cancer patients with small lung tumours are a preferred starting point for clinical translation of FLASH because (i) transmission beams are of special benefit for lung tumours since they mitigate for range uncertainties and contain a sharp lateral penumbra, (ii) high doses are required for the FLASH effect to occur and hypofractionation is not uncommon for lung patients, and (iii) the very short irradiation times and high doses in combination with gating allow smaller treatment margins for moving tumours.In this study, we took a first step towards intensity modulated proton therapy (IMPT) with FLASH treatment plan optimisation by (i) investigating the most delivery-time effective way to irradiate a field, (ii) proposing an optimisation method to maximise FLASH within a treatment plan, and (iii)analysing and evaluating FLASH treatment plans. Because increased pencil-beam (spot) separation showed to benefit the pencil-beam scanning(PBS) delivery time of a field, spot overlap minimisation was proposed as optimisation method for FLASH. Treatment plans using 3, 5 and 7 transmission beams were generated with and without FLASH optimisation for 6 small lung tumour patients. Although spot overlap minimisation doesoccasionally improve delivery time for a limited number of beam angles, the overall treatment plan does not benefit from the optimisation. Therefore, spot overlap minimisation cannot be used for FLASH optimisation in clinical IMPT treatment planning. Recommendations for future research include optimisation on PBS delivery time and PBS pattern optimisation.","FLASH radiotherapy; proton therapy; treatment plan optimisation; IMPT; FLASH; high dose rates; irradiation time; overlap optimisation; lung cancer; radiotherapy; Pencil beam scanning; transmission beams; FLASH triangle; high energy irradiation; spot separation; delivery time; PBS delivery time","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Over night consumers’ needs changed, leaving the organizations in an uncertain environment. The current situation highlights that organizations need approaches that must enable them engage in search activities, in order to find out how to adapt and deal with uncertainty. This thesis was carried out in the context of a strategy design agency. They help their clients to explore how to adapt an organization by designing strategies and new business models. By a design doing approach they help their clients to engage in search activities with a focus on business model innovation. An initial business idea is considered to be a ‘guess’ that needs to be tested. During the search activities a prototyping process is followed to test these ‘guesses’, referred to as assumptions.The prototyping process is carried out by a multidisciplinary team, consisting of employees of the organization from various departments and business designers from a strategic agency. These (validation) teams aim to use prototyping to reduce uncertainty. By carefully deciding what assumptions needs to be tested, an experiment (activity) is designed to do so. Prototypes in the form of artifacts are build to generate learnings. With the use of these learnings, teams can iterate their business model, value proposition and product designs.Initial observations show, validation teams face difficulty to create suitable prototypes, and setups to test these assumptions while uncertainty is only addressed to a limited extent. Underlying assumptions, which are not explicit at first, are seldom considered. To enhance the current practice, a wide range of prototypes are created which are implemented within the context. The implemented prototypes are aimed to enhance the current process, mainly through a digital manner due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Through numerous of prototypes, new ways were explored with the intention to enable teams to address uncertainty, and moreover, help to create suitable prototypes. These efforts manifested in enabling teams to utilize prototypes as a straw man within the team or use prototypes to trigger customers in an early stage. These activities helped the team to go beyond testing assumptions, and enabling them to reveal assumptions. Through the practice of revealing assumptions, the prototyping process enables to drive continuous learning, since the newly revealed assumption can influence learnings goals for the next steps.The project also identified obstacles that could hinder a successful use of prototyping, such as a risk avoidance mindset and lacking skills of team members.Eventually, based on the developed prototypes and generated learnings, a boundary object in the form of a digital warroom was designed and presented. So the teams are being enabled to go through the prototyping process to address uncertainty. The embodied approach of the warroom should help teams to drive changes by developing new business models, value propositions with product &amp; services supporting these.","prototyping; uncertainty; organizations; adaptability","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

These limitations have prompted researchers to explore different options, such as cartilage engineering. Bioprinting, a promising tissue engineering technique, could be used to fabricate biomimetic constructs that can potentially replace allografts. The present study explores the generation of a biomimetic chondrocyte density gradient in full-thickness bioprinted Alginate/NFC scaffolds with a PCL framework and investigates the effect of this zonal distribution of cells on the production of cartilage matrix within the scaffolds. To this end, two types of scaffolds were bioprinted; one with a graded three-zone distribution of cells (bottom zone: 5×106 cells/ml, middle zone: 10×106 cells/ml, top zone: 20×106 cells/ml), and another with a homogeneous cell density (10×106 cells/ml) and cultured for 25 days. Furthermore, the mechanical properties of the multi-material scaffolds were evaluated. The results showed that a three-zone cell density gradient could be achieved using extrusion-based bioprinting. The gradient was maintained for 25 days in scaffolds cultured in non-chondrogenic media (absence of ascorbic acid) but was transformed into a two-zone gradient within the first 14 days, in cultures with chondrogenic media (presence of ascorbic acid in the medium), and maintained as such until the end of the experiment. The zonal distribution of cells led to a zonal distribution of sGAGs, after 14 days of culture, with the sGAGs deposition being increased in the areas of high cell density. However, there was no significant Collagen deposition within the scaffolds at any time point during the experiment. This study attempts to shed light into one of the gradients of the native cartilage tissue (cell density gradient), with the hope of contributing to the development of a biomimetic fully functional engineered cartilage scaffold in the future.","bioprinting; zonal scaffolds; cartilage scaffolds; cartilage regeneration; tissue engineering","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-07-14","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

The plinth volume, of a pedestrian scale, dedicated to the productive city and the community facilities, forms a base for the existing building. Small scale production spaces which surround a courtyard, construct the industrial filligree of the city. Simulaneously, by conjoining office space as being the domicile of the 21st century economy with small scale industry, alliances and clusters can be formed. Social housing rises up out of this block, transcending the eyeline of the street. This project, as a work/ live configuration, seeks to mediate between the traditional values of Anderlecht’s urban fabric and the boldness of Les Goujons as a product of Brusselization. The contrast between top and bottom is made even more apparent by their different alignments in relation to the site; the base following the street while the upper (existing) volume breaks ties with it. While the south wing of the building is absorbed into an urban block, the north wing redeems a modernist quality it initially never received. It now surrounds itself with public space - giving the building the notion of air, light and space. In the current situation, the plinth is disjointed from the street and public space, it fails to adress the public. The typical Anderlecht block is a mixture of different functions, volumes, shapes and spaces that address a variety of users and engages with the public realm in different ways. But all typical Anderlecht blocks share one quality: They are prourban and serve the traditional city. They are exploited by the resourcefulness of their residents. By absorbing Les Goujons into a newly established Anderlecht block, it takes advantage from these qualities, while simultaneously offering density and social diversity to the city. The inner spaces in the block will provide users the tools needed to build a community, a place to have a seat and enjoy the weather, as well as a space to have a conversation or a stroll. The intermediate zones become buffers; they soften the edges of public space. Without compromising the dramatic and overwhelming aesthetic of Les Goujons, the renovated facade retains the characteristics of the modernist aesthetic. Reused steel mullions and glass curtain wall panels glitter the mirage of Brusselization. The base volume facades instead delineate the townhouse tradition of 19th century Brussels. With a wink at Brussels’ façadism, These facades correspond to this tradition by reproducing the informal elevation of the street; arrhythmic placement of windows and balconies, altering building heights and detailed expression.","Brusselization; Productive city; modernism; work-live environment","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","50.834397,4.322594"

They provide passivation of silicon surface and high carrier selectivity. So far, superior results have been achieved through the use of a stack of poly-Si with SiO2. The objective of this project is the optimization of an alternative passivation stack based on carbon alloyed poly-Si (poly-SiCx). The alloy is selected since carbon provides improved material resilience against blistering and wet-chemical stability in commonly used chemicals in the silicon industry. The optimized poly-SiCx contacts are implemented in fornt back contacted (FBC) solar cell. We improve the passivation quality of SiOx/poly-SiCx contacts optimizing several parameters. Our main focus is on the buffer layer optimization and its deposition methods comparing LPCVD and PECVD technique. We also turn our attention to identify the optimum annealing temperature and thickness of doped layers. Finally, we focus on the influence of the different capping layer composition on hydrogeneation process. With the optimization of the annealing temperature, and thickness of (i)a-Si layer deposited by LPCVD, we obtain high passivation quality on cell precursor structure: i-Voc of 713 mV, τeff of 2.14 ms and Jo of 9.5 fA/cm2. On the contrary, during the optimization of buffer layer deposited by PECVD, we firstly focus on the material properties and the bonds present in the deposited layers to minimize the hydrogen contact. After the optimization of the (i)a-Si:H layer thickness, deposition parameters and annealing temperature on (p)poly-SiCx symmetrical sample, we obtain the remarking results: i-Voc of 681 mV, τeff of 1.15 ms and Jo of 31.3 fA/cm2.<br/>The potential of SiOx/poly-SiCx passivation contacts is checked on the device level of FBC solar cells. On FBC solar cells with buffer layer deposited by the PECVD, after an effective post annealing of the cell performed at a temperature of 350°C, we achieve the remarking parameters; Voc of 659 mV, Jsc of 34.36 mA/cm2, FF of 77.58 % and ηact of 17.56 %. We check also the the influence of different SiNx capping layers on the hydrogenation process. We obtain the best results on the FBC solar cell on which the capping layer is stoichiometric. These results, after the high-temperature port annealing, are Voc of 690 mV, Jsc of 36.18 mA/cm2, FF of 80.38 %, and ηact of 20.06 %. These are also the best FBC poly-SiCx results which we have obtained in this project.<br/>The application of SiOx/poly-SiCx passivation contacts is investigated also in terms of the IBC solar cell concept. We proposed two alternative fabrication methods based on photolithography, which is crucial for contact formation of IBC solar cells. One of the fabrication methods focuses on a buffer layer deposited by LPCVD as this layer is of higher quality and homogeneity than the interlayer deposited by PECVD. The second developed method focuses on the buffer layer deposited by LPCVD and PECVD. Despite the lower passivation quality achieved on contact with the buffer layer deposited by PECVD, this method has a significant advantage because it requires fewer photolithography steps when compared to the fabrication method, which makes use only of buffer layers deposited by LPCVD. In the view of the photolithography processes, we have performed etching tests on (i)a-Si, (i)a-Si: H, and amorphous doped layers. Thanks to these tests, we have identified etching rates of these layers in various prepared poly-Si etching solutions.<br","passivating contact; poly-SiCx; c-Si","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Weight savings directly translate to reduced CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from cars which aids automotive manufactures to meet the vehicle emission guidelines put forth by regulatory bodies around the world. Further increase in weight savings and productivity can be realised when BIW components are fabricated using laser beam welding (LBW). However, the phenomenon of solidification cracking of AHSS during LBW poses challenges to not only its application in the automotive industry, and also in the production lines of steel manufacturers. From the body of literature pertaining to solidification cracking two fundamental conditions can be identified that result in solidification cracking in alloys. First is the development of thermo-mechanical stresses/strains during liquid melt solidification and second, is the formation of a crack susceptible microstructure. In addition to this, the welding conditions can influence the susceptibility of alloys to solidification cracking. The objective of the present study is to understand the influence of variable processing conditions during LBW on solidification cracking tendency of AHSS and how to control these conditions to minimise it. In particular, an attempt is made to understand the effect of keyhole configuration, welding speed and laser beam spot size on solidification cracking. Furthermore, finite element analysis is used to predict the size and shape of the weld pool during LBW, and to determine the net process efficiency which in turn is compared with the calculated process efficiency from the existing analytical model. Bead-on-plate LBW following the testing procedure of the VDEh (German Steel Institute) standard hot cracking test was performed on three third-generation AHSS at two LBW facilities with different beam quality. Due to this, the keyhole during the tests at the two facilities was identified to exist in the closed keyhole configuration and more towards the open keyhole configuration. The susceptibility to solidification cracking was found to increase when the keyhole prevailed in the closed keyhole configuration during LBW. The keyhole configuration was varied by altering the process parameters (welding speed and spot size of the laser beam) in comparison to the parameters corresponding to the closed keyhole configuration. Reducing the welding speed, while keeping the laser power and spot size constant, resulted in the open keyhole configuration and subsequent reduction in the solidification cracking tendency but, until a limit. Similarly, reducing the spot size, while keeping the welding speed and laser power constant, also reduced the solidification cracking tendency as the open keyhole configuration was enforced. The macroscopic area of the fusion zone (weld size) was found to corroborate with the solidification cracking tendency of the alloys. Consequently, the spot size of the laser beam was varied to determine the critical spot size which resulted in a critical weld size at which solidification cracking did not occur. Corresponding to this, the critical process efficiency was determined which is representative of the critical heat input above which solidification cracking occurs. However, the magnitude of the critical spot size, weld size and process efficiency is dependent on the solidification cracking susceptibility of the alloy in question.","Solidification Cracking; Laser Beam Welding; Advanced High Strength Steels; Keyhole","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Materials Science and Engineering","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","If 10 people would answer the question “What falls into the category grooming and what is beautification?” there would be 10 different answers. For some, grooming does not go beyond taking a shower and brushing your teeth. But what about shaving? Or make-up? And a question that arose during quarantine: how important are hairdressers? Most people agree that cosmetic surgery does not belong in the realm of grooming anymore, but how about using injectables? This is where the discussion gets interesting. In this thesis the focus lies on the twilight zone of beautification, meaning on minor surgeries, injectables and trends that normalize enhancing your beauty in a way, that technically can be considered surgery, but are not perceived as such by the public. <br/><br/>Firstly, the phenomenon Beauty Ideals was explored. While thoroughly researching this phenomenon, the Vision in Product Design was used to create six clusters, or overarching themes. Three of these clusters were chosen to design for. In order to create design for debate and awareness, critical design theory was applied to create three designs. For each design a dystopia was written, and a prototype was built and a scenario photo was made. The combination of these three, show three problems that could arise when we choose to beautify to an extent to which we can no longer return to natural.<br/><br/>First of all, the Wishbone is a face jewel that reflects how beautification affects our metal health. Often we beautify ourselves because we want to become happier, but research shows, that rarely ever this is the case. Short term happiness is achieved, but on the long run, on average, people become more discontent with themselves and the way they look. The design of the Wishbone reflects how we limit ourselves in the way we feel and express ourselves. Taking the current developments, such as preventive Botox, to an extreme, people will physically be unable to move their faces in a way that is healthy for both the brain and the body. <br/><br/>Secondly, the Tulip is a chair that reflects how beautification affects our relationships. The way we want to make ourselves look better, stands in the way of pleasant touch and how we perceive touch. Again, taken to an extreme, we see that an extremely important part of human connection is limited, muted or avoided all together. <br/><br/>Lastly, the Cloud is a ‘My-First-Botox-Kit’ that reflects how beautification affects our daughters and the generations to come. Having small amounts of Botox and fillers injected seems innocent, but young children, are vulnerable and susceptible to everything they see around them. Especially when it comes to their direct environment. Using injectables as a mother, aunt, teacher or other type of role model, gives off a signal to the younger generation that they are not good enough the way they are. <br","Beauty; Beautification; Critical Design; prototyping; dystopia","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is found that the mixing length parameterization in this subgrid model is at the root of a long trouble problem of grid size sensitivity in large-eddy simulation (LES). A new formulation of mixing length is proposed under the consideration of some basic elements including the presence of surface, the dependence of grid size Δ and a smoothing interpolation. The performance of this modified scheme is remarkable regarding the improvement of the simulation quality and accuracy. In other words, not only is the convergence of the simulated results from a range of grid size achieved but also in the precise intensity of physical variables are modelled. The only discrepancies display in the variance of temperature in the middle of boundary layer and high turbulent kinetic energy near the surface. <br/><br/>To further experiment the performance of the new scheme under different scenarios, the cases of different stability condition, an independent LES code with same modification, the cases of different advection schemes and different prescribed parameters are explored. In very stable condition, the first order variables from the modified scheme are in reasonable range but with some spreads compared to the results from a dynamic code. The deviation of second order statistics shows that the proposed formulation of mixing length meets limitations due to the complex interaction between the surface and turbulent flow in shallower boundary layer. The modified scheme is model system independent based on the similar improvement of simulation results in an independent LES code system. The sensitivity of advection schemes is surprisingly hardly found in new proposed SGS model. The cases of tested parameters further verifies the limitation of original Deardroff subgrid model.","Buoyancy length scale; Stable boundary layer; Subgrid-scale model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Environmental Engineering","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","Various technologies have been implemented in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) to generate clean effluent with minimised impacts on the environment. Thermal hydrolysis process (THP) and struvite crystallisation reactors are two examples of these technologies. THP generates humic-like substances, known as melanoidins, that are presumed to disrupt struvite crystallisation. THP also solubilises trace elements that are prone to complex with melanoidins. On the one hand, the trace elements might stay bound to the melanoidins in the supernatant or on the other hand; they might be present in struvite as impurities. As both THP and struvite crystallisation are promising technologies, the objective of this study was to understand the effects of THP on struvite crystallisation. Results showed that melanoidins generated by THP affected P removal and the amount of produced struvite in struvite crystallisation at pH 6.5 and 7.25, but not at pH 8. In contrary to melanoidins, humic acids (HA) were found to reduce P removal efficiency at pH 8. Melanoidins resulted in slightly higher N-NH4 concentration in the supernatant in all pH values. Melanoidins and HA also changed crystal colour from white into brown and black, respectively. Furthermore, melanoidins and HA changed the morphology of struvite crystals from X-shaped and long rod-like crystals into square-shaped crystals and at the same time reduced the diameter of struvite crystal. Regardless, melanoidins did not change the Mg:N-NH4:P-PO4 molar ratio. Melanoidins did not significantly influence induction time, except at pH 7.25 and 2 g TOC/L melanoidins. In addition to this, melanoidins were found to form complexes with magnesium which subsequently decreased the supersaturation and affected struvite crystallisation. Different elements had different fate on struvite crystallisation. Melanoidins formed complexes with Mn and Ni, resulting in a higher concentration in the supernatant compared to the condition without melanoidins. Based on PHREEQC modelling, humic substances (HS) formed complexes with Ca, Cu, and Fe. Certain trace elements (Ca, Co, Cu, Fe, and Mn) and heavy metals (Al and Cr) were found to co-precipitate with struvite in all experimental conditions; meanwhile, Se minerals only co-precipitated at pH 8. All minerals showed decreasing SI with increasing HS concentrations. The decrease of SI implied that there would be less co-precipitation of Al, Ca, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, and Se in struvite crystals. Nevertheless, their presence in the supernatant would not guarantee the bioavailability of the trace elements for bacteria in partial nitritation/anammox (PN/A) processes due to the chance of complexation with HS. Eventually, it could be concluded that THP affected struvite crystallisation and Response Surface Methodology (RSM) confirmed that the optimum conditions for struvite crystallisation with maximised N and P contents and big diameter were pH of 7.9 and 0 g TOC/L melanoidins. Nonetheless, melanoidins prevented co-precipitation of trace elements in struvite crystals.","Crystallisation; Humic substances; Melanoidins; Phosphorus recovery; Struvite; Thermal hydrolysis process","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-07-14","","","","Water Management | Sanitary Engineering","",""

Intensifying agglomerations to urban centres across the globe due to the displacement and mass migrations of large populations has increased the pressure of organising a dense urban habitat. In its dominion over nature modern life was so caught up in establishing the narratives of individual life that it was naive to the complexity of everyday activity. The celebration of the Individual and the rationalisation of nature and society attempted to find order amongst the chaos of a city. The intensity of diversification in cities due to agglomerations to global centres highlights the changing face society and culture in dense formations and its immediacy. But when the practices of a past epoch continue to pervade themselves into the contemporary narrative, when the ethical practice of past time refuses discontinue for the continuity of a new ethical practice and the development of collective memory then we find ourselves in a cycle of self-contradiction. The condition it creates formulates something hybrid, repetitive, standardised and universally proliferated. There is an inherent issue with creating a dense urban ecology, especially in verticality, that is both equitable to its inhabitants and sustainable to its environment. Between establishing forms of density and the articulation of diversity in our cities there exists an inability to inform the everyday perspective, the continued withering away of political character in our public space and a lack of avenues to establish resilient forms of citizenship. Creating a future perspective for our city becomes increasingly unclear and clouded amongst the ubiquity and generic nature of universal design and the destruction of our urban heritage. When the ability for the urban to produce space for the possibility of specificity is reduced, whether through urban segregation, stratification or fragmentation, then the reference plane for the city wither’s away. A loss of identity in density that cam as result of the modernisation for cities and city life.<br/><br/><br/>The Future Primitive is a reframe for looking at the city, one that can enliven the stories of the common and everyday. It means to see the city as a continue process of collective memory and reflection. The research project was to use this concept of as a way to establishing the city as a common future. Through a series of theoretical discussions which aimed to enlighten an inherent paradox in the way we deal with the relationship between space and time in our cities through aesthetics and territory the research pretend how this is proliferated in the articulation of diversity and density in our cities ultimately constraining the possibilities for our common future and furthering the divide of Earth and World. This produced a set of theoretical notions and principals that established the basis for a design brief for prototyping the development of civic common space through the vertical densification of an existing urban landscape. <br","Architecture; Urbanism; Commons; Future Cities; Social Inequality; Planetary Urbanization; Verticality; Political Citizenship; Densification; Primitive; Permanence; Ecology","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","-27.468325, 153.024406"

The thesis starts with an inquiry around the very notion of nomadism, outlining the figure of the nomad in relation to the territory, as a habitat and as a field of knowledge. Nomadic territories are distinguished by co - habitation between human and nature systems accompanied by a synchronized performance of natural and anthropogenic agents. The nomad is fully embedded with the territory and its nature, meaning that he or she is not only aware but also part of the biophysical cycle. The ex ante of Sámi contributes to the establishment and definition of the nomadic paradigm and simultaneously supports the previous argument. A hypothesis transition moves the scope of the study from Sápmi to the Wadden Sea Region, aiming at testing how the nomadic paradigm could trigger a shift in the way sedentary civilization, currently based on permanence, stability and over – exploitation of ecosystems carrying capacity, values the landscape. The analysis and diagnosis of the multifaceted pressures related to climate change and human activity in the Wadden Sea Region highlight the urgency for a new balance between economy and ecology, based on co - habitation and de – growth. A shift towards the nomadic paradigm, thus, seems extremely relevant. Following this, an evolutionarily adaptive strategic framework is developed and applied on Texel Island which becomes an “in situ” experiment. Here, the strategic actions turn into place specific (plug in) design interventions. The living lab of Texel is an iterative, robust, open innovation ecosystem, where water management, land use and human activity are reprogrammed through design, in a way that mitigates risk, enhances the island’s adaptive capacity, activates awareness and participation of permanent and temporary actors, towards a sustainable development that will set a (neo nomadic) example for the Wadden Sea Region as a whole.","Spatial planning; Landscape Design; Resilience; Flooding; Adaptation; Nomadism; Territorialization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To battle eutrophication, an important factor is to monitor it. Five indicators are used together to assess the status of eutrophication, determined by the Common Procedure. These are the chlorophyll-a concentration, the turbidity, the nitrate and phosphorus concentration, the oxygen levels and the biological water quality. All five indicators need to be known to obtain the final eutrophication status. However, just looking at the chlorophyll-a concentration on its own is also a good measure. This thesis focuses only on the chlorophyll-a concentration as an indicator for eutrophication.<br/><br/>To monitor the North Sea, the OSPAR's Commission has established eutrophication monitoring zones. The aim of this study is to determine eutrophication monitoring zones based on available satellite data of the chlorophyll-a concentration in the Dutch part of the North Sea. The zones are defined using four clustering algorithms: K-means clustering, Hierarchical clustering, Random Forest clustering and HDBSCAN. The results from these clustering algorithms are compared to both each other and to the previously defined eutrophication zones.<br/> <br/>First, the case study region is split into two areas: the coastal area, which lies closer to the shore, and the offshore area, which lies farther away from the shore. The best result for this separation was generated by K-means clustering with two clusters.<br/> <br/>Afterwards, the eutrophication zones are determined separately in the offshore area and the coastal area. The clustering results are ranked based on four criteria. The first criterion is correspondence to OSPAR's previously defined eutrophication monitoring zones. The second criterion is the similarity of the clusters to the zones that are visible in the data. The third criterion is the performance determined by validation metrics. This criterion was considered less important because of the lack of ability to capture the goals of the research. The last criterion is confirmation through the HDBSCAN clustering. This was added later during the study when it was found that HDBSCAN yielded very accurate results. Due to how HDBSCAN works these accurate results were not usable directly, as the number of clusters this yields it too high, but they were usable for verification. The best results were found through random forest clustering with respectively nine and five clusters for the offshore and coastal areas.<br/><br/>Subsequently, the zones derived from clustering were compared to other data to see whether the determined monitoring zones also hold over time. This appeared to be the case. <br/>Moreover, the distribution of the chlorophyll-a concentration for each zone is determined. Additionally, the trend of the chlorophyll-a concentration of one determined monitoring zone is analysed over time. Lastly, the defined eutrophication monitoring zones are compared to other defined zones within the Dutch North Sea coast. These other zones were fishery policies, marine protected areas, spatial planning, and bathymetry. The comparison validated the defined monitoring zones.","","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To achieve this, crops are suggested as keypoints, and two different keypoint descriptors are put forth. The first descriptor is based on the shape and size of the crops, while the alternative descriptor is based on the planting pattern of crops. The method, and both descriptors, generate promising results for certain scenario's.

The opportunity for the current project was seen in exploring how design could be used to support these initiatives in developing their own capacity building process throughout their complex challenge of embedding innovation in cities. The goal of the project is, in particular, to investigate how to design a methodology that supports urban innovators in framing their capacity building steps, in order to foster their continuous development of capabilities for their innovation processes. <br/>After initial explorations through theories on transdisciplinary and reflective approaches, combined with designed interventions with master students, a clearer research direction has been identified to answer the following research question; How can a reflective tool enable urban innovators in developing their own Designscapes capacity building trajectory in order to facilitate continuous improvement and diffusion of capabilities? The project takes a research through design approach, articulated in five iterative design interventions. During the interventions, prototypes are designed and evaluated with urban innovators from Designscapes project, leading to the final proposal of a reflective tool for DEI initiatives. Through five iterations, insights are generated regarding how reflective processes can better facilitate the identification of capacity building needs in DEI projects. Simultaneously, each intervention informed as well the requirements for the design of the reflective tool as final outcome of this project. The final result of the project, a reflective tool in support of DEI initiatives’ capacity building journeys, contributes to facilitate urban innovators in embracing a reflective approach in carrying out their projects and identifying new capabilities they need to develop to succeed in them. The final result still has opportunities for improvement and further research is seen as necessary for its implementation in real context constraints of initiatives projects.","Participatory City Making; Delft Design Labs; Designscapes; Design Enabled Innovation; Capacity Building; Reflective tool","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

Thus, this study argues that a less risky approach to ECV capability development is needed. One possible tool that can be used is strategic corporate social responsibility (CSR) that is designed according to a firm’s intention. In this context, CSR initiative can be used as a learning ground to develop a firm’s ECV capability without the typical pressure and constraints of a commercial project. The premise is explored by conducting a single case study of a startup competition held by an established ICT company in Indonesia that partners with three public universities. In this study, fifteen propositions on how strategic CSR can facilitate and support a firm’s development of ECV capability are developed, accompanied by potential challenges and solutions identified from both case study and literature study. By integrating ECV capability development and strategic CSR, a firm can achieve two objectives with one action while nurturing positive relationship with stakeholders.","external corporate venturing; strategic CSR; dynamic capabilities; capability development; developing country","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

(mentor); Annema, J.A. (mentor); Rook, L. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","Improving accessibility has become one of the main objectives for policymakers in the transport and urban field. Having access to activities and people is essential to ensure the proper functioning of societies and it affects people’s quality of life. One of the remaining challenges in this field is related with the economics of accessibility, in particular, with the monetary quantification of the added value of having multiple options available to travel to. Accessibility indicators and current theory suggest that having more options available is translated into higher levels of accessibility. However, the benefits of increasing the number of alternatives is subjected to the law of diminishing returns, that is, the added value provided by each additional option decreases as more options are available. Therefore, the main research question of this thesis is: How much are individuals willing to pay for having different quantity of options of the same destination (e.g., a supermarket) to travel to? The research methodology proposed to answer this research question consists on a preliminary research and two different questionnaires. The study area of this research is a small Spanish city, located in the province of Albacete. The aim of the preliminary research is to gather information about the context and the culture of this study area. In this way, data about sociodemographic characteristics of the population, the location and current number of destinations or perceptions about current services has been searched. The non-market nature of the services to be analysed makes Stated Preference approaches the best methods to elicit monetary values. However, due to the novelty of the research, a first exploratory questionnaire was designed to obtain a first sight of the citizens’ opinion about the importance that they give to have multiple options of the same destination, which factors they value most, or what are the main reasons why they value having several options. After that, the second questionnaire was elaborated using a particular Contingent Valuation Method, namely Payment Cards, whose objective is to elicit monetary values for different hypothetical situations in which the supply of the service varies. Both questionnaires were distributed online in order to reach the highest number of respondents. The results show that people prefer to have more options of basic services, such as food stores, pharmacies, schools or medical centres, than non-essential services like gyms, hairdressers or clothe shops Moreover, proximity is considered an important factor just for basic services, while variety is more appreciated for secondary ones, so that people can choose the one that best suits their likings. After analysing the results from the first questionnaire and applying other relevant criteria, two final destinations were chosen to be further analysed in the second questionnaire, namely, kindergartens and primary health centres. Results show that, in the case of kindergartens, more than half of the respondents are willing to pay extra 12€ per month (median value) for expanding current services in case the demand increases, whereas just 8€ to remain in the status quo in the hypothetical situation in which demand holds or decreases. At first sight this result may seem the opposite to the concept of loss aversion, but when placed in context it may be reasonable that citizens are not willing to pay for keeping open empty kindergartens. Furthermore, the results showed that not all the respondents are willing to pay the same amounts, resulting in significant differences among respondents who are users, have been in the past, or will probably be in the future, and those who have no children, prefer private kindergartens or simply do not make use of the service. On the other hand, there is no such a difference between users, option users and non-users in the case of medical centres. All the three groups present a mean WTP value of 50€ per year for expanding current services. One possible explanation is that everyone is a potential user of this service, even if they do not currently use it. Therefore, option values would probably be high for option and non-users, being willing to pay the same amounts than regular users. Also, non-use values may play a key role. It is important to mention that there is not a significant difference in the values reported when considering the two possible alternatives proposed to expand the service. Although finishing a second medical centre is more expensive than extending current schedule, people is not willing to pay more for it. After reflecting on all the findings obtained and place them in the context of the study area, it can be concluded that sometimes it is not only the number of options itself what citizens appreciate (and are willing to pay for), but many other factors should be taken into account. For instance, for public services, the amount of destinations can be subjected to political strategies such as increasing the number of services even if they are not needed. Moreover, people may prefer to have less options with high service quality, than more options with poorer quality. Finally, for private destinations in which people’s preferences play a key role, the particular characteristics of each new (or removed) option will influence the total value for each individual. Thanks to this research, policymakers are better informed to make decisions about public services, avoiding unnecessary costs and allocating public funds more efficiently. In the particular case of this research, information to make future decisions is provided for different scenarios. For example, in case the demand for primary health services increases, policymakers should extend current schedule, as it is cheaper than opening a new centre and people value both alternatives in the same way . Moreover, current managers and future entrepreneurs can obtain useful insights for running their businesses. The results from the questionnaires show which factors are more appreciated for each type of destination, in addition to the citizens’ perception about the current number of options available, making it easily to identify market opportunities. Finally, several interesting future research avenues are proposed to further explore about this topic. For instance, the research can be replicated in other contexts with different cultural factors to see whether people’s preferences vary. Moreover, more sophisticated methods can be applied to estimate how much are individuals willing to pay. Finally, it would be very interesting to analyse private and non-essential destinations in order to compare whether the results differ and empirically test the hypothesis derived from the first questionnaire.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

Cooperation can be crucial for microorganisms to survive stressful environmental conditions. In this work, we report on the cooperative behaviour by the yeast S. cerevisiae and the bacterium E. coli, which stimulates survival and growth at high temperatures. Our lab had already discovered that genetically identical yeast cells cooperate with each other via the secretion of a public good (the antioxidant glutathione), to extend habitability of high temperatures. However, microbes naturally live in communities, where they coexist with other strains and species. These microbial communities are crucial to the health of an ecosystem, but their habitats are warming up due to climate change. So, understanding their response to a rising temperature may be crucial to keep ecosystems healthy. We take it one step further and study the cooperation between different yeast strains at high temperatures. We found that not only a population of genetically identical cells, but also different strains cooperate with each other, to collectively survive under high temperature conditions. We performed so-called co-existence experiments at high temperatures, where we combined two different yeast strains, one genetically fitter than the other. Depending on the initial composition of the mixed population, we obtained two outcomes. In the first outcome, the genetically fitter strain helps the less fit strain to grow. In the second outcome, vice versa, the less fit strain helps the fitter strain to grow. A mathematical model that reproduces the experimental data, predicts an additional outcome, where both strains would help each other to grow. Additionally, we discovered a novel cooperative behaviour at high temperatures in the bacterium E. coli. We found that E. coli cells show similar growth behaviour compared to yeast and we hypothesize that a comparable cooperative behaviour lies at the basis, also regulated by the secretion of a public good. These results suggest that cooperation at high temperatures could be conserved amongst different microbial species.","Microbe; cooperation; heat; microorganisms","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Sciences | Nanobiology","",""

Due to the remoteness and limited accessibility of some communities, off-grid solutions such as mini-grids are required to electrify these regions. An essential part of such an isolated mini-grid is the energy storage system. DC Opportunities aims to establish these mini-grids as a third step in the electrification process. As a means of energy storage, the small-scale employment of the mature technology of pumped hydro storage (PHS) should be explored, making use of height differences in terrain often present in these areas. While PHS is the most common energy storage technology, it has thus far only be employed on a large scale and only recently research on its small scale applicability has been gaining ground.<br/>In order to conduct a feasibility study on the use of PHS as a means of energy storage for isolated mini-grids in low-resource settings, such as those in Sub-Saharan Africa, local challenges are identified. These include a suitable operating range, quality of supply and power issues, limited component and material availability, potential arrival of the main grid, funding, low tariffs and revenue, a low-trust society, limited technical skills, theft and vandalism, political vertical networks and corruption, regulatory issues, secondary water use and environmental impact. Based on these challenges, a program of requirements is presented, which consider the technical, economic and socio-cultural requirements.<br/>Subsequently, the available design options are discussed, and based on the program of requirements a technical design synthesis leads to a provisional technical design. This exploration has led to the conclusion that earth dam reservoirs should be used for the water storage system, Glass Reinforced Plastic or Mild Steel pipes for the water conveyance system and a binary unit utilizing a Pump-as-Turbine or a ternary unit employing a Pelton turbine for the powerhouse configuration; this configuration can be either designed for an one-time installation or scalable installation. Based on the provisional technical design and the local challenges, an organizational structure, using the existing local power structure, ensures the PHS plant embeds itself in the community through community involvement and participation, as well as local capacity building by the project facilitator. The capacity requirements of the reservoir, as well as the diameter and material of the penstock, and the powerhouse configuration appear to be highly dependent on site-specific conditions. Therefore an energy flow model was developed, which in combination with a penstock selection tool and a generated demand profile is able to determine the requirements of a Hybrid Energy Storage System (HESS) utilising PHS as its main component for an isolated mini-grid. This model has been deployed for a case study in Adi Araha, Ethiopia, yielding positive results. Further exploration into the economic implications of the modeled system, and socio-cultural factors to be considered for the case study, led to the conclusion that for the case study a PHS plant could prove to be a technically, economically and socially feasible solution. Further research is however warranted, specifically on site.<br/>The developed model was further employed to attain a conclusion on the general economic feasibility. While the socio-cultural factors are very site specific and can not easily be generalized, the results exhibit that for a situation where the gross head is at least 250 meter, and preferably around 300 meter, and the maximum power output requirements of the PHS plant is at least 150 kilowatt, technical and economic feasibility is attainable. Isolated mini-grids requiring a storage solutions, adhering to these conditions, should thus be further investigated to more accurately determine the feasibility of a small pumped hydro storage plant.","small pumped hydro storage; sub-Saharan Africa; Mini-grid; Pumped hydro storage; Rural electrification","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

This study determines the validity of the two-dimensional flow solver for predicting the isentropic expansion of Siloxane MM through a converging-diverging nozzle using compressible Euler equations, adiabatic flow, and the Peng-Robinson equation of state. Two flows with an inlet stagnation temperature of 525K were considered: an expansion from 18.4 bar to 2.1 bar, and an expansion from 11.1 bar to 1.3 bar.  Mach number along the centreline and static pressure along the nozzle surface were used as the direct system response quantities used in the analysis. Experimental data and uncertainty came from the ORCHID, model input uncertainty was quantified using stochastic collocation, and the numerical uncertainty was calculated using the Richardson extrapolation. The conclusions were based on a hybrid of the ASME V&amp;V 20 and Real Space validation metrics, with a novel Engineering Response Quantity analysis based on determining the effects of system uncertainty on performance parameters. The studied SU2 model provide valid predictions for Mach number, and invalid predictions for static pressure. The largest error is in the kernel region, where E<sub>Mach</sub>=0.111 and E<sub>Pressure</sub> = 112 kPa. Mach number has a maximum simulation uncertainty of 2% at the transition to the reflex region. Pressure has a maximum uncertainty of 3% at the throat. In the context of turbomachinery the simulation uncertainties translate to +/-0.001 and +/-0.02 on a loss coefficient calculated across a theoretical normal shock, for Mach and pressure respectively. Considering +/-0.01 as significant for a loss coefficient the Mach uncertainty is negligible. Input uncertainty is the largest component of the pressure uncertainty, while experimental uncertainty is dominant for Mach. The input parameters which provide the highest contribution to the uncertainty are critical pressure and temperature. The developed infrastructure can be used for expanding the validation of SU2 to different flow cases.","SU2; Validation; NICFD; non-ideal compressible fluid dynamics; Uncertainty Quantification","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-07-01","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","In recent years, development of a concept from the mid- 1970's has led to the emergence of Airborne Wind Energy Systems (AWES). Currently the AWES sector encompasses dozens of companies that are developing a range of concepts of, more or less automated, flying wings attached to a tether which convert wind energy to electricity. At the time of this writing however, AWE as a technology discipline is still in early stages of development; not a single company has been capable of producing a commercially ready system. This phase, where the primary goal is to commercialise technology, is described as the 'valley of death' as here the risk of failure is high. In literature this phase has gathered attention from a policy perspective, however the perspective of the entrepreneur is scarcely researched. This research will attempt to find an answer to the problems that entrepreneurs encounter in the valley of death. <br/><br/>The valley of death is defined as: A phase that occurs during commercialisation of technology where a combination of long and costly development and a lack of resources cause an environment where the risk of failure is high for organisations to introduce the first commercial product.This definition, combined with a literature review on challenges that are likely to occur in this phase, forms the context that defines the strategies.In four expert interviews with private sector investors and experienced entrepreneurs, this context is discussed. The findings from these interviews are combined with insights from literature to identify three likely challenges: 1) technology uncertainty, which is caused by the inherent complexity of hardware development and production, which result in long and costly development. 2) market uncertainty, which is caused by difficulties in matching technology characteristics to market needs, hesitance by other stakeholders or competing against an incumbent regime and 3) lack of financial resources, which is the result of high costs during the commercialisation of hardware technology and a tendency to under invest by the private sector. In order to identify a possible way to deal with these answers findings from a separate literature review and from the four expert interviews are combined. From this, eight strategies emerge.The findings in this analysis show that activities belonging to all seven functions are found in the AWES TIS. Possible barriers are found in functions five and six. There is little to no market formation, only through technology push by the entrepreneurs. Resources are considered scarce for development and AWES technology development is costly and long. These barriers are similar to the challenges and characteristics of the valley of death.<br/><br/>Concluding on the main research question the valley of death was redefined from the perspective of the technology developer, including multiple perspectives. It is characterised by a low availability of resources and organisations that develop hardware based technology are at risk of failing to commercialise. By identifying and testing common strategies for their applicability this research was able to provide a way to reduce the risk of failure in this phase. Start-ups that develop new technologies must prioritise commercialisation of their technology by focusing on minimum development towards specific needs in order to generate revenue. However, for hardware based innovation external resources are needed to fund development. By demonstrating the ability to find value these start-ups increase the chance to appeal to investors in the private sector and secure the necessary funding.","Airborne wind energy; valley of death; entrepreneurship; innovation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-07-13","","","","","",""

This approach is capable of utilising online information regarding realistic future predictions of the propulsive power demand, addressing the current gap in the literature regarding the implementation of MPC EMSs onboard ships, and pragmatic future mission information utilisation. To the author's best knowledge, MPC for fuel consumption minimisation has not yet been implemented at this timescale in maritime propulsion plants with hybrid power supply. Furthermore, online mission information from the Integrated Bridge Systems (IBSs) and the governor's human input cannot be utilised by EMSs onboard ships, due to the lack of a mathematical pathway to enable such an information feedback flow. Increasingly powerful processing units in ship controllers and a wider application of batteries in marine powertrains motivated such a computationally heavy and, simultaneously, highly fuel-efficient control approach. The proposed controller framework has been tested and verified in a case study using a Mean Value First Principle (MVFP) propulsion plant model of a hybrid naval vessel with batteries in Simulink®, provided by DAMEN® SNS. By using provided mission data, realistic mission profiles were generated, in which the proposed controller is validated against perfectly and piecewise, non-perfectly informed Dynamic Programming (DP) solutions in an information barrier scheme, yielding close to optimal performance, and a fuel consumption reduction of up to 3.5% when compared to any non-long-term feedback enabled controller.","Energy Management Strategy; Model Predictive Control; Hybrid Power Supply; hybrid electric propulsion; Naval Ships; Integrated Bridge Systems; Long-term Information Utilization; Control Framework; Feedback Enabled","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-07-13","","","","Marine Technology","",""

These factors can lead to entrance barriers in utilization of breakdown data when assessing network reliability and scope of attainable improvements in asset strategy and maintenance concepts. Proven solutions and contextualized research are not readily available for water companies which, as asset-intensive enterprise relying on physical assets to deliver water to its customers, have a big stake in optimizing its use of data. This project has set out to research whether aspects of recommendation making for asset management at water companies can be aided with application of commonly available and deployable business intelligence tools. To this end, a water company which faces similar challenges has been selected. Evides – a water provider in the region of Rijnmond seeks more data-driven approaches in asset management of water connections. This asset group can be characterized by high volume, high technological heterogeneity and high absolute number of breakdowns as compared to distribution pipes. Together with a vast volume of data, this combination of factors leads to challenges in maintaining a continuous oversight and transparent conversion of performance data into strategic goals and clear service level agreements. The case of Evides inspired a research approach in which application of a custom-made decision support system is evaluated for the process of recommendation making in asset management of water connections. Methodology for this research encompassed for semi-structured interviews with network specialists and managers to obtain information on current asset management goals and the corresponding recommendation-making process for water connections. Thereafter, a thematic analysis was conducted to distill the main themes depicting aspects of interests to network-specialists in charge of producing recommendations and to managers – the decision makers. The type and moments at which performance data is processed and consulted were described and positioned in a managerial decision-making model, together with aspects assessed at each stage. Simple performance indicators were selected to aid the assessments and to connect performance readings with company goals. Findings were thereafter embedded into a purpose-made prototype of a decision support system, utilizing capacity of business intelligence software in creating curated datasets and user-friendly front end. In the last phase of the research, network specialists participated in appraisal of the created tool by completing a series of tasks designed to assess performance of water connections. Surveys were then conducted among participants to evaluate the added value of the created tool in the context of recommendation-making for asset management of water connections at Evides. Results show that, for the case study company, the created tool allows for improvements in accessibility and connectivity of company performance data and can contribute towards greater transparency in goal setting and enabling data-driven recommendation making for asset management of water connections. Performance outliers and policy non-compliers can be localized easier and help company in localizing areas in need of attention. Display of simple performance indicators for connections as per user-selected criteria can in the long run enable more nuances in describing network performance, shifting away from binary descriptions of asset’s performance. In case of Evides, the performance management framework for water connections was discovered as insufficiently defined to allow for assessments of direct benefits as result of application of the designed decision support-system. It is therefore recommended for future research to apply similar methodology for asset groups with well defined performance management standards and to focus on experimental design with higher external validity.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-07-13","","","","","",""

Yet, the cost of myoelectric upper limb prostheses are still a hindering factor of widespread usage of the prostheses. In developing countries, where the demand for prostheses is relatively higher, commercial myoelectric prostheses are out of reach for the majority of amputees because of limited financial resources. Low cost myoelectric prostheses with the aim of use in developing countries are not commercially available at this moment. <br/>Objectives: The goal of this study is to develop a functional low cost myoelectric upper limb prosthesis. The developed prosthesis will be tested with standardized and validated test methods, to evaluate if the prosthesis is usable and functional. The Box and Blocks Test (BBT) and the Southampton Hand Assessment Procedure (SHAP) will be used for this purpose. <br/>Results: A low cost myoelectric prosthesis prototype was developed in this study; the MyoGrab Hand. The material cost of the prototype was 99.33 euro. The weight of the prosthesis was 352 g. The maximum pinch force of the hand prosthesis was 54.8 N. The MyoGrab Hand was tested by 20 able-bodied participants with BBT and the SHAP. In a first evaluation with ten participants, the prototype proved its functionality with an average score of 17.0 (± 2.2) with the BBT and an Index of Functionality (IoF) of average 41 (± 8.3) with the SHAP. After optimizing the Arduino code structure, the MyoGrab Hand was evaluated again. Ten able-bodied participants carried out the BBT. The average score on the BBT with the optimized MyoGrab Hand was 18.4 (± 2.4). The result of the BBT in the second evaluation was not significantly better than in the first evaluation (t = -1.3, df = 18, p = 0.21). In a durability experiment, critical failure of the prototype occurred after 16539 cycles of opening and closing of the hand. <br/>Conclusion: The goal of this study, the development of a functional low cost myoelectric prosthesis, has been achieved. The MyoGrab Hand was evaluated with standardized and validated test methods and proved itself functional. This is one of the first studies that was focused on the functionality, usability and durability of a low cost myoelectric prosthesis. The functionality of the MyoGrab Hand does not equal the functionality of commercial myoelectric prostheses, commercial myoelectric prostheses are more functional. The MyoGrab Hand was able to perform most of the activities of daily life (ADL) tasks in the SHAP, however, carrying out these ADL tasks took longer, as compared to commercial prostheses. This study is a first step in the direction of making a functional myoelectric prosthesis available to larger part of the amputee population with limited financial resources. Future research should focus on a lower weight battery solution, waterproof design and testing in a non-clinical setting.<br","Prosthesis; Myoelectric; 3D printed; upper limb; EMG; Arduino; SHAP; BBT","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-07-13","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

Hence, in current horticultural practice these control algorithms are scarcely used. Therefore, the need rises for a control algorithm which does not rely on a parametric system representa- tion but rather on input/output data of the greenhouse system, hereby establishing a way to control the system with unknown or unmodeled dynamics. A recently proposed algo- rithm, Data-Enabled Predictive Control (DeePC), is able to replace system identification, state estimation and future trajectory prediction by one single optimization framework. The algorithm exploits a non-parametric model constructed solely from input/output data of the system. This algorithm is employed in order to control the greenhouse climate. It is shown that in numerical simulation the DeePC algorithm is able to control the greenhouse climate. A comparison is made with the conventional Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) algorithm in order to show the differences between a predictive control algorithm that has direct access to the non-linear greenhouse simulation model and a purely data-driven predic- tive control algorithm. Both algorithms are compared based on reference tracking accuracy and computational time. Furthermore, it is shown in numerical simulation that the DeePC algorithm is able to cope with changing dynamics within the greenhouse system throughout the crop cycle.","MPC; DeePC; NMPC; Greenhouse","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","For the continued growth of PV capacity, it will be necessary to store vast amounts of energy to overcome seasonal differences in energy generation. To this end, the conversion of electricity to liquid or gas fuels could play an important role in the future energy system. There are numerous ways to create fuels from solar energy, the possibilities range from completely monolithically integrated photoelectrochemical (PEC) devices to configurations where the PV is completely decoupled from the electrochemical reaction. This thesis is part of the DISCO project, where the aim is to create multi-junction PV cells that can generate a high voltage and integrate these into PEC devices. The aim of this thesis project is to optimize the photovoltaic performance of a triple-junction device based on crystalline silicon (c-Si), nanocrystalline silicon (nc-Si:H) and amorphous silicon (a-Si:H).<br/><br/>The bottom junction of this triple-junction device is a wafer-based silicon heterojunction (SHJ) cell. The used wafer should have a smooth surface texture, since previous research has shown that growing a nc-Si:H absorber layer on the regular random pyramid surface texture results in the formation of cracks. To this end, three different proposed smooth surface textures were compared amongst each other. These surface textures were a smooth pyramid surface texture, a hexagonal surface texture created with photolithography, and a texture of crater like surface features obtained by etching a sacrificial layer. It was found that from these three textures, the best performing SHJ cells could be made from wafers with a smooth pyramid surface texture. With respect to the other surface textures, the smooth pyramid surface texturing approach leads to the smallest fraction of exposed &lt;100&gt; crystal orientations, which are more challenging to passivate. The performance of the SHJ cell is extremely sensitive to the passivation quality of the intrinsic amorphous silicon layers on both side of the wafer. By optimizing this passivation layer and the doped layers, SHJ bottom cell efficiencies of over 18% were achieved. <br/><br/>The middle junction of this triple-junction device is based on a nc-Si:H absorber layer. By varying the crystallinity of this i-nc-Si:H absorber layer, it was found that optimal photovoltaic performance is achieved for a crystalline volume fraction between 50% and 65%. Furthermore, the thickness of this absorber layer can be varied to improve the current matching between the different subcells in the triple-junction device. To this end, the effect of a varying absorber layer thickness on the single-junction PV performance was investigated. It was found that the absorber layer thickness is a trade-off between on the one hand Voc and FF, and on the other hand Jsc. For example, doubling the absorber layer thickness from 2.5 µm to 5.0 µm results in a Jsc increase from 18.2 mA/cm<sup>2</sup> to 20.8 mA/cm<sup>2</sup>, whereas the Voc and the FF respectively decrease from 506 mV and 0.65 to 481 mV and 0.59. <br/>Once the bottom and middle junctions were optimized, different material combinations in the tunnel recombination junctions of the multi-junction device were investigated. It was found that p-nc-SiO<sub>x</sub> and n-nc-SiO<sub>x</sub> with appropriate doping levels and contact layers were the best performing materials in both tunnel recombination junctions. When the Voc of the tandem cells was compared to the sum of the single-junction cells, the optimized tunnel recombination junctions resulted in a Voc loss of 7 mV in the top tandem (nc-Si:H/a-Si:H), and 51 mV in the bottom tandem (SHJ/nc-Si:H).<br/>By making use of all the performed optimizations described above, a triple-junction device based on c-Si/nc-Si:H/a-Si:H was processed. The final device had a PV efficiency of 13.63%, with a FF of 0.755, a Voc of 1982 mV and a Jsc of 9.11 mA/cm<sup>2</sup>. To the best of our knowledge, this is a world-record efficiency for this type of solar cell configuration. If it is managed in future research to match the current over the different subcells more evenly, this device has the potential to achieve a current density over 12 mA/cm<sup>2</sup>.","PV; multi-junction device; amorphous silicon; nanocrystalline silicon; crystalline silicon; silicon heterojunction; passivation; tunnel recombination junctions; smooth surface texture","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","DISCO",""

It is the principal ingredient for modern flood forecasting and early warning systems. Radar forecasts are generated by identifying and tracking rainfall cells in radar images and extrapolating them along the main direction of motion based on the assumption of Lagrangian persistence. The latter means that the rainfall cells do not physically evolve over time. Therefore the key to improving predictions is to anticipate the growth and decay of rainfall cells during the next few hours. Studies have shown that estimating growth and decay based on past radar images is nearly impossible. Therefore, in this thesis, a new approach for predicting growth and decay based on physical guidance from a numerical weather prediction model is investigated. The idea is that numerical weather prediction models are better at anticipating changes in the atmosphere than radar and thus, should also contain information about the growth and decay of rain cells. To test this hypothesis, two simple machine learning models have been trained to learn the relationship between the observed growth and decay in radar images and the output parameters from the Dutch mesoscale numerical weather prediction model HARMONIE. The models were trained on data in the summer of 2019 around the city of Rotterdam for two area sizes, $20\times 20$ km$^2$ and $60\times 60$ km$^2$. The first model is static and assumes that all predictions from HARMONIE are correct. Unfortunately, this turns out to be too optimistic as HARMONIE often places the rain cells at the wrong locations with the wrong intensities and trends. As a result, no meaningful relationship between HARMONIE outputs and growth/decay in radar could be learned. The dynamic model overcomes this issue with the help of an additional classifier. The classifier predicts whether the information from HARMONIE can be trusted or not. Then, a regression model predicts the magnitude of growth and decay (only for the trusted cases). Out of 308 analysed cases, the classifier labelled 237 HARMONIE predictions as being untrustworthy, thereby removing a lot of bad cases. However, 98 of these were false negatives, meaning that they could have been used to predict growth and decay. On the other hand, only 71 cases were labelled as containing useful information, from which 27 cases were false positives. Despite these errors, the dynamic model was able to improve the root mean square error on the predicted growth/decay by $27$\% for these 71 cases. Also, the correlation between the predicted and actual growth/decay increased from near zero to $0.488$. This is encouraging and clearly highlights the potential of this approach. Still, some important challenges remain. In particular, results show that the dynamic model often underestimates the magnitude of growth and decay. Also, when the entire validation data set is considered, including all unusable cases, the improvement with respect to the static model is only $6$\%. This is mainly caused by the poor performance of HARMONIE and the large number of unusable cases. However, performance could be improved further by building a better classifier capable of identifying all good cases with a low number of false negatives.","NWP models; nowcasting; Rainfall; precipitation; prediction; dynamic","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Physics","",""

Grid balancing services must be assured when the output from a wind farm is integrated into the electrical grid to avoid the risk of blackouts.<b> Active Power Control (APC)</b> methods are employed to provide grid balancing ancillary services such as frequency control. One objective of APC is to have the total power generated from a wind farm, track the power demand requirements obtained from the utility grid. To achieve this objective, the wind farm should be able to operate below their maximum power production capacity i.e, in derating mode. This implies that the turbines in the wind farm should also be derated. The presence of wakes in the wind farm results in the downstream turbines to experience reduced wind speed and increased turbulence. <br/>The earlier works on APC for wind farms revealed the need for a closed-loop wind farm control strategy to combat the effect of wake turbulence. The presence of wakes posed several challenges on obtaining the estimate of the available power at every turbine on a time scale of seconds. Yet, some model-free algorithms were dependent on the estimation of available power at every turbine in the wind farm. This, leads us to the question, “<b>Can a wind farm controller be developed to provide APC for waked wind farms, where the setpoint selection and distribution are made without estimating the available power at each turbine?</b>” To explore the answer to this question, a single wind turbine power tracking control algorithm is developed as the first step. This tracking algorithm does not depend on the estimation of available power. The proposed algorithm makes the turbine operate on two different operating modes namely, the perfect tracking mode and greedy/boosting mode. The algorithms were developed in a way that they can be integrated with the existing torque and pitch controllers of the turbine. Following this, a closed-loop wind farm control strategy has been developed. The closed-loop wind farm controller takes the total power generated from the wind farm as the feedback signal. Based on the operating mode of the individual turbines, the wind farm controller coordinates and distributes the total power reference signal as individual power set-points to the respective wind turbines. The performance of the closed loop wind farm controller was evaluated for a 9-turbine case in SOWFA simulation for four different scenarios. The scenarios differed from each other based on the way the turbines in the wind farm are derated and the individual set points to the turbines are distributed by the wind farm controller. Simulation results showed that the scenario in which the upstream turbines are derated more than the downstream turbines, the tracking performance was better compared to the other scenarios. The damage equivalent loads experienced by the tower base of the individual turbines were also calculated and each of the scenario resulted in different loading patterns. Recommendations are also provided to extend this work and perform further research.<br","wind farm; Active power control; Wind Turbine Control; closed-loop wind farm control; Damage equivalent loads","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

To further develop offshore wind energy, investment in ever-larger construction vessels is necessary. Designing these vessels is difficult however, as this market is characterised by a large but seemingly unpredictable growth of market demand, turbine size and distance from shore. Currently no way of dealing with such market uncertainty within the ship design process was found to exist. This research aims to develop a method that is able to deal with market uncertainty in early ship design by increasing knowledge when design freedom is still high. The method uses uncertainty modelling prior to the requirement definition stage by performing global market research, and during the concept design stage by iteratively co-evolving the vessel design and business case in parallel. The method consists of three parts; simulating an expected market from data, modelling multiple vessel designs, and an uncertainty model that evaluates the performance of the vessels in the market. The case study into offshore wind foundation installation vessels showed that the method can provide valuable insight in the effect of ship design parameters like main dimensions, crane size and ship speed on the performance in an uncertain market. These results were used to create an initial design that is expected to perform well in the uncertain market. The developed method thus provides a way to deal with market uncertainty in the early ship design process.","Uncertainty modelling; Complex design methodologies; Offshore wind foundation installation; Early stage design; Decision making; Ship design; Concept exploration","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Marine Technology","",""

Besides, it is an important parameter in climatological and hydrological models. Understanding of the root zone storage capacity and its major determining processes is therefore fundamental in environmental sciences. Several studies have investigated root zone storage capacity magnitude and its descriptor variables, but mainly in snow absent regions. Computation and analysis of root zone storage capacities in snow dominant regions is therefore underexposed. As such, additional understanding of the major descriptor variables of the root zone storage capacity in boreal regions and in particular the influence of snow on the root zone storage capacity is desired. The aim of this study is therefore to quantify catchment average root zone storage capacities, identify its main descriptor variables and their regional variability and determine the influence of snow on root zone storage capacities in Canada. Root zone storage capacities were computed for 230 Canadian catchments using a simple water balance approach with additional snow module and were found to be normally distributed with mean magnitude of 183 mm and a standard deviation of 70 mm. Individual correlation of climate, discharge and landscape variables showed most relevant relationship between root zone storage capacities and yearly potential evaporation, runoff coefficient and seasonality index, although with considerable variance. Subsequent investigation on the mutual effect of several variables showed that the aridity index, runoff coefficient and seasonality timing index are major descriptor variables of the root zone storage capacity, by how they indicate the allocation of water for transpiration in a catchment and describe the degree of synchronisation between liquid input and atmospheric water demand. Application of a multiple linear regression model using the aridity index, runoff coefficient and seasonality timing index showed these variables can be used to predict root zone storage capacities in Canada with an R2 of 0.72. Subsequent tests of the predictive capability of this model Finland resulted in an R2 of 0.62. The influence of snow on the root zone storage capacity in Canada was identified by comparing its magnitude computed with and without a snow module. Whenever significantly present, snow effects showed a decrease in root zone storage capacity magnitude, caused by increased overlap between liquid input and transpiration output in a catchment. These effects are encapsulated by the seasonality timing index. To determine the regional variability of root zone storage capacity descriptors in Canada, catchments were clustered based on similar functioning. The results indicated that different variables have an effect on the root zone storage capacity in different functionally comparable regions and that a large part of the functional behaviour of the clusters can be explained by the geographical location of their catchments. The influence of these regionally dependent variables on the root zone storage capacity is encapsulated in the earlier defined main descriptor variables aridity index, runoff coefficient and seasonality timing index.","Root zone storage capacity; Snow; Descriptor variables; Hydrology; Roots; Canada","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Water Management | Hydrology","",""

In its current form, the Atalanta has a lift-to-mass ratio of 0.12 which inhibits it from taking off. Getting the Atalanta to fly would greatly benefit the research into areas such as aerodynamic modelling, on-board electronics, control and navigation and more. Designing and realizing a new, energy-efficient wing-system capable of producing 1.5 gram lift is found to be the most effective solution, with an expected lift-to-mass ratio of 0.85. Developing this new wing-system requires the design, manufacturing and integration of two parts: a wing and a compliant hinge. The wing is a wing-shaped, rigid plate that pushes air around to generate lift. The hinge is the interface between the Atalanta body and the wing, and allows the wing to passively rotate, i.e.: pitch, around its spanwise axis. For the fabrication of the wing, a hybrid structure is created by stacking sheets of different materials on top of each other, each with its own purpose. The sheets are laser cut before assembly to distributed material only where needed. The result is a wing consisting of a carbon frame for stiffness, a Mylar sheet for enclosing the wing surface area and a double-sided adhesive layer to bond the two together. For the compliant pitching hinge, a cross axis configuration of three leaf-flexures is selected. The combined pure bending motion of all three flexures allows the wing to rotate around its pitching axis. The flexures are fabricated and subsequently integrated into the wing structure, forming the new wing-system. The two main tests qualitatively asses the performance of the new wing-system. The first test measures the average stiffness of four hinges, and finds it to be a factor 27.8 higher than was expected. Measurement errors, incorrect input parameters, hinge flexure misalignment and corrugation at the edges of the flexures all can reduce the factor to 13.9, but the dominant reason is estimated to be curving of the flexures along their width. The second test determines the kinematic profile of the new wing-system; i.e. the sweeping and pitching angles during a single stroke. The results show that the wing-system operates at its resonance frequency of 8.5 Hz. This indicates that the energy efficiency of the new wing-system should be improved compared to the current wing-system. The 8.5 Hz sweeping frequency does mean a lower lift generation than expected, but this can be improved by reducing the mass of the wing and optimizing its topology. With some weight saving improvements the new wing-system should be more energy efficient while producing more lift compared to the current wing-system. The design and manufacturing processes are more flexible and consistent which makes experimental optimization of the mechanical properties of the wing-system easier. The novel cross axis hinge concept proves to be a valuable addition to the wing, although its fabrication can be improved upon.","Flapping-Wing; compliant mechanism; Fabrication; Lift generation; Energy Efficiency; Atalanta","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

These inequalities can be violated according to the theory of quantum mechanics and have also been violated experimentally. Bell inequalities were therefore historically used to disprove local hidden variable models as an interpretation of quantum mechanics. An interesting question is to what degree Bell inequalities can be violated according to the theory of quantum mechanics. The degree to which a particular Bell inequality can be violated is quantified by the largest violation of the Bell inequality. A central question we address in this thesis is how large the largest violation can become when considering all possible Bell inequalities. In particular the CHSH-inequality, a well-known Bell inequality, has a largest violation equal to the square root of 2 and we want to find a Bell inequality with largest violation exceeding the square root of 2. This thesis consists of two main parts. In the first part we formally define Bell inequalities and the largest violation and prove several theorems about Bell inequalities. In the second part we search for Bell inequalities with largest violation exceeding the square root of 2. We do this by first approximating the largest violation of a given Bell inequality using numerical optimization. Next, using this approximation, we use numerical optimization to maximize the largest violation. Due to run-time restrictions we were only able to consider Bell inequalities with a relatively small number of terms and were unable to find any among them with largest violation exceeding the square root of 2.","Bell inequalities; violation; quantum measurement; CHSH-inequality","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics | Applied Physics","",""

In order to meet future demand, the vast amount of oﬀ-shore wind resources can be unlocked. A key technology for this task are ﬂoating wind turbines (FWTs), as they are less constrained by water depth than ﬁxed wind turbines. One challenge for FWTs is sometimes referred to as ‘negative aerodynamic damping’: interaction between the blade pitch controllers and the fore-aft motions of the ﬂoating platform (pitch and surge) can cause instabilities leading to large oscillations in platform motion and rotor speed. These interactions translate to right half-plane (RHP) zeros, limiting the system bandwidth and thereby the performance of the wind turbine. This increases the variability in the power output of the FWT. This thesis looks into a promising type of non-linear control to overcome this limit: reset control. Reset control is characterized by a higher phase compared to linear controllers. This could be used to improve the stability margins of the system and/or to increasethebandwidth.

In the default conﬁguration, large peaks are present in the control signal, leading to excessive motions of the blades. The second conﬁguration performs well under idealized circumstances, but with high frequency disturbance (such as turbulent wind or sensor noise), excessive amounts of resets prevent the controller from reacting appropriately.","wind turbine; Reset control; CgLp; Floating Wind Turbines","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Furthermore, the simulation is shown to successfully perform both a coherent real-time evolution and iteration towards the ground state.

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","Infrastructure, industry and extraction have greatly reshaped the North Sea over the last five decades. These specific elements played and still play a vital role in the growth and evolution of the North Sea and its adjacent countries. Among all the fishing and oil industry have become highly governmentally influenced machines and are imposing structural injustice on those in contact with its multi scalar impact. Both industries appear seemingly very different from each other however, both take part in the imposition in terms of pollution, territorial claims and impacts on identity and culture. This role has its direct effects on people closely linked to these systems, but also to those far beyond the boundaries of the North Sea. Their lives forever changed, with a low possibility to ever act against. One of the main reasonings behind this imposing role are the detached positions of these industries in relation to their territorial specificities. The lack of integration in terms of site specific entities such as climate, flows and culture are enhanced by its alienated and detached appearance directly result in the separation of man, machine and territory. Unfortunately, these industries are currently indispensable for our present-day lives, without them we couldn’t live as freely and developed as we do now. To act against the structural injustice imposed by the industries a new type of industry must be introduced and by means of it an energy transition. Allowing for maintaining benefits, yet without the imposed disintegration known from our current state of existence. The duality imposed by these industries is clearly notable in Bergen, Norway. Being Norway’s largest centre of sea based extraction, production, transportation, research and education Bergen has greatly benefitted from the extraction of oil and fish however always correlated by strong cases of structural injustice. On the other side of the industry stands Bergen’s unique landscape and its territorial specificities unlike any other city surrounding the North Sea. Together they embody a topography of chance suitable for this new type of industry, which is set to initialise an integrated and coalesced energy transition. Its result is a new approach to an equilibrium between all related subjects and objects, while providing a bodily experience embedded in and exposed to territory, flows and machine. The new type of industry entails a series of interventions linked to a multi scalar energy transition in terms of production and utilisation by means of direct linkage between man, machine and territory. The proposition consists of three main elements: a hydrogen production facility, a fuelling station and a bath house. Each individual element plays a critical role in the integration and coalescence of production, flows and territory to create an integrated and sustainable energy transition. The hydrogen production facility as the manifestation of integrated production and service to the city by means of both product and waste. The fuelling station as the long term solution and the possibility of reterritorialization of fjordic waters by local fishermen. And lastly the bath house as a social proposition of full process exposure, tangibility and integration. These elements make various appearances ranging from: the uncovering of present-day systems to the management of site specificities, use and enhancement of cultural aspects and the utilisation of clean energy and waste. Furthermore, a moment of reflection on the self and the structural injustice imposed by the governmental machines which we currently heavily rely on. Together acting as a statement of minimal intervention to maximise territorial use and therefore the activation of structural justice by means of integration.","Imposing industries; Structural injustice; Dual existence; Topography of chance; Energy transition; Integrated justice","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Transitional Territories","","60.3930, 5.3242"

Hence the healthcare system needs to transition towards sustainable healthcare. An approach to achieve a transition towards sustainable healthcare is the Quadruple Aim. It is a practical framework that focuses on improving the health of the population, improving the work-life of care providers, enhancing patients experience and reducing health cost. To implement these four aims, it is necessary the collaboration between multiple disciplines and the implementation of an innovative approach. Open innovation provides a space for transdisciplinary collaboration and innovation to occurs. Hence, this graduation project explores transdisciplinary collaborations in the healthcare sector, focusing on open innovation initiatives. The research question for this study is how to build effective transdisciplinary collaborations in healthcare? This graduation project took place in two countries, the Netherlands and Mexico. In the Netherlands, I realised interview research in eight open innovation initiatives. Later, in Mexico, I did a case study at the Research and Technological Development Unit inside the General Hospital of Mexico ‘Eduardo Liceaga’. Afterwards, I realised a comparative analysis between both studies, followed by a design phase to build effective transdisciplinary collaborations in healthcare. The results of the two studies present a future vision and a future-oriented strategy for the Research and Technological Development Unit to improve collaboration between actors. The future vision contributes to the alignment of the actors involved in the unit so that they can work in the same direction. The strategy is formed by three strategic lines: organisational and project development support, building a knowledge community, and promote and consolidate the unit. These strategic lines aim to guide the actors towards the future vision by suggesting a series of steps. The success of this initiative could contribute to boost innovation in healthcare. A suggestion for future research is on how design can facilitate the implementation of the strategy by considering the collaboration of all the actors present in the unit.","Transdisciplinary collaborations; Healthcare; Collaboration in healthcare","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

In this thesis two main objectives are studied. Firstly, it is studied whether the simplified analysis approaches: Simplified Lateral Mechanism Analysis (SLaMA), as described in the NPR9998-2018, and the Equivalent Frame Method (EFM) as implemented into the software package 3Muri are able to describe the seismic behavior of an Unreinforced Masonry (URM) terraced house. Secondly, the influence of the geometry of the piers in a facade is assessed. Both the objectives are studied by means of two case studies. The first case study represents a typical but idealized URM structure of a terraced house from which the seismic capacity was determined in the TU Delft lab by cyclic pushover tests. The second case study concerns a specific two-storey URM terraced house located in Groningen. The case studies are characterized by large daylight openings, slender piers and a low lateral capacity into the x-direction.","Groningen; Earthquake; NLPO; Simplified Lateral Mechanism Analysis (SLaMA); 3Muri; Nonlinear Pushover; URM; NPR9998; Equivalent frame method","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Building Engineering","",""

(mentor); van den Engel, P.J.W. (mentor); Tenpierik, M.J. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","Rising temperatures due to climate change and the increased Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect both have a major impact on Singapore’s outdoor comfort. Research has reported an average UHI in Singapore of 4°C, which can even exceed 7°C at some times of the day. (Acero &amp; Ruefenacht, 2017) Increasing convective surface heat transfer from the human body by means of induced wind speeds is an important strategy to improve outdoor thermal comfort. However, the combination of its high urban density, leading to a considerable number of obstructions for urban wind flows, and the generally low wind speeds due to its geographical proximity to the equator makes urban ventilation in Singapore challenging. (Acero &amp; Ruefenacht, 2017) Since the 1970s, void decks, open spaces at the ground floor of buildings, have become a typical characteristic of public housing flats in Singapore. These have been shown to potentially increase wind speeds by more than twofold. (Chew &amp; Norford, 2019) However, the effect of void deck geometries on the imbalance between outdoor thermal and pedestrian wind comfort in a realistic urban setting has not been addressed before.<br/>Hence, the main research question of this thesis was formulated as follows: How can the geometry design of void decks be optimized to enhance urban ventilation for outdoor thermal comfort in Singapore while ensuring good pedestrian comfort?  A strong mismatch between pedestrian wind comfort and outdoor thermal comfort was observed in the study area with the simulated monsoon wind conditions. This marks the importance to perform wind microclimate analyses in a tropical environment as Singapore, focusing on both aspects. This work demonstrates a design methodology that combines parametric design tools with CFD (computational fluid dynamics) simulations with the aim to make better wind-informed design decisions for an urban context. <br/>Using a parametric building model, ten void deck geometry variants were generated and compared. The implications of the observed flow pattern in terms of urban planning were clarified. For example, while a horizontally converging void deck geometry was found to be effective at directing the urban ventilation towards a target location due to the funnel-shaped induced wind speed region downstream, horizontally diverging void decks led to a more evenly spread region of accelerated flow along the void length. The highest amplification factors inside the void deck were obtained for a vertically diverging geometry. This geometry was subsequently applied to all the buildings facing the prevailing wind directions in the study area, Clementi, using a parametric urban model. This model allows the user to apply various void deck geometries to different building groups independently from each other based on their orientation. A comparison of the wind speed and air temperature distributions after the urban-scale intervention to the current situation showed a wind speed increase and temperature decrease in almost all the void decks. While the amplified wind speed region extended downstream of some void decks, other areas in between the buildings showed a slowed down wind flow. The temperature effects were more extreme at the more closely-packed areas with a smaller distance in between the buildings. Overall, it was concluded that the void deck modifications did not only affect the local wind microclimate inside the void decks, but also altered the wind conditions in between the buildings. Ideally, these wind speed-amplifying void decks should be used in combination with other urban cooling strategies. <br/>The proposed workflow was demonstrated for the geometry design of void decks, but is also applicable in the optimization process of other building features which may affect the urban wind microclimate, such as canopies and building podia.","urban ventilation; Singapore; outdoor thermal comfort; pedestrian wind comfort; urban cooling; urban microclimate modelling; computational fluid dynamics; CFD; OpenFOAM; parametric design; computational design; Grasshopper; urban wind flows","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Building Technology | Sustainable Design","","1.3162,103.7649"

Records can be submitted in the ledgers with various lags, because the data of many different bookkeepers is involved with different workflows. Bookkeepers can be punctual or late, therefore records can be submitted with various lags in the ledgers. This causes missing data, which results in a deformation of a time series that is constructed from these records. Using a technique called now­casting, a prediction can be made of how these series with no missing data would have looked like. <br/>This study sheds light on how information of an incomplete time series from ledgers of Dutch companies can be used to now­cast on that series, without the use of external indicators. To better utilize the information available from the series, an addition to the Seasonal Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average with eXogenous regressors (SARIMAX) model is proposed. The addition to the SARIMAX model is presented in two forms: the additive­ and multiplicative relation between indicator­ and target series. These are modeled with the goal to improve the information utilization and therefore improve the now­casting accuracy. Experiments have shown that this addition to the model does not give a direct improvement in accuracy compared to an ordinary SARIMAX model.

To create a collaborative research and design process, this research has been produced through collective research, workshops, exhibitions, design competitions and collective investigations.

By combining AI’s ability to quickly wring insights from data and the ever-growing network of connected devices and systems that generate data, companies can avoid unplanned downtime, increase operating efficiency, and enable new and enhanced products and services. Put simply, IoT acts as a digital nervous system in which AI is the brain that drives decisions. Despite the promise of AI and IoT, many organizations’ efforts to scale up seems to fall short. Companies generally start by testing the waters with a proof-of-concept and pilot project, often later grinding to halt with no clearly defined strategy to scale for a variety of reasons. By combining extensive literature study of more than 200 academic papers, 11 expert interviews, and an exploratory case study, the research explores the underlying reason why most AIoT initiatives fail to scale up by investigating four main aspects, namely the barriers to scale up, the cross-industry differences, the temporal variances, and the potential strategies for companies to escape from the “pilot purgatory.” The study reaches to an exhaustive list of 22 factors, classifying the factors into five main categories: strategy (AI/I4.0 strategy, competing investment opportunities, and technology partners), data (data quality and availability, data governance, data security and privacy, data analytics capabilities), people (top management support, user support/resistance, technology sponsors/champions, skilled staff and expertise, technology knowledge, organizational culture, organizational agility, organizational structure, and alignment between departments), process (perceived business benefits, business models/use cases and operating models), and technology (ICT capabilities and infrastructure, integration with other systems, and technology characteristics). The study also reveals that some factors tend to be more influential in certain stages. While strategic factors tend to be more prominent in the earlier stages, people and organizational factors tend to arise later when organizations roll out solutions. The research also confirmed the dominant role of top management and technology sponsors in igniting as well as leading the scale-up process. Albeit limited, two main variables stood out as cross-industry differences: regulations and digital maturity of the industry. In the study, three big points emerged as the potential strategies for companies to eliminate, or at least mitigate, the barriers. These are proof-of-value, not proof of concept, treating and managing data as a key business asset, and top-down and bottom-up support. As opposed to proving the feasibility of the technology, as many have before, organizations can start by assessing the technology from the business lens way to identify high-value use cases and prove the real value -if there is one. The research shows that companies require to pay utmost attention to collecting, structuring, and managing their data, even before initiating AIoT projects. The study discovers that the support from all levels -executive sponsorship from the top, and ensuring user acceptance and upskilling employees on the frontline- is essential to scale up, as it likely is for most digital transformations.","Artificial Intelligence; Internet of Things; Artificial Intelligence of Things; AI; IoT; AIoT; Barriers to scale up; Adoption; Strategy; Case Study","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","","51.9963° N, 4.3759° E"

Combustion inside this homogeneous reactor was simulated for various stoichiometric conditions for an initial temperature of 1000K. Subsequently, a one-dimensional model of chained reactors to simulate flow was considered, equipped with both the two-step and four-step mechanisms. This was realized using the scalar convection-diffusion equation to compute the flow throughout the reactor.

This is an improvement over current radio ranging techniques, which can achieve m-level performance. One common application of navigation data is the estimation of physical and astronomical parameters. To utilize the improved observation quality of ILR, it is necessary to use sufficiently detailed observation- and dynamical models during parameter estimation. We investigate the influence of relativistic modelling on parameter estimation quality using ILR data. Simulated parameter estimation experiments involving a Juno-like Jovian orbiter were used to gauge the impact of 22 different relativistic effects. The spacecraft's initial state, the mass of Jupiter and two post-Newtonian parameters were estimated in each experiment. Parameter estimation error, observation errors and estimation residuals were used as metrics to quantify the influence of each effect. Rough preliminary estimates of an effect's magnitude were found to be a good predictor of the actual impact on estimation error, with some exceptions. Excluding the gravitational influence of Jupiter's velocity and the Jupiter-Sun coupled gravity resulted in almost no change in estimation error, likely due to compensation by the Newtonian gravity term. Similar compensatory relationships can be identified by comparing mean observation errors with mean estimation residuals. Including empirical accelerations in the estimation process reduces the impact of these outliers.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

This is mainly due to the linear economy model which is still the dominant model nowadays. This model has been proven to be unsustainable, and it has put an enormous stress in the environment. For this reason, different approaches need to be integrated into the building industry. Designing with the aid of an environmental impact assessment framework is one approach to consider the degradation to the environment, product of a building design. By quantifying the amount of embodied energy and carbon footprint related to a desired acoustic and thermal insulation in a building, designers and engineers can take eco-informed decisions, which not only bring ecological benefits, but also material savings.<br/><br/>The focus of this thesis is on the facade level, which belongs to the ‘‘skin’’ of the building according to Brand (1994).

Additionally, the relationship between the environment and the built environment is explored, as well as the building industry in the Netherlands with the aim of identifying the most used facade systems.

A model concerning the mid-plane stretching and an electric force with a direct and alternating current component is formulated. The method of multiple scales is used to construct a solution that is valid for a long time after the initial conditions. The effect of the frequency of the alternating current was studied by performing a stability analysis. The results show that for frequencies close to the eigenfrequency of the homogeneous problem, there is no stable equilibrium and resonance occurs. Furthermore, a start was made to study the effect of the damping coefficient. The results show that a smaller damping will always lead to resonance on a very small time scale. The results also indicate larger oscillations and an small increase of the importance of the non-linear terms for smaller damping. All results are validated by comparing them with a numeric solution and show excellent agreement.","Method of multiple scales; MEMS; Microbeam","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Within the numerous challenges due to Climate change and Urbanisation, water ranks the highest as a risk to the society. This risk ranges from water related catastrophes like floods to availability of portable water to the growing population. There are many cities in the world that are threaten with this issue. One global city, that witnesses severe water related risks is Jakarta. Jakarta has been reported flooding as early as in the year of 1621 and since then there has various flood events over the years. In the olden times the kampungs and desakotas developed ways to live with the water forming a very sustainable and close relationship with their river system. But as Jakarta grew into a metropolis with problems and focus getting bigger and diverse, the focus shifted to an infrastructure-oriented development with which the perception of the river and kampungs began to change. A lot of alterations were and are still constantly being made to the physical morphology of both the river and the kampungs leaving them without an identity. At present the Kampungs are the “informal trouble” to the city and the rivers are canalized drains of water and waste.<br/><br/>The shift to a constant dependency on linear approaches of flood management and inequity in the planning policies leaves the Kampungs and river network vulnerable to the imbalance in the natural- built systems. <br/><br/>Therefore, the outcome of the project aims to look at an alternate perspective to approach the flood and water management structure of the city of Jakarta. It is done by looking at “urban poor not as a problem but as a part of the solution” to primarily address the issue of flooding. The project also aims to investigate ways to integrate them as a key component of the larger water management schemes. The urban poor in the Kampungs of Jakarta show a strong potential due to the deep engraved sense of community and affinity to the river and its cultural symbolism. These socio-cultural values of the people within the kampungs could be a key factor in bringing about a behavioral shift in the way they treat their rivers or immediate water systems. Bottom-up interventions within these Kampungs integrated with a top-down strategic plan could reduce a significant amount of stress on the river system and improve the socio-ecological values of the river<br","Urban river deltas; Flood resilience; Kampungs; Landscape infrastructure; Adaptive urban landscape transformations","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Landscape Architecture","Flowscapes Landscape Architecture",""

To mitigate the effects of high variability and low availability of water in the region, governments have been investing, since the 1960s, in the construction of dams to stop the loss of water to the ocean, and water channels, to quickly distribute the stored water to places of greatest demand. Of the 10 states in the Brazilian seminary, the one with the largest amount of waterworks is Ceará, where the largest reservoir in Latin America is also found, Castanhão, built in the middle third of the Jaguaribe river, whose basin drains 50% of the state’s territory. The construction of the Castanhão dam demanded, among other actions, the resettlement of the urban centre of the city Jaguaribara, which had 2/3 of its territory flooded to make way for stored water.<br/><br/>The initial study showed the unsustainability of the regional water system and a series of problems regarding the use and availability of water in Jaguaribara. Such observation aroused the hypothesis that local water management could be improved by combining engineering and nature-base solutions, considering the inhabitants of Jaguaribara and the unique biome of Brazilian semiarid, the Caatinga. Therefore, the present work adopts the research through design strategy (RTD) and starts from the analysis of the wetness Ceará and Jaguaribara, to propose design strategies that aim to establish a wetness retention landscape in Jaguaribara - also stretching these ideas at a larger scale. As result, the design strategies were evaluated for their effectiveness in terms of creating an autonomous and drought-resilient community, being classified into seven types, according to their specific objectives and areas of implementation.","Water retention (urban) landscap; Holding wetness; Drought-resilient community; Wetness; Drought resilience; Caatinga biome; Semiarid; Semi-arid Climate","en","master thesis","","","","","","For citations, please use: Veras Morais, M.

The community of the neighbourhood and the everyday life of the residents became overlooked with the city shining it’s spotlights on the international stage. The neighbourhoods of Brussels become audiences to the city, not the actors.<br/>The neighbourhood is to ignored no longer. Everyday life is a performance. As time passes people work, dwell, consume and express in an ongoing dialogue between the characters of the neighbourhood and the stage sets they perform on. Through staging everyday life value is given to these performances; a spontaneous discussion amongst neighbours, the captivation and amusement of a child, a moment of respite and relief from the city. The careful understanding of the relationship between stage and character puts the people of the neighbourhood in the limelight, their lives become the story to be told that the surrounding city audience should view. <br/>Stage sets of public life are to be engrained into the urban blocks of the neighbourhood, anchoring their worth into the physical form of city and pronouncing their integrity with their embracement of local material and technique. An architecture of modesty is to be achieved, functioning as scenery to the performance, keeping the spotlight on people and their value in creating in the neighbourhood. Future development is going to happen. These stages of public life are fundamental to preserving the character of a place, to ensure the performance of everyday life can go on.<br/>Derived from Latin ""spolium"" (plural: ""spolia""), the term spolia is used in archaeology meaning ""spoils"" (as in ""spoils of war""), booty or loot, typically seen in Greek or Roman architectural sculpture. It refers to the cut stones or decorative elements from older buildings that are re-used for new construction as an economical alternative to quarried stone which was more expensive. <br/>The principle can surpass the re-appropriation of material to that of a defined approach to architecture. The spoils are found in the existing space and form of the built fabric, the traces of memory within evolved site and the everyday routines, use and occupation of the people in their neighbourhood. It’s an approach of attentiveness, with concern for that which exists, with a passion for the task of making something from something. It is a technique of reaction. With thorough observation the existing elements of the site are to be negotiated with, understanding their value and how they can be redefined to benefit the needs of the present. <br/>The value of the neighbourhood needs to be reaffirmed. The stage needs to be set around the people that act immediately upon the city and that give life to its character. Through an architecture of modesty, stage sets of public life can be ingrained into the urban blocks, ensuring their preservation. Through the principles of spolia, value can be discovered in everything and gifted back to the people.<br/>As the film producer Karel Reisz has said, looking back on his work, “It is about wanting what you got, rather than going out and getting what you want.” <br","Everyday; Reuse; Refurbishment; public space; warehouse; BRICK; polycarbonate","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Urbanism","","50.83503, 4.32139"

The High Line spans a highly heterogeneous area (socially as well as architecturally). The park is by many considered as beautifully designed, yet also controversial. The construction led to several major unintended consequences, defined as The High Line Effect: (1) Real estate boom: over 50 projects, worth $2 billion have been developed since the construction of the High Line in 2009 began, most of them extremely exclusive, leading to the phenomenon of super-gentrification, but also resulting in $65 million tax revenue annually for the City of New York. (2) The High Line is used by a heterogeneous user group in different ways, but overflooded by tourists (about 8 million a year) while it was meant to serve the local community. The High Line has been copied all over the world with similar consequences and research shows that not only High Lines but public space in general can produce similar effects. <br/><br/>The design of Penn Globe, a 40.000m² hybrid of a market, gallery and apartments, located in a pedestrianized area, examines the social and economic effect of public space on its surroundings, by not simply copying the High Line but by creating a public point in a currently mono-functional residential social housing neighborhood: Penn South. The ambition is to instigate redevelopment in the area by tying it back together locally while opening it up 'globally' to the rest of Midtown Manhattan. By integrating public space better programmatically and spatially into its urban logic, negative consequences of The High Line Effect can be minimized and a more balanced amount of social and economic value can be created.","architecture; complex projects; public space; public building; New York City; Midtown Manhattan; Market; Housing; Gallery","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Complex Projects","NY Midtown Graduation Studio","40.747817, -73.998556"

It will also be critical that damage tolerance and safety are not compromised in the process. Lattice materials represents one avenue of exploration; however, two key challenges arise: limited experimental work has been conducted to date regarding tensile mechanical response and lattice materials are generally considered to be less tough than traditional aerospace materials. Advancements in additive manufacturing in recent years creates the opportunity to rapidly produce high-quality complex geometries, allowing for both challenges to be more easily investigated. To address the issue of toughness and damage tolerance, nature is a source of inspiration, as all of nature’s toughest materials derive this characteristic from creating structural hierarchy using intrinsically weak<br/>building blocks.<br/><br/>Two sets of lattice structures were fabricated using stereolithographic (SLA) 3D printing and tested under quasi-static tensile loading. Two sets of lattices were fabricated: lattices with uniform strut thickness, or relative density, and mixed-relative density lattices which create structural hierarchy. Using a novel method to track lattice deformation during loading, lattice stiffness-displacement response has been correlated with beam elongation and rotation behavior and the deformation of individual cells. The stiffness-displacement response of uniform lattices can be classified by relative density as either an elastomeric, elastoplastic, or hybrid response. In hierarchical lattices, cell deformations occurring in different relative density regions are directly correlated to features of the stiffness-displacement response.<br/><br/>Aspects of the mechanical response of hierarchical lattices, particularly fracture toughness and fracture pattern, are heavily influenced by the exact configuration of structural hierarchy, spurring a discussion of what characteristics are most important in the pursuit of increased lattice damage tolerance. While none of the lattices represent an optimal solution, each displayed characteristics which, if combined to<br/>form a hybrid structure, could substantially improve lattice damage tolerance.","lattice structure; cellular solid; metamaterials; structural hierarchy; additive manufacturing; stereolithography; damage tolerance; fracture behavior; biomimicry; lightweight; Digital Image Correlation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

The parareal algorithm is designed to generate an approximation to an initial value problem faster than a serial numerical time-integration method by using two propagators, the coarse propagator and the fine propagator. With the use of two different propagators, some computations can be carried out in parallel, which leads to a faster method. In this research, the parareal algorithm is executed on the two-step mechanism for combustion of methane. The temperature rise due to the combustion is assumed to be zero. The model is implemented in Python and with the use of the librarymultiprocessing, computations are executed in parallel. Different time-integration methods are implemented that can be used in the coarse and fine propagator. In this research, we will focus on the case that the both propagators use the same time-integration method. One can distinguish the propagators by using a different time-step for a chosen time-integration method. With the use of the absolute error the accuracy can be examined. Because the analytic solution to the problem for combustion of methane is unknown, a time-integration method, from which we know that it gives a small absolute error, is used as representation of the analytic solution. The parareal algorithm executed on the model for combustion of methane gives an accurate result for the right choice of propagators. However, for this choice of propagators, the parareal algorithm does not result in a significant speedup compared to the fine propagator in serial, assuming that we have enough processors available. This is because the running time of the propagators do not differ much. To generate a better speedup, two different time-integration methods can be considered for the propagators. Moreover, the model for combustion of methane can be divided into more than two partial reaction and then themulti-level parallelization [1] can be examined.","","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics","",""

Environmental problems are substantial and it's known that economic growth contributes to them. In addition, social inequality in society has grown. As a response, the concept of sustainable development has come up, but to date businesses find this hard to implement in their ways of working. As societal pressure is increasing, a growing trend can be seen by pioneering businesses, social entrepreneurs and impact investors working towards an impact economy. In the built environment, however, the concepts of ‘impact thinking’ or ‘social entrepreneurship’ are still very much unknown. Although some institutional investors have adopted an ESG-approach for their investments and a number of developers have started to brand themselves as sustainable, to date there is barely no evidence suggesting that this actually leads to positive societal impact. Very few parties in the built environment place impact first in their corporate strategy or measure the impacts they make. As the built environment is responsible for many environmental and social problems, this is something that needs to change. This thesis therefore researches in what ways impact thinking can be implemented into (urban) development, from the perspective of the social entrepreneurial developer. The first part of the research was conducted through a literature study, the second part through a combination of qualitative and design research. A total of 16 interviews have been conducted with impact developers, impact investors and urban development experts. Based on findings, a first definition for impact development is given, its barriers an drivers are formulated and six principles for impact development are proposed. Through a collaborative research through design approach, also an example impact development was designed: a social-impact based plan for the gentrifying neighborhood Wielewaal. The research outcomes aim to inspire private parties in urban or real estate development to place impact first in their ways of working. In doing so, this thesis aims to open the dialogue about the responsibility of businesses to society and our cities and help developers and municipalities work towards more long-term sustainable and fair urban developments. For impact thinking to really take a flight in (urban) development, taxing or incentivizing impact by the government is necessary.","Impact economy; Impact thinking; Social impact; Urban and real estate development; Gentrification; Gentlyfication; Social entrepreneurship; CSR","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Management in the Built Environment","",""

Urban environments affect our body and state of mind, and are not always beneficial for our mental health. Landscape and urban design can do something about this. But the question is how? The city of Amsterdam is used as a location to investigate this. The city is surrounded with a diverse metropolitan landscape, which enters far into the city in the form of green wedges, also called the Scheggen. Amsterdam has a long history in investing in green spaces during urban expansions. Since the sixteenth century every period of growth has been accompanied by planned investment in green spaces. First by planting trees along the canals in the sixteenth century. Than by creating city parks in the nineteenth century. The existing green structure was planned during the General Expansion Plan in 1934, made by van Eesteren. The purpose of the General Expansion Plan was not only to expand urban development but also to create a balance between city and green space. This green structure ensures that every resident of Amsterdam can reach a green space within ten minutes, even from the heart of the city centre. Nowadays, the city of Amsterdam has to deal with the following problems. Firstly, the big pressure on the housing market, is forcing the city to densify as well as expand outside of its current urban borders, which makes the Scheggen vulnerable. Not only densification is a problem, but also the fact that more and more people suffer from mental health issues, such as stress, burn-outs, anxiety and depression. Of course we all need a little bit of stress, but if people cannot restore from too much stress for a prolonged period of time, their health will be negatively affected in many ways. Additionally, the city also has to deal with a number of other complex issues, such as climate change issues and biodiversity loss. This has led to the main research question: How can a forest park be designed in such a way that it contributes to reducing mental stress in an urban environment? The findings from the literature study provided evidence that a forest park can contribute to reduce mental stress. Visiting or viewing a forest has a positive effect on people’s mental health and recovering from stress, especially for people from urban environments. The literature study, together with a thorough site research, formed the site specific design principles for the design intervention. The result of this thesis is a design proposal for an urban forest park for Amsterdam Sloterdijk. The project shows that the design proposal for a forest park not only contributes to reduce mental stress in an urban environment, but also increases biodiversity, and acts as a climate buffer by managing rainwater and cooling the environment.","urban forest; healing nature; urban development; densification; liveability; human behaviour; mental health; restorative nature; sensorial design; landscape design; amsterdam","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Landscape Architecture","","52.386654, 4.824552"

It is also about stratification, of adding layers to a story that continues when the spolia is given a new life. The research focused on time and the unfinished, exploring the relationship between architecture and time. Architecture is subjected to the social forces of time, defined by the change of users and functions over time. Buildings are usually designed to be a finished product, with a specific use, leaving the time factor out of the equation. This often leads to vacancy or underuse, due to the inability of the building to adapt to new uses or undergo a transformation to accommodate new uses. Aiming for the unfinished allows time to take its course. Like spolia, a building can acquire new meanings – or a new life – when transformed. This stratification of layers of time, materials and uses, turns the building into a story that will never be complete, evolving and adapting to respond to occurrences over time.","Reuse; Civic center; Industrial; Spolia; Unfinished","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","",""

Early detection of health related problems in both healthy and people with medical problems, will catch problems early and prevent the need for more costly procedures. One of these medical problems is concerning the hydration level. Dehydration most often occurs for elderly people. To prevent sickness and even death, monitoring of the hydration can play a key factor in prevention. Hydration monitoring can be established by using a designed CMOS permittivity sensor. However, to design a commonly used hydration monitoring device, this CMOS permittivity sensor needs to be designed in such a way that portable sensing could be enabled. To design such a portable hydration sensor from an application sensor, different steps are required. To bring previously developed sensor to enable hydration monitoring, it need to be packaged in such a way that it can sense the medium of interest and be connected to the outside world while sufficiently protected, so that it will not damage during use. Different packaging procedures could be distinguished to accomplish this. The first packaging procedure is regarding the creation of SU8 metallized pillars. The second packaging procedure is for creation of cavities in SU8 and fill these cavities with aluminium particles. Besides the packaging of the sensor chip, validation measurements are required to ensure that a relationship could be detected with the permittivity sensor between the hydration level of the human skin. To enable measurements of the skin permittivity without bulky systems, a PCB layout should be designed.","CMOS permittivity sensor,; Dielectric spectroscopy; Hydration monitoring","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering","",""

The main research question is: How is the structural material for a high rise building in the Netherlands chosen and how can this process become structured? Currently of the buildings in the Netherlands above 120 m, 86% have only reinforced concrete as structural material. This raises the question if the preference in the Netherlands for concrete comes from a clear decision-making process or if it originates elsewhere? In theory this decision-making process follows an organized cycle called the Basic design cycle. In practice preferences based on experience gained from former projects play a role, which results in deviation from the theoretical decision-making process. By gaining insight in the differences between theory and practice in the decision-making process, this thesis tries to identify the main differences arising in the structural material choice process. Four differences between theory and practice – regarding the structural material choice process of high rise buildings in the Netherlands – have been identified. By conducting interviews, these differences between theory and practice have been further researched and confirmed. (1) Disproportionately less steel is used for the main load-bearing structure of high rise buildings in the Netherlands. (2) Reasoning behind design decisions is often not made clear. (3) Building methods of contractors influence the structural material choice. (4) Arguments and expectation don’t match reality. For example, figures based on the construction time of the buildings in the Netherlands above 120 m show that prefab concrete buildings don’t always have a shorter construction time than cast in-situ concrete. In this thesis Difference 2 and 3 are combined and addressed together by creating an advisory excel-tool. The goal of this excel-tool is to give the structural engineer – early in the design process of a high rise project – insight in the influence of the structural typology on: cost (direct and indirect costs) and sustainability (environmental cost). Early in the design process very little details are available about the design of the high rise building and a lot of things can still change. Because of that, the input of the tool is kept simple: the height of the high rise building. As output a top ten of structural combinations is given. The structural combinations are a combinations of (1) stability system, (2) structural material and (3) floor type. This top ten is determined by calculating the (direct and indirect) costs and the environmental cost (sustainability) of twenty-six different structural combinations at all heights within the height range of that stability system. Eventually the top ten shows which out of the twenty-six structural combinations have the lowest (direct and indirect) costs and the lowest environmental cost (sustainability). This way a structural engineer can explore early in the design process what the influence of his or her design choices are on the final result and take the top ten structural combinations into consideration.","High Rise; Sustainabilty; Environmental cost; Cost; Indirect cost; Direct cost; Tool; Structural material; Decision-making framework; Decision-making process; Netherlands; Basic design cycle; Differences theory and practice","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Building Engineering - Structural Design","",""

Amongst the healable polymer classes, thermoplastic polyurethanes have received increasing attention in the last years. This is mainly due to their broad application areas, the variety of chemical platforms that can be used, and the potential use of hydrogen bonding to assist the healing process. However, the combination of good mechanical properties and healing at near room temperature remains challenging. In order to learn how to find a better balance between healing and mechanical properties, dedicated studies on the impact of the monomer chemical architecture on the overall polymer performance are needed.In this work we study the impact of monomer mixtures with different chemical composition on the overall mechanical and healing behaviour of self-healing thermoplastic polyurethanes based on CroHeal™ 2000, biopolyol. The polymers are synthesized via one-shot technique, starting from three constituents: a long chain diol (CroHeal™ 2000), a chain extender (EHD) and a diisocyanate (aromatics - MDI and PPDI, and aliphatic - HMDI) or diisocyanate mixtures (MDI/HMDI and MDI/PPDI in different ratios).Fracture tests using Single Edge Notch Tension specimens show a clear increase in mechanical properties and interfacial strength recovery after damage for short healing times at room temperature when using higher aromatic content in the isocyanate mixture. Furthermore, IR mapping showed that initial compositional heterogeneity is decreased when more aliphatic isocyanates are used but also when longer annealing times are applied in the case of aromatic diisocyanates. The presence of compositional heterogeneities does not influence the healing response under the conditions studied.","self-healing; polymers; TPU; polyurethane; aliphatic diisocyanate; aromatic diisocyanate","en","student report","","","","","","","","2022-07-10","","","","Aerospace Engineering | Novel Aerospace Materials","",""

Although lightweight lattice structures have been widely investigated in various fields owing to their advantages in terms of their mechanical characteristics and the development of additive manufacturing, research on lattice structures has focused mainly on process and design methods for structural development, and not on the repair of lattice structures. In the present study, the repairability of lattice structures was studied to extend the lifetimes of lattice-structured products; this would enable the reuse of products and induce people to directly get involved in creating a circular economy. To determine the factors to be considered for repairing lattice structures, standard specimens fabricated in the form of single undivided and adhesively bonded joint samples were fabricated by fused deposition modeling and compared under four quasi-static tests: compression, tensile, shear, and three-point bending. The octet-truss unit cell was used in the specimen with a strut diameter of 1–2.5 mm at 0.5 mm intervals and a length of 10 mm. The difference in mechanical response between the two groups was significant in the tensile and three-point bending tests, while the compressive and shear tests showed similar results. Therefore, determination of the direction of the stress imposed on the products is essential for the proper repair of the underlying lattice structures, prolonging the life cycle of the product and thus leading to a positive effect on the circular economy.","lattice structure; octet-truss; additive manufacturing; mechanical response; repairing; circular economy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

Co-creation aims to achieve this by involving stakeholders throughout the process. Including all these different opinions makes co-creation activities increasingly complex, risking the quality of the outcome (Agueverre et al., 2020).<br/><br/>This thesis aims to unravel the complexity of these activities in designer-client co-creation projects. The designers targeted in this study are the designers of the consultancy Unplugged, based in Amsterdam. Unplugged aims to discover business opportunities together with their client, to take steps towards transformation. The assignment from Unplugged was to perform research into the ideation phase, as this is often experienced as difficult in practice, especially in the context of co-creation.<br/><br/>Through semi-structured interviews with the designers of Unplugged and several extensive literature reviews, three iterations were performed to get to the core of the complexity. The first iteration showed that the design proces, as a designer wants to perform it, is continuously disrupted. Three disrupting factors were identified: 1) the projects are stuck between design and research, 2) the client does not have a sufficient understanding of innovation, and 3) the designers do not have enough influence on the projects.<br/><br/>From these factors, it was concluded, in the second iteration, that there is a lack of autonomy for the designers of Unplugged. Based on this insight, an extensive literature review was conducted to discover the cause of the lack of autonomy. This literature review showed that there exists a tension between autonomy (independence) and conformity (obedience) in the context of social trusteeship (acting in the best interest of the client), or: “Do you give the client what they ask, or what they need?”<br/><br/>Through synthesis it was revealed that this tension is strengthened by the difference in perceived status of the respective members of the co-creation team and a misunderstanding of each other’s expertise. This difference leads to a power imbalance in which the designers have taken on a facilitating role, whereas the client takes the dominant role. Resulting in the client taking over the project and limiting the input of the designers expertise.<br/><br/>In the third iteration, roles are introduced for both the designer and client. These roles aim to ensure that each actors expertise is used in the correct way and at the correct time in the project by eliminating the power hierarchy in the project, through dialogue. Based on these roles, a new approach is introduced to designer-client interactions in which a rich understanding about each other’s expertise is created. <br/><br/>In conclusion, this thesis proposes a new approach to designer-client co-creation projects based on roles. This new approach aims to free designers from their facilitating role by creating a rich understanding between designer and client through dialogue.","Autonomy; Design; Roles; Dialogue; Co-creation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","China is facing the dual challenges of urbanization and motorization（Jing, 2008）. The poorly organized urban centers and traditional residential planning are unable to meet the increasingly diverse demand of people. To solve these problems, the TOD model and the emerging community living circle are being favored by policy makers. Promoting urban construction based on the land development model of large-capacity rail transit station becomes a common understanding in many cities (Xuewu &amp; Meng, 2018). However, faced with chaotic urban layout, mixed functions, and complicated land use, the new modes of transportation (rail) and the built-up areas (communities) create incompatibility. The issue of coordinated development of rail stations and communities is receiving increasing attention. Simultaneously, the uneven distribution of public facilities prompts the community living circle to emerge as a means of planning innovation. However, the theoretical division of the station influencing realm and community living circle is not applicable to mountain cities. In the context of complex mountain terrain, the way in which the two describe the space with a fixed distance as the radius is inconsistent with actual experience of people. So, this paper redefines the station influencing realm and community living circle, and delimits the radiation range of the two with the walking time of 15 minutes. Moreover, the connection area affected by both can reflect the spatial coupling and accessibility of the two spaces. At the same time, the connection area has low coupling degree and poor space quality in the mountain city. Therefore, the design strategy for the connection space of mountain cities needs to be updated and optimized. This paper will review the literature on TOD models and their associated station influencing realm and link them to residential district planning and start-up concept of community living circle to better explore their dynamic relationships and build a set of operational models and assessment systems, achieving a balance between transportation, high density and high-quality space experience.","Community living circle, Station influencing realm, TOD, Residential district planning , Rail system, Mountain topography","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The crop grows perfectly on the Dutch soils, so the material is locally attuned. There are low fertilizer and pesticide requirements, which makes the crop relatively environmentally friendly (Lewandowski, Clifton-Brown, Scurlock &amp; Huisman, 2000). The elephant grass has a high absorption of CO2. This material sounds promising, and therefore, research is done on the unique qualities of this material: what fitting application areas of the material are, and what questions arise when designing with this material. The project definition is as follows: exploring the possibilities of designing with elephant grass based bioplastic. During the first phase of this research the unique qualities of this bioplastic are explored and they are connected to application areas that fit the material. While doing this analysis, a method is designed that can be used for exploring the unique qualities of a new material. The Vibers bioplastic has the unique quality that it is bio-based and biodegradable, and due to its look and feel, users link it directly to a sustainable material. The elephant grass fibres have captured a large amount of CO2 from the air. Also they add stiffness to the material. With this unique quality, a structured way of opportunity finding is used in order to identify the right fit for the material.In the second phase of the report the method ‘research through design’ is used to explore the material further while designing two concepts of a veranda bench. The veranda bench is chosen to continue the project with since the unique qualities of the material add value to the product. Also this application has multiple conflicting requirements, which can lead to interesting design questions. The goal of this exploration is not to design the best veranda bench, but to get to know the material better, and to set up design guidelines for designing with Vibers bioplastic. During the design process several design questions arose that needed to be answered in order to design with this material. Answering those questions gave insights in the strength, production, UV resistance and end-of-life scenarios of the material. In the conclusion of this research, the findings are converted to design guidelines and recommendations. The design guidelines are meant to help designers that want to use this material. They explain the following: (1) The material should add value to the product. (2) The material has environmental benefits. (3) The material has a sustainable look and feel that should be used. (4) How production depends on the desired end-of-life scenario of the product. (5) What plastic the material is comparable to. (6) What the end-of-life possibilities are with this material. (7) That the material does not change colour in UV exposure. (8) How different percentages of elephant grass can change the material. (9) That the material is fit for durable and timeless design. (10) That the material is fit for modular design.The recommendations are meant to help Vibers develop their material. Firstly, a method is explained that they can use for exploring new materials. Secondly, a recommendation is given on what application areas are fit for their material. Thirdly, a to-do list is made, which explains what questions have not been answered in this thesis and thus need follow-up research. Lastly, the writer gives advice on how transparency is key to a more sustainable world.","Miscanthus; Elephant grass; Sustainabilty; Biobased plastic; Design guidelines; Research through design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

It is the companies mission to capture anopheles mosquitoes before they can bite and contribute to reducing malaria transmission in Africa and other malaria zones around the world. To be able to achieve their goal, PreMal aims to implement high numbers of traps in the field. This project has been initiated to assist PreMal in their journey towards implementing their mosquito traps as an add-on product to the Solar Home System (SHS) market. Next to PreMal, SolarWorks! (SW) is the second party connected to this project. This is a SHS distributor that was established in The Netherlands but operates in Mozambique and Malawi, both Sub-Saharan African countries. PreMal partnered-up with SW for the promotion, sales, distribution, and support of their products. This way PreMal gained access to a wide, growing, target group of people that could benefit from their product. The challenging part of this project was to design a Product-Service-System that was able to connect the two main stakeholders in their wishes and needs while at the same time staying customer centered. To be able to design this system, desk and field research was conducted and literature was supported with field work findings to build a stable framework to build upon. During the desk research phase information was gathered about SHS, SW, the BoP customer, PAYG-payment models, and PSS. Main findings include that a PSS with a PAYG payment model would suit both the distributing company and the customer. While during field research in Malawi the key findings that arose were related to practical manners such as when people would be able to pay for a product, how they would prefer to pick-up sachets and how the promotion and sales process of the product could look like. The decisions that had to be made in the design phase were backed by arguments from the desk and field research phases. The PSS that was developed could be divided in six elements that cover the journey of the MTego mosquito trap from development through distribution and use, towards end-of-life. Key decisions were that the product will be sold mainly in a package with a SHS, that odour sachets must be picked up in the stores of SW, that PAYG services will be used to offer contract periods of up to 18 months, and that people that already own a SHS have the ability to buy the product separately with a short, 6-month PAYG-contract. This report concludes with recommendations for further research that include reducing the price of the product to reach a bigger target audience, developing a smaller and cheaper edition of the MTego for inside use, and research into the best way to create mosquito-free zones in rural communities.","Base of the pyramid; Product-Service-System; Solar Home System; malaria; mosquito trap","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

Body-powered hook prostheses provide good control due to their proprioceptive feedback but are in general not efficient nor appealing. The WILMER group has developed an appealing voluntary-opening prehensor by building all mechanical parts inside the prosthetic cover. The voluntary closing (VC) version, the Tweezer, has slight advantages over the voluntary opening but failed to provide sufficient energy transmission within the available space to which hydraulics offer the solution. The objective is to develop and evaluate a hydraulic VC mechanism within a body powered hook prosthesis that meets the main requirements. Methods A hydraulic system was designed. The system shall transmit a 32 N and a 6.4 N actuation force, when holding objects for a prolonged time, to a 7 N pinch force. A maximum 40 mm actuation displacement shall close the hook from a 50° open to a 0° closed position. The system shall fit inside the prosthetic cover and have a maximum mass of 43 g. A prototype was built and tested to measure its performance. Results The design consists of three hydraulic actuators: a master cylinder, a slave cylinder and a pressure intensifier. The user actuates the master cylinder, which is incorporated in the harness, causing fluid to be transferred to a slave cylinder in the prosthesis that closes the hook to grasp objects. When an object is met the pressure intensifier amplifies the pressure of the slave to increase the pinch force to 45 – 53 N and 9 – 11 N for actuation forces 32 and 6.4 N respectively. The actuation displacement equals 26 mm. The prototype failed to be manufactured properly within the given time and a simplified version, equal to the inactive pressure intensifier, has been made to prove part of the concept. Theoretically, the simplified version closes the hook with an actuation displacement of 11 mm and reaches pinch forces of 5 – 6 N over the hook range. The prototype closes the hook with 12 mm and reaches pinch forces 3 – 5 N. It takes 4 N to reopen the hook. The simplified version weighs only 15 g and fits easily inside the prosthetic cover. The mechanism provides proprioceptive feedback at the master cylinder. Conclusion Part of the concept has been proven. Theoretically, by adjusting the simplified versions parameters the 32 N actuation force could generate pinch forces 16 – 19 N with a 34 mm actuation displacement. It would outperform other body powered prostheses in terms of force transmission. The hydraulic VC mechanism has the potential to transfer a comfortable actuation force and displacement into the required pinch force within the available space of the Tweezer. Thus, a voluntary closing hook prosthesis is designed that can satisfy all user requirements control, comfort and cosmesis.","body-powered; prosthesis; Hydraulic; Upper-limb; voluntary closing; design; Development","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

Infections can occur directly via contact with infected people, but also indirectly via infected water. Because of these direct, but especially indirect infections, it is useful to investigate the spread of the disease using mathematical epidemic models. In this report a compartmental epidemic model for cholera is discussed: the SIRB model. This model consists of four compartments: susceptibles, infected, recovered and the bacterial concentration in water. The interaction between the groups is given by a system of differential equations. The equilibrium solutions and their stabilityare mathematically analysed. The main focus of this report, however, is on two different spatial models. The patches model consists of multiple patches connected by migration of people. Different measures against cholera are studied using this model. The second spatial model that has been numerically implemented is a diffusion SIRB model. The influence of the diffusion coefficients on the solution patterns will be researched for different initial conditions. The results presented in this report are building blocks for further research into compartmental models that simulate the spatial dynamics of cholera.","mathematical model; epidemic; cholera; diffusion model","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics","",""

This research builds upon an existing model for designing MES, coupling both temporal and geographical constraints for the investment planning of three energy networks. Large problem instances and complicating substructures of the model result in excessive computing times. This research therefore focuses on improving computation times of finding (near) optimal solutions. First, within a theoretical framework, the computational complexity of the model is investigated for insight into the worst-case performance of algorithms and interesting substructures. Second, in a practical setting, an empirical research with different problem instances will be performed, to investigate the efficiency of different methods within the branch-and-cut algorithm, such as parameter adjustments for the solver, the consideration of an existing network and the implementation of valid inequalities. Third, decomposition methods are compared. It appears that, overall, the MIP solver with the additional valid inequalities performs best.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics","",""

The changing climate can affect the way we appropriate urban outdoor spaces which will affect the social sustainability in the city, so adaptation strategies in cities are necessary. Urban designers should create conditions to maintain the quality of life in these spaces and therefore the question is asked: “How can urban design improve the urban microclimate of- and (temporary) appropriation in urban outdoor spaces to make Milan sustainable towards 2100? This thesis is in search of urban design solutions for a social- and environmentally sustainable development of cities in the future. To achieve this the thesis will elaborate at first on temporary appropriation and the guidelines that urban designers should take into account to create (a) pleasant walkability, places for staying and soft edges. Secondly, it will elaborate on urban microclimate and it’s guidelines. Thirdly, and most importantly, the relations between appropriation and urban microclimate will be explained. Through a strong analysis of the theoretical subjects and an analysis of Milan as a case study a vision and design strategy is developed. On different spatial scales, the projects show the opportunities and necessary actions that should be taken to create a sustainable living environment towards 2100. Design methods are used to research how urban designers can make the spatial translation of the theoretical guidelines and these solutions are shown in a handbook called: “Climability solutions for urban design”. These solutions have been applied to multiple project locations in Milan where is shown how the solutions work, who is involved and which necessary actions are needed. After all, to create a sustainable environment towards 2100 interventions on different scale levels should be designed with great attention to the urban microclimate and appropriation of urban outdoor spaces. Designers should be more climate aware and should integrate choice in their design where people should have many opportunities to appropriate the space and to choose a microclimate that is pleasant for them. This research can be extended by site visits with interviews of residents and professionals in the fields of social- and environmental sustainability. Moreover, more extensive use of design tools, like ENVI-met, will give more insight into the design of urban microclimate and will improve the design ideas.","Urban microclimate; Appropriation; Liveability; Climate change adaptation; Milan, Italy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","","45.4654219, 9.1859243"

(mentor); Hooimeijer, F.L. (mentor); Clarke, Nicholas (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","In an excerpt from the fictional work “Waterland” (Swift, 1992), the narrator labels water as “Nothing,” implying land and humans as “Something.” This was more of a philosophical expression that can alternatively be inferred from the real-world processes like land reclamation. Land was always associated with value, stability, certainty and utility in contrast to water. Subsequently, early civilizations and modern-day habitations fundamentally removed or controlled water. However, the traditional water systems did this in a more sustainable fashion. Here, water management was a unit of cultural expression of the site-specific challenges faced by people, be it in terms of topography, climate or social hierarchy. One such traditional water system, where land and water assumed identities of being something and nothing respectively is the “Kuttanad Kayalnilam Farming System”: a long-established land-water utilization system that practices paddy farming below sea level for more than a century now in Kerala, India. Positioned at the mouth of a delta, this agrarian landscape deals with the threat of periodically fluctuating water levels resulting in seasonal flooding which adversely influences the livelihood of the inhabitants. Taking the case of the Kuttanad deltaic landscape, this thesis brings to the foreground, a radical departure from the tenets of classical terrestrial centric approaches in geography and landscape architecture for creating a flexible landscape by redefining the relationship between land and water in order to improve the quality of life and space in the delta. The new fluid geographical approach was based on a systematic understanding of the amphibious qualities embedded in the site context through a four-lens approach. The lenses being volatility, hydro-sociality, rhythm and wetness, and reflect respectively: radical emergence of lives and landscapes, the mutual implications of social life and water flows, the pulsating temporality in hydro-social relations and the materialization of water in everyday life (Krause, 2017). Together these lenses led to a site-specific spatial framework for enhancing the amphibious value of landscapes. In the specific case of Kuttanad, this called for a revival of the indigenous relationship between land and water which can be accomplished by moderately restoring the cyclical movement of salt and water. This radical change is envisioned over a large time frame by means of a slow landscape architectural process where nature and humans evolve and adapt to the cycle of salt and water. Furthermore, an adaptive design calendar or water calendar was formulated to guide this slow landscape transformation. The water calendar is a very site-specific tool that can be used for both visual communication and decision making regarding the function, quality and diversity of space and life in a flexible landscape operating within the spatio-temporal context of any deltaic region. Ultimately, it will guide to gradually build a complex narrative of how humans and nature exchange roles between being makers and takers of the landscape over time. On the other hand, the role of the landscape architect is to facilitate this narrative by envisioning a slow landscape architectonic transformation. On the whole, this is a generic approach that can be applied to any other delta facing similar challenges and can be a model for the future direction of flexible and resilient landscapes.","Amphibious landscapes; Volatility; Hydro-sociality; Rhythm; Wetness; Slow landscape architecture; Adaptive design calendar","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Landscape Architecture","Flowscapes Landscape Architecture","9.529544, 76.392498"

Besides, the E-bike is inevitably subject to technical obsolescence resulting from advancing E-bike technology. We designed a durable modular E-bike with a circular end-of-life purpose. The E-bike's durability reduces the needed maintenance frequency. The E-bikes' modularity enables simple exchange and interchange of modules. This allows cost-efficient E-bike repair and alteration of modules. Future robustness of the E-bike is essential for long-term re-usability in a circular system. We designed the E-bike to be time-less by well recognizable E-bike aesthetics similar to a traditional bicycle. The retro-look will never get old and helps to sustain the desirability of the re-use of the E-bike throughout time.","Fleet; Shared; reuse","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

Pitting corrosion is one of the most dangerous forms of corrosion. In combination with a fatigue loading, a corrosion pit could result into the failure of a structure, due to a minimal weight reduction. Of the corrosion fatigue process, the transition of a corrosion pit to a fatigue crack is one of the less understood topics. In this thesis, a combined analytical/numerical model is presented that implements mechanisms of both the fatigue, and the corrosion process to determine the moment in time and location in the corrosion pit of the pit-to-crack transition. The hypothesis used to build the model, is that the pit-to-crack transition occurs at the moment that a fatigue crack initiates. Assumptions are made to be able to predict the level of stress and strain at the surface and below the surface of a corrosion pit using a FEM model. Using the stress and strain levels, damage is accumulated until the failure criterion is reached, i.e. when a fatigue crack will initiate. In this research study, elliptical pit shapes are considered, with and without a certain roughness at the surface of the corrosion pit. From the results it is found that a more sharp shaped corrosion pit is a more favourable location for fatigue crack initiation, than a more blunt shaped corrosion pit. The number of cycles to fatigue crack initiation resulting from the developed model are higher, than the number of cycles to failure found by the DNV GL B1 SN-curve for free corrosion conditions. Also, the DNV GL SN-curve is more steep, than a fitted curve through the data points resulting from the developed model. Through a sensitivity study and by considering the number of assumptions and simplifications made in this research study, it is concluded that the spread and uncertainty of the outcome of the developed model is too large to be able to draw conclusions based on the comparison between the results and the DNV GL SN-curves. More research on the input parameters of the developed model will give more certainty and a better validity to the model. It is found that the effect of surface roughness to the fatigue crack initiation life is not substantial, because it affects the stress and strain levels only up to a relatively small depth. The location of fatigue crack initiation is in the pit bottom for blunt shaped corrosion pits, and in the pit wall for sharp shaped corrosion pits. For circular shaped corrosion pits, the difference between the fatigue crack initiation life at the pit wall and the pit bottom is negligible. It is concluded that the model gives a comprehensive basis for the prediction of the pit-to-crack transition, but more (experimental) research on the input parameters will be necessary to be able to give a substantiated estimate of structural life of offshore wind turbine foundations.","Pitting corrosion; Corrosion; Fatigue; Wind Turbine; Foundation; Steel; Offshore structures","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Marine Technology","",""

Previous research has proposed the Four-Design-Choice-Architecture, a control system with a feedforward loop that opens possibilities for personalisation to the driver. The goal of this research is therefore to understand how changing the reference trajectory and the feedforward gain influences the acceptance of the system. This investigation consists of an offline simulation platform and a human-in-the-loop experiment in which the most popular driving group, R3L5 drivers, and the optimal curve cutters group, R2L1 and R2L2 drivers, were subjected to four different reference trajectories and two feedforward gains. The reference trajectories consisted of the industry standard centerline trajectory, a completely personalised trajectory and the class-average trajectories of the drivers' own class and the other group's class. The feedforward gains consisted of the heuristically tuned value of 0.92 and the lower 0.5 to give the drivers a higher workload. The results showed that complete personalisation consistently leads to less conflict for all drivers, however, drivers that adapt their driving style to the guidance also reach low conflict values for the class-average guidance of their own class. Furthermore, it was found that acceptance is not linked to optimal trajectories, i.e., less steering input needed and more dynamically safe trajectories. The results also showed that the higher feedforward gain of 0.92 is beneficial with respect to the lower gain as it reduces conflicts up to 86.91\% and is rated consistently higher in subjective questionnaires. Future research should focus on understanding which drivers need the complete personalisation and on how to optimise the feedforward gain.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2025-07-09","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","The growing complexity of many projects and applications require methods that help integrate vasts amounts of data coming from different sources. In all cases, semantic interoperability plays an important role - the meaning of content should be organized logically, as to allow machines to interpret it. The Semantic Web vision has been developing standards to support this idea, with the goal of creating a 'web of data', were pieces information can be accessed and linked to one another consistently. The ideas behind Linked Data have been explored in different areas of study. The geospatial domain presents an interesting challenge, as geospatial data offers many different views on the same physical universe. This is especially the case with geo-registries - collections of official geospatial data used by governments. This data already contains links in the form of spatial relations. However, there is no consensus on how these links should take form. Thus, this research will explore how linkable geospatial data from registries actually is by answering the following question:""To what extent can ontology-based solutions using semantic web technologies contribute to the integration and use of data from geo-spatial registries?"". This question is broken down in three sub-questions that address ontology-based integration techniques (including tools and languages), the impact of dataset characteristics and the added value of semantic relations. The research includes a literature study to provide a theoretical background, a case study of two Dutch geo-registries (Basisregistratie Grootschalige Topografie and Basisregistrie Topografie) and a conceptual framework that is applied to the case study as a way to explore the main question. The results of this framework reinforce the importance of using instance-level data to understand the connections between different conceptual models and show the unavoidable subjectivity that is involved in the process - from the conceptualization of the data (model) to the creation of query rules. The findings indicate that the capabilities of ontology languages (such as OWL) are not necessarily practical for data from registries, and that custom processes might be necessary depending on the application envisioned by data users. Country-wide registries managed by different data owners and different interpretations of data acquisition rules will lead to inevitable variations in the registration of objects in datasets. And more efforts could be invested in providing quality indicators for alignments.","Semantic Web; geospatial registries; Linked Data; semantic interoperability","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geomatics","",""

(TU Delft Architecture and the Built Environment)","Meijers, B.M. (mentor); Peters, R.Y. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","Navigational charts play a vital role in a ship's safety while navigating the seas, rivers or lakes. With most of the features and obstructions being out of sight -below sea-level - these charts are more critical than e.g. topographic maps. For routing but also positioning, depth information is a key aspect on these charts. This depth information is available in either depth contours, coloured depth areas and individual soundings. However with the data originating from accurate but usually erratic survey data, a visualisation of raw data is not sufficient for use in a navigational chart directly. It would not clearly convey the information to a human operator in one sight, and thus this visualisation is in need of generalisation: a simplified representation of the same data with irrelevant details being omitted. This thesis gives new insights in the generalisation process for isobaths only and proposes a new framework to deal with those. We propose a framework based on a novel auxiliary data structure to link a triangulation to the resulting isobaths: the triangle region graph. It links the position of isobaths directly to individual triangles, as well as establishes relations between the isobaths themselves. With this structure we ultimately link the survey data to the final cartographic product and thus in theory we could integrate all information across the generalisation pipeline in one and the same process. We have successfully used this framework with a basic rule-based evaluation model: we isolate conflicting isobaths, triangles and vertices based on legibility requirements and target generalisation operators on those. With this approach we can successfully maintain more of the morphology while still yielding a finely legible chart. Especially at large scale charts the results are promising: narrow channels, pits and bends remain if legibility permits. With smaller scale charts the challenge now is to generalise beyond smoothness. More radical generalisation operators are needed to omit all irrelevant details. However the overall framework using the triangle region graph as integrating mechanism has potential to do so. It is easily extensible due to its modular approach and can incorporate most depth information: from survey accuracy to size of isobaths and even golden sounding selection in the future.","navigation; chart; generalisation; contouring; isobaths; bathymetry; hydrography; smoothing; triangulation; graph; data structure; simplification","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geomatics","",""

It investigates the feasibility and applicability of this method with respect to three proposed generalization approaches and tries to evaluate the possibility of vario-scale map representation. First, the generalization sequence is created for each of these approaches. It is then processed with a greedy algorithm in order to decide which generalization operations can be shown at the same time. After that, two aspects are assessed: the generalization of the map quality and the assignment itself. The results show that the method is feasible for the vario-scale maps, however, the proposed generalization techniques need to be improved and none of them can be considered as suitable at its current state of development. Nevertheless, the main aspect of the interaction is significantly improved and the solution can be considered feasible.

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","Users in traditional office buildings often experience discomfort with the indoor environment and have issues with how this is being regulated. Research has shown that users’ satisfaction in an office building, which consists of their comfort and health, reflects on their work productivity. Therefore, necessary measures need to be taken in order to be able to suffice the office users’ needs. Also, due to the fact that the building sector in Europe is responsible for an energy consumption of 40% of the final energy use and this leads to high carbon emissions and dependence on fossil fuels, the European Commission has stipulated regulations, where it is stated that all new buildings have to be nearly zero-energy by the beginning of 2021. Due to the fact that the façade is one of the buildings’ components which has high impact on the indoor comfort and energy use of the building, taking the user’s comfort needs and designing this from the conceptual design phase, can help achieve user satisfaction and enhance work productivity, while also helping achieve nearly energy neutrality.<br/><br/>This research aims to investigate the relevant factors of user satisfaction that could be implemented into façade design, while also investigating state of the art interactive/adaptive façade technologies (passive and active) and energy efficient façade design methods, in order to provide design solutions which optimally satisfies office users’ needs of comfort, and therefore increases work productivity, and also supports nearly energy neutrality of office buildings. This leads to the research question of, “How can an interactive/adaptive office building façade element be designed to optimally satisfy its users in order to increase work productivity and to support nearly energy neutrality of office buildings?”. Optimal indoor satisfaction is defined as office users being thermally comfortable, experiencing comfort in the air quality indoors, the acoustics, and the lighting, and also when other human preferences are met such as, having control of their environment, having a view, and having an appealing place to work. <br/><br/>Based on literature review regarding user satisfaction, façade design, state of the art interactive/adaptive technologies, and energy efficient design methods, the design considerations were stipulated. These are user comfort, user control, energy efficiency, and user preferences. The user preferences is the most subjective criteria, because it expresses the preferences and desires of specific type of people. Therefore, this research presents office façade designs for specific type of users, namely the Energy Efficient archetype, the Self-Adaptive environment archetype, and the Full-Control of their environment archetype. The evaluation of these design configurations show that it is almost impossible to have one interactive/adaptive façade design that complies with all of the user<br/>preferences of all types of users, because every type of user has different preferences and some might contradict each other. Nevertheless, this research concludes on design characteristics derived from the presented design<br/>configurations, which show how the most optimal officer-user oriented façade design should function, that can ensure user satisfaction for different types of users and can help its building become nearly energy neutral.","user satisfaction; façade design,; interactive/adaptive technologies; energy efficient design methods; office user preferences","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","",""

The research leading to the collective memory and its architectural application was about Alvaro Siza’s way of working with context, local community and ‘as-found’ elements on the site. The collective memory – especially as described by Aldo Rossi – is something that architects has to find on site and interpret through his culture and knowledge to provide the architectural design settled in the context. This way of approaching to the given place allows better understanding of local way of living, the needs and architectural solutions responding to it. On another hand, it deals very much with the identity crisis in modern cities, which are dominated by placeless architecture, which was promoted by modernism. All those issues raised in the projects are also the concern of the studio, which focuses on medium-sized areas, which problems need to be understood in detail, so they are too small for tools of urbanism to provide the accurate solutions.<br/>The idea of memory is an important part of the approach, allowing to find cultural importance of certain elements in space. The site is located in Anderlecht district and plot for the intervention is a collage of everything both in form and function. Traditional row-houses, post-industrial buildings, modernist housing block and 16-storey high slab social housing in one place together with a park and a lot of undefined space occupied by ruins or outdoor storages. The place, however, has a certain history of the Senne river, which once flew through Brussels and at some point in time was covered and left traces within the whole city or industrial character of the neighbourhood which is still visible and now is the topic of many projects which consider bringing back the character of productive metropolis to Brussels. Nevertheless, the plot is complicated in its present state and challenges students to think between the urban and architectural scale in order to improve the spatial quality on the site by using tools and precision, which would not be accessible on an only urban scale.<br/><br/>Since the post-war modernist times, architects regularly raised the critical concern on the technology dominance, standardization and commodification of the architecture. Alexander Tzonis and Liane Lefaivre wrote the theory of Critical Regionalism, which was later cited and expanded by Kenneth Frampton. Previously mentioned Aldo Rossi and Christine Boyer wrote about collective memory where they criticised and tried to refer to the context made by modernist architecture in cities. As it appeared, post-modernism with its contextual movement also did not solve the problems of disappearing identity within modern cities.<br/>Today, the effects of globalization are much more visible than back in the 1970s and therefore the role of an architect is also about understanding different issues appearing in various areas of one’s work. Moreover, in the time of rapid development of technology, changing societal habits, architecture also has to keep that pace. It is an architect’s role to keep up with the innovative research methodologies and knowledge to provide a better response to the dynamic environment of constant change. Important thing is that the theory does not promote coming back to vernacular roots, but creates a room for interpretation of these values in a critical way. The problems outlined by mentioned architects, philosophers and sociologists can still be found as an important issues of modern architecture which has to deal with the fast-growing of the cities, sustainability issues and therefore the development of technology – especially in the time when international submissions for architects are not exceptions, but in most cases everydayness. This pace of growing demands and shrinking deadlines makes it difficult for proper studying of context and ends up in standardized structures optimized to meet all demands. The most common concern cited in mentioned works is placeless architecture, which cuts off itself from the context.<br/>Studying those phenomena, reasons why they appear and how are the possible solutions to them can give me a proper awareness for my professional future as an architect to implement this knowledge during the real projects.","collective memory; architecture; craft school; identity; regionalism; Spolia; bricolage","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Urbanism","","50.835008, 4.323628"

The relatively new mobility concept, MaaS, is suggested to meet the mobility needs of the end-users in a sustainable, affordable and user’s flexible manner (MaaS Alliance, 2019). Even though the MaaS sympathizers claim an improvement for the travelers regarding the mobility services, the need for a device will increase the digitalization of the transport sector. Pangbourne et al. (2018) pointed out that the digitalization could lead to transport related social exclusion. An exploratory research approach was used to explore the effects of the introduction of MaaS on transport related social exclusion. The research provided better insight in the potential effects of MaaS on transport related social exclusion and proposed policy ideas on the basis of an extensive literature review and in-depth semi-structured interviews. Only about one impact – digitalization – there was agreement between the reviewed literature and conducted interviews regardless the differences in underlying assumptions. On top of that, it is believed by the author that the digitalization of the transport system is inevitable. Even though MaaS might not be implemented to the fullest extent, the further digitalization of the transport sector will pose certain barriers for a significant part of the population. Therefore, it is of great importance to start the debate about the social and moral impacts of the introduction of a new mobility concept in order to prevent an increase of social inequity in the transport sector.","Mobility as a Service; Transport related social exclusion; Exploratory research approach; Equity","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","",""

Five office buildings with low monumental value that lost their relevance in time are chosen as case studies, the primary interest of the studio is to explore possibilities of such building stock and to extend building life by external and internal interventions. De Knip in Amsterdam Sloterdijk representing the office tower typology in the 1990s is the subject of this project, situated in the green wedge between two extensive ecological resources, the urban goal of the district is to become a stepping stone green connection, a livable neighborhood for both human and nature. Currently used as the government tax office, the future use of the building is open for discussion. The inherent characteristics of tower typologies, changing working culture and change of demographics of the area are challenges and potentials of the building. In parallel to the global phenomenon of office vacancy problem is the growing tension between urbanism and biodiversity and the prolonged disconnection between nature and human in built environment. This thesis reflects on the role of buildings in urban ecology, it proposes a systemic change in addressing nature inclusiveness in architecture. It shows a spectrum of possible influence on design when considering nature as a potential user. Topics regarding urban ecology in building design is rather new, the value of this study is to encourage discussion and imagination. the project aims to explore the meaning of design for biodiversity in two levels. Firstly, is to understand the limitations and opportunities of buildings in conservation performance which help to anticipate alternative strategies to achieve such conservation goal. Secondly is to understand the meaning of biodiversity design to human and to human- nature relationship. Human aspect is important human can be co- conspirator that facilitate radical changes. Both directions look into adding extra dimensions, either spatial or programmatic to animal conservation in building as a way to strengthen the power of architecture. In the end, research and vision is translated into various forms, including a design toolbox for future nature inclusive design in building, multi- scale nature inclusive design application in De Knip, replicable habitat facade prototypes, typology innovations concerning the challenge of nature management and human acknowledgement; and the advocate of an Ecological building database to foster urban ecology development. Concerning the constantly changing working culture and unpredictable public health crisis, the project also seeks to open discussion regarding social resilience in work space, It questions the boundary of publicness and public ownership of a building as a type of flexibility. Taking inspiration from current public building development, parklet typology and vertical urbanism, the project proposes a two-operation model dedicating half of the building to public domain free for access. what is the impact if architects only design a robust background rather than an articulated foreground for users?

These buildings are often monofunctional and of low architectural value resulting in an average lifespan of only 30 years! The tradition of demolition and new construction of mediocre buildings is harmful for public space and a waste of money, time, and moreover, building materials. <br/>This project explores the architectural possibilities of transforming a typical Dutch office building, the extension of the Palace of Justice in Arnhem, centered around a circular material strategy. In this circular material strategy the existing materials are reused, remade and recycled into the design of the transformation to reduce the environmental impact and reconsider our take-make-waste tradition. <br/>The design transforms the current, monofunctional and low-value extension of the Palace of Justice into a qualitative and flexible structure. By removing the two eastern building parts an urban passage is created allowing the building to position itself strongly into the urban fabric and simultaneously clarifying the hierarchy inside the building. Covering the space in between the rear wings, enlarging the façade openings and creating a central atrium provide the building with the much needed architectural quality and help define a strong and flexible basis. <br/>The far-reaching reuse of building materials in the design, focused especially on the reuse of concrete, results in a CO2 reduction of 85% when compared to new construction of a similar building. Hereby, the projects shows it is worthwhile reconsidering low-value office buildings from both the architectural and sustainability perspective. The circular strategy, with the related large environmental benefits, is an example of how we should approach building materials and never throw them away without second thoughts. By doing this, the project is an exemplary case study of how the architect can contribute to the circular transition and ultimately to a more sustainable world. <br","Circular building; Office building; Transformation project","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","Second Life","51.978654, 5.911616"

A similar dilemma is visible in the developing neighbourhood Oosterwold near Almere where inhabitants develop their own wastewater treatment and energy provision systems following an unusual form of bottom-up urban planning. At the moment most inhabitants choose to develop these systems individually. Using the land-use, environmental impact and environmental risks associated with these essential service systems, a case is made for the potential of communal wastewater treatment, the exchange of electricity through a communal smart grid and the implementation of seasonal heat storage.

It begins with acknowledging how the Semarang river have been facing continuous landscape degradation despite it being a backbone of the city based on the observation of historical trajectory and site visits. Following the synthesis, the thesis then constructs its foundation by the theory of risk = (hazard x vulnerability) / coping capacity (Cardona. et al., 2012). Hence, the analysis proceed by investigating the variables of the equation which leads to the findings of multiple water related challenges: (1) land subsidence due to uncontrolled groundwater extraction; (2) coastal, pluvial, and fluvial flooding; and (3) low water quality due to poor waste management in the city. These hazards are currently dominating the equation as the coping capacity and the vulnerability of the citizens have not been able to balance the scale. This framework then developed the equation by changing the coping capacity into regenerative capacity, which is the combination of the theories of ecosystem services biomimicry (Zari, 2018) and socio-ecological resilience (Cote &amp; Nightingale, 2012), in order to guide the project in developing water sensitive urban design strategies. A regenerative design means that interventions contain elements which mimic the ecosystem services that they become productive landscapes for the community to be able to sustain themselves in facing possible future hazards. Hence, the proposed strategies would try their best to engage with the local communities through participatory planning. Examples of these interventions are shown in this thesis through the three sub-projects of Purify, Protect, and Provide; which are pioneered by a series of multifunctional bridges along the Semarang River.","Regenerative Design; Ecosystem Services Biomimicry; Socio-ecological Resilience; Participatory Planning; Semarang, Indonesia","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Transitional Territories","","-6.974304, 110.427403"

Improving attractiveness and the city image can be achieved by urban renewal. In Rotterdam, The National Programme Rotterdam-Zuid (NPRZ) was initiated to tackle the disadvantages and improve the quality of life in Rotterdam-Zuid (the worst neighbourhood of The Netherlands). An image and economic improvement was realised in Rotterdam-Zuid. However, too little residents of Rotterdam-Zuid did benefit from this economic improvement. More positive impacts in the area are necessary and urban renewal could improve these areas. However, urban renewal occurs at a too low pace. A positive impact for this process is necessary. An event can succeed in catalysing urban renewal, by strategically planning the event beforehand. As a result, the event can deliver hard and soft impacts on the area. After the Netherlands won the Eurovision Song Contest (ESC) in May 2019 in Tel Aviv, the city of Rotterdam was chosen as the host city of the ESC 2020 in Ahoy Rotterdam. Ahoy Rotterdam is located in Rotterdam-Zuid. This event could be an opportunity for Rotterdam to positively impact the renewal of Rotterdam-Zuid and indirectly improve the city’s attractiveness and image. The problem which this research tries to tackle is how to positively impact the urban renewal of Rotterdam-Zuid by strategically planning the Eurovision Song Contest 2020/2021. This research aims to explore and understand the benefits of hosting cultural events, like the Eurovision Song Contest, in relation to their contribution to urban renewal. Based on the defined problem, the following main question is formed for this research: “Which elements when hosting a cultural great event could positively impact and catalyse urban renewal?” To answer the main question a qualitative approach was chosen. This approach includes a literature review, explorative semi-structured interviews with experts and a case study of the urban renewal project Hart van Zuid (HvZ) in relation to the Eurovision Song Contest (ESC) in Rotterdam. For this case study, reports have been analysed and semi-structured interviews with stakeholders of both HvZ and the ESC have been held. From the results of literature, explorative interviews, case description and case study interviews it can be concluded that social impacts occur the most and on a short-term basis. An important observation which has been made is the importance of a connection in the form of a relationship between the event and the urban renewal project. The impacts that have been found are divided in the categories of social impact, economic impacts and physical impact. First, side-events are mentioned as an important means to create a social impact on an area. Important is that these side-events have a character that shows the identity of the location, otherwise local people do not feel attracted to these events. Secondly, economic impacts are based on tourism generated by the event. For this impact, no necessary steps need to be taken by the municipality or other hosting organisation. Tourism leads to higher spending in the area and new facilities created by the urban renewal project captures this impact to create a positive long-term economic spin-off. Lastly, the physical impact is, due to the short preparation time, not as present as a social and/or economic impact. Opportunities like creating a marker in the area, speeding up the existing planning of urban renewal and using city dressing for the delivery of the buildings are however mentioned. This research suggests important elements which can be used to increase the successfulness and realisation of these social, economic and physical impacts.","Events; Urban renewal; Impact; Legacy; Urban Area Development; Eurovision Song Contest; Hart van Zuid; Rotterdam-Zuid","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Management in the Built Environment","",""

Together with this rising health care expenses caused by mental health and current environmental design questions such as water nuisance, heath island effect, densification demands and creating a healthy living environment, leads to questioning current city structures. This thesis rethinks existing city structures, by creating a new way of designing cities which respond to current environmental design questions and offers restorative nature. It explores methods of creating restorative nature and by researching restorative theories and their affiliation to movement and bodily experience. Movement acts as a tool for designing with an eye-level - and sensorial experience which are both crucial for perceiving nature and its beneficial effects. To design a new city structure, a historical overview is created to research healthy living environments and how these can be spatially recognised in landscape structures, urban plans and ideal city movements. The Garden City movement is used as a starting point for the research. From this research the Urban Forest Movement is designed, working through three scales: the city/region, a main structure of the city and the site. The movement focusses on creating healthy living environments by reacting to current environmental design questions and by emphasising the importance of how green spaces are experienced. The generic model is applied to the city of Den Haag, testing it in the process. The site was chosen because of its history and its different relation to the surrounding landscape due to the lack of a city wall. To apply the Movement, it is adapted to fit the design brief that is concluded from an analysis of the site. A vision is created for the city/region scale that focusses on the main spatial framework, densification and green spaces. One of these elements of the spatial framework is further elaborated, zooming in to the line scale. To implement the ideas on the lowest scale on how to create restorative green spaces which help to create healthy living environments, a design on eye-level perspective and movement is made. These crucial design methods are used to design a park along the line. Here elevations, buildings, water structures, materialisation and a planting plan are used to create various bodily experiences through movement. Three different movements are introduced in the park; Gliding, Grazing and Wandering, offering different levels of emerging in nature and experiencing its restorative effects. Finally, conclusions and limitations of the thesis are discussed and evaluated to provide future suggestions.","Healthy living environment; city movement; restorative nature; mental health; healing nature; sensorial design; Garden City movement; urban forestry; landscape design; movement; Den Haag; bodily experience; Urban Forest Movement","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","Graduation Studio Flowscapes","52.066876, 4.263276"

The city of Addis Ababa urgently need a change in creating spaces of transition for migrants, that would sustain their lifestyle, but also offer a flexible way to adapt towards the lifestyle of the city, by providing flexible housing arrangements, where variety of socio-economic groups could dwell together, as the current attempts by the government are failing. Therefore, the project aims to create a model of a co-existing housing scheme between two lifestyle groups of urban dwellers and rural newcomers, as well as different income groups of economically weak income, low-income, middle-income and high-income people. The chosen location serves as prototype of creating a neighbourhood, where different, even conflicting, uses and users can live together and enjoy the convenience of junction.

By paying attention to the hydrological change before and after extreme drought and the patterns of drought recovery of ecohydrological system, it is possible to better understand the consequences of extreme drought on ecohydrological system. Both climate change and landscape change have an influence on catchment hydrological condition. The drought-related hydrological change is, therefore, the combination of changes induced by these two drivers. To further explore extreme drought impacts and the root causes of hydrological change under extreme drought events, it is necessary to separate the impact of drought-related climate change from the impact of landscape change. This study aims to characterize the variations in hydroclimatic conditions before and after extreme drought by studying the hydroclimatic movements in Budyko space, explore post-drought ecohydrological system recovery, and further separate and investigate the effects of climate and landscape change on catchment hydrological conditions. Monthly SPEI at a 12-month timescale was used to characterize and define the extreme drought events. The Budyko framework was applied to study the hydroclimatic changes of 63 basins in the United States induced by extreme drought events from 1990 to 2013 by quantifying the hydroclimatic movements in Budyko space. The climate effect on precipitation partitioning was distinguished from the landscape effect that is mainly related to vegetation response to extreme drought events. The contributions of precipitation and potential evaporation were quantified to further understand the effect of climate change which is caused by alterations of these climatic variables. To understand the effect of drought-related vegetation change on catchment precipitation partitioning, NDVI was applied to examine the response of vegetation to drought in terms of alteration in vegetation greenness and patterns of vegetation recovery. There were significant hydroclimatic changes in the basins before and after extreme drought. In post-drought period, more precipitation tended to be partitioned into evaporation in most basins. Change in streamflow was larger than the change in evaporation. 63.5% of all the basins experienced wetter conditions and more precipitation after drought. All basins gradually recovered in post-drought period, but not fully restored to their pre-drought states. The hydrological change under extreme drought was not explained by climate change alone in these basins, suggesting the existence of landscape drivers. The climate and landscape effects on precipitation partitioning could either enhance or counteract each other. The landscape drivers contributed more to change in catchment precipitation partitioning. In terms of the climatic effect that associated with the change in aridity index, climate change affects catchment precipitation partitioning by changing the precipitation and potential evaporation, among which precipitation is a more crucial climatic driver. From a vegetation-related landscape perspective, vegetation greenness reverted to pre-drought level within three years in most basins. The rapid or slow recovery, regrowth and even degradation of vegetation in post-drought period cause landscape-driven changes in catchment precipitation partitioning through directly changing vegetation transpiration and streamflow.","extreme drought; Budyko framework; precipitation partitioning; climate effect; landscape effect; vegetation change","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Water Management","",""

Solving the PIDE can now be done alternatively by solving a FBSDEJ. In this thesis we will first investigate the stochastic framework behind FBSDEJs and we will look into the uniqueness and existence of their solutions. Furthermore we propose a new numerical method which can efficiently solve FBSDEJs. The semi-discretisation is based on the classical Backward Differentiation Formula (BDF) methods, for the computation of the conditional expectations we use the COS method which makes use of Fourier cosine expansions, exploiting the knowledge we have about characteristic functions. Finally we implement the new method and we investigate it extensively both numerically and theoretically. We show that the BDFn schemes are highly stable and efficient for computing FBSDEJs, the initial steps still have to be investigated in greater detail so that we can make use of the high-order BDFn schemes.","Stochastic Differential Equations; Fourier-Cosine Expansion; Stochastic Analysis; Multistep Methods","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics","",""

(TU Delft Aerospace Engineering)","Heiligers, M.J. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","Space-weather events have a large impact on Earth. In particular, Coronal Mass Ejections (CME) pose huge potential dangers to human technology both in orbit and on the surface of the planet, such as disruptions to power grids, increased radiation doses to astronauts and damage to sensitive components of satellites. Warnings for space-weather events are currently given by satellites in the vicinity of the L1 point. When a CME passes by that point, the satellites emit a warning that reaches the Earth, on average, one hour before the CME. This thesis aims at using solar-sail technology to move a satellite closer to the Sun, detect the CME sooner, and thus increase the warning time.<br/><br/>Solar sails continuously generate thrust by reflecting solar photons off a large and highly reflective sail membrane. This continuous acceleration can be used to generate Artificial Equilibrium Points (AEPs) in the Circular Restricted Three-Body Problem (CRTBP) that are displaced away from the five classical Lagrange points. Like for the classical case, periodic orbits exist around these AEPs, enabling, for example, CME monitoring in a periodic orbit around an AEP that is located closer to the Sun than the Sun-Earth L1 point from where current satellites detect CMEs. There have been some theoretical mission designs taking advantage of this possibility, but the increase in warning time is modest for any near-term sail performance.<br/><br/>This thesis investigates the use of solar-sail technology to travel upstream of the CME and significantly increase the warning time. The study considers the actual shape of CMEs as a constraint for the solar-sail trajectory that surfs along invariant manifold-like structures emanating from AEPs and Lyapunov orbits around sub-L1 points, i.e., AEPs sunward of the classical L1 point, to travel upstream of the CME. <br/><br/>As a preliminary solution, two strategies are evaluated. The first strategy considers a series of heteroclinic connections between different AEPs in the sub-L1 region. The second strategy uses a homoclinic connection of a Lyapunov orbit around a sub-L1 point. The trajectories aim to travel upstream along the path of the CME and back to the initial AEP or Lyapunov orbit to guarantee periodicity and, therefore, CME monitoring for as long as the sail remains operational. The homo- and heteroclinic connections are sought for by looking for connections between the unstable and stable manifolds emanating from the AEPs and Lyapunov orbits. To minimize the discontinuity in states at the linkage of the unstable and stable manifolds, a genetic algorithm approach is used to optimize the piece-wise constant attitude of the sail along the manifold trajectories and the location, i.e., which AEP or where along the Lyapunov orbit, from where the manifolds emanate.<br/><br/>Though the homo- and heteroclinic connections exhibit a discontinuity in the attitude of the sail at the connection of the unstable and stable manifolds, they provide a good initial guess for further optimization with a direct pseudospectral method, implemented in the software tool PSOPT. In the optimal control approach, the attitude of the sail is allowed to vary along the trajectory (instead of the piece-wise constant sail attitude in the genetic algorithm approach) such that the sail travels as far as possible upstream of the CME while staying as close as possible to the central axis of the CME.<br/> <br/>The genetic algorithm results from both strategies show an improvement in warning time with respect to the warning time achieved by current satellites in the environment of the L1 point. Under the assumptions taken in this research, the trajectories using the homoclinic connections from a Lyapunov orbit out-perform those that employ heteroclinic connections between AEPs. The best genetic algorithm solution offers an up to 10 times longer warning time than current satellites at L1. <br/>This solution shows a small discontinuity in the states at the linkage of the unstable and stable manifold trajectories in the order of thousands of kilometers for the position and centimeters per second for the velocity. However, the <br/> discontinuity in the attitude of the sail of approximately 70 degrees renders the trajectory unfeasible before further optimization.<br/>Furthermore, some parts of the trajectory are too far from the axis of the CME to intercept CMEs approaching the Earth.<br/><br/>Finally, the trajectories obtained with PSOPT show that the sail remains within a defined distance to the axis of the CME while traveling upstream of the CME due to a control law that modifies the attitude of the sail at a rate achievable with state of the art technology. This strategy allows a 15 times longer average warning time compared to the warning time provided by current satellites at the L$_1$ point.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

The project started research of a historical river in the city—the Senne in Brussels. The river influenced the urban development of the whole city morphologically and typologically. Interventions regarding the river show how local people treat spolia. The site is also located along the trace of Senne. A typical wall was formed because of the covering the Senne. It indicates the history but also segregates and influences current situations. It serves as such an important role that it should not be easily discarded. It is the spolia for this site. There is a big difference between the two sides of the wall--living and working, nature and the built environment, leisure and production. The urban concept is to reuse the wall to activate the neighbourhood, increase housing and public facilities and remove the productive constructions to the suburban area. The urban regards the wall as the main spolia and returns the centre of the block to the public. The wall frames the public facilities and parks of the community garden. The architectural proposal continues the focus on the wall as the spolia and explores how to treat it on the architectural scale. The project deals with three issues: the urban gestures facing different sides, the combination of the elderly and the children and the reuse of the existing wall. Among these, to reuse and reconfigure the wall intertwine the other two and becomes the main spine of my project. In the architectural scale, the content of spolia can be enriched. The wall is not only a line. It has the thickness; it has structure; it has a function. The wall acts as the perimeter of the project and organizes programs. The two user groups share an event hall and the kitchen. They have visual connections but also have their privacy. The façade intends to remain the solidness of the wall and make the new open and light while ties in with the old. So for the new façade, the frame can open up the courtyard by reducing the mass of the wall. The original texture of the old is remained to highlight the old wall. The façade also uses similar bricks of the old wall but uses different bonding to create a subtle difference between new and old. Especially for the entrance, light and translucent material is applied to the cladding to express an opening of the old. The interior use wood floor and plaster wall to release the heaviness of the texture of the bricks. In conclusion, my project lies partly in the urban solution. It articulates and celebrates an existing wall from urban scale down to materialization.

As an important port city, Semarang’s urban fabric is closely related to its infrastructure: water and traffic networks. However, since the 1980s, the acceleration of Semarang urban growth has not been supported by proper foundations. The characteristics of the coastal area were hardly taken into account in urban development. Consequently, flood risk and, in particular, rob phenomena or tidal flood became the chronic problem of Semarang City. Consequently, environmental degradation and infrastructure destruction have continued to occur in the Semarang coastal area. Moreover, community life is always threatened by inundation risks. With Semarang as a backdrop, this research aims to address the gap on soft and hard approach in urban mitigation resilience planning in concept from both social and ecological resilience perspective and positioning urban design (both from architecture, landscape, and planning) by exploring the local adaptive mechanism in the chosen coastal Kampung Kemijen, in Semarang, Indonesia. This research derived from the socio-cultural perspective, trying to explore more on the local level and how it can be translated and integrated into the larger scale urban mitigation planning. The objective of the strategic framework, which is based on the socio-ecological principles, the actions which try to integrate the soft and hard approach in urban planning, and both of the design framework and strategies outcomes will be implemented on the design elaboration. The Strategic Framework’s goal is to develop a general understanding and possibilities of balancing the soft and hard approach in urban mitigation planning from the human scale through to the city scale. The project tries to read the relationships between three scales of planning: the city of Semarang, the coastal area (on the district scale), the kampung, and most importantly, to the human scale. The projects at some point are very site, time, and contextually specific. Therefore, the people’s participation and the high concern of climate and ecological-based planning are very important. In the end, This research demonstrates the strength and quality of the soft approach through local adaptive mechanisms in urban planning. Public participation is an important aspect when dealing with the urban planning issue in the Indonesian context. The normative urban planning in Indonesia tends to exclude public participation, whereas utilizing the local adaptive mechanism might contrive a new way of urban mitigation planning, which can be enforced for longterm planning.","Adaptive Mechanism; Public Participation; Multiscalar Planning; Socio-Ecological Resilience; Local Adaptation; Climate Resilience; Semarang, Indonesia","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Urbanism","","-6.955755, 110.434085"

During this time the economy of these countries was transformed from a central-planning-controlled system based on state ownership to a neoliberal one, where capitalist principles rule. Besides, the political structure also changed entirely because the socialist regimes were transformed into democracies. Through these complex transitions, everybody’s life was affected because regulations, employment and services were reorganised. These processes also had a great effect on the urban fabric and continue to affect the current development of these cities. In my thesis, I collect the post-socialist consequences of the era change to specifically address them through creativity-led regeneration. This type of regeneration can be a catalyst to achieve an integrated design process to positively affect local communities and to reach a larger social impact through which the social and spatial consequences of the post-socialist transition can be addressed at the same time. This is demonstrated through a detailed creativity-led regeneration process in the XXIst district of Budapest, in the underused industrial area of the Csepel Works.","Post-socialist transition; Creativity; Regeneration; Engagement; Co-creation; Right to the city","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","","47.430675"

It disperses communities, is not inclusive for the very poor and does not respond to environmental issues. This while the natural environment, and in particular the waterbodies of the city, is already under great pressure after years of uncontrolled urban sprawl. It has led to massive decline of urban green spaces and extremely polluted rivers having a huge negative impact on the liveability of the city. Therefore, this graduation report presents a design proposal that tries to reconnect the inhabitants with the waterbodies of the city in order to create a river culture. The vision of a river culture is the guiding principle throughout the whole design and emerges on all different scales. It connects the water linked ecosystem with the urban fabric and ensures that the waterbodies once again play a vital role within the environmental, social, economic and technical domain. In this way it is interwoven in the daily patterns of life of Addis Ababa’s inhabitants.

Research has shown that actions need to be taken to reduce climate change. Not only the government should take their responsibility, but also other businesses, like the cruise industry. The cruise industry is a growing business and cruise ships have an environmental impact. This study aims to contribute to the development of sustainable, circular cruise ships. Specifically, the gas, fluid, and solid waste streams. The final product is a roadmap, based on waste stream analyses, towards a set of targets and goals. This master thesis, examines which steps need to be taken, focusing on the three waste streams to make the transition towards circular cruise ships following the City-zen method to comply with the UN sustainable development goals. Three roadmaps are made, with three different levels of ambition; 1. Fully Circular, 2. Collaboration Ship &amp; Land, and 3. Positive effect on the environment to find the best way to design a sustainable cruise ship. The research can be subdivided into four main sections, background information, waste stream analysis, master planning, and conclusions. These four main sections are all in relation to the case study, cruise ships from Royal Caribbean Ltd. A literature study is conducted to obtain the needed information. The results show that it is impossible to ensure that no waste enters the environment under the conditions made for the specific roadmaps. On this basis, a combination of the three roadmaps and their technical solutions is made to design the sustainable circular cruise ship. The final design for retrofit cruise ships and newly built cruise ships is not fully circular. The treated black and grey water and bilge water still contain pollutants that come back into the sea. However, the emissions from the gas stream are reduced or fully eliminated, more pollutants are removed from the black, grey and bilge water, pollutant by-products are recycled on land, heat is recovered and reused, clean products as biogas, biodiesel and struvite are produced, seawater as ballast water is not needed, and non-hazardous and hazardous waste is reduced, reused and recycled. These adjustments and additions should be added to prevent waste discharge into the environment. This research also shows that the same design principles and interventions used in cities and building complexes can also be implemented on cruise ships, like the New Stepped Strategy, Cradle to Cradle, material passport, plants, heat pumps, and the energy exchange principle. Further research is needed into technical systems to treat and prevent waste from entering the environment and into other criteria like cost, energy consumption, needed materials and emissions.","Circular Design; Sustainable Cruise Ships; Cruise Industry","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","This research focuses on the analysis of Floating Car Data (FCD) data to understand sustainable transportation behavior in the area of Amsterdam. Using data collected by mobile devices, trips are analyzed by their distance and transportation method. Sustainability is a relevant factor to the social and scientific community. With increasing population and growing cities, the impact of travel on the environment is also increasing. New policies are required to stimulate a more sustainable approach to transportation. Research on sustainable travel behavior provides input for the policy makers. The main research question is defined by what extent FCD can be used to provide insights in the sustainable mobility behavior in Amsterdam. In the existing literature, there are four objectives for sustainable mobility: hazards reduction, travel reduction, modal shift and accessibility. The modal shift (e.g. replacing care usage by public transport) is one of the key drivers for this research. To quantify the behavior, different sustainable mobility indicators are identified to determine the sustainable direction related to the mode of transportation. In the literature there are many methods to quantify sustainable transportation behavior ranging from the traditional methods like counting and surveys to modern approaches including smartphone and sensor data. The methodology used starts with the problem statement and literature review. The data sets are selected and analyzed, providing the results and conclusions. A decision tree is used for categorizing different trips people make, where a difference between short and longer distance trips is made. This research makes use of a wide range of tools ranging from PostgreSQL databases to advanced features of ESRI to visualize data. Five different available data sets are analyzed for their suitability for this research. Based on several requirements like availability, having Origin and Destination (OD) information, usability and documentation, the data sets are assessed and two data sets (Google OD and LMS) are chosen to be analyzed in more detail. The data is filtered and cleaned to make sure it fits the scope (Amsterdam) and the two sets are compared to each other. The trips are split into short and long distance trips, where for both a detailed analysis is performed on the trips which can be easily replaced by more sustainable trips. Regarding the short distance trips, analysis shows that walking and biking are the most common option in busy areas as the city center and the business district. The less sustainable car trips for short distances show several patterns in the city. Using interactive maps, these patterns are identified and both data sets are compared. For longer distance car trips, train transportation is the more sustainable option. There is however a tradeoff between the most sustainable and least time-consuming transportation option. This makes that train trips are not always the most logical or even sustainable choice for transportation. A method is developed and applied to the data set to test if a train trip is a realistic alternative. The results show for both data sets that there is a significant amount of car trips which could easily be replaced by the train. During the analysis of the data for long distances, a problem has been found with the Google data set. It seems that this data set is showing most of the time the same noise. This phenomenon was found by comparing the different modes of transportation available in the Google data set. The error is not in all the data, but it seems to have an impact on the data set. Conclusion is that the data provides many insights on travel behavior and different available data sets can be linked together to provide deeper insights. The Google data set shows interesting results for shorter distances but gives less reliable results for longer distances. The LMS data set is used to compare the results for both short and long distances. The use of FCD data to study and stimulate sustainable mobility behavior seems very promising, but the quality of the available data sets has a large influence on the usability.","Sustainabilty; sustainable mobility; Google; Floating Car Data; GPS Data; Amsterdam; Mobility; Geomatics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geomatics","",""

Two different winding angles were considered, related to a helical type winding and circumferential type winding, which were varied in sequence in terms of positioning and grouping. The manufacturing parameters were kept constant for all considered stacking sequences and were applied to a sub-scale pressure vessel geometry. Detailed experimental characterization revealed differences in burst pressure and strain measured with full-field digital image correlation with predefined deformation parameters. Analytical and finite element methods were used to capture related mechanical effects. The strain and burst pressure results from both approaches were correlated to conclude that the order of a sequence affects the structural performance, causing differences in CPV burst pressure of at most 49%. The results show that specific sequence choices can lead to higher burst pressures.","Composite Pressure Vessel; Filament Winding; Deformation Analysis; Digital Image Correlation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-07-08","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

The influence of control manoeuvres on the fatigue of static components is generally discussed, but drivetrain fatigue due to wake steering and axial induction control is rarely discussed, while it is known that the drivetrain is a highly vulnerable part of the wind turbine and its downtime can result in a significant increase in cost. Having a better understanding of turbine wake interaction and wind farm power optimization and its influence on drivetrain dynamic behaviour serves as a reference for future wind farm cost optimization and predictive maintenance. The main research question answered in the thesis is as follows: To what extent does wind farm power optimization increase profit when wind farm power production and drivetrain bearing fatigue damage is considered? Multiple test cases for wake steering and axial induction control are considered, where different yaw angles, γ, and the blade pitch angles, β, are chosen for the upwind turbine. For each test case, power production and bearing damage is studied. A cost estimation is made and for a range of energy prices, the most profitable test case is found. For verification, a two and four wind turbine case in an uniform wind field is considered. Power production results for this low turbulent case are studied and compared to literature. Turbulent wind field results show that both wake steering and induction control result in a limited power production increase of 0.78% for γ = 7° and 0.17% for β = 1°, shown in the Figure below. The power production increase for the two and four wind turbine case in the uniform wind field for wake steering and induction control are 4.78% for γ = 15°, 16.6% for γ = 20°, 0.19% for β = 1° and 5.04% for β = 3° respectively. Overall absolute bearing damage of WT1 and WT2 increases with increased yaw angles for WT1 and the overall bearing damage of WT1 and WT2 decreases with increased blade pitch angles for WT1. INP-A and PLC-B bearing damage significantly increased for the downwind turbine. In the high turbulent wind field (TI = 0.2), when considering two wind turbines, wake steering can result in an increase of profit ranging from -€3,70 to €4,-, while axial induction control can result in an increase in profit ranging from €3,- to €40,-. In the low turbulent wind field (TI = 0), when considering four wind turbines, the power production increase for wake steering can result in a profit increase ranging from €30,- to €130,-, while axial induction control can result in a profit increase ranging from €15,- to €60,-. Both wake steering and induction control can result in increased profit. The desired control manoeuvre is highly dependent on the ambient wind, wake overlap of the downwind turbine and the wind farm arrangement.","wind energy; fatigue damage; wind farm optimization; wake steering control; axial induction control; wind farm power optimization; wind turbine drivetrain damage","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","European Wind Energy Masters (EWEM) | Offshore and dredging engineering | Bottom Founded Structures, Arctic and Wind","",""

(mentor); Turrin, M. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","The MOR prototype is a smart passive building with a central building management system to control and optimise the operation of the active and passive building systems and therefore reduce the energy consumption of the building and improve the users comfort conditions (MOR Team, 2019b). During the competition, the systems in the prototype were set to function in the Hungarian climate (Warm-summer humid continental climate according to the Köppen climate classification) whereas the Netherlands has a temperate oceanic climate. Showing that the MOR prototype can function efficiently in both Hungarian and Dutch climates with only changing the settings of the building management system can prove that it will also be able to function efficiently when the local climate will change. This research is aiming to extend the period in which the passive systems are used within the building management system in order to minimize the energy consumption while improving the comfort conditions. The following research questions will be used to find the important aspects to be considered: Which parameters have the biggest influence? What are the comfort conditions that the building management system has to reach? How is the building management system currently programmed? Can simulations optimise these setpoints? The parameters that have the biggest influence on the total energy consumption of a building are space heating (16 %) and water heating (21 %). The biggest is electrical appliances (33 %) but these are not influenced by the building management system (Nuiten, et al., 2019). For thermal comfort, the Adaptive Temperature Limits guideline suggests a range of temperatures based on a calculated average of the four preceding days (van der Linden, Boerstra, Raue, Kurvers, &amp; de Dear, 2006). For indoor air quality, a maximum CO2 level was found of 800 ppm above the normal outdoor level of around 400 ppm (VLA, TNO, Peutz BV en Nieman Raadgevende Ingenieurs BV., 2018). And for relative humidity, a range of 30 – 70 % was found for an indoor temperature of 18 – 24 °C (BOOM-SI, Milieukundig Onderzoek-&amp; OntwerpBuro, 2019). For visual comfort, there are no standards for residential buildings. A recommendation for the amount of light needed in a room is based on the activities. For the average room, a minimum of around 300 lux is found. For areas with more precise work such as the workstation, kitchen counter or bathroom mirror, a minimum of 500 lux is recommended (Bodart, et al., 2011). Acoustical comfort is not controlled by the building management system. Finally, a Grasshopper model is made with Ladybug, Honeybee and Ironbug plugins to use with the modeFRONTIER optimisation software. After comparing simulations made by this model to measurements inside the MOR prototype, it turns out that this model is not able to accurately simulate the different systems. Therefore the existing DesignBuilder model is used for optimisations with the built-in optimisation engine of DesignBuilder. The optimisations show that for the MOR prototype, an energy consumption reduction of 11 % per year could be realised if the heating setpoint is raised from 20,5 °C to 20,8 °C and the mechanical ventilation rate is reduced from 1,3 ach to 1,0 ach. An additional 2 % could be saved by not using active cooling. Because natural ventilation in the model is only considered as a cooling strategy and not as an air quality control strategy the optimisations showed that no natural ventilation is necessary. The workflow as described in this report can be used for optimising the setpoints in other buildings using building management systems. Further research is needed to be able to optimise all setpoints mentioned in this report.","Building management system; BMS; MOR; Optimisation; Modular Office Renovation; Sustainable renovation; Passive design technology","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","","51.99659408484556, 4.377973299901974"

Surrogate models, aka meta-models that predict how the original simulation models behave offer a clear advantage in terms of speed of the results. This study delves into performance-based design using surrogate models to give the designer a tool to quickly understand the variables that will affect its efficiency. Looking specifically to improve four (4) results: energy consumption, natural daylight, comfort, and floor area. This study contemplates 16 unique variables ranging from effects of the Context (1), general building shape &amp; orientation (6) to façade variables (9). The energy results are validated in DesignBuilder software before proceeding to collect 500 samples for two different locations: Bogotá and Amsterdam. This data is then run through three machine learning methods, Multilinear Regression, Non-linear Regression, and ANN. Next, the chosen ANN-based surrogate models for each of the outcomes are trained and hyperparameters finetuned to increase their R2 value and reduce their standard error (MSE) and mean absolute error (MAE). Finally, the generic surrogate models are run and compared through various optimization algorithms to determine Pareto-frontier options that ultimately improve the energy performance of a solution with the daylight, comfort, and floor area as design constraints or goals. A time reduction of up to 99.96% was achieved to collect another 500 samples. Finally, the final model also serves as an aid for visualization of the design space by allowing near-real-time (6 seconds) to generate the form of each design solution","High-Rise; Performance based design; Surrogate modelling; Energy Efficiency; Daylight; Comfort; Machine Learning; Computational Optimization; Artificial Neural Networks; Sampling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Building Technology | Sustainable Design","",""

With this invention, students might have the possibility to chat with a sort of “online therapist” anywhere and anytime they feel the need, without stigma or judgement barriers. In order to successfully implement these conversational agents, the therapeutic alliance between the doctor and the patient should be recreated as accurately as possible. Personality seems to be an important factor for the success and eventual satisfaction in the whole treatment. The present research – through LIWC software – explores the extent to which students use different linguistic patterns in an expressive writing task depending on their personality and mental health status. This study hypothesized that students sufffering from Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) use different words than mentally stable students, and that their linguistic patterns are further influenced by their behavioral activation or inhibition systems. The main findings were in line with these two hypotheses. Based on the results, both students affected and not by GAD use different words specifically depending on their BAS levels. In conclusion, as predicted by previous researchers, personality is well-reflected through language styles: each student with a specific behavior, mental health characteristic, and even nationality expresses him/her self with different linguistic patterns.","Psychology; Chatbot; Conversational Agent; Personality; Language Inquiry; LIWC; Anxiety","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

In response to this, the Minister of Infrastructure and Water Management established the 'Beleidstafel Droogte'. An external scientific committee took part in the Beleidstafel Droogte. One of their key recommendations was to introduce other drought indicators since the currently used indicator (precipitation deficit) is not sufficient due to limitations. This research investigates what drought indicators can be used in The Netherlands to support anticipative drought management. For water managers, it is crucial to know when and where drought occurs, and how severe this drought is. To reveal the start, severity, and ending of a drought, drought indicators can be used. However, to define drought, regional differences need to be incorporated. Therefore, this research used a case study area to find out what drought indicators can be introduced. Within the boundaries of this area, three different analyses were conducted: 1) hydrological analysis, 2) stakeholder analysis and 3) policy analysis. According to the results, a set of potentially relevant and suitable drought indicators was selected. These drought indicators were tested with focus groups to determine whether they can be used to support anticipative drought management. The area of water board Vallei &amp; Veluwe was selected as the case study area. Concerning the hydrological analysis, multiple methods were applied to obtain a better understanding of the water system and essential hydrological processes. Because of the relative nature of drought, several stakeholders that are directly affected by drought were interviewed. Through semi-structured interviews, information concerning drought was obtained about the stakes and information needs for different stakeholders. Since measures can be taken to anticipate drought or to mitigate drought problems, the policy on drought was considered. In this way, the interrelation between policy on drought and drought indicators was taken into account. The results of the analyses mentioned above led to the following selection of drought indicators: SPI-1 &amp; SPI-3, soil moisture, stream discharge, groundwater levels/isohypse, NDVI and EVI. To test the selected indicators can support anticipative drought management, two focus groups session were organised. For these focus groups, a dry year was reconstructed, which was explored by the participants. Based on the information that was presented to the participants, they were asked whether they would advise taking measures and what their level of alertness was. One group received information from the selected indicators, whereas the other group received information which is used nowadays for drought monitoring. After evaluating and comparing the focus groups, conclusions were drawn. The participants that received information from the selected drought indicators acted more pro-active, because: 1) measures were advised more rapidly, 2) more measures were advised, and maintained applicable for a more extended period, and 3) the level of alertness was significantly higher. Based on these findings, it was concluded that the selected drought indicators support anticipative drought management.","drought; drought indicators; anticipative drought management; case study","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Water Management","",""

However, this technology is currently registering a high failure rate, and several users are still skeptical of its effectiveness. One of the reasons for this low performance lies in the fact that chatbots have a poor human-likeness that negatively influences customer perception of the technology. Secondly, the low level of personalization does not allow for tailored services based on customers’ needs and requirements. Previous studies discovered that it is possible to attach specific personality traits to chatbots in order to increase their human-likeness. Besides, other researchers have discovered the importance of service personalization as a distinctive requirement for successful e-commerce businesses. Depending on consumers’ decision-making behaviour, scientists have found that different services lead to different levels of customer satisfaction. The present study explored the two sides of Human-Computer Interaction with the final aim of understanding how to better align chatbot personality with human decision-making personality. Two different chatbot personalities (neutral and extravert) were created and randomly assigned to different users. During the experiment, participants had to complete a real chatbot conversation focused on dress shoes and were asked to conduct a post-interaction questionnaire to assess their satisfaction. Results showed that it is possible to effectively attach an extravert personality into a chatbot conversation through the use of language, emoticons and GIFs. Moreover, participants with different personal decision-making behaviour and gender registered different levels of customer satisfaction. Finally, the chatbot neutral personality registered different level of customer satisfaction depending on gender and personal decision-making behaviour. These findings support the literature by analyzing the complementary relationship between chatbot and human personalities. Future studies could use these findings to develop chatbot experiences that better fit with customer needs and requirements.","Chatbot; Personality; Maximization; Human-Computer Interaction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

In order to facilitate aid to these individuals, humanitarian organizations (HOs) leverage their on-the-ground capacity to create identity profiles and risk assessments of these people. However, in-kind aid is being increasingly replaced by Cash Transfer Programs (CTPs). In CTPs, beneficiaries are provided with funding to self-procure their necessities. Complication: For efficient CTPs, these humanitarian identities need to be accepted beyond the boundaries of humanitarian aid. However, by relying on traditional identity management systems, HOs expose the beneficiaries to security and function creep risks. In order to share beneficiary identity information in a more responsible way, HOs have started to leverage Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) systems. These SSI systems need to be scaled up to a more foundational nature in order to facilitate private-sector services. For this a collaboration with national public- and private stakeholders is required. In order to realize that, there is a need for a process design. Which among other things ensures support from crucial stakeholders. Approach: This study used a Design Science Research inspired approach, combined with a Systems Engineering perspective to explicate the problem, define support driving and constraining circumstances and conditions, generate principles for the humanitarian sector to create support driving circumstances and conditions in Kenya and validate these principles using the input of industry experts. This research approach had a focus of practical insights over theoretical insights. Results: A set of five validated support nurturing principles were established with which humanitarian organizations can nurture support for a more foundational humanitarian SSI system in Kenya. Additionally, a framework has been composed with which local circumstances and conditions in a country can be assessed. Next steps: Further research should focus on establishing a more complete process design for a collaboration process, which also deals with participation of stakeholders, structures commitment and defines process rules for different phases of the process. Additionally, further research should explore the capacity and willingness of beneficiaries to control their own identity. And finally, the effect of international innovation initiation on the willingness of national stakeholders should be explored.","Self-Sovereign Identity; Design Science Research; Foundational Identity; Humanitarian Development","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-07-08","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

Reason for this trend is the high yield strength of HSS which leads to reduced weights and costs. Characteristic for HSS is the reduced ductility in comparison to normal steels. Therefore, Eurocode 3 part 1-8 (2020) recommends material reduction factors (Cf) for the design of joints made of steel with a yield strength higher than 355 MPa. The standard includes steel grades up to S700. The material reduction factors need to be validated to ensure efficient design of tubular HSS joints. This research intents to investigate the behaviour of X joints made from different kind of steel grades. The goal is to investigate if the material reduction factors for HSS, proposed in the new version of the Eurocode, are justified. Coupon experiments are conducted to determine the material properties of the X joints. Two geometrically identical X joints with varying steel grades of S355 and S500 are experimentally tested. The conducted X joint experiments, which are evaluated by digital image correlation (DIC), provide the necessary evidence to understand the behaviour of the failure mode and the fracture strain. Finite element analysis confirms the experimental evidence. The results from both the experiments and finite element analysis are used to validate the Eurocode design resistance. Furthermore, a parametric study is executed to investigate the influence of the material properties and the brace width over chord width ratio on the numerical resistance of X joints. This results in a total of 39 different X joint models that are included in this research. Lastly, the obtained numerical resistances are compared to the predicted design resistance according to Eurocode.","high strength steel; X joints; material reduction factors; tension; experiment","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering","",""

The project considers that spatial transformation is only acceptable if it responds to current-day social and spatial issues. In the urban design of the project in Cureghem, the Senne is used to shape the park in the urban plan, not because the Senne is spolia, but because of the need for readable and climate-responsive exterior spaces. The smaller scale of the architecture aims to stimulate peoples feeling of belonging and ability to develop their crafts. In the design, the spolia of local craft and economic activity of textiles, ceramics and building materials is used as an inspiration for the program. Both in the urban plan and architecture, the spatial fragmentation is explained by zooming into the border conditions of the fragmented urban block. These conditions explain the current problems that are present. One of the theoretical explorations was to answer the question: What can be defined as a border or edge, what do they consist of, and are they culturally defined? To answer this question a lot of disciplines had to be addressed, from geology and archaeology to anthropology and the body.

There is a global trend indicates that the urgent need for change from cultural tourism to creative tourism, to achieve a better-integrated tourism system within a city. The project aims to choose one of the historical tourist cities in Europe as the experimental site for researching and solving overtourism problems by the development of creative tourism. Hungary’s capital city-Budapest is the only international city within the country, almost 75% of the country’s tourism revenue is generated here by the development of cultural tourism which can be reflected on its highly centralize cultural facilities and accommodation within the inner city, resulting in the concentration of the tourist bubbles. The project explores how to implement transitional zone(brownfield) as the place to develop creative tourism as the strategy to affect the tourist movement patterns, in order to reduce the pressure of tourist bubbles concentrating in the inner city. Eventually, the development of creative tourism in the transitional zone can relieve the pressure on the historic inner city of Budapest while regenerating the brownfield within the city, increasing both the quality of life in the historic inner city and the neighborhood in the transitional zone, leading to socio-economic growth for the city.","overtourism; Tourist bubbles; cultural tourism; creative tourism; tourist movement patterns","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","",""

Small scale PV systems do not have complex measuring devices and their breakdowns are not spotted immediately by the system owners. This might lead to prolonged time without generating power and creating both financial loss and environmental damage. This thesis presents a method of PV yield nowcasting laying foundations for remote monitoring. Early detection of faults is the first step towards eliminating the described issues. In this project four machine learning models for predicting solar yield were developed: ElasticNet, Polynomial Regression, Random Forest, and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). The models were created both for daily and hourly data sets, as some inverters can log daily yields only. In both cases, the utilized data set consisted of data for the time between July 1st, 2018 and June 30th, 2019 and corresponding to 1,102 PV systems which is five times more than the largest data set studied in the found literature. The average PV system size in the data set is 4.44 kWp. Utilized inputs next to weather data and previous yields included shading factor describing fraction of direct light unable to reach PV system due to surrounding obstacles. Calculation of shading facor was based on 360⁰ pictures taken at the site. XGBoost algorithm turned out to be the most suitable for the task of PV yield nowcasting obtaining RMSE of 1.48 kWh and MAE of 0.877 kWh for hourly data aggregated to daily values and evaluated on future time steps. Currently used commercial software of Solar Monkey has RMSE equal 2.237 kWh and MAE equal 1.5 kWh. XGBoost model trained on daily data obtained RMSE 1.185 kWh and MAE 0.698 kWh outperforming hourly model most likely due to utilization of Hidden Markov Model for data cleaning. Next to overall performance, per system metrics were calculated for the hourly XGBoost. Mean individual RMSE for previously seen systems is 1.656 kWh while for unseen systems it equals 1.666 kWh. This means the model scales well to previously unseen systems and implies that its parallelized version is not necessary. Also, the model's learning saturates after seeing data corresponding to one year and 278 PV systems. Precalculation of GPOA worsened performance with respect to the model utilizing GHI. Hourly XGBoost has hourly RMSE of 0.281 kWh under clear sky and 0.377 kWh under partly cloudy sky which indicates it is more mistaken for cloudy conditions. This could be caused by low quality of cloud coverage data. The model also has large relative errors for small irradiance values which occur mostly in January and December, as well as just after sunrise and just before sunset. This issue is caused by using squared error as loss function during model training. Despite these shortcomings, the conclusive results recommend industrial implementation of the developed model.","AI; artificial intelligence; forecasting; machine learning; nowcasting; photovoltaics; PV monitoring; renewable energy; solar yield prediction; yield nowcasting; XGBoost","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-07-08","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

Unfortunately, the accuracy of commonly used temperature sensors greatly deteriorates in more advanced CMOS processes, thus requiring a certain amount of calibration. Thermal noise thermometry is a highly accurate niche temperature sensing method. It employs the thermal noise of a resistive component to determine the temperature. Thermal noise thermometry is a primary temperature sensing method that is inherently accurate and perfectly linear with temperature, which is ideal for temperature sensors. The fundamental nature of thermal noise with virtually no requirements for accurate device characterization is excellent for integration in any advanced technology. The primary disadvantage of noise thermometers is that they are inherently slow, their resolution improves with longer measurement duration and/or wider measurement bandwidth due to the stochastic nature of noise thermometers, which is why these sensors are rarely used outside of laboratory environments.Although many discrete noise thermometers have been developed in the past, limited research has been conducted on integrating a noise thermometer on a chip. Integrated noise thermometry has the potential to overcome the long measurement times of existing noise thermometers by giving access to increased measurement bandwidths of integrated circuits, as there is no need for off-chip components.Since thermal noise is typically a small signal, the readout is extremely sensitive to non-idealities, such as excess circuit noise and parasitic capacitances. These non-idealities must be properly taken into account or be compensated in order to perform accurate temperature measurements. This thesis compares many different compensation techniques to increase the accuracy of integrated noise thermometry and presents a new method for compensating noise thermometry error sources. This new method greatly simplifies the overall design and theoretically removes all non-idealities of the readout electronics, such as amplifier noise, from the temperature reading. Circuit simulations of this technique demonstrate the viability of the proposed method by showing that &gt;97 of the errors caused by the readout noise and parasitic capacitance can be compensated. The presented methods will allow for accurate noise thermometry to be implemented in advanced CMOS processes and thereby increase the speed and application possibilities of noise thermometry.","Noise; Thermometry; Integrated","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Microelectronics","",""

The project is executed for Buchrnhornen, a company based in Eindhoven which has over 70 years of experience in manufacturing orthopaedic shoes and orthosis in a traditional way. Mechanical metamaterials are artificial structures with mechanical properties defined by their structure rather than their composition. They consist of rationally designed unit cells with unique mechanical properties. The project focusses on replacing the hinges and stops used in a traditional AFO to block plantar or dorsal flexion by a mechanical metamaterial structure which could achieve the same mechanical functioning. A digital program in Grasshopper (Rhino plug-in) is developed which generates a design space based on an input scan of the patients lower leg. The design space is split up in different parts based on the mechanical requirements of the specific areas in the AFO. For each design space, a suitable topology infill which meets the mechanical requirement of the area is developed and generated. Through an input which can be defined per generated model, mechanical requirements can be customized per patient. The output of the digital program is a ready to 3D print .stl file. An extensive research on 3D print methods and materials is done in order to find the most suitable method to fabricate the generated model. The best option was found in a Composite Fibre Co-extrusion (CFC) printer which is able to implement carbon fibre in a model. The addition of carbon fibre ensures much stronger prints which are able to resist the high forces which are applied on the AFO. The project is finished with a conceptual model generated through the developed digital program as well as an extensive evaluation and advice on the researched print methods and topologies.

This topic is strikingly valuable to contemporary demand, given the fact that there is a considerable amount of buildings and building elements that do not carry a value that is strong enough to be considered historical or cultural. In fact, often the meaning of Bricolage crosses the line with the one of Spolia, which consists of a twist respect to the first one, in the sense that a Spolia gains a further value, recalling a former life, a significance that revives identity and history. The questions of this research investigate the role of bricolage and spolia in today’s context and the way in which bricolage can be applied to architecture, and the value that bricolage assumes within it, in particular, related to monetary value, durability, and sustainability. There is a limited amount of resources available, and even if the moment in which they are going to be over seems distant, it’s going to be reached. Thus, it is of extreme relevance to start learning now the possibilities of second hand construction materials, the processes and limits to overcome, as well as the potentials. There are many ways in which the subject of Bricolage in architecture could be approached, leading to different orientations within the field. Nevertheless, the focus of the thesis is directed more towards the material sphere, in which the potentials of re-use and adaptation of building elements of various nature are investigated.Simultaneously, the possibilities of integration of both the new and the old materials are pivotal aspects to be scrutinized, while on the other side, the material properties should be taken into consideration for the components and elements to work together. In addition, the portion of the research that is most relevant to be described consists of the study and onsite observation and analysis of the practice of dealing with the concept of bricolage in these terms, that regard the reuse of materials and any available elements of architecture. The design results in a series of buildings realized with the most reused materials possible, with a program and a composition responding to the needs of the area. To be more specific, it will involve the realization of a promenade composed on one side by a work of sew and cut, dealing with existing buildings combined with new ones.Eventually, the design is based on actual resources found available, partially from site demolitions, partially from contemporary demolitions around the city of Brussels, and, as a third source, in the moment in which the first two ones are not enough, from Opalis, an online database presenting all the major resellers of second hand construction elements in Belgium. These material resources, instead of a design limit, will represent a potential for future design approaches that will inevitably be taken into consideration in future times.","Bricolage; Material reuse; Second-hand construction; Reclaimed materials; Salvaged materials; skating; climbing; structure; industrial; claustra wall; Rotor; Sports Hall; salvage; Reusability","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","",""

The default event implies that the SME could not properly reimburse the money owned to its suppliers. If their default could be forecast, experts could adopt measures in order to prevent it or its impactful consequences. For this reason, developing a credit scoring model which is able to predict which SMEs are endangered of default is crucial. There are plenty of credit scoring prediction models available in the literature. However, most of them are only relying on the financial status of one company. In this work, we are presenting a novel method for credit scoring prediction which does not only take into account the SMEs’ financial situation, but also their position and role within a transactional network. A transactional network is a graph, whereby the nodes are represented by SMEs and the edges show that between two nodes there should be at least one transaction. In our work, we highlight the limitations that traditional models face and provide an alternative to overcome them. Furthermore, our findings show that combining network features with financial features could lead to a more accurate prediction and increase the robustness of the model.

Being the capital city with the most populated district in the Netherlands, higher municipal solid waste accumulation in Amsterdam is in existence. A substantial portion of the municipal waste in Amsterdam is categorized as organic waste, with a percentage of 36%. By far, the waste separation in Amsterdam is further less than the national average, especially for organic waste where its separation rate does not even reach 0.1%. Eventually, most of the organic waste is often commingled with residual waste and being incinerated collectively. A wide range of solutions is proposed to preserve as much value of organic waste as possible such as through bio-digestion and composting. A project called ReStore contributed to this by developing a measurement method on centralised and decentralised organic waste management options. However, it is not yet known the extent to which the outcome of this model can be accurately interpreted. An evaluation and comparison within a systematic approach is needed by considering different attempt in the modelling, conceptualization, and approach in order to gain a far-reaching and thorough interpretation. Furthermore, the typical configuration, feature, infrastructure, and process design made up the unique characteristic of organic waste management. Thus, there is a need for detailed analysis that is capable of considering specific waste properties and process characteristics through a chain perspective. Taking the ReStore method as a point of departure, this study seeks to investigate the carbon footprint of composting, bio-digestion, and WtE using the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) method and finally point out how both models can complement one another. To that end, a literature review was firstly carried out along with the ReStore model conceptualisation. Next, an environmental impact modelling was performed following the LCA methodology, building on the model characteristics and framework from ReStore. Through comparative analysis, the outcome of the LCA study was then compared with the outcome from the ReStore model. Finally, recommendations were formulated on how the concept of LCA helps in providing suggestions on modelling waste management for the ReStore model and vice versa. The results demonstrate a close outcome between the LCA model and the ReStore model, either from the order of impact or from the hotspot dispersion. The results vary along the chosen allocation method, yet, all of these results show that neither bio-digestion nor composting are seen as the preferably option towards WtE. Though differences between both models are not really prominent, the knowledge of LCA embraces essential contributions towards performance improvement for ReStore to model better organic waste management scenarios. It helps ReStore to be more aware with regard to multifunctionality issue and its solutions. Moreover, the wide-range impact categories included in the LCA will help in defining a more extensive result interpretation through different impact point of view. Furthermore, LCA provides thorough and systematic result evaluation that will contribute to a more conclusive analysis. While the LCA model and its concept shares imperative roles to the ReStore model, the LCA model model could also learn from the ReStore model to be more specific with regard to the modelling and analysis. The ReStore model has inspired the LCA model with regard to the flexibility in handling changes in the waste composition. Finally, LCA that is known as a complex and resource intensive tool may learn from ReStore in terms of its accessibility.","Life Cycle Assessment; Waste management; organic waste; comparative analysis; Waste-to-Energy; Anaerobic Digestion; Composting","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Industrial Ecology","",""

One of those are fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) which rely on the chemical reaction of hydrogen to produce electricity. The hydrogen is stored in a gaseous and compressed form in composite pressure vessels (CPVs) which must be subjected to numerous tests for the certification. The end-of-line (EOL) test is a pressurization up to 105 MPa, compulsory for each tank before in-service life. This test could be used to quality assure the component and to verify the state of the CPV. Knowledge regarding damage formation and progression during a CPV pressurization must be obtained for the purpose. The goal of the research is to study which damage mechanisms take place and how their characteristics change when analyzing different layups. This is done pressurizing vessels with different stacking sequences in a specially designed testing chamber. During the test, optic and acoustic data are recorded. The acoustic emissions of the CPVs are detected using 120 sound pressure sensors and processed using a delay-and-sum beamforming algorithm. The optic data are analyzed with digital image correlation (DIC). The results show that only one damage mechanism takes place in the investigated pressure range (5-105 MPa). This has been identified as interfiber-fracture (IFF), happening both in the hoops and helical layers. Computer tomography scans have been used to validate the results. It is discovered that the grouping and the positioning of the hoop and helical layers has a significant influence on the acoustic behavior of the vessel. All the specimens of a layup follow a specific acoustic pattern: they have similar characteristics that can be used to associate a specimen to an analyzed stacking sequence. It has been shown that DIC has limited suitability regarding IFF detection in the hoop layers. It can identify IFF only if the hoops are the outermost plies of the laminate. However, it seems promising to predict the formation of other damage mechanisms such as IFF in the superficial helicals and delaminations. The findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the damage mechanisms taking place during an EOL pressurization. They also clarify the influence of the stacking sequence on the damage characteristics.","Pressure vessel; CPV; Damage; IFF; Acoustic Beamforming; Digital Image Correlation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-07-08","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

SD models provide a high­level understanding of the system and aid in designing policies to achieve specific system behaviours. Conventional SD modelling requires an intensive amount of time, human resources and effort. Applying Machine Learning (ML) techniques benefits the modelling process in saving on resources. It also has the potential to provide insights into the system and prevent subjective­ ness of the modeller. This work proposes two methodologies, EvoNN and EvoESN, to learn SD models automatically for the urban system from observations under different levels of prior knowledge. EvoNN solves the automated equation formulation task for a Causal Link Diagram (CLD) and annotates it with Shallow Neural Networks (SNNs) as surrogate equations. The annotated CLD can be further used in simulating the system behaviour. We provide experimental results on a real­world urban system in Am­sterdam as well as the evaluation of the simulation results. The second methodology, EvoESN learns both the structure and the quantitative relations in the model without the prior knowledge about the structure. Trained using observation data, the EvoESN produces satisfactory results on the real­world urban system. We further incorporate the judgement from the domain expert to evaluate the learned model. Applied on a more complex system, EvoESN shows solid reliability and scalability to handle large datasets. Both EvoNN and EvoESN stand as promising supportive tools for SD modellers and remain robust even when lacking system observations.","system dynamics; automated modelling; machine learning; deep learning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To keep plan execution deadlock-free, one approach is to construct an Action Dependency Graph (ADG) which encodes the ordering of AGVs as they proceed along their routes. Using this method, delayed AGVs occasionally require others to wait for them at intersections, thereby affecting the plan execution efficiency. If the workspace is shared by dynamic obstacles such as humans or third party robots, AGVs can experience large delays. A common mitigation approach is to re-solve the MAPF using the current, delayed AGV positions. However, due to its inherent complexity, solving the MAPF is time-consuming, making this approach inefficient, especially for large AGV teams. To address this challenge, we present a novel concept called a Switchable Action Dependency Graph (SADG) which is used as the basis for a shrinking and receding horizon control scheme to repeatedly modify an acyclic ADG to minimize route completion times of each AGV using an optimization based approach. Our control strategies persistently maintain an acyclic ADG, necessary for deadlock-free plan execution. The proposed control strategies are evaluated in a simulation environment and show a reduc- tion in route completion times when a fleet of AGVs is subjected to random delays. Finally, the methods are also implemented using ROS and validated in the Gazebo simulation envi- ronment to illustrate practical feasibility when applied to real systems.","Robust Plan Execution; Scheduling and Coordination; Mixed Integer Programming; Multi-Agent Path Finding; Factory Automation; Receding Horizon Control","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

However, the tool can potentially be of high value for the heat transition plans of The Hague if it is implemented in a data ecosystem. Different actors (i.e. government, modellers, residents) can withdraw and provide useful information in a data ecosystem. The power of the Vesta MAIS model lies in the rational calculations and the amount of background data. However, the social perspectives and non-rational aspects are lacking, which makes the model not as applicable as desired. The fact that information is easier accessible in a data ecosystem makes it possible to increase the participation rate of the residents. In Chapter 5, a suggestion for a data ecosystem is already provided in order to include social perspectives in the data-driven analysis. In figure 5.5, the meta-data for a certain data ecosystem in the heat transition is given. However, in Chapter 9 the most essential input factors from the residents as well as from the government are determined. Another aspect on the data ecosystem is the fact that the top-down management approach will be eliminated, because there is a lot more responsibility in the hands of the residents.","Heat transition; Vesta MAIS; Resident Engagement","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","",""

This means that you have less to do with each other, know less about each other and this means that the distance is getting bigger all the time. The institutional buildings have a kind of imaginary “boundery” around their building, difficult to get in and to get in touch with the elderly. In the book “most people are good,” Rutger Bregman argues that the threshold that people would do more for each other has to do with distance between people. If you are farther away from someone you are less attempt to do something for the other. (Bregman, 2019). And with this distance comes fear of the ignorant “ignorance frightens the unknown.” Because the group of elderly people is growing the care can not handle it all. The moments of contact is getting smaller and smaller. And because of this problem and the fact that elderly are not getting in touch with others there a is a lot of loneliness. The observation of ethnographic research has led to several points of improvement: 1. The distance should be reduced between elderly but also all the users of space. We need to go ‘‘from forced to being alone to chosen to be alone’’ 2. Creating a sense of belonging If you would create space that stimulate that people are being seen and heard people feel appreciated. By creating a sense of belonging you would get more familiar with one another. 3. Get more familiar with one another By getting more familiar with one another you would do more for one another. If we take care for echater less care is needed. The goal is that by reducing the distance you create a sense of belonging and familiarity with each other. And this means that you would rather help someone, which means that the care would be partially relieved. The goal is to create an environment in Leiden where connection is stimulated. Distances are reduced. Spaces are designed to stimulated the spontaneous encounter. In my opinion we should design housing that is not only suitable for elderly but for several target groups. Making a distinction between elderly housing and others immediately creates distances between elderly and other users of space. So creating environment where several target groups life together where they can take care of one another. This eventually led to my research question: ''To what extent could reducing distances between users of space trigger a form of spatial design that create a sense of belonging and familiarity among people through the lens of elderly?

Cities are growing and urban mobility is getting worse. The amount of freight going in cities is ever increasing. The way food is grown, distributed and consumed has been changed over the years. Technologies in mobility changes - think of the impact of the railroad - the behaviour of the people changed, restaurants emerged and gigantic supermarkets have a huge impact on thousands of cities. What is the impact of these trends and innovations on the built environment and how will the city respond to the next trend? With the rise of online orders, the spatial requirements our cities already changed. Within the food industry, there is a rapid increase in online grocery purchases. Picnic is the fastest growing company in the Netherlands. This trend results in an increase of movements in and out of the city. Leading to even more congestion. In the first half year of my graduation I researched the effects, the flows, the spatial requirements and the energy demand of a new proposed urban distribution centre. This distribution centre is supplied at night by cargo trams using the unused tram network. The groceries are distributed during day by an electric fleet with the shortest action radius as possible. So firstly the project creates a m ore efficient system to the the large scale mobility problem by functioning as an urban distribution centre. This results first hand in a decrease of the amount of movements within the city and the amount of motorized covered kilometres. Secondly, the building host several food related functions such as a bakery, brewery and a fully public food court. A clear synergy within the food chain is made which is totally transparent and visible for all the passers-by. To fully show the new future food supply chain, the main pedestrian pathway is elevated, avoiding the busy intersection below the building, going through the building and connecting the city centre of The Hague with its business district. So even when the food chain is digitalising and thus getting more distant to human this project shows all the processes and logistics behind your daily consumption. To get us a little bit more connected to this fast and complex chain. The project becomes a link in the city by optimising and destressing urban mobility, a link in its context by connecting two districts and a link in the food supply chain by showing the processes and background of your daily consumptions.

Moreover, the dynamics and salinity averaged over the width of the estuary are considered, such that only dynamics in the vertical and along channel direction are modelled. Estuaries are subject to periodical variations forced by tides. The variation within a tidal period is not studied in this thesis, but the dynamics and salinity averaged over a tidal period are considered. The effects of tides or variation along the width of the estuary are not neglected from this model, but are incorporated in the parametrisation of the model instead.","estuary; bifurcation; wind; analytical; numerical","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(mentor); Nan, L. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","Semantic segmentation of aerial point clouds with high accuracy is significant for many geographical applications, but is not trivial since the data is massive and unstructured. In the past few years, deep learning approaches designed for 3D point cloud data have made great progress. Pointwise neural networks, such as PointNet and its extensions, show their ability to process 3D point clouds, especially in classification and semantic segmentation. In this work, we implement DGCNN (Dynamic Graph CNN), which combines PointNet with Graph CNN, and extend its semantic segmentation application from indoor scenes to an aerial point cloud dataset: The Current Elevation File Netherlands (AHN), which was produced by airborne laser scanners for the whole Netherlands. Point clouds from the iteration AHN3 are classified into four classes: ground, building, water and others (including vegetation, railways, etc). Moreover, DGCNN splits the input point cloud into regular blocks before operating on it and processes each block independently, which limits the effective range (receptive field) of the network to some extent. Thus, the second aim of this work is to investigate the impact of the effective range on the performance of DGCNN by adjusting two crucial parameters: the block size and the neighborhood size k in k-NN graphs. It turns out that enlarging the block size or k helps to improve the overall accuracy of DGCNN, but cannot ensure better segmentation results from each individual class. With the block size 50 m and k=20, the most balanced F1 scores for all classes and an overall accuracy of 93.28% are achieved. Based on the evaluation for each setting with a certain block size and k, we also manage to further improve the overall accuracy to 93.51% by combining smaller-scale (with block size 30 m) and larger-scale (with block size 50 m) segmentation results, with k=20.","Point Cloud; Semantic segmentation; DGCNN","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Geoscience and Remote Sensing","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","A building manager of a small monument in Alkmaar wants to give the monument a new function as a restaurant. His idea is to place a glass structure over his monument, like a huge cheese bell, in Alkmaar as a famous cheese city. The main question that is central in this research is: “How can a full glass dome structure be built, to cover ‘Het Kruithuisje’ in Alkmaar, The Netherlands, in which the thermal comfort is maintained in the most passive manner, without impeding the visual benefits of glass?”. To answer this question this research is divided into four parts: literature, designs, analysis and final design and conclusion. Various coarse designs will be made that will be analyzed. Based on the analyzed designs, a final design can be made in which the structural performance and thermal comfort are known. These results will lead to a design with building plans that can ultimately be built, with guidelines, recommendations and conclusions for possible upcoming similar structures. A dome structure, or a cupula structure, is a form of shell structures. A shell structure is a structure where the surface can bear the loads, because the surface is shaped and supported in a certain way (Flügge, 1973). Glass can be used as a construction material, but it has a number of properties as standard that are not entirely suitable for a construction material. To make glass a safer construction material and to give it a greater bearing capacity, it must be strengthened. The dome is a suitable shape for constructing glass structures because most of the internal dome forces are in compression. A shell structure can be built in as a completely smooth surface or built from various separate components. To build this entire construction, the shape must be divided into panels. To approximate the dome shape hot bended double curved panels will be used. To be able to build with glass, connections are needed between the various glass components. (Santarsiero et al., 2016). To achieve high transparency and low peak voltages, a combination of adhesive connections and dry assembly connections can be used. Designing with glass creates problems, especially for thermal comfort problems. These problems can be easily solved by using a lot of energy, which is not a sustainable solution. With passive strategies, a large part of this requested energy can be removed. In order to take away as much energy as possible in a passive manner, there must be compromised on transparency.","Structural glass; Dome structure; Passive strategies; Alkmaar; Kruithuisje","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Building Technology","","52.633486, 4.740339"

In response, new regulations, BENG 2020, are implemented and applied to all new constructions as of the 1st of July 2020. Regarding the high-rise typology that is known for its extensive energy consumption, those regulations present a constraint to its height increment. Despite being a potential solution to the shortage in the housing sector, residential apartment high-rises still make up for a minimal part of the country’s skyline. The aim of this research is to investigate whether the regulations turn into a limitation to the target height despite the implementation of optimal design solutions. The performance of a building is an outcome of the environmental conditions, the context, the early stage and the facade design. Under the large number of possible combinations, and being interrelated, the impact of different design scenarios of a residential high-rise in the temperate climate are evaluated regarding the energy performance, the energy loads and the user’s thermal comfort. With a computational methodology of work using parametric modeling in Grasshopper, energy simulation in plug-ins and modeFRONTIER platform, the setting of an integrated work ow provides the tool for the exploration and optimization of the parameters. Based on the near-optimal final design, a gradual height increment is performed on the residential high-rise that is marked by limitations at two different levels under both of the primary fossil usage BENG 2 with 49.25 kWh/m2 and the energy generation BENG 3 with 40.2%. To serve the high-rise typology in achieving the target height of 160 meters, amendments to those regulations are proposed according to the building’s volume, envelope surface and height. Based on the optimization results, additional design guidelines are provided to serve architects in achieving a closer ranking to the BENG indicators for residential high-rises.","computational design; optimization; Parametric Design; High-rise; BENG; Residential building; Facade design; temperate climate","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","",""

There exist various drivers and barriers (D&amp;B) that can enhance or hinder sustainability in organizations. Research has so far mainly been focused on the primary activities within an organization. Hence, this study focused on the supporting activities (SA). This study researched what the defining moments are in the enhancement of sustainability in the SA of an engineering consultant organization. This qualitative research used the method process research, comprising a case study wherein processes of enhancing sustainability within one organization were mapped. Data for 8 cases was collected through semi-structured interviews and case documentation, within the playing field of the most important D&amp;B. Case data was analyzed through the streams model of decision-making theory, existing of the problem, solution and participant stream. Furthermore, windows of opportunities (WOO) and tipping points (TP) were identified in the processes. The results include different patterns and striking observations. Most problem streams include CO2 emissions. The WOO involved raised awareness or multiple events making the problem more pressing. There were no significant TP identified throughout the cases. It was observed that awareness and intrinsic motivation form the most important drivers. The most important barriers are costs; the lack of support from employees or partners; and the lack of intrinsic motivation in the form of a lack of vision and priority. There were four most striking observations regarding the processes in the case study. The first observation is the intrinsic motivation of individuals playing a big role in the enhancement of sustainability. The second observation involves that the organization seems to hook onto trends and external events. The organization is only picking low hanging fruit, by making use of changes that are already planned or taking place, forming the third observation. The fourth observation comprises that there is a lack of clear goals, vision and priority regarding sustainability within the SA. It is therefore recommended to create a supportive and open environment for individuals that are motivated to enhance sustainability; to make use of external events, trends and of changes that are already lined up, but to not let these external occurrences determine the path towards sustainability; and to develop clear goals and a strategy for sustainability in the SA, for a more integral approach.","Sustainability; Process research; Supporting activities; Organization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

This thesis first analysed the current inclusion of environmental requirements in the invitation to bid, bid and assessment of the bid. Hereafter, the results were evaluated and a proposal to develop the inclusion of environmental requirements has been made. A misalignment of environmental inclusion was found. Environmental requirements were included in 86% of the 70 invitations to bid, 74% of the bids and 46% of the assessments of the bid. Three defects possibly causing the misalignment were obtained. First of all, ineffective inclusion of environmental requirements in the invitation to bid. Secondly, missing feedback and scores in the assessment of the bid. Thirdly, when feedback was included on the environmental requirements, it was unclear or very limited. As a consequence, environmental requirements are not taken into account in the procurement process. Four purchasing experts from Dutch provinces have been interviewed to evaluate the three limitations and come up with opportunities to resolve them. By looking critically at the expert interview results and comparing them to the results of the content analysis, two problems were noticed. First of all, window dressing: ambitions to improve the inclusion of environmental requirements were stated, but not realised. Secondly, a lack of responsibility. The window dressing and lack of responsibility are caused by the absence of environmental management in the IPM-model. No one is taking action, because no one is responsible. It was concluded that a change in the IPM-model is needed to create responsibility and that the procurement process needs to be improved to incorporate environmental requirements more sufficient. It is recommended to the client to include environmental management in the IPM-model. The environmental management department should have four responsibilities: ensure environmental inclusion, correct limited or incorrect environmental inclusion, learn from mistakes made and develop environmental inclusion based on acquired knowledge. Secondly, a learning process needs to be started. It is recommended to both the client and the contractor to document feedback and review the environmental inclusion in the invitation to bid and bid. The feedback and reviews have to be interpreted and used to improve future invitations to bids and bids. By documenting past performances, future performances can be improved.","Green Public Procurement; Construction Management; Procurement; Tender management; environmental; Sustainability; Construction sector","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

For instance, the sites and services scheme could provide such a solution combining efficient use of resources and community participation, that can greatly increase the market value of the house and adapt it to users’ own needs. Circular strategies are being pursued mainly in Europe, however, are often already present in the informal sector of developing countries.<br/>Applying alternative building principles in a developing country such as Ethiopia sets a new set of challenges in comparison to a housing scheme developed on the same values in the western world.

Most of the studies performed so far focus on the drivers’ reaction times and the mechanisms behind the transition. In this study, an effort is made to incorporate the braking times that are required in order to finalize a safety maneuver, with the aim to assess the safety implications of the entire transition in control. For this purpose, a new methodology was developed and a simulation model was used in order to simulate platoons of CACC equipped vehicles. Two new KPIs were defined: the Time to Control and the Safe Time Budget. The results suggest that higher number of critical events and crashes are associated with higher market penetration rates. This reveals that despite the fact that AV can in general increase traffic efficiency and safety, when it comes to emergency situations where safety is inextricably linked to the combination of AV and driver performance, overall safety may be compromised under certain conditions. In addition, the results revealed a strong connection of the above-mentioned action times with the initial speed of the vehicles involved in a conflict. The findings of this research, point to new directions particularly in concern to the extension of the operational design domain of automated vehicles in order to minimize system deactivations, and also with regard to the need for better prediction models and safety assessment tools.","Authority transitions; CACC; Safety Assessment; driver behaviour; Simulation; AV; take-over requests","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Transport, Infrastructure and Logistics","",""

However, the nomadic site actors practise informal ‘urban mining’ which enables material flow despite physical distance of the urban fragments. The flow of resource becomes the immaterial spolia that gives experiential qualities and grants adaptability to the neighbourhood. The urban planning proposal thus endeavors to orchestrate the process of urban mining from collection, disassembly, extraction, recovery, consumption and reinvention within the site plot, challenging the status quo of recycling industry as infrastructure. The site is re-zoned into a production strip, mixed commercial and production public interior strip, and a cultural strip, forming a sprawling alley-yard internally that connects the major urban nodes of the plot at its periphery. The organization stitches the urban fragments thematically and functionally with narrating the process of urban mining. “Everyone is equipped by nature to receive and to assimilate sensory experiences,” (Lehmann, 2017). Recyclage is a hybrid that encompasses a material library, makerspace for material experiment , exposition space for new prototypes, auditorium, meeting rooms, office space for researchers and archive, providing a converge point for inhabitants, entrepreneurs, researchers and everyday makers. Being juxtaposed with teaching space of Le goujon and confronting the street of institutions, the recycle learning center serves as an extension of the educational cluster. The programmes are devised in zones that foster a pedagogical environment based on the observation of how a person understands and approaches material when I conducted the sensory experience mapping for the research. The spatial arrangement suggests exploratory and ascending movement with constant sightlines towards Le goujon which predominantly constitutes to the site context. The center interpreted materials as interlocutor between people from all walks of life, unleashing the inherent material literacy of individuals, reinventing architectural opportunities between traces of events, time as well as memories. The materiality of the project illustrates the boundless possibility of materials and the humanized facet of urban mining. Aluminium at different states and forms are harnessed to showcase the time and traces material afford particularly in this site with occupants constantly moving in and out. Aluminium is highly available, omnipresent in ever-changing commercial and residential buildings, and associated with domestic life and the remembrance of Anderlecht being a post-industrial city. The architecture ensemble is depicted as a living life account of aluminium that it is finished with mainly reused aluminium which undergoes a myriad of transformation strategies: reuse, repurpose, reconfigure and transform to take up different expressions. The ‘patchwork’ language presents an amateur character and recognizes the potential of anthropocene waste in elevating the design outcome, manifesting the envisioned position of Recyclage in empowering a home-grown community of nomads.","Urban mining; Aluminium Reuse; Spolia; Recycle learning; Pedagogical architecture; Human-material relationship","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","",""

Hackney as one part of the most deprived area, which is socially and spatially segregated out of the active zone of London, as well as it is under the danger of losing its strong local identity due to the new trend of urban regeneration. A possible path for Hackney is to promote a new type of urban regeneration that focuses on and driven by the local diversities, which could be supported by the inclusive design on the public spaces. However, the current debates about the injustice with segregation caused by it are unlinked with the local context, while it is also missing a bridge to the current inclusive design practices.

It critically assesses and responds to urban sites by enhancing its qualities and addressing its shortcomings. New buildings should therefore aim to establish themselves as articulators of a broader intervention scheme. By doing so, both existing and new structures are bound together in mutual benefit. This relationship elevates the quality of what is found in our cities and is fostered by new buildings that have character and are not arbitrary. Spolia is made of what is found in our cities, both material and immaterial pieces of former sites and building cultures. These fragments can be recomposed and incorporated into new structures, providing meaning, adding value and stabilizing them into the existing.Bricolage can be described as a creative practice that uses a limited and heterogeneous repertoire of available resources. It promotes reuse and re-appropriation of both material and immaterial values. Such re-imagining of found objects often results in new and uncommon meanings, while also embracing a sense of practicality and ingenuity. Adopting bricolage means looking at design practice differently. It becomes important to start by investigating the existing, the heterogeneous repertoire of our buildings and cities, looking for signs and ideas. These will form the starting point of future interventions. New designs are to be developed in tandem with the creative reuse of existing structures, thus a position on reuse is also important. Through a creative reuse that imagines new possibilities, the existing is used as a starting point for a new design. The idea is to highlight what can be a complimentary relationship between renewed structures and the newly added, rather than to stage a clash between old and new. To piece together three modest buildings into one new building, in turn making them a valued asset on the site. I believe this project illustrates how, by working with what is already in place in our cities, we can add upon and improve urban sites. I advocate that this should happen by a creative reuse that pieces together old and new, generating new and meaningful structures. Through this practice, both ordinary and relevant buildings may have their lives extended, their qualities highlighted or their faults amended. Piecing together means slowly building towards something new, taking fragments of what one finds along the way and making the best use of them. Indeed, the pleasure is the act itself, and the satisfaction is in creating an harmonious whole out of such fragmentrs.","reuse; bricolage; spolia; urban architecture","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","Our society is expanding and in response to this, cities are undergoing transformations. The pluralism of an individualized society, relating to one’s own needs and desires, is perceptible in the way we dwell in the city. However, this doesn’t mean that a larger cohesive (social) structure isn’t essential. Indeed, Brussels, the capital of the European Union that carries the motto ‘In Varietate Concordia,’ consists of several fragmentations on an institutional level aside from an archipelago of urban fields. Therefore, pursuing an architectural solution that ensures harmony between the varied wishes of society becomes more relevant. As a respond to the individualized society and an approach against the fragmentation on different scales, the design project aims to reconcile the existing amorphous urban tissue. In other words: it encourages the characters of the site do justice to their own identity and subsequently engages in dialogue with them in order to achieve a stronger unity. While keeping in mind that the neighbourhood is characterized by its below-average median income and high population diversity, fragmentation can be transposed into rich stratification only when pluralism will be embraced. The design proposes a new social housing block and an extended structure that holds a Martial Arts school. Adjacent to this, the Les Goujons is a remnant of the 1970s modernist social housing in which social carries different connotations. The proposed design includes shared amenities, which normally are not self-evident in affordable housing. These amenities are designed to be communal spaces that ought to bring the residents together. Besides that, a fixed spine through the building with perpendicular flexible walls allow the housing units to be diverse and have their own unique features. How the building is situated between three fragments and exposed to different border conditions, is decisive for the placement of the units within the building contributing to these features. The variation in housing units also plays an important role to the aforementioned pluralism of an individualized society. The design project suggests the theme of mirroring: it questions what to keep and what not, which then initiates a dialogue between the characters. In the context of the studio’s topic, spolia in re is primarily noticeable on the urban scale: higher residentials on the front side and industrial-sized structures on the rear side with a connecting courtyard shared by many. In materialism, the spolia in se points out the collective amenities. This is captured in a curated collection of the exterior as well as interior elements. From reused pavements and an imposing portal for the courtyard, wooden flooring for the winter garden to sanitary elements, tiles, fittings and non-generic doors to indicate these communal spaces.","Collective Living; Fragmentation; Social Housing; Brussels; Martial Arts School; Individualization; Contemporary City; Slow Urbanism; Mediation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","Spolia","50.835163, 4.323649"

To do so the architect inserts in the existing floorplan the spaces in the form of circles; the so called “bubble diagram”. The purpose of this project is to propose a methodology to wave proximity relationships with illuminance requirements. The designer inserts existing geometry of the building in the software. An illuminance analysis of the room is performed so as to determine the ideal light locations for each room according to regulations. The user inserts the desired proximity and illuminance requirements of the rooms in the form of points and lines and prioritizes them. Given these inputs the goal is to place the rooms in positions that the objective function (potential energy) is minimized. The tool finds the optimal position of the rooms regarding proximity and illuminance requirements in the given boundaries without overlapping themselves by simulating it as a spring network and produces the bubble diagram. The diagram produced serves as the starting point for the designer to further develop the layout into a proper floorplan manually.","layout; proximity; Illuminance; spring network; optimization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Building Technology","",""

State-owned kebele housing, which houses an estimated 40% of the city’s inhabitants, has very low rents but is not maintained, leading to deterioration. Thus, the city is left with a severe shortage of adequate housing. Current state-led developments intended to alleviate the acute housing problem do not address the specific situation of Addis Ababa, and do not allow for the flexibility and adaptability that is required by residents. This research and design project focusses on a specific site in Gerji, owned by the Federal Housing Corporation, and proposes a new model for mid-density, low-rise development which is specific to the context of Ethiopia and suitable for the varying and different living patterns of people in Addis Ababa. The project includes ethnographic research, looking into the lifestyles and daily habits of local residents, as well as documenting their homes and living spaces. Further research was conducted into vernacular and historical building styles and construction methods present in Ethiopia, which was used to inform the design and better understand the specific context of Ethiopia. The research concluded that many different living patterns must be accommodated in a new development, and that this should allow for flexibility and adaptability as household incomes and expectations change over time. Moreover, homes should be suitable for the climate and materials and construction techniques should be informed by local customs in order to aid social sustainability. Finally, tenure options, functions and typologies should be mixed to create a diverse and resilient neighbourhood. The proposed design addresses the research by offering three distinct typologies of building, all of which offer the flexibility needed to allow for different functions and uses. These three typologies are aimed at different sectors of the community and are proposed to be offered in different tenure models. The design is simple and uses adobe bricks and laminated bamboo lumber as its main construction materials. These both use raw materials that can easily be sourced locally and can be processed cheaply on site, using local labour. Ultimately, the proposal achieves a density similar to that of local state-funded housing developments, known as “condominiums”, suggesting that this more varied and site-specific approach to tackling the housing shortage is feasible for Addis Ababa. Adopting such an approach, which looks to local customs and vernacular styles for inspiration, is a radical alternative to the unsustainable route currently being taken in Addis Ababa.","Vernacular; Dwelling; Adobe; Mid-density dwelling; Low-rise dwelling; Addis Ababa; Gerji","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","","8.997361, 38.807671"

Due to the increasing urbanization and the congestion of people and businesses, the city’s urban environment and particularly, public space needs to reinvent itself to address the modern challenges and remain an important element of the urban fabric. Towards this direction, public space should firstly, become more flexible, to embrace the fast change of the urban living in the context of the global metropolis. Secondly, it should become smarter, to deal with the huge amount of people and information, and find ways to use them in profitable ways to improve the quality of life in the urban environment. Thirdly, it should become more human-centered, in the sense that it should focus on the user, identifying his needs and expectations for the public life. Following these guidelines, this thesis proposes an “Innovation Lab” as the prominent future public space of Global Metropolises. The ambition is the creation of an inclusive collective space, a global meeting point where people from all parts of the city, or even the world would be able to find common ground in an engaging space that will boost their innovation and creativity, as well as interaction with others. The medium to succeed in this goal would be technology. Whereas the majority of people blame technology for the isolation of people and the decrease of public interaction, the truth is that isolation in public space is an old phenomenon. It started already since the invention of typography and generally the invention of personal ways for one to be entertained and educated by himself in public without the need to physically interact with another. In reality, technology is the primary means of socializing and communication when it is being used appropriately and is already incorporated in all aspects of everyday life. Besides, New York is the world’s biggest tech hub for 2019 and Transitional Yards is its new base, consisting of an environment where technology can flourish. When it comes to my thesis, technology is applied in three ways; The Innovation Lab is hosting a tech-related program where people can get informed about new technologies and experience them applied in space. Besides, the implementation of sensors optimizes the organization and experience of the building, offering atmosphere control, personalized experiences, energy, and cost savings. Furthermore, smart technology is also applied to the curation of experience since from the beginning of the experience of a visitor (online check for events, book tickets), to how someone enters the building (face control), to the experience of space and program (augmented experiences) to the exit (leave feedback, upload comments), everything is automated for optimal results. The final project is a building complex of the total 69.000 m2, comprised of an office tower (52.750 m2), a public expo building (15.652 m2), and a connecting large multi-form and multi-purpose venue (600 m2). The final volumetric composition resides in the city’s identity where the different urban elements ex. the tower, the New York townhouse, and the monuments are all placed irregularly next to one another, forming a playful skyline. The more private functions are located in the tower (private offices), while in the lower volumes and hence closer to the human scale the public functions are being placed. The materials chosen for this project are playing with transparency and translucency, aiming to create an atmospheric and pleasant environment where innovation and creation can flourish.","Augmented Reality; digital experience; public space design; architecture; global metropolis; Complex Projects","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","","40.749633"

Several aspects in the mobility chain are changing, for example the alternatives in modes and the trip types of passengers. The rail network with the vital locations as stations and the operation of the services on the network seem to be less adaptive, while the travel behaviour of passengers seem to change due to developments in access and egress, Additionally, the use of the train network differs per region. This could result in a mismatch between the network design and the way passengers use the network, i.e. the travel behaviour of passengers. This research will perform a qualitative and quantitative network analysis on two different case studies to obtain insights into influence of the network design on the travel times and station choice. These case studies are the Stedenbaan Zuid and the Veluwelijn, which both show different demand and network characteristics. Both case studies reveal different results in terms of travel times for the network variants, due to the differences in demand characteristics. The differences in the effect of the network design of the case studies could be assigned to the demand characteristics. In network design, the usage by the passenger should be leading. Yet, the location of the network and the stop density could contribute to passengers changing their travel behaviour based on the network design.

This is captured by the main research question: In which manner could the design of a high-rise building in the context of the Binckhorst The Hague, from the perspective of urban design, contribute to the development of a more inclusive city? The urgency of the subject follows on the trend of high-rise developments in Europe, The Netherlands and The Hague. The Hague is predicted to grow substantially in population until 2040. The municipality has chosen a strategy of high-rise developments, to house the increasing population and to improve spatial quality. The Binckhorst plays an important role in this strategy. In the design of high-rise buildings there is a set of social challenges that should be accounted for: a rigid structure, homogeneity; and vertical segregation. The lack of a humanistic approach and the high amount of residents per building create the urge to approach the design of high-rise buildings from an urban design perspective. The Hague is dealing with a set of social challenges like segregation, loneliness, and social exclusion. This should be understood in the light of a hyper-diverse population with the nature of constantly changing needs and values of the residents. The main design value is inclusivity, as a part of the Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations, it answers to the most fundamental ethical consideration for the development of our cities. Related to the theories of Just Diversity and the Open-City, the sub-design values that contribute to a more inclusive city and answer to the social context of The Hague are formulated. The design values taken from these theories are recognition, encounter and adaptability. Recognition addresses the different needs and values of people, adaptability responds to the changing needs and values and encounter is aimed at facilitating interaction between like and unlike individuals. Continuing on the design values a set of urban design principles and related elements guide the projects towards a more concrete form. These principles are tested by observations in and around existing high-rise buildings in The Hague and interviews with residents. The project concludes in a high-rise design in the Binckhorst The Hague. The design consists of urban design elements like a vertical living street, public spaces (pockets) along the route and a configuration of volumes and program. This project has set a clear framework of design values and principles that contribute to an inclusive high-rise design. While the fieldwork and the design constituted to an evaluation of these principles, more experiments in design or a wider target-group for interviews could help better ground the principles. Here extensive research in the context of one or a few of the innovative projects mentioned could help to better understand the social implications of design decisions taken. Next to the academic work there remains a need for visionary and experimental high-rise projects to explore new design approaches.","Inclusive city; Vertical urbanism; Interior urbanism; High-rise; Urban design; Just Diversity; Open-City","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Urbanism","City of the Future","52.069395, 4.337655"

(TU Delft Architecture and the Built Environment)","Meijers, B.M. (mentor); Liu, H. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","This MSc thesis aims to research how to efficiently manage 4D AIS data (Longitude, Latitude, Time, and MMSI (the ID of the vessel)) to do the fast query by using the Space Filling curve in PostgreSQL. The AIS is the Automatic Identification System which is born because the frequent occurrence of maritime accidents has caused casualties and economic losses. AIS is intended to assist a vessel’s watchstanding officers and allow maritime authorities to track and monitor the vessels’ movement. For now, the AIS has been used in various kinds of fields because the AIS data is really important and useful. The AIS data contains lots of useful information such as the dynamic information (including ship location, speed, heading, and so on), the static information (including ship name, ship type...), and some other types of data. Because of the useful information that AIS includes, there a great many useful applications based on the AIS data. For example, the AIS data is used for detecting the vessels’ anomalies motions or tracking the vessels. While the studies mainly focus on the applications of the AIS data, The efficient management of the AIS data is neglected. Hence, I am going to study how to efficiently manage the multidimensional AIS data. Space Filling Curve (SFC) will be used to manage the multidimensional AIS data. The SFC is a great method for indexing the multidimensional data. The SFC can map data in multidimensional space to 1D space. There are lots of kinds of SFC, such as Morton curve, Hilbert curve, Gray curve, and so on. And the Morton curve and Hilbert curve are used in this thesis because of the property of the locality form the nD space is preserved in the location on the curve [Dai and Su, 2003] and both are so-called quadrant recursive curves [Meijers and van Oosterom, 2018] which is the very significant property. In my research, I proposed two kinds of methods to manage 4D AIS data. One is the 4D integrated approach that the 4D AIS data is encoded to SFC together.

To test the two approaches, bounding box query (to find the vessels in a given space and time range) and trajectory query (to find the position information of a specific vessel in a give time range) will be implemented in the database. To verify the usability and superiority of my approach, the benchmark is set. The comparison between the two approaches I proposed will be done.

A new field of research has been involving multi-agent robotic systems in the architectural design and/or fabrication process. They require a new understand the built environment as an “adaptive ecology” composed of autonomous agents that interact with each other and their nearby environment (users and context). I am proposing the examination of a multi-agent system composed of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs, or drones) that can collaborate together to self-assemble into structures that are user-interactive and responsive to the local climate conditions. These structures are composed of a many of these ‘drone-bricks’ that form shelters that can grow and morph to accommodate users’ changing positions and movements through time. They are able to modulate environmental conditions such as wind and rain shelters, daylight penetration and the acoustic resonance of the space. This architecture is directly informed by the users’ activities, environmental conditions, and other information flows. It relies on principles of emergence, indeterminacy and generative design. This architecture has no blueprint but is self-organising; it is processual, indeterminate and continuously in formation, as opposed to the dominance of static, predetermined forms and functions in the organisation of the environment today. How to translate these architectural intents (performative and qualitative metrics) to a swarm of UAVs in an attempt to create a robotic architectural ‘species’ where autonomous agents collaborate to form temporary shelters that respond to local environmental conditions and human interactions? The research, simulation and prototyping rely on a behavioural and praxiological approach to architectural design that establishes a feedback loop between the algorithmically-encoded robotic capacities (behaviours), the material properties (morphogenetic processes) and sensing capabilities (neurological processes) of the agents and the emergent interactions and their self-organization in the environment in real-time. This project attempts to look at the ways these behaviours are digitally coded and physically expressed, as well as evaluate the overall agency granted to the system through the implementation of these behaviours with the overarching aim of developing new relationships between space and users through multi-agent robotic systems.","Swarm Robotics; Drone; Autonomous Agent; Soft Robotics; Inflatable; Generative Algorithms; User Interaction; Responsive Space; Aggregate Structures; Hyperbody","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Robotic Building","","34.653857,135.386118"

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","Wandering around the neighborhood and exploring the unstable interstitial space, the passages were deemed as the most vibrant stages for real life, the hidden gems behind the walls bounding the street. The passages connect the street to the consumption space behind the row of housing blocks, which is transformed from the old production structures due to gentrification and de-industrialization. With blurry sovereignty, people improvise, people share the space and people reuse. <br/><br/>This discovery led to the question: This discovery led to the question: Who should design the way of living? Architects or Individuals? The existing situation entitled ample freedom to individuals, yet the optimization of space in terms of usage and circulation is not ensured due to poor communication and consideration. Here is when architects introduce Generous Space. Generous Space is the stage for improvisation with an embedded narrative designed; empowered symbiotic benefits; and is a kind of semi-public space that entitled stakeholders a sense of ownership, be it charged or not.<br/><br/>In the urban level, Generous Space becomes the newly drawn internal urban passage, a public interior that generates different open spaces for the plot. The form of the varied open space suggests certain types of happenings respecting the zoning and edges definition of the plot under the theme of urban mining, which gains from the waste from the city. The actors along the urban passage can occupy the space for events in different timeframes and adjust accessibility when the plot evolves and the demand changes.<br/><br/>Architecturally, the project focused on the second-hand shopping arcade which is the end segment of the internal urban passage that lies between a gigantic social housing block and a strip of abandoned offices. Generous Space turns to flexible space, communal space, and shared space. Flexible space is demonstrated by the various combinations of living, production, and consumption spaces of the studios with free plans and band connections. Communal space is a kind of public space where different parties enjoy symbiotic benefits. This is exhibited by the communal thrift cafe that allows the neighbors and consumers to relax and work while displaying the repurposed furniture and accessories of the studios. A shared space is a more intimate space that is only shared among a smaller group of stakeholders, mostly found in the shared corridor that tenants can choose to collaborate for common interests or maintain it as the extension of individual space.<br/><br/>As for materialization, Generous Space is a system designed in a way that controls and allows replacement and appropriation. This could take place in different artifacts, a ceiling, a facade, a staircase, etc. The most prominent application is the ceiling of the passage, which also serves as the balcony garden of the residents. Wooden crates were collected from the neighborhood to form the modular structure where residents can choose the plantation to form a pattern for an ever-changing collective aesthetic. <br/><br/>The way of living is the most precious remnant to be spoliated. The passage is the identified stage that promised the actions. Architects, like and more than a choreographer, need to be generous enough when the dancers want more improvisation without deviating the main storyline.<br","Second hand; passage; urban architecture; spolia; generousity; imrpovisation; appropriation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The partial wetting regime implies the boundary condition dh/dz&gt;0 at the triple junction. The asymptotics as h↓0 are investigated. This is done by using a dynamical system for the error between the solution and the microscopic contact angle. Using the linearized version of the dynamical system, values for n when resonances occur are found. These resonances lead to a different behaviour for the solution as h↓0, so the asymptotics are found to be different for different values of n. Together with the asymptotics for h→∞ as found in [Giacomelli et al., 2016], the solution to the thin-film equation in partial wetting can be characterized. Also, via this solution, the relation between the microscopic and macroscopic contact angles can be analyzed. From the main result of this thesis, it can be seen that the macroscopic Tanner law for the contact angle depends smoothly on the microscopic contact angle.","thin-film equation; partial wetting; Differential Equations; dynamical systems; Fluid dynamics","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics","",""

The current method to do that systematically underestimates emission rates by 40%, and has an error estimate larger than 100% for most sources. I developed a new mass-balance method to reduce these errors, taking into account emissions moving from the source region into the surroundings. Its performance was tested using a year-long atmospheric transport model run over the United States. The new method has a lower emission underestimation of only 14-19%, while the errors are reduced by 60-70% compared to the old method. Direct application of the new method on TROPOMI data over two known large emission regions gives emission rates consistent with recent literature.","methane; emission; Quantification; TROPOMI","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

(mentor); Heimbs, Sebastian (mentor); van Campen, J.M.J.F. (graduation committee); Rans, C.D. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","As collisions between aircraft and birds happen many thousands of times every year, all aspects of such impact events need to be taken into account in the process of designing an aircraft. One aspect that poses a risk is caused by the vibrations induced during bird impact. These vibrations are propagated through the aircraft structure by stress waves. Severe vibrations can negatively affect aircraft components and electrical systems located near the point of impact. While a vast amount of knowledge and research on the modelling of direct bird impact damage is already available, a gap in understanding exists regarding such vibrations. The purpose of this thesis is to help fill this research gap. Therefore, this thesis tries to answer whether the shock effect caused by the stress waves generated during a bird impact on an aluminium alloy plate can be accurately predicted using state-of-the-art numerical modelling techniques. Two aspects are investigated. Firstly, it is evaluated whether the stress waves that propagate the impact loads through the structure can be identified in the model. Secondly, it is analysed how well the severity of the induced vibrations can be modelled. This is done by utilising five bird impact tests, which were performed by Airbus. In each of these tests, a bird impacts an aluminium alloy test plate, which represents a simplified aircraft structure. A dummy mass, attached to these test structures, represents an electrical system influenced by the vibratory response of the plate. The displacement of the plate is recorded using digital image correlation (DIC). Accelerometers at several locations of the test structure are used to record the vibrations. The author created a dynamic explicit finite element model of the test structures to analyse how well current modelling techniques can determine these stress waves and vibrations. The structure in this model employs mostly conventional shell elements. For the bird, a smooth particle hydrodynamic (SPH) model is used. Several types of stress waves are analysed. The main stress wave types evaluated are the in-plane longitudinal and the out-of-plane Rayleigh wave. An attempt is made to identify these waves in both the numerical model and the physical test. It is found that the DIC data of the impact test shows too much disturbance to evaluate these waves. In the numerical model, both an in-plane and an out-of-plane stress wave is seen. Their recorded velocities are seen to approach their theoretical value as the mesh is refined. The propagation velocity of the out-of-plane stress wave is found to depend on the structure of the mesh. When propagating diagonally to the mesh, a 17% lower wave propagation velocity is found compared to a wave travelling tangentially to the mesh. No research was available in which the vibrations of an aircraft structure due to bird impact are analysed. Therefore, the shock response spectrum (SRS) technique, as applied in the space industry to evaluate the severity and damaging potential of vibrations, is utilised. This is the first known research in which an SRS is applied to a bird impact problem. In this research, the SRS is used to compare vibrations from the tests and the numerical model. Such an SRS is generated from the acceleration-time signal of a vibration. It is found that the trend of the SRSs obtained from the numerical model approximates the SRSs from the bird impact test closely. However, due to the fickle pattern of the SRSs, a maximum discrepancy of 5 to 10 dB between model and test is common.","Bird Impact; Stress wave propagation; Shock Response Spectrum (SRS); Finite Element Analysis; Vibratory response","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2025-07-08","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

The implementation was performed in a structured manner by: (1) A literature review into the current applications of OCT in relation to current standards; (2) A thesis feasibility study into clinical practices, professional views and other processes regarding ICI; (3) A Master’s thesis including a cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) and the actual implementation of OCT at the department. The project started with a literature review about the current applications of OCT in relation to intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) and coronary angiography (CAG). The literature review has been published in Cardiology and Therapy. In general, OCT-guidance seems to contribute to favorable clinical outcomes compared with CAG-guidance alone. However, OCT-guidance results in similar clinical outcomes as IVUS-guidance. OCT could be considered for lumen assessment and stent related morphology in more complex cases in which CAG interpretation remains uncertain. Since OCT and IVUS have distinct characteristics, these techniques are complementary and should be considered carefully for each patient case based on the benefits and limitations of both techniques. The thesis feasibility study aimed at acquiring insights into the clinical practices, the different views, and other processes (data, training, etcetera) related to ICI at the LUMC and other medical centers. This was achieved by observing clinical practices at the LUMC and other medical centers, and by interviewing clinicians and technicians at those centers. Both the literature review and the feasibility study provided extensive insights in current practices and controversies regarding ICI. Such insights were essential before implementation of OCT. These insights were used to carefully execute the implementation, while accounting for the interests of all stakeholders as much as possible. In addition, the knowledge gained from the literature review and feasibility study were used as input for the master’s thesis. The master’s thesis included a health economic evaluation comparing cost-effectiveness of OCT with IVUS and CAG, and the actual implementation of OCT at the department. The CEA was performed using the concept of Markov modelling. In general, OCT along with CAG was a more cost-effective intracoronary treatment strategy than IVUS along with CAG for patients with CAD. However, the gain in QALYs and reduction in costs were limited. Both IVUS and OCT outperform CAG alone in terms of cost-effectiveness. With this thesis the current applications of OCT in relation to IVUS and CAG were identified, insights into different views and practices regarding ICI in the interventional cardiology domain were obtained and the cost-effectiveness of OCT-guided PCI compared with IVUS-guided PCI and PCI solely guided by CAG was assessed. In addition, OCT was implemented at the department of interventional cardiology of the LUMC. The processes, procedures and considerations around the implementation of OCT at the department of interventional cardiology were identified and described. Finally, the thesis was concluded with an argument about the added value of the technical physician as a new healthcare professional.","Coronary artery disease; Percutaneous coronary intervention; Intracoronary imaging; Optical Coherence Tomography; Intravascular ultrasound; Cost-effectiveness; Implementation","en","master thesis","","","","","","Related dataset 4TU.ResearchData https://doi.org/10.1007/s40119-020-00185-4","","2020-10-01","","","","Technical Medicine","",""

Improving facilities for an all-age-friendly city can provide a healthy and supportive life for both the young and the old living in cities. One of the cities of interest in this is Amsterdam. Amsterdam has been exploring sustainable and healthy city development, such as garden city in the 1920s. In Amsterdam Noord, a central area of Amsterdam, the post-industrial IJ bank and the attached garden villages currently need renovation. Amsterdam Noord is the potential site for an all-age-friendly development. Amsterdam Noord was built with the concept of garden city, where urban forest is used mainly as green buffer and formed entities from industrial nuisances. However, since the industry is moving out, the existing urban forest becomes barriers for connectivity and undermines the dike-polder landscape of Noord. Thus, this project takes urban forest as a key element to renovate Amsterdam Noord and aims to explore an urban forest framework for Amsterdam Noord to be all-age-friendly and to develop the Noord identity as a dike city and a garden city.<br/>Firstly, theoretical study is executed in topics of urban identity, all-age-friendly city, and urban forest to conclude a theoretical framework of restorative and identity-narrative green network. Secondly, based on the theoretical framework, site study is executed in topics of urban fabric, site visit of the dike, and urban forest tradition. Thirdly, these studies provide site-speci c strategies to build Amsterdam Noord with a restorative and identity-narrative plan, to develop the all-age-friendly-ness and its identity. As the result, this project proposes a multi-scale plan for Amsterdam Noord. In city scale (L), Amsterdam Noord is divided into 3 zones, with different urbanization plans, to integrate into the expanding Amsterdam center as well as preserve and develop its identity. In green system scale (M), a multi-functional and restorative urban forest network is designed with the old dike as its spine, to improve connectivity within and beyond Amsterdam Noord. In green space scale (S), urban forest places are designed to offer sensorial experiences related to identity elements, as well as provide all-age-friendly space and program for Noord. The results of this project will provide a new view about how Amsterdam Noord can be developed into a future garden city, which is all-age-friendly, green, and related to its own identity as a dike city.","Urban forest; Urban identity; Age-friendly city; Garden city; Amsterdam Noord","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Intralox’s current implementation is expensive, too complicated, and inaccurate. After considering several possible readout implementations, an inductively coupled solution with a frequency-based readout showed the most promise. The readout system is based on frequency domain measurement. It uses an impedance analyzer to measure the resonance frequency of the sensor accurately. The system must measure the resonance frequency with a 20 Hz accuracy in less than 10ms. Since the system only has minimal time to do a measurement, a complete frequency sweep of the bandwidth of interest (26.9 MHZ - 27.4 MHz) is not possible. There are multiple methods to improve the measurement speed by using smart signal design. A band-passed pseudo-random-noise signal yielded the best results. In this thesis, we document the impact of some of the known non-idealities on the measurement accuracy. The parasitic capacitance is probably the most critical non-ideality because it makes the resonance frequency depend on the coupling coefficient between the reader and the sensor. This dependence on the coupling coefficient makes the measurement susceptible to the coil position and angle. Therefore, the parasitic capacitance should be compensated to negate most of the error it produces. The simulation of the real-life implementation shows promising results. We conclude that the final design should, in theory, provide a working solution for Intralox.","Inductive coupling; Impedance analysis; Pseudorandom noise","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","2022-07-08","","","","Electrical Engineering","Bachelor graduation project Electrical Engineering",""

This situation is especially dominant on the site of Morgestond, Den Haag: a generic post war city where most migrants lives. Having rarely any leading culture or shared memory, the community struggled to establish a commen sense of belonging. However, if taking the architecture as a ‘system’, it has the capability to learn from virtual community. With a translational process, the ‘customizing system’ of virtual community was first diagrammized, then spatialized and materialized as an architecture.

The original territory, where Rome was founded, was incredibly marshy, due to the continuous flooding of the Tiber, but the Romans, thanks to their ingenuity, were able to reclaim the area through sewers and drains and to obtain running water thanks to the complex hydraulic system of the aqueducts. The relationship between Rome and its waters begins from its origins and has represented for centuries the authenticity of the city.<br/>The uncontrolled and immense growth of Rome, which occurred over the last 50 years, leads to a significant shift in urban infrastructure that has changed people’s attitude toward the water. This positivist approach to the construction of the modern city has contributed powerfully to the destruction, cancellation, alteration of many signs of the historical stratifications that derived their reasons, origins, and significant developments from the water factor.<br/>The Romans, who over the centuries coexisted with water in a resilient and technological society, today they perceive it as a separate element from their everyday life, which indeed often causes incredible problems with heavy storms and flooding or a long period of drought. <br/>The city today urgently needs to propose profound transformation to face the need for services and resolve issues brought by a developing populace and a modern lifestyle. The city needs to build its resilience in reacting to the social and ecological difficulties of its time while considering Rome’s really extraordinary nature. A uniqueness that must be protected and enhance. <br/>This research aims to provide site-specific strategies to reveal, connect, preserve, and explore the existing water-based identity of Rome, meanwhile creating an adaptive and resilient system, that could reduce flood risk and create socio-ecological transformations. <br/>Based on an in-depth study of the city in its various aspects - morphological, cultural, social, archaeological -the area of the historical center of the Palatine hill through to the Caffarella park has been chosen as study area. Along this axis the project defines “water-based” routes, which have the aim both to make known the ancient and modern water-based identity of the city and to solve the most serious problems of flooding and drought, creating public and green spaces available to citizens and tourists. Through the route, which begins in the Palatine area, in the urban heart of the city, the visitor will learn about an unusual and unknown history of Rome in which various modern and ancient elements take shape as part of a larger system. Visitors, both tourists and citizens, will understand the link between aqueducts, fountains and thermal baths but also the importance of more modern elements such as wetland, bioswales, watersquares, finally arriving at the end of the route at the Nymphaeum of Egeria at Parco della Caffarella, a place full of mystery and charm, surrounded by nature.<br/>It is therefore thanks to these routes that the city and its citizens regain their water-based identity, in a project that leaves ample room for both educational and recreational moments, creating areas that restore the relationship between urban and nature.<br","Sense of Place; tourist routes; resilience; adaptation; Nature-based solution; Urban ecology; green and blue system; Water-based Urbanization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","41.8894° N, 12.4875° E"

This time could be used for deliveries but in order to have a neutral interaction a behavioural change is required. Prior work by Desmet has mapped these ‘micro-emotions’ and described how they can be used to drive product design and shape product experience. As the sensing capacities and intelligence of our artefacts are increasing new opportunities arise. Could these micro-emotions also be used to shape the experience while a product is in use? We conducted a case study on an encounter between pedestrians and a small delivery robot. A clustering, based on people’s initial micro-emotions and experience, seemed to effectively capture how they would subsequently respond to the robot. We were able to design robot behaviour from these ‘emotion-clusters’ that helps to shape people’s response and experience according to achieve a time-efficient/neutral encounter.

Repairing, upgrading and restoring façades extends their lifecycle and reduces waste. The European Union and Dutch government have set goals to reach a circular future: in 2050 the built environment must be 100% circular. However, this demands a tremendous change in the current maintenance system. Façades are often maintained for the service life of only 50 years. Therefore, the quality at end-of-life is usually low. Additionally, due to issues in information capture and management, the condition at end-of-life is also challenging to determine. Therefore, façades are discarded as waste, sometimes way before they are at their actual end-of-life. Furthermore, to increase the circular potential of façades, the existing maintenance system requires change. In this research, an investigation is done into how the current maintenance system can be facilitated towards circular maintenance utilizing digital technologies. Inspections on façade defects are currently carried out manually. Afterwards, this information is stored and maintained manually in real estate software. Visual inspections and information systems are prone to human errors. Therefore, a study is done into the automation of the existing maintenance system to facilitate communication between parties. The Digital Twin (DT) is a real-time computer-generated BIM-model of the mother building, using sensors and Internet of Things (IoT) to capture data. Existing detection technologies are compared with detection sensors from literature, like infrared thermography and fibre sensors. The influence of the recommended sensors on the existing maintenance process is determined. The output of this is a new maintenance system using a DT to increase the circularity potential of façades.","Circular Economy; Maintenance; Management; Information; Building Information Modelling,; Digital Twins; Façades","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Management in the Built Environment","",""

The number of city dwellers is increasing all over the World, especially in the Global South where the shift from rural to urban life is still ongoing. Nevertheless, the resulting strategies to cope with the challenges that are following this escalation have often proved to be ineffective, leaving part of the population in miserable condition, unable to access proper housing and services. Particularly in developing countries, the lack of proper unifying urban strategies has led to the proliferation of gated communities, both formal and informal. As a result, a fracture between public and private space has been created. The aftermath of this phenomena are the lack of security and the communities’ alienation. Also, the call for progress, the attempt to build a modern ideal city and the pressure from the housing market have led to the erasure of the existing historical fabric, thus both tangible and intangible heritage. Therefore, the thesis’ pivot is the border-boundary condition and the transitional spaces as the crucial threshold toward an integrated and cohesive system, regarding physical transition, income groups, and technology. The project envisions an area where different income groups can come together, providing a regular and varied scheme, together with special urban condition. The in-between spaces, translated form the one observed and studied on site, provide a physical transition from public to private space and from existing to new architecture. Likewise, the technological feature aim at providing a solution which can be adapted and work in different conditions. The final intent is to realize a neighborhood where the local community will be supported believing also that this will lead also to the support of the incoming fabric as well.","Global South; Vault; Compressed Earth Block; Ethiopia; Addis Ababa; Heritage","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","","9.036067, 38.746930"

It can be equally seen on the urban level where this insular condition is a proliferating phenomenon. The contemporary city is characterized by the widespread propension of certain metropolitan fragments to detach themselves from their continuum of the city. Driven by the increasing dependency on logistics, this condition becomes a globalized urban form. It tends to become the privileged form of spatial organization in the contemporary city. Ports being its most accomplished version, by their monumentality, radicality and juxtaposition with the city. They tend to become territorial exceptions, ground exceptions, urbanization exceptions, time exceptions and legal exceptions at the heart of the city.<br/><br/>This is particularly visible in the cities neighbouring the port of Pireas, that has for some years been the site of an impressive transformation since the port was acquired by the Chinese. Since then, the port grows exponentially with the ambition to become the main commercial door to Europe for Asian importations. To accommodate ever more docks, the port progressively cannibalizes any available coastline. Gradually, the city finds itself encapsulated, trapped and asphyxiated by a large infrastructural barrier, without any access to the sea. The ports, supposed to be windows on the worlds become constrictive elements. The city of islands is at risk of becoming a city of conflicts. We need to find ways of diffusing that tension.<br/><br/>This project suggests an aggressive welcome to the urban condition created by the port while proposing to reclaim Pireas’ relationship with the seaboard. As the waterfront of the cities is turning into an infrastructural product, the new boardwalks may become perpendicular lines. This project investigates this hypothesis. It thus proposes a perforation through the infrastructural barrier from town to sea in an underused interstitial space of the port. It invites us to re-imagine the spatial relationships between architecture, landscape, energy and infrastructure in ports.","Exception; Territory; Insularity; Port; Bubble","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The current state of circularity in land tendering is studied by a case study of four cases. Subsequently, the findings from these cases are verified and refined in interviews with expert in the field of circular land tendering. This leads to two sets of recommendations: a land tender process and tender criteria. The circular land tendering process consists of six steps: - CE tender policy, where the available policy regarding circular land tendering must be studies - Context, where the context must be studied - Project goals, where three or four project goals must be defined, which are pursued in the tender. To stimulate circularity, this must be one of the core aims. - Tender procedure, where the best procedure is selected, which must incorporate a dialogue - Tender criteria, where tender goals are translated into awarding criteria, either quantitative or qualitative. - Awarding &amp; control: Where the contract is drawn up and enforced.

Building-integrated photovoltaic panels (BIPV) which would assist for the resolution of the problem can be applied by replacing the façade cladding with BIPV panels whenever possible. The optimum orientation of PV panels for the Netherlands is south with an angle of 37°, which maximises total electricity production. While the process is simple for new buildings and systems installed in areas with no orientation restrictions or horizon obstructions, the scenario becomes more challenging in urban settlements. As the premises cannot be reoriented in an urban context, solutions may be finding the best places to install BIPV panels on the façade and tilting them. This process can be deployed simultaneously with the building refurbishment that is needed to reach the current envelope insulation standards. Tilting can increase the energy yield, but this would increase the production costs and thus, initial investment costs. The balance between energy yield and added production costs can be found by locating the right panel in the right place on a limited budget. In this study, an early-stage computational design method to optimally allocate and reorient BIPV façade modules to reach a cost-effective and applicable solution is presented.

Currently, these coastal communities are being affected by an amount of socio-economical issues, some examples being the significant percentage of unemployment, pollution, ecological degradation and flooding, which on communities of the pacific coast happen on average 42 times a year. Puntarenas has a particular condition of being a territory generated by sedimentation, not only allowing for human settlement and economic activities but also manifested in the ecological processes surrounding it. The sand stretch is a result of recent sedimentation patterns, a simultaneous dynamic of littoral and sea currents which over the years resulted in a series of morphological transformations, though becoming less strong once human settlement happened. Another consequence of this morphological process is the generation of a mangrove ecosystem which for years has benefited from the sedimentation and its spatial relation with the sand stretch barrier. Now these natural dynamics have been strengthened by climate change and anthropogenic activity, increasingly threatening the future of the landscape and the life within. Under this conditions flooding will evolve from what the residents of Puntarenas have perceived so far as a temporary phenomenon to becoming a permanent event.

As its population grows exorbitantly, waves of migrants are flowing endlessly into the capital city. Such a fast pace of development brings about a hallucinated future constituted by processes driven by economic and political forces pursuing efficient outcomes. Addis Ababa wants to deliver quickly, in great quantities and as cheap as possible: there is little time for thinking! Against this background, it seems a matter of great urgency to provide the city with alternative visions. This is particularly relevant if we consider that being a federal city, Addis Ababa is geographically limited, and, therefore, it cannot expand outside of its boundaries. As a result, such a self-destructive spiral tends to move forward while erasing its traces, threatening the most consolidated neighbourhoods that struggle to coexist with the explosive growth of the city. The inner city represents, indeed, a land of high value and the inhabitants who have been living there for more than a hundred years are now under threat of eviction. It appears that the old city and its style of life could be swept away at any moment by a masterplan that does not take into consideration its value. Alongside such a tangible heritage comprised of streets, alleyways and historical architecture composing material narratives, there are human ones moulded through the structures of the longue durée. The question the intervention poses is how can we densify and reconfigure delipidated historical districts without erasing their traces, interpret their styles of life while providing a dynamic structure that can cater for the dreams of their inhabitants? Is it possible to decode decentralized morphogenetic processes and learn from self-organizing systems to design modern cities? Can architecture be something other than the imposition of a demiurge that shapes inert matter, in such a way that it turns into the acceptance of every event of life, constantly balancing freedom and control like a funambulist, not pursuing chaos but rather by being open and not reacting to it. In short, paraphrasing Charles Correa, how can we open new doors to new aspirations while drawing on existing values? Through the exploration of the current situation, complemented with oral fragments of memories and historical footages, I began to familiarize with the processes of becoming of the patterns of everyday life in the neighbourhood. The aim of the project is twofold: on the one hand, it intends to draw on the existing values and collective memory to reconfigure the narratives of historical districts; on the other hand, the ambition is to provide a structure that can adapt through time and be open to change. If the model is neither entirely taken from the current configuration nor imposed as an external solution, but rather one derived from the internal morphogenetic capabilities, a new one, then, could bridge the apparent opposition between local and universal.","inner city redevelopment; reconfiguration; self-organizing systems; slum redevelopment","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","","9.036678, 38.749290"

This is examined by analysing the operational trip data of the bicycle sharing program called HTM-fiets, conducting a survey among the users of this bicycle sharing program and performing an expert meeting. The results indicate that in this case the shared bicycle does not complement urban public transport to a large extent in a single ride and seems more used as a substitute of urban public transport. Therefore, it is probably more valuable to focus on integrating the shared bicycle with urban public transport as a whole than to assure a good integration in a single ride. To realise the integrated public transport and shared bicycle system, the shared bicycle could be marketed as a form of public transport and the shared bicycle could be made available in areas with weak urban public transport connections to increase the total network and with that the accessibility in cities.","Bicycle sharing programs; Urban Public Transport; Complementary; Substitution; Modal shift","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Transport, Infrastructure and Logistics","",""

For accomplishing sustainable growth, the European Commission set the objective for achieving a circular economy in 2050. Rijkswaterstaat pushed this ambition even further, wanting to be circular in 2030. In the province Noord-Holland, the municipalities Bergen, Uitgeest, Castricum and Heiloo work together in the organization called ‘de BUCH’. They have the ambition to be the leading municipalities in circular economy. For their transition, they questioned the ‘Delft Design Lab Participatory City Making Lab’ at the University of Technology Delft: how to change the norm behaviour of their citizens towards circular norm behaviour at a local level? To answer this question, first the context was explored on the topics of waste, circular economy and behaviour change. After that the ambitious question of the BUCH is researched by researching how the citizens in the BUCH can be facilitated to the transition towards a circular economy. This is researched by 1) an intervention, 2) a competitor analysis on circular practices, 3) a survey on the behaviour of citizens in the BUCH, and 4) multiple semi-structured in-depth interviews. The key insight of the research is that a large proportion of the citizens in the BUCH is motivated to practice circular behaviour. However, the opportunity to do that is experienced as low. Various designs for those opportunities were made and evaluated. While operationalizing these designs, there was the critical insight: a circular initiative network is missing that brings together the ambitious and motivated citizens in the BUCH. This resulted in the final design: De BUCH rond maken: Samen doen we het. Consisting out of: •A Circular Initiative Network administrator: This person functions and acts as the network administrator of circular initiatives in the BUCH. The person enables to establish novel relationships between people and groups of people, which catalyses value to emerge between those people. •Initiative makers package: The package is a tool that citizens can request. It contains the essential steps to explain a circular initiative idea from multiple facets. The tool than helps to have conversations with other people, helping to operationalize the idea. •Do together: This is in essence a collaborating process. In order to catalyse this process, it is key to follow certain principles and have a certain mindset. Also, the role that the Circular initiative network administrator takes in such collaborative effort is key. The final design also contains a plan with key actions to follow, in order to facilitate the citizens in their transition towards a circular economy. A key action point is the communication towards the BUCH citizens, as having communication from multiple various sources will help in changing the norm. The design showed promising results in a creative session with initiative leaders and citizens from the BUCH municipalities. It is recommended that the final design is put further into a pilot for testing and development. This to, while doing that together, operationalize the transition of the BUCH citizens towards a circular economy.","Circular economy; Transition; Waste; Behaviour change; De BUCH gemeenten; Circulair Centrum De BUCH; Delft Design Labs; Participatory City Making; Emergence; System design; Circular behaviour; Intervention; Network","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

This method was chosen after analyzing the criteria for a vegetable processing factory and combining this with a literature research to previous methods applied to solve these ""facility layout problems"". The gradient descent approach uses the partial derivatives of a multi-variable objective, the flow-cost, in order to get a vector which is the direction of greatest descent. Computing this vector for all departments and then moving them creates an iterative improving loop. In addition to the gradient descent approach a swapping procedure and a shooting procedure is introduced in order to reduce the effect of random starting position. From the result of the first-stage model, relative location constraints are extracted to be used in the second-stage model, a linear constraint programming solver capable of running optimizations by google or-tools [36], to greatly reduce the solution space. The proposed method was tested on two toy-problems from Tam and Li [44] and compared to results existing in literature. Additionally, the effect of including a first-stage model was tested as well. When looking directly at the results, the proposed method is consistent and shows good results. Especially the inclusion of the first-stage model helps finding better solutions. Compared to other results found in the literature, the method shows slightly less good results based purely on the objective value. However, the final layouts found in this thesis are more compact.","Facility Layout Problem; Gradient Descent Approach; Layout Optimization; Mixed Integer Programming","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Building Technology","",""

If so, how?<br/><br/>Besides that, cities are getting bigger and bigger, in height and hectare. Eventually, there is a limited possible grow and there is a need to look for other solutions to densify. In times where the demand for new homes is reminiscent of the ‘Volkshuisvesting’ of the 70’s and 80’s, we are obliged to look creatively at our current housing stock and urban infill. Our stock exists for 33% (CBS 2016) out of houses built between the 70’s and the 80’s. Which consists mainly out of family homes. In the building complex, the family homes can easily be divided into studios or two-room apartments to increase the density and variation of housing in the building.

The rational city of the modernist era has been eroded by the forces of globalisation and the liberalised economy, erasing the traditional points of reference in the urban environment. Consequently, this space has become increasingly illegible. Koolhaas notes: ‘We were making sandcastles. Now we swim in the sea that swept them away’. Similar Deyan Sudjic describes the city as ‘an urban soup’.<br/>However, a new form of ‘city-ness’ is emerging from the dullness of urbanisation. It is forming around stations, along road arteries and connected by fibre optic cables. Following the lines of infrastructure, these linear fragments of development thrive on diversity, density and perpetual change: we call them urban coral reefs. Linear in their form, these complex ecosystems provide a new habitat for the urbanites of the twenty first century.<br/>This is particularly noticeable in the suburban centres, like Ilford in East London, where the myth of Metroland has collapsed and city dwellers now look to more accessible places to live. The comfort of the semi-detached house with a garden has been substituted for the convenience of living near a train station. As Paul Virilio and Antoine Picon explain, time and speed are now more important than distance.<br/>This change in habits has engendered an unprecedented migration from the leafy residential streets of suburbia to the dense centres and high roads, which were traditionally reserved for commercial and retail uses. In Ilford, speculative high-rises and apartment blocks are replacing the decaying industrial sheds and vacant lots that once populated parts of the town centre. The influx of new residents will put pressure on the existing public spaces and amenities as densities in the area top the scale for the London Metropolitan Area.<br/>In this context, there is a growing need to ensure the resilience of the reef by creating a legible and engaging space that can support the needs of the community and cater to a changing demographic.","Urban Design Framework; Infrastructure; placemaking; Heritage; crossrail; Church; ilford; Public realm; pedestrian perception","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","","51.557702, 0.069150"

It is an intangible, psychological and sociological need that is projected on, and connected to the Built Environment (Rennels &amp; Purnell, 2017; Dovey, 1985). Many people in western societies meet their 'sense of home' through traditional housing. Yet, there is a small marginalized group of homeless people whom are unable to do so. Many suffer from severe physical and mental health diseases, which makes it even more challenging to maintain a stable life. Dutch policymakers provide shelters to assist those in need, but these accommodations do not positively affect the well-being of the homeless. In addition, many shelters fail to facilitate the wish of homeless people of dying in the shelter (Klop et al., 2018). <br/><br/>Therefore, the aim of this research is to redefine shelter design so to improve the mental well-being of homeless people. This, by learning lessons from psycho-supportive design approaches in the healthcare environment. Hence, the main question in this research is: ‘Which architectural elements in the care environment have a positive effect on the (mental) well-being of homeless (terminal) people with chronic mental health problems?’.<br/>The above question is answered by means of literature studies, case study analysis and fieldwork. From the results, several spatial-design components have been extracted and categorized into problems and solutions concerning the theoretical themes of: stigma; security; sensorial stimulation and environmental experience. <br/><br/>The results showed that privacy, daylight entrance, access to nature and social integration are the four main elements that positively improve one’s (mental or physical) well-being. Additional spatial-design components have been summarized into four conclusive Evidence-Based-Design guidelines and crucial design factors which may be applied on both urban and building scale. When all four guidelines are considered in the architectural design of shelters, the best mental health outcomes are achieved.<br/>As the issue of homelessness is not yet solved and the number of people with complex care needs increase, the Netherlands is in desperate need of more assisted and affordable housing. With this research architects, urban planners and developers are encouraged to enter the discourse of homelessness. Moreover, they are stimulated to use the Evidence-Based Toolkit into the design process of new homeless shelters.","Homelessness; Evidence Based Design; Dwelling; Shelter; Psycho-supportive design; Healthcare architecture; Palliative care; Mental health; Social care","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Explorelab","","51.882035,4.537928."

Its monolithic, smooth, and transparent look transmits a sense of elegance and simplicity. However, due to its brittle mechanical property, it can create complex engineering challenges when intended for a structural load-bearing application. Many forget glass has a comparable compression strength to steel and excels when compared to the mechanical properties of unreinforced concrete. (Oikonomopoulou, 2019; Ashby, 2006) Until now, there have been 4 primary discovered manufacturing techniques for glass. Float glass has a 25mm thickness limitation. (AGC, 2019) Extruded and float glass cannot form complex 3D geometries. (Roeder, 1971) 3D printed glass is not structurally validated. (Klein, 2015) Cast glass can offer a solution to all of these limitations. (Oikonomopoulou, 2019)<br/>This thesis answers the following question: To what extent can topological optimisation and new fabrication methods be employed to create compressive free-form glass structures? To answer this this thesis will delve into glass, topology optimisation and shell structures. Throughout the thesis it will notice how topology optimisation and shell structures offer solutions to glass related challenges.<br/>Compression Shells are ideal for Glass. Why? Because glass is brittle. This means that it fractures without warning when tension is applied to a crack. Glass has a low tensile strength but a very high compressive strength. That is why shell structures are ideal for glass as they experience compression only loads. (Adriaenssens et al., 2014) Shells best utilize the strengths of glass and avoid testing its weakest limitations. <br/>Annealing time is one of the most challenging aspects of cast glass. As the volume/mass ratio increases the annealing time increases exponentially. (Oikonomopoulou, 2019) This means careful consideration should be attributed to decreasing this time. This thesis used topology optimisation as a tool to decrease the thickness and thus the annealing time. This thesis explains structural optimisation and evaluates different topological optimisation approaches and software. At the end a 43% mass reduction was achieved.<br/>The goal in this thesis was to design an 6x6m booth from cast glass for the martial district exhibition. After the shell was topologically optimised and structurally validated by means of finite element analyses, the booth was designed for manufacturing, transportation and assembly. The booth was subdivided to fit in trucks and be assembled using spider cranes. The manufacturing procedure was developed using additively manufactured sand mould designs. Demountable and reusable connections, and foundation designs were also developed for the shell.<br","Topology Optimisation; Topology Optimization; Shell Structures; Cast Glass; Glass; Structural glass; Casting; 3d printed mould; Additive Manufacturing; Parametric Design; Shell","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","",""

By applying PCA, this thesis explores and optimises the correlation between space layout and energy performance of a co-living residence in the Netherlands. Firstly, a generic model is developed to gain initial findings, then, is applied to a case-study to evaluate its practicability. The study considers a mixed-mode building with adaptive thermal comfort models and optimises three objectives distinctively: the cooling, the heating and the lighting demands.<br/>The results provide both computational and energy-efficient insights, useful to achieve performance-driven designs. Despite the main influence of the envelope parameters on the energy demand, it is beneficial to plan the functions in order to fulfil their energy and comfort requirements. Different functions play the leading roles in minimising different objectives, varying the depth, the orientation and the windows accordingly. In shallow buildings, energy-optimised configurations can save more than 37% of the total energy demand. However, the results are strictly dependent on the solution space defined by the parametric model. In practice, the designer needs to translate the underlying principles of space layout or to develop a site-specific optimisation.","Space Layout; Energy Efficiency; Optimisation; Performative computational architecture; Layout Optimization; energy performance","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Building Technology","",""

One of the common surface representations of 3D building models is polygon mesh, which is both compact and efficient in terms of exchange format<br/>and data processing respectively. Downstream applications of polygon meshes can be found in the fields of urban planning, digital mapping, and fluid simulation.<br/>However, the aforementioned applications usually require the input to be watertight and manifold, which is not always fulfilled by existing building models. Moreover, the interior structures of a building model are also considered redundant in certain applications. From such practical demands comes<br/>our graduation project, i.e. trying to recover watertight and manifold outer surface from error-ridden 3D building models.<br/>Existing methods with respect to outer surface extraction can be categorized into two types: surfaceoriented methods and volumetric methods. The former focuses on one particular type of artifacts and operates directly on the surfaces of the defective model. Since surface-oriented methods mainly introduce local operations where needed, unnecessary changes of the original model can be avoided and the result is of high fidelity. Whilst, the latter generates an intermediate representation of the original model, based on which the outer surface is extracted. The volumetric methods are more heuristic for our project since they are designed especially for multiple artifacts and the results are gauranteed with some desired properties.<br/>In this thesis, we propose a hybrid approach for the extraction of outer surface from error-ridden 3D building models, which aims at recovering a watertight and manifold outer shell of the original model. The advantage of our method is that it is non-parametric, fully automatic, and have no assumptions for the input. Moreover, the small features of original model are kept to the greatest extent after processing.<br/>Our method can be divided into four steps: 1) pre-processing, 2) constrained tetrahedralization, 3) classification, and 4) outer surface extraction. All six types of artifacts listed in this paper are gradually resolved during these steps, resulting in a watertight and manifold representation.<br/>The results from our experiments turn out that our methodology can generate valid results in most cases, while preserving input faces and small features at the same time. Comparing with several stateof-the-art methods, our results still possess superior properties in terms of validity and integrity.","Outer Surface Extraction; 3D Building Models; 3D Models; Model Repair; Artifact","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geomatics","",""

The focus on relationships, community and reducing resources led to the subject of cohousing; a residential community that shares resources, facilities and that undertakes joint activities. This type of living suits – and can even improve – social cohesion within Almere Haven and the feeling of being part of something. The original thought of ‘De Werven’ was to create small, social neighbourhoods within a larger residential neighbourhood. Implementing cohousing within this typology therefore suits the original intention. By changing the housing typologies a community is realised for different family situations suitable for all ages. For the transformation the present existing materials will be harvested and reused to establish a circular and low-energy living environment. An environment in which the individual is just as important as the community.","cohousing; community; centraal wonen; circularity; reuse; Almere; Almere-Haven; Experimentele woningbouw; Joop van Stigt; De Werven","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Heritage & Architecture","Adapting 20C Heritage","52.336654, 5.222934"

It also puts pressure on logistic service providers, their employees, traffic and the environment. Parcel deliveries to service points or parcel lockers could release some of this pressure. However, service points are only scarcely used by Dutch consumers, while parcel lockers still lack a dense network. In addition, it is unclear how Dutch consumers can be persuaded to use these options more, and what kind of travel mode they will use for their parcel pick-ups. Two stated choice experiments were constructed to find out which factors influence Dutch consumer preferences for different delivery methods as well as the choice for a travel mode to pick-up a parcel. The results indicate that delivery prices and delivery moments are important factors that influence consumer choices for a delivery option. Several background characteristics, like age and current e-shopping behaviour, also have an influence. For the pick-up mode choices, distance and weight were most important. Here current travel behaviour plays a large role as well. There is potential in setting prices and delivery moments such that the self-pickup methods are used more. Building a dense parcel locker network can further accelerate this, and will also favour pick-up modes like walking and cycling. Future research should, therefore, focus on the complex situation in the Dutch parcel market, in order to analyse how more collaboration between the different parties in this sector can be improved such that prices, delivery moment and distances to pick-up points favour pick-up methods more.","Parcel Delivery; Parcel Lockers; Home Delivery; Consumer Preferences; Mixed Logit Model; Pick-up; Last mile; Parcel; Stated Preference","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

An important barrier that needs to be overcome in order to fully adopt its potential is uncertainty and its risk to the implementation of different electrication alternatives. The absence of information that illustrates the effect of uncertainty on the performance of these alternatives decreases the stability of business cases and hinders the decision-making process. To filll a part of this knowledge gap, this research performed a case-study revolving around a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model of an integrated chemical cluster in the Port of Rotterdam. The effect of the uncertain factors on the KPIs was analyzed using an exploratory modelling and analysis (EMA) approach. In addition, a key opportunity of the MILP model was utilized by changing the objective function to look at individual and collective actor optimization perspectives. This research implicates that EMA can be an effective approach to explore the effect of various uncertain factor on industrial systems undergoing electrication. Furthermore, when the goal is to perform a broad uncertainty analysis that allows for easy implementation of actor optimization perspectives while requiring only limited information about the uncertain factors in the form of sampling bandwidths, the combination of EMA and MILP can be a powerful tool.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-07-07","","","","","",""

This emerging phenomenon sees the instrumentalization of cultural events and festivals into powerful economic tools to attract a global flow of event-driven tourists. This economic model, together with the fast development of infrastructural fast connection has led to an intensification of the number of events planned throughout the year, which shifts the notion of events as temporal manifestations, towards a permanent asset of our contemporary cities. Such constant intensity of global flow is threatening the traditional role of public space, as commercial space for global customer is prioritised over civic space for local inhabitants. The research investigates the new spatial consequences of such phenomenon in the dynamics of contemporary cities and searchers for solutions that can address this necessary dichotomy between the global and the local. In search of new spaces that are able to host this necessary dichotomy and also to equally address both perspectives, the global one and the local. The design project analyses the case of the city of Milan, a contemporary city that is strongly betting on the cultural economy, hence the festivalisation of its city centre to attract global event-driven tourism.The project looks at the area of Rogoredo, one of the 7 abandoned railway yards, surrounding the city of Milan, as a key site that can embrace this contemporary dichotomy. Looking into spatial solutions that can transform what today is an infrastructural barrier into a valuable event-based public space of the future. The project focuses on architectural solutions to maintain and revalue the railway yard of Rogoredo (Milan) and its surrounding.By the reuse of the existing infrastructural framework of the site, no longer as a transit hub but as a construction hub, this project shows how it could lead to the design of flexible, reversible public spaces to host these series of cultural/economic events, and improving the local contexts.In other words, looking at the advantages (economical and sustainable) of avoiding a tabula rasa scenario of the site, and instead reusing, and integrate the existing infrastructural framework ( from train tracks, train cars, abandoned warehouse, etc) together with the series of industrial clusters that are present in the proximity of the site, to regenerate the area from an ex-mobility node to future proof, flexible construction arteria which can rely upon local (on-site) construction industries. Eventually transforming Rogoredo as one of the key glo-cal cultural nodes of the city of Milan.","dichotomy; glocal; contemporary cities; Architecture; Urbanism; cultural economy; Milan, Italy; festivalisation; Built Environment; splintering effect; Entrepreneurship; Event design; Festivals; Experience economy; railway yard; Construction; circularity; Modularity; stage","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","",""

The Deep Spectroscopic High-redshift Mapper 2.0 (DESHIMA 2.0) will use an integrated superconducting spectrometer chip with a 220-440 GHz band coverage and a spectral resolution of f/df = 500, enabling submillimeter observations with an unprecedented instantaneous band coverage.<br/><br/>However, the octave bandwidth of DESHIMA 2.0 poses a challenge: the atmospheric transmission is highly nonlinear in the broad frequency window of DESHIMA 2.0, complicating the removal of atmosphere noise from the signal. <br/><br/>In this thesis, I present the Time-dependent End-to-end Model for Post-process Optimization (TiEMPO). TiEMPO provides realistic time-dependent simulations of high-redshift galaxy observations. It consists of the following components: <br/><b>Galaxy model.</b> A galaxy is modeled using a two-component modified blackbody spectrum as a template. The model outputs the flux density, which is converted to power spectral density using the frequency-dependent effective aperture area of the telescope. <br/><b>Atmosphere model. </b>TiEMPO makes use of atmosphere model ARIS, which models a spatially and dynamically varying atmosphere and outputs Extra Path Length. TiEMPO converts this to precipitable water vapor using a relation that was found with the Smith-Weintraub value of the Extra Path Length and the ideal gas law. <br/><b>Telescope beam. </b>TiEMPO can be adapted to use any arbitrary beam shape for the near-field telescope beam. The far-field beam is modeled using the effective aperture area. Finally, the output of TiEMPO is given at multiple positions, enabling simulations of sky chopping and nodding in two directions. <br/><b>Radiation transfer. </b>A static model of the sensitivity of DESHIMA, determining the attenuation and the emission of the atmosphere and transmitting the signal through each component of the telescope and instrument.<br/><b>Spectrometer chip.</b> TiEMPO can adopt any filter transmission of the channels inside a spectrometer chip. In this work, they are approximated with Lorentzian curves. The photon and recombination noise are modeled with the NEP and the noise distribution is approximated with a normal distribution. The noise is incorporated with an integration over the filter response, treating photon-bunching over the wide bandwidth of DESHIMA 2.0 accurately.<br/><b>Conversion to sky temperature.</b>Finally, the power measured in the chip is related to the sky temperature with an interpolation made with a skydip simulation in the radiation transfer model.<br/><br/>We compare the first TiEMPO simulations to observation data by comparing the time signal, power spectral density and noise equivalent flux density. Apart from a small offset in the power spectral density, the simulation data closely resembles the observation data. TiEMPO allows us to test algorithms for atmosphere removal and galaxy detection, to study the effect of different weather conditions and to evaluate the performance of different observing techniques. TiEMPO is modular, making it usable for the original DESHIMA instrument and its successor DESHIMA 2.0. The use of TiEMPO can be extended to other spectrometers besides DESHIMA 2.0, like a grating spectrometer, and other telescopes, such as the promising 50m-aperture AtLAST/LST telescope.","Simulation; Computer Model; Kinetic Inductance Detectors; Millimeter-wave; Submillimeter-wave; DESHIMA; Spectrometer; Filter Bank; Mathematics; Physics","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics | Applied Physics","",""

Applying infrastructure, such as stop signs and traffic lights, are supposed to prevent collisions on the intersection. However, such methods contribute to the travel delay, while accidents still occur due to human errors. Considering the rise of automation within vehicles, the automation of intersections becomes possible. Vehicles exchange information with each other (distributed techniques) or with a central unit (centralized techniques) to determine the velocity profile needed to efficiently cross the intersection without causing any collisions. This information exchange is established through the creation of spontaneous wireless networks between vehicles and infrastructure, also known as a Vehicular Ad-Hoc Network (VANET).<br/><br/>However, the addition of wireless communication to autonomous vehicles presents a dangerous vulnerability to cyber attacks. In the literature, many studies investigate what types of cyber attacks are most likely to occur on the VANET. From these studies, it is chosen to test the cyber attack called ""false data injection"" on Virtual Platooning based Intersection Control.<br/><br/>It is shown in simulations that an alteration in the broadcasted messages for a duration of $1.3$ seconds already leads to a collision on the intersection. In order to prevent such events from happening, a Sliding Mode Observer (SMO) is designed to monitor the received data from the surrounding vehicles. Treating the false injected data as an unknown input to the system, the SMO is designed to reconstruct the anomalous data.<br/><br/>The accuracy of the unknown input reconstruction using an SMO depends on how well the model describes the dynamics of the vehicles. Thus the SMO is designed for both a linear as well as a non-linear vehicle model. To analyze the performance of the SMO, the observer is applied to both simulations and experiments. Under the assumption that the vehicles can measure the relative velocity to each other, both the simulations and the experiments show promising results.","Intersection Control; Sliding Mode Observer; Anomaly Detection; Autonomous vehicles; Anki overdrive","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(mentor); Meijers, P.C. (graduation committee); Antonakas, Panagiotis (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","Pre-piling templates are often used in the offshore industry to ensure the vertical installation of foundation piles for jacket structures. Boskalis is currently preparing a project that uses these templates in the Taiwan Strait, which is a region known for its relatively soft soils and seismic activity. Consequently, the piles are very long in order to enable sufficient bearing capacity. In earlier work, an Orcaflex model was developed to predict the dynamic behavior of 90 meter long piles stabbed in the template with 5 meter penetration into the seabed, which resembles the situation prior to pile driving. The obtained results indicated excessive loads on the template due to large swaying motions of the piles. This problem is caused by resonance: the natural swaying frequency of the long piles interferes with significant wave energy. In this thesis, this model is further developed and improved by identifying and addressing the following three shortcomings.<br/><br/>First, the model does not account for wave diffraction effects at the piles. A simplified model is developed to study the impact of wave diffraction on the pile swaying amplitude in the frequency domain using a theory by MacCamy and Fuchs. In order to model wave diffraction effects in Orcaflex, diffraction-corrected added mass coefficients are assigned to each pile node based on spectral density analyses of the acceleration of the waves relative to the pile. Second, in the adapted model, the effect of flow oscillation is not considered in the drag coefficient definition, which leads to inaccurate modelling of the drag loads. This deficiency is corrected by modelling the influence of the Keulegan-Carpenter number on the drag coefficient. To do so, the oscillation period parameter of the Keulegan-Carpenter number at each pile node is assumed based on spectral density analyses of the velocity of the waves relative to the pile. Drag coefficients are calculated from the Keulegan-Carpenter numbers and related to Reynolds numbers. This relation is used in Orcaflex. Third, the pile clamp modelling is simplified in the adapted model. A realistic clamp design is assumed to model the clamp more accurately. Based on the results of time-domain simulations, the maximum loads on the template decrease in short-wave sea states when diffraction is accounted for. Further, while model results with the revised drag coefficient show an increase in pile swaying velocities, the maximum loads on the template remain roughly identical. Yet, with the revised pile clamp, the model predicts significantly higher loads on the template. Overall, the results show a violation of the template design limits in several load cases. This implies the need for either redesigning the template or finding a work method solution to mitigate the pile swaying. The latter is pursued by modelling vessel wave shielding.<br/><br/>By turning the vessel in a certain heading relative to the dominant wave direction, one can shield the installation site from waves and reduce the loads on the piles. To model this, a hydrodynamic diffraction analysis is performed in Ansys Aqwa. Velocity potential data is obtained to describe the influence of the vessel on the waves near the piles, which is subsequently incorporated into the Orcaflex model. Now, the predicted loads on the template no longer exceed the design limits, which demonstrates that shielding is an effective strategy to ensure workability, provided that the vessel roll motion does not become excessive. Since roll can cause large crane tip motions that would complicate the operation, it is recommended to further study the vessel motions during shielding.","modelling; OrcaFlex; Aqwa; Frequency-domain; Time-domain simulations; wave diffraction; Drag coefficient; Shielding; hydrodynamic diffraction analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2025-07-06","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering | Floating Offshore Structure","Master Thesis","24.80666344, 119.923662972"

The interactions between the mRNA strands and proteins form links in the network, while these molecules form the nodes of the network. Numerical models for the dynamics of such a network, through solving a minimally nonlinear stochastic differential equation show nontrivial dynamics. This behavior is caused by non linearity introduced by the positivity condition, this is due to the fact that molecular concentrations cannot cannot be negative. Whether these dynamics are stable, oscillatory or chaotic seems to depend on the average connectivity of the network. There appears to be a region of networks that can transition from chaotic behavior to stable behavior. For a simple differential equation this would not be a region, but just one value. This region, referred to as the “Edge-of-Chaos” region, is therefore rather interesting. In this report we analyse the Lyapunov spectrum in order to quantify these dynamics. This is a way to measure the stability of the solution of out differential equation. We look at how different parameters in the minimally nonlinear differential equation and the generation of the network affect these dynamics. The investigated parameters include different edge weights, different noise levels, different equilibrium values and different network types. After studying the dynamics of a single network, we study the dynamics of populations of networks using an evolutionary algorithm and a co-evolutionary algorithm. We found that an edge of chaos region exists universally, that is for all types of networks we looked at, for all feasible noise levels, for all equilibrium values and for all network sizes. Whether or not a network lies in this region is determined by how much self interaction its nodes have compared to the strength of the interactions between the nodes. Additionally, the size of the network determines how well this “Edge-of-Chaos” plateau forms. Larger networks in this region behave more stable than smaller ones. We also came to the conclusion that both the evolutionary and co-evolutionary algorithm, using the Kullback-Leibler divergence in accordance with a probability distribution defined by a Hamiltonian to compare the fitness of individuals, do not yield the expected results. That is, they do not show any correlation between the connectivity of a network and the development of the population over time.","","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics | Applied Physics","",""

Poisson's equation is a partial differential equation that is solved with the usage of Green's functions. This is a major advantage because Earth's surface is an equipotential, which leads to a Dirichlett boundary condition. We apply this methodology to a spherical Earth, where the Green's function is closed. It is demonstrated that, when this Green’s functions based methodology is applied to a homogeneous density, a linear spherical density and the PREM density profiles (where all density profiles are spherically symmetric), then discontinuities occur in the accelerationof gravitation across the surface of the Earth, in the range of 0.01 %- 0.13 %. Such an effect is a symptom of incompatibility with the laws of physics for geostaticalequilibrium, and it is certainly significant as compared to the numerical accuracy of the solution. Moreover, the discrepancy is dependent on geographical latitude, as was to be expected, because it somehow reflects the centrifugal effect. The conclusion is made that this method is indeed capable of detecting, and even quantifying, the incompatibility of spherically symmetric mass distributions with the fundamental laws of physics for self-gravitating and rotating planets. This opens a way -and this is one of the main results- to computing corrections to spherically symmetric mass distributions, such as the PREM model. Based on this method, a further way forward to this end is suggested.","Green's function molecular; Poisson equation; gravitational field; self-gravitating; rotating; planet","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics | Applied Physics","",""

One of the main mechanisms for foam generation at steady state is Roof snap-off. In some cases, mechanistic models of Roof snap off, based on observations from 2D micromodels are used for reservoir simulation. The main problem with these experiments is in their 2D nature. Two-phase flow within a 2D medium requires that the fluids paths cross and compete for pore occupancy. This virtually ensures fluctuating pore occupancy and therefore puts into question the applicability of 2D mechanistic models for steady state foam generation in 3D media. Two-phase flow in a micromodel is analyzed with a lattice percolation model in order to determine under what conditions steady two-phase flow can be achieved. The gas network is established with bond percolation and liquid is allowed to flow across the sample with the help of liquid bridges. These liquid bridges enable the liquid to cross gas-occupied pore throats without snap-off. The calculated attribute for the gas and liquid networks is equivalent resistance, ΔP/Q. For this a new unit for hydraulic resistivity was used and is equal to the fluid viscosity divided by the pore radius to the third power, H = μ/R3. The equivalent resistance of the gas and liquid networks are found by applying rules from linear circuits of electrical resistances. Solutions for the equivalent resistivity of the gas network are calculated with the node elimination method and Kirchhoff’s solution for a random network of resistances. The liquid network’s conductivity is calculated as the sum of path resistances in parallel and is a theoretical maximum. The gas and liquid conductivity of nine pre-existing 16x16 networks from Holstvoogd(2020) are reevaluated and, in addition, twelve new samples of size 32x32 are evaluated. Functionally, the model’s behavior is as follows: gas conductivity is inversely proportional and liquid conductivity is proportional to the occupation threshold. It is found that the gas conductivity is a function of tortuosity and number of parallel flow loops. Conductivity decreases with increased tortuosity and increases with number of parallel flow paths. The ratio of liquid and gas conductivity for the twelve 32x32 models is calculated. When adjusted for gas viscosities of supercritical CO2 and Nitrogen gas it is found that it is in the order of 10-3 to 10-4. Therefore, it has been determined that it is practically impossible to achieve steady two-phase flow without fluctuating pore occupancy.","Foam; Micromodel; Network conductivity; Kirchoff's solution; Node elimination; liquid bridging","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Focusing on the revitalizing of the Jacobuskerk in Winterswijk, the project forms of a sustainable response on the increasing vacancy rates of Catholic churches through integrating the concept of Cradle to Cradle. Vacancy rates are an ongoing problem on a large scale and include highly valued and important building typologies for the development of our history, such as religious objects like Catholic churches. Such heritage has an influential position in the communication of the building environment with society, which is valuable to be maintained. This influential position offers possibilities for other relevant topics to be communicated in addition. The agenda of sustainability is a topic that architects are increasingly taking responsibility in, as the ecological problems and the influence of the current building environment for the future is clear. The revitalization of vacant buildings is important for a sustainable future building environment as vacant buildings form a sensitive part of the aspects that make our current building environment unsustainable. This unique position of heritage therefore forms a relevant sector for architects to respond on. Currently the potentials of sustainability in heritage are mostly understood to essentially lie in the extension of the lifetime of a building retaining the important and valued character of the building. But can it be more? In terms of circular economy an object of heritage and the values it features are initially not at all designed to be circular. Initially designed with specific status and values or gained over time, these objects are designed to become waste eventually. The postponing of becoming waste by the extension of the lifetime is typically considered as a less-bad approach of dealing with sustainability as it is not solving the source of the ecological problem but merely delaying and minimizing the effect. This graduation project focuses on the question if heritage being an existing cradle to grave product can form a solution to the root of the ecological problem, as according the concept of Cradle to Cradle this solution would essentially rely on a new way of designing. Since heritage is designed as linear product in a significantly less advanced linear economical system that is eco-effective and less bad at best, can it become a circular and eco-efficient cradle to cradle product in a building environment, economy and society slowly but surely shifting towards a circular model? Or is less bad the maximal sustainable potential reachable in heritage? In response to this question Cradle to Church approached the Jacobuskerk in Winterswijk as an education center through the formation of a set of interventions that translate the circular principles as proposed by the concept of Cradle to Cradle into the existing framework of values that compose the monumental character of the Jacobuskerk. Through the interventions and the circular statements behind them, this project aims to form a reference for the typology of Catholic churches and other objects of heritage. Furthermore, the project hopes to form a point of discussion regarding the exclusive position of Heritage in the formation of a sustainable future building environment.","Circularity; Sustainability; Redevelopment; Heritage; Architecture","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Heritage & Architecture","KaDer Gelderland","51.97175115, 6.71813179895452"

(TU Delft Architecture and the Built Environment)","van Bergen, J. (mentor); Yang, Z. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","During the last four decades, China experienced the fastest urban population growth in the world. After the establishment of the Special Economic Zones (SEZ) in 1979, due to the tremendous demand for new construction land, cities authorities expropriated farmlands to establish new urban developments. However, in order to minimize compensation costs, they left the housing plots of the former villages untouched. Hence, those were encroached into the city’s structure becoming urban villages (villages-in-the-city). The SEZ began to attract more and more migrants from all over China. The demand of housing in the villages kept on rising and the expansion of the plots became extreme and illegal. The spatial results of this process are overpopulated but also lively, active, mixed-used, and human-scaled environments. Since most of them are located in valuable locations for the real estate market, the Chinese government deals with the “issue” with their demolition. Diversity and variety of the built environment diminish with each bulldozing, slowly authorizing the loss of a unique urbanism.<br/><br/>Historically, villages were located in strategic points according to the characteristics of the landscape, and closely related to the blue system. This relationship has gradually diminished. The water infrastructure within the entire Pearl River system is now extremely polluted, mostly due to industries. As a result, nowadays water is seen as an issue and a threat rather than an opportunity. In Lijiao village, the chosen design location situated in Haizhu District (Guangzhou, Guangdong Province), the high demand for housing made possible the demolition and replacement of numerous cultural landscapes along with the underground canalization of watercourses. Only the main stream is still uncovered but the water is polluted and it serves as linear parking lot for the villagers.<br/><br/>The aim of the thesis project is to highlight and eventually exploit the positive aspects and the values of urban villages, through the process of research by design. In such manner, Lijiao is re-integrated into the city’s structure and the lost connection with the water landscape is re-defined, serving as a carrier into the urban village while strengthening its identity. The expected result is an improvement in quality of both the public space and the water sanitation system.","Urban villages; Identity; Urban Development; Climate Adaptation; Water Village","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","23°03′18″N 113°19′12″E"

Unfortunately, it results often in thermoacoustic instabilities. These instabilities are high amplitude pressure oscillations which cause damage to the combustion system, reduce efficiency, flame blow-off or flashback. While the cause for instabilities due to longitudinal modes is known, the cause for transverse thermoacoustic instabilities is still not fully understood. Currently, transverse thermoacoustic instabilities are avoided by damping devices that consume considerate amounts of cooling air, thus raising the flame temperature and NOx emissions. Therefore, a good understanding of the feedback cycle that cause transverse thermoacoustic instabilities is crucial in predicting and avoiding combustion instabilities. In this work, Large Eddy Simulations (LES) is used to study processes involved by the driving of instabilities in a small scale burner. Additionally, different dampening alternatives are designed and validated. Experiments have shown that a small scale burner becomes unstable with decreasing flame lengths, due to the addition of hydrogen to the fuel. To research the impact compact flames have on combustion instabilities, simulations of methane flames with decreasing lengths is performed. It is found that decreasing the flame length, increased the amplitude of the pressure oscillations. Similar as to the experiment, both longitudinal, as well as transverse instabilities, is observed in the LES. Unfortunately, to study the transverse thermoacoustic instabilities, the longitudinal modes must be avoided. Hence a modification is designed to dampen the longitudinal mode without affecting the transverse modes. Ultimately an orifice plate was designed that reduced the pressure amplitude of the longitudinal mode by 92 %, while hardly influencing the transverse modes. The sufficient suppression of the longitudinal modes enabled the research into the transverse thermoacoustic instabilities feedback cycle. The research found two driving mechanisms for transverse instabilities. First of all, flames located at pressure anti-nodes are excited by pressure-induced flow oscillations from the premixing ducts. Consequently, the flame’s heat release positively coupled with the acoustic pressure. Additionally, the lateral movement of the flame towards regions of higher pressure, due to transverse acoustic velocity, is observed. Especially at pressure nodes, where acoustic velocities are most potent, the flame movement was substantial. While both mechanisms are found and agree to the driving criteria, it is difficult to say what their actual contribution to the instabilities are. Finally, the actual driving of transverse thermoacoustic instability by flow oscillations inside the premixing duct is studied. At first, a modification is designed to deliberately cause a quarter-wave resonance that forces the pressure anti-node away from the flames. This way, the unsteady heat release is not able to couple with acoustic pressure oscillations. Secondly, a modification inspired by a muffler is aimed at dampening all acoustic waves travelling through the premixing duct. Unfortunately, the quarter-wave resonance created new unstable modes as well as increased the strength of the other instabilities. Also, the muffler modification is not able to dampen the transverse instabilities. Moreover, a resonant mode arose inside one of the muffler elements causing a new instability inside the combustion chamber.","LES; Combustion Instability; Thermo-acoustics; Lean Premixed Combustion; Gas Turbine; CFD; Combustion Simulation; Jet Flame","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-06-19","","","","","",""

This results in an annoying howling effect which can damage hardware and human hearing. To solve this issue, an adaptive filter that estimates the feedback path and uses this estimate to cancel the feedback can be designed. However, because the adaptive filter receives signals from both the microphone and the feedback, and because sound signals are generally correlated over time, the estimate becomes biased. To reduce this bias, the speaker signal can be decorrelated from the input. In this thesis several options to decorrelate these signals are explored, and they are evaluated based on decorrelation performance and effect on audio quality. Frequency shifting is selected as the best decorrelation method as it provides the most decorrelation while retaining audio quality. Finally it is shown that using Frequency Shifting to decorrelate the microphone and speaker signal indeed improves the estimation of the feedback path.","Decorrelation; Signal Processing; Adaptive Filtering; Acoustic Feedback Cancellation; Frequency Modulation; PEAQ; ODG; AFC; Digital signal processing","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering","",""

To start, the movements of each component are described in a displacement diagram. From this diagram, ladder logic can be extracted, which is a set of conditions with corresponding actions. These actions are executed when the conditions hold. This ladder logic is the programming language of PLCs and makes it possible to control pneumatics. De Techniekschool provides courses on these techniques and pneumatics.<br/><br/>This report describes the research, design and implementation of a software application to aid students in their education of pneumatics. The main goal is to allow users to create a displacement diagram and then generate the corresponding ladder logic based on this diagram. This will allow users to understand how this conversion works and help them in understanding PLC programming.<br/><br/>In the research phase, various designs were evaluated. The implementation of the compiler was thought out and possible designs for the Graphical User Interface (GUI) for creating the diagram were explored. In the case of the GUI, the final implementation differs from the initial chosen design. This is because, during the project, it was discovered that the design did not work as well as intended, thus the switch was made. To guarantee the correct behaviour of the product, each individual component was tested on its own with unit tests.<br/><br/>Besides a compiler and the ability to draw displacement diagrams, features of Stepladder include the option to save and open work, and the option to undo and redo actions. It is also possible to show the signals which the PLC will receive and send. These signals already play a vital role in the conversion from displacement diagram to ladder logic and the generated signals can help to understand this conversion. <br/><br/>Desirable features which are not yet implemented are the support for multiple languages and improvements to the accessibility of the application. Also, a more advanced compiler is desired, because the current compiler does create ladder logic according to a valid technique, but it is not the optimal solution. For learning purposes, an optimal conversion may be desired. Proper user testing is also desired to verify the design and whether the application is easy to use.<br/><br/>To conclude, the final product allows the user to create displacement diagrams and generate ladder logic. This can be used to study the conversion needed in PLC programming. The final product meets the design goals set in the design process. Besides the design goals, the product also satisfies the initial requirements.

At the back of the church an extension is made in the form of a public stairs and tribune looking over the park. The roof of the extension forms an elevated walkway, connecting the park and the shopping street. Secondly, the nave is transformed into a library space. The existing building is adapted to meet the new requirements. A bookcase with three floors is placed in the aisle of the church.

It occurs as a defence mechanism if a person does not<br/>have enough social contact. This pain prevents people from being isolated which<br/>in historical times would be fatal as people are stronger and safer in groups. Among elderly loneliness is more severe then in other age groups. This is due to<br/>the loss of good friends and loved ones. Next to this elderly are less active in public places as they are housed in more closed off complexes where every facility is present so that they wont have to leave the complex. This means they are not likely to meet new people outside of their building or wing.<br/>But loneliness is a pain that also leads to retraction and people isolating themselves from public life. It then becomes a vicious cycle where people can become increasingly lonely. It can only be contested by the individual that suffers from it. Loneliness can thus not be solved by architecture but it can be prevented by it.<br/>But how to prevent loneliness with architecture? By addressing relations which<br/>have the most impact on people their social life their social health can be restored. According to multiple sociologists weak ties such as colleagues and neighbours are of most important as they replace lost strong ties such as loved ones and friends. But social interactions with weak ties should happen naturally and not forced upon or organised. Organised social activities are a major threshold for people with social anxiety which excludes them from such activites. <br/><br/>The main question for this research is therefore as follows:<br/>How can the build environment promote spontaneous social interaction to prevent loneliness among elderly?<br/><br/>The main conclusion of this research is that people need to leave their private domain and enter the public realm as this is where spontaneous interactions take place. To get elderly out of their private domain the environment should invite to do so. This means to create attractive environments with opportunities to engage in social activities as well as to live independent, to fulfil potential and to be seen by others.<br/>Activity attracts activity so by activating public spaces elderly are more tempted to go outside. But as elderly are less active then other groups it is good to mix them with youth, students, and families, which also increases their visibility to the rest of the community they live in. But while they should live mixed between other types of demographic groups they still want to seek support among each other but in small manageable groups of approximately five elderly. Elderly should therefore be housed in small groups with a communal garden or space to meet and control.<br/>Next to organising dwellings the public realm should also be organised so that it stimulates spontaneous social interaction. By creating third spaces, green spaces and transitional spaces this can be accomplished. This is because people transfer to or past these locations which creates opportunities to meet others on the way over and/or at the location itself. These spaces can be locations such as a restaurant, park and library and they should be visible from inside the dwellings as activity attracts activity.<br/>But these location should also have certain qualities such as that they have to be comfortable, safe, visually stimulating and controllable. This latter describes the hierarchy and depiction of private and public spaces. As being social also means to have control over the amount of social interaction one has, and thus also being able to retreat in privacy. The difference between private and public should therefore be clearly marked so that it is recognisable for others. These interventions or design guidelines should all be implemented close to the housing as elderly do not have a broad range where they can go.","Healthcare; Elderly; Loneliness; Housing; Leiden; social interaction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Dwelling","Designing for Care","52.153400, 4.482504"

This fast-growing fleet needs to be supported by equally developing Maintenance, Repair, and Overhaul (MRO) divisions of airlines. In light of the growing need for more efficient and technologically advanced aircraft maintenance, this project called the Hangar of the Future was initiated. The Engineering and Maintenance (E&amp;M) division of KLM Royal Dutch Airlines is one of the largest MRO service providers in the airline industry. KLM’s Hangar 12 at Schiphol carries out A-checks for its entire Boeing 737 and 787 fleet. These are the airplanes that are the most promising for future use and KLM is acquiring more of them every year. For this reason, Hangar 12 has an increasing responsibility for sustaining the company. For the development of the hangar, KLM has several priorities that were initiators of the project:- New technology is required to continue to be competitive and to maximize the efficiency of maintenance. - KLM believes in retaining a sustainable workforce for which ergonomics i.e. providing a pleasant and healthy working environment play a huge role. - Sustainability is a strategic pillar for the company and is hardwired into KLM’s future mission (The attention to this topic was minimized going forward in the project due to several reasons).While considering these factors, the project was tackled with a fairly methodological approach. It was guided by the overarching Double Diamond structure of industrial design. The scheduling of the project was done in line with the four phases: Discover, Define, Develop, and Deliver. Clear goals were set for all the phases before starting them and within each phase, one or more design/research methods were used to achieve these goals.In the Discover phase, research was carried out about the working of the hangar, the employees, their problems, and requirements. A broad understanding was gained and documented in this starting phase.In the Define phase, the research was analyzed and converted into usable data. The problem statements that would be the most beneficial to address were identified. This phase was crucial in guiding the focus of the project.The Develop phase was the one that resulted in the highest quantity of innovative ideas due to the brainstorming activities incorporated in this phase. It was intended to go broad again, explore ideas, research on the possibilities, and come up with multiple directions that address the problem statements.Lastly, the Define phase was the one where it all came together. The ideas were filtered, concepts were given shape, and validation was carried out. Virtual prototyping and concept animation was done for presenting the concepts.The project resulted in a family of three concepts that fit the hangar: a collaborative inspection robot for full ground and drone inspection, an Automated Guided Vehicle (AGV) for moving materials and tools, and a dashboard that updates the teams with realtime information at the hangar workfloor. These three concepts address the top priorities of the stakeholders and are backed by well-grounded research.","KLM; Aircraft Base Maintenance; Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul; Hangar; Airframe; Engineering and Maintenance; Virtual Reality; VR; Concept Design; Concept Development; Aircraft Maintenance","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","52.2974151,4.7918945"

We divide this task into four parts. In the first part, we prepare the audio files to be used as input to a neural network. Specifically, we examine ways to create spectrograms. We then optimise the spectrograms by reducing and normalising them. The second part consists of theoretical information regarding neural networks. We initially look at the perceptron, the building blocks of any neural network, and then extend this notion to various networks, such as the multilayer perceptron, the recurrent network and the convolutional network. In the third part, we apply the theoretical knowledge that we gained in part two and implement a standard neural network, a recurrent neural network, a convolutional neural network, and a combination of<br/>recurrent and convolutional neural networks. We examine various network structures and we evaluate them based on what the networks can learn, how fast they can learn it and how accurate its classifications are. Simultaneously, we focus on creating an efficient network, using the fewest amounts of computational resources possible. We train each of the networks with data that we created in part one, and compare the performance of the networks with each other. In terms of accuracy and loss measures, we find that the best performing network is the combination of the recurrent and convolutional neural network. This network is able to determine which of six considered genres a 3 second sound sample belongs to with an accuracy of 90%. However, in terms of computational resources required to train the models, the convolutional neural network with many kernels during training converges using least computational cost. We then experiment with the amount of kernels in the convolutional layers, and find that a layer with many kernels learns faster, but does not necessarily yield better results. This is because networks with fewer kernels eventually learn the same kernels that are significant. Finally, we consider the impact of varying sound sample lengths on the performance of the networks. For a 1 second sound sample, we see that the recurrent network outperforms the other networks in terms of accuracy of the predictions. However, the larger we make the sound samples between 1 and 3 seconds, the better each network performs. Part four consists of an explanation of each component in the system, and presents a complete system built with Google’s TensorFlow [15], in which all the components work together to create an end-to-end classification system.","","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Giventheir large areal extent and high sand content, submarine-fan deposits formsignificant hydrocarbon reservoirs. Their internal architecture is often poorlyresolved. With much of the three-dimensional architecture of the turbiditelobes below seismic resolution, there is commonly a significant level of un-certainty associated with respect to the reservoir geometry and quality.At the end of submarine channels, turbidity currents lose confinementand encounter a slope break, in response, the current decelerates and forms a deposit, a turbidite. Repeated passage of turbidity currents forms a stackof deposits that are generically termed lobes.Subsequent flow events modify the bathymetry by erosion and deposi-tion, thereby affecting the trajectory of subsequent flow events. Due to self-formed relief, beds start stacking laterally, in 'compensation'. A complex but ordered stratigraphy is created by repeated cycles of shifts in deposition, which results in variability in deposits that governs reservoir connectivity. In this study, multiple consecutive turbidity currents flowing over self-formed relief are modeled using a process-based numerical model (Delft3D-FLOW). The response of successive turbidity currents and their deposits to variations in channel slope was tested. Models with steeper channel slope were observed to result in more vigorous flows with deposits that cover a larger surface area. Following passages of turbidity currents were observed to erode bed sediment in the channel and thereby diminish the amount ofreadily erodible bed sediment for following turbidity currents. With the current model set-up, the deposit relief was insufficient to observe lateral stacking of deposits. These simulations provide insight into the depositional processes and the controls on the geometry and sedimentary trends of the deposits emplaced by successive turbidity currents flowing over a slope break and losing confinement.<br","turbidites","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To reach it, the work was divided into four parts. <br/>The project starts with an introduction explaining the motivations behind this work. It continues by grounding the problem in the context of major sports events. Indeed, the temporary quality of such manifestations, as well as their promotion of innovative solutions made it ideal for this study. Moreover, reviewing Olympic legacies showed the need for a structure capable to be re-used in different contexts. <br/>The second part of the research englobes a literature review on two subjects. Exploring sustainable construction highlighted the main principles in environmentally friendly structural design. Life cycles assessments are identified as the main tool for evaluating the ecological performances and their process is therefore described. Moreover, reviewing existing LCA on timber constructions showed hotspots in the manufacturing of timber such as the importance of local sourcing. <br/>Additionally, the second part examines existing work on designing for re-use. Multiple factors should be incorporated to ensure the re-usability of a construction. The most essential one, demountability was explored in length and a table showing the related design criterion, such as minimizing the number of different connectors, was devised. A review of existing constructions designed for re-use concludes this second part. <br/>The third part applies the findings of the second to the selection of timber solutions. To narrow the possible products, the roof structure of an indoor arena is preselected for the case study. Locally sourced glue-laminated timber is chosen for its dimensional stability, whereas assemblies using glued-in rods and steel connectors show great versatility and are therefore preferred. Considering the structural system adapted for multi-purpose re-use, a truss was selected for the origin structure because of its inherent standardization. The third part is concluded by the development of a structural solution for the case study.<br/>The fourth part concerns the design of the roof and façade structures of a badminton arena. To maximize re-use options, the structural elements are designed to be applicable to different contexts such as the main structure of a high school. The designed solution was finally assessed using the developed guidelines and an LCA-based study. <br/>The study shows that multi-purpose re-use is a structurally feasible alternative. Indeed, through careful planning, and by using the developed guidelines, it is possible to re-use the structural elements from a 60-meter span roof in a 6.3-meter span high school with relatively high efficiency. Moreover, the environmental study, although superficial, showed a reduction in global warming potential of 60-90% depending on the re-use scenario compared with a one-off design.","Re-use; timber structures; sustainabilty; Modular construction; demountable; Structural engineering; Arena; Olympic Games; LCA; Timber joints","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The design proposal for this region serves as a possible outcome of this framework, based on design principles and generic objectives. Parkstad Limburg used to be a wealthy region due to the thriving mining industry. The closing of these mines meant economic decline and the neglect of this region. To counter these consequences, many initiatives focus on the recovery and improvement of the landscapes’ qualities. Nature development for recreational use along the brooks, for instance, has started to greenify the landscape. The agricultural lands, however, are dealing with more challenges than the landscapes’ attractiveness. Soil compaction, erosion, and a poor carbon cycle are under discussion. The large scale agricultural practice also influenced the ecological value of these lands. Small landscape elements have been removed, resulting in shrinking biodiversity. New agricultural models are developing, such as agroforestry, food forests, and carbon farming. Their currently small scale implementations do not achieve great impact. Agroecology should be practiced on a larger scale to realize its potential benefits for food production, recreational experience, and contribution to biodiversity. The basic design objective is to increase the coverage of the agricultural land with woody plants, such as trees. Especially along the slopes, these reforestations can add value, due to their ability to stabilize the soil and reduce the water run-off. Besides forest coverage, open landscapes are equally important to biodiversity. These open landscapes provide wide views. The allocation of the forested plots should consider these existing valuable views. For the design of the high and flat plateaus, agroforestry systems are applied, to preserve these views and profit from the flat surface. On these lands, conventional crops can be cultivated. The additions of production forest typologies are placed along the slopes. Food forests are shaped in strips, following the height-lines. This strip-cultivation ensures an easy harvest method. There are also less rationally organized forests which are for wood production. Wood production which supports the development of a sustainable wood industry for high-quality use. Besides tools or furniture, a revolution in wooden architecture is at hand. The landscape architectural framework aims for the synergy of the ecological processes and the productivity of the landscape. Separation of these systems have caused problems for one another, but working together could be beneficial for both. Combining multifunctional use with recreational experiences increases awareness and support for this shift in our cultivated landscapes. The result is a future proof, ecologically and economically healthy landscape.","Biodiversity; Climate Crisis; Ecology; Erosion; Spatial Quality; Agroecology; Agriculture; Forestry; Land-use; Nature-inclusive","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Landscape Architecture","","50.945038, 5.934756"

This master thesis aims to give recommendations about upscaling circularity in UAD. The research question that is answered is: How can the municipality of Amsterdam scale up circular urban area development by learning from projects with high circular ambitions in Buiksloterham? The answers to this question take two main issues into account. A practical issue on the implementation and possibilities for circularity and a management issue for the municipality on how they should operate in projects with high circular ambitions. The practical issue is in this research substantiated with a literature study in circular strategies for urban area development. A framework of circular strategies is realised, to indicate, structure, and reflect upon circularity in the built environment. A case study in the urban area development Buiksloterham answers the question for the municipality. Upscaling circularity in UAD requires a combination of good policy and management from the municipality. Key elements are: provide clear image and information of the plans.

The following report elaborates the steps taken in developing a holistic interior vision for ‘Sustainable Luxury’ of Mercedes-Benz. In seek of representation for the future societal needs, and possible future challenges and opportunities in terms of holistic mobility conceptualisation, the research took place in the rural areas of Japan. Therefore, this project is aimed at ‘Self-reliant people accepting innovation raised on the traditional values’. These people are seeking the segregated life, focused on the abundant luxury of time, bonds of smaller communities, and personal fulfilment. Cherishing the community traditions, innovation is acceptable if it preserves the experiential domain of respect towards community members and the environment. To fulfil the demand for such a context, the mission was ‘to achieve a perception of an abundance of less within the experience and perception of the product while keeping the identity of the brand intact.’ As the reconciliation between sustainability and luxury indicates the change of expression of luxury in means of a form, the qualities of the premium experience are set to keeping the utmost feeling of safety and physical ease leading to comfort. Therefore, ‘encountering a moment for yourself, within a shared experience, in comfort.’ was set as the desired interaction. The ideation led to the development of three concept ideas, which were further validated and iterated leading to the conclusive vision ‘Ikigai: A reason for being’. Ikigai presents mobility solution as part of the holistic system of sustainability and manifests as a contribution to the context. The vision ‘Ikigai’ is a Level 4 shared mobility service by Mercedes-Benz, intended for the rural communities of Japan. The on-demand service, utilising the Mercedes-Benz municipal vehicle, grants community residents overcoming the dependence on the pre-scheduled, public transportation of the area. The private zones in the interior space are providing users with a possibility for individual focus and relaxation while in a shared environment. Ikigai’s minimalistic interior is enriched by the works of local craftsman. The material finishings of unique algae-based materials and bio-luminescent lights, produced in the village, are limited to the vehicle design specific to the area.

There, young people will have the opportunity to practice different activities revolving around the principles of coupé décalé and to perform on stage. The Yopougon Youth Cultural Center will be ran and upkept by young people from the neighborhood (number of them are ex-fighters and militias from the conflict), providing a model of social cohesion applied to an economic and cultural activity. The building will house a restaurant similar to the hundreds which can be found in Yopougon and which are the theater for coupé décalé related events.

Within its architecture, a battle between oppositions is expressed. Neo-classical v Brutalism. Socialism v Nationalism. Macedonian v Albanian. The list goes on. Yet life continues amongst this and these binary oppositions do not represent the true life of Skopjans. The city’s image is showcasing an environment that does not reflect the life of its people, which is vibrant, multifaceted, everyday, normal. The built environment does not make it easy for social integration, with public spaces which are frequently bare and flat – dominating and monumental squares devoid of the layers needed to let life happen.<br/> The contested and non-discript ‘island’ between the old bazaar (Albanian territory) and Macedonia Square (Macedonian territory) forms the location of my project. This no-mans land is a place without stigma and therefore provides a key opportunity to create spaces for integration between different communities. The island is made up of disparate built entities the paradigm for Skopje’s built fabric of opposing expressions. The site includes the old Hammam dating from 1500 during the Ottoman Empire, now the national gallery; the Macedonian Opera and Ballet from the Socialist era to the most recent development; Skopje 2014 museums positioned along the riverfront. These buildings work in isolation from one another and the public spaces are largely neglected. The site harbours great and un-realised potential to constitute as Skopje’s common ground – to improve integration and presence in public space, to provide the canvas for a vibrant, every-day life. The latent space possesses the existing ingredients, what is needed is the emulsion to make them function as a whole. ‘Island of Common Ground’ provides the glue between the disparate built entities, to celebrate Skopje’s complexity and encourage appropriation, integration and meaningfulness. <br/> My graduation project provides a raised platform, spreading itself throughout the island of transition between the two core territories of Skopje. Beneath its canopy it will house spaces to activate the site and its existing buildings. These incorporate structures such as food market stalls, cafes, restaurants, bars and theatre spaces yet these are open to change and adapt according to community and stakeholder wishes. These form light-weight structures within the strong surrounding framework. The project sits between the blurred line of architecture and public space – it aims to provide the constant within which the flux of life can adapt and change. <br","Integration; public space; social; Mat building; platform; urban architecture; common ground","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","","41.9981, 21.4254"

This increase has brought a high return to the real-estate developers but at the same time has compromised with occupant satisfaction. It brings an additional challenge for the architects and designer to look into the user-centred design for workspaces and offices. The current design process relies heavily on the experience. There is a need to evaluate the design from a user’s perspective.<br/>It is known that user’s in an office environment are impacted by various Indoor environmental quality factors. The most important of those factors is the noise disturbance which leads to decreased concentration, reduced satisfaction, and sick building syndrome in some cases. The noise disturbance is caused by speech interactions, appliances and services. These disturbances are relatively unknown to the designer in the early design phase and depend on user behaviour. This graduation project challenges the current design process by proving a digital intervention in the form of workflow. The workflow aims to help architects and designers in the early design process to evaluate spatial layout with respect to disturbances in the office.<br/>This research combines the knowledge of design informatics, psychology and building physics to come up with a simulation workflow. It uses the knowledge of the psychology of workspaces to understand the user behaviour towards the noise disturbance. This knowledge is put to use through an agent-based model simulating the user movement and interactions through the office layout. It is made possible by combining existing methodologies of acoustic simulation, trajectory evaluation with the newly developed agent-based model that is simulating user behaviour. The results are then visualized on the spatial layout to get further insights into the design by testing with two case studies. As a result of prototyping, a simulation workflow is proposed which can be used to evaluate workspace layout in terms of user behaviour towards the noise.","User Behavior; User-centred design; Agent-Based Simulation; Acoustics of workspaces","en","master thesis","","","","","","Scripts and Code used for the simulation framework: https://gitlab.com/divyae.iitr/acoustic-simulation-in-offices","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","A visible tumor can be surrounded by invisible groups of cancer cells called microscopic disease that cannot be imaged. For ultimate tumor control it is imperative that not only the visible tumor, but also this microscopic disease is irradiated. In current clinical practice, microscopic disease control is achieved by not just irradiating the visible tumor, but also a margin around it. The distribution and extent of microscopic disease is patient-specific and generally unknown. These uncertainties propagate into the currently used margin definition. In this study, probabilistic treatment planning models to replace the margin recipe were investigated. The uncertainties of the microscopic disease were explicitly included into the model through an expected Tumor Control Probability (expected TCP) cost function. Optimal treatment plans could consequently be created by optimizing the expected TCP. Both a one-dimensional and three-dimensional model were established. In the one-dimensional model, the probability of finding microscopic disease at different radial distances from the visible tumor was included into the cost function. Other patient uncertainties were also included in the expected TCP. Next, the three-dimensional model was based on a microscopic description of the spatial distribution of microscopic disease extensions (MDE). A similar radial distribution as the one-dimensional was used in combination with an angular distribution of the MDE. Instead of describing the microscopic disease within a certain volume, the MDE islets were explicitly modeled. Promising results were retrieved from the one-dimensional model. The optimal dose distributions are at their peak near the visible tumor and decay with increasing radial distance from the visible tumor. Most microscopic disease is located close to the visible tumor, which explains this result. Unfortunately, the three-dimensional model did not lead to any realistic optimized dose distributions. This has multiple reasons. Firstly, a too coarse numerical grid has been used for the microscopic disease region. The computational times escalated for finer grids. Furthermore, a microscopic and stochastic description of a realistic number of MDE islets has proven to be unattainable. Model adaptations are suggested that deal with these problems. Moreover, the framework of the three-dimensional model has been used to corroborate the effect of the optimal one-dimensional dose distribution on the expected TCP. Here no optimization was required, which allowed for a more realistic, finer numerical grid to be used. Compared to the classical margin recipe, the expected TCP improved drastically. In conclusion, significantly better tumor control can be achieved by replacing the classical margin recipe with probabilistic treatment planning. Additional research towards a three-dimensional macroscopic model that accurately describes the distribution of microscopic disease is required. Finally, the total dose a patient may receive has to be properly substantiated to be able to clinically implement probabilistic treatment planning. This would require the involvement of clinicians and radiobiologists.","","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Additionally, when elements composition the heritage landscape begin to fall apart, the landscape is pushed further into a state of disassociations.The estate landscape of the Baakse Beek narrates quite a similar tale. It is an estate landscape losing prominence and attachment from the rural lives. This broken relationship is further aggravated by the brook decaying functionally, ecologically and sensorially. Curating experiences offers a revitalisation of the heritage estates to become a setting for formation of experiential narratives and appreciation of the brook, which vitalises the aesthetic and ecological diversity within these estates. In doing so, the research entails the use of narratives as a method for documenting the uniqueness that lies in the basic unitof the landscape’s composition i.e the enclosures, mapping the experiences in these enclosures and alongthe brook, and constructing the plethora of socio-cultural engagements and perceptions in and with the landscape. Enriched by the theories of Sensorial Landscape, Seasonality of Landscape and Aesthetic Engagement, the research led to the curation of a tapestry of sensorially stimulating and engaging spaces. The project delivers a way of seeing the brook as integral to the experience of the landscape . It hopes to inspire the different stakeholders of the landscape to envision a more whole some outlook of looking at the sustainability of these heritage landscapes not only in functional terms, but also in terms of socio-cultural connections that sustain the value of this landscape.","Baakse Beek; Sensorial Affordances; Experiential Landscape; Narratives; Brook Restoration; Heritage landscape; Place Making","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Landscape Architecture","","52.108402, 6.384674"

Point clouds are increasingly used in different applications, ranging from architectural preservation to computer vision. The 3D medial axis transform is a topology preserving, skeleton representation of shapes. It can be used to decompose an object in meaningful parts and to describe local and long range information of points in a point cloud. <br/><br/>In the past years, many deep learning methods for point clouds emerged. These are used for different applications, such as shape classification, object detection or semantic segmentation. In particular, the latter aim to classify each point in the input point cloud in subsets, based on their semantics.<br/><br/>This research investigates the integration of the 3D MAT in two deep learning methods for point clouds' semantic segmentation, PointNet++ and Superpoint Graph. In particular, the 3D MAT was used in PointNet++ as a point feature, to give context to local points. Then, it was used in Superpoint Graph as a geometric descriptor to partition a point cloud and as a edge feature in the SPG. <br/><br/>The major findings of this research outline that the 3D MAT can be successfully used in PointNet++ as a point feature, improving the overall accuracy and loss values of the algorithm. Particularly two MAT derived properties used in this research output positive results, radii and separation angles. These can be combined with point coordinates and RGB information to bring additional knowledge on the geometry of the shape, representing its curvature and thickness. Furthermore, they can be integrated in a simple and effective way, without increasing computational or time effort in the algorithm.<br/><br/>The analysis carried out in Superpoint Graph depicts that the 3D MAT does not improve the initial geometric partition. In fact, adding geometric descriptors to the algorithm increases the difficulty in dividing the point cloud into simple shapes, creating artifacts. Furthermore, adding MAT information on superedges does not give added value to the SPG graph. The reason is that the SPG graph and the structured MAT are different than each other, in practice, as nodes represent diverse parts in the point cloud.","Medial Axis Transform; Deep Learning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geomatics","",""

To work towards a more collaborative way of planning and to enhance the competitive edge of port cities, mixed-use developments that include both city -and industrial orientated functions could be an outcome.<br/>A comprehensive literature study into the mixed-use concept reveals, besides a positive view, also a more critical view on mixed-use ideas. While mixing uses knows many benefits, in realized mixed-use developments higher goals, as sustainability, synergy and diversity are not always reached and residential satisfaction appears to be rather low. Furthermore, the combination of industry and housing is typically avoided and when attempted, this mix usually<br/>doesn’t last long. It appears residential nuisance plays a pivotal role in this. Consequently, it is argued that when developing mixed-use areas, the potential incompatibilities between different uses should be acknowledged and<br/>residential nuisance should be managed. By coining the terms actual and perceived nuisance, a distinction is made between the objective level of nuisance, exposed to the receiver, and the subjective level of nuisance, as perceived by the receiver. Commonly used measures in urban planning are focused on mitigating the observation of nuisance (actual nuisance). However, theory suggests that also the annoyance levels attached to these observations may not be overlooked (perceived nuisance) and that the relation between actual and perceived nuisance might not be as straight-forward as it seems. In this study a deeper understanding of how residents perceive nuisance caused by industry is gained with help of a practical case: Hoek van Holland. This is a Dutch village located close to industry and part of the port city Rotterdam. Two focus groups with residents of Hoek van Holland are conducted and an urban planner who is involved with developments in the village is interviewed. The findings show that perceived nuisance is a very interrelated concept. It is influenced in several ways and depends on more than actual nuisance alone. It is theorized residential<br/>satisfaction has a mediating effect on feelings of annoyance and, therefore, urban planners should not underestimate the value of residential satisfaction for the (long-term) success of a mixed-use developments.","Residential satisfaction; Residential nuisance; mixed-use; Port city; Urban planning; perceived nuisance; subjectivity","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","","51.98060, 4.13420"

Without any measure taken, it leads to a situation where the illuminance exceeds the comfort requirement next to the window by making an over-lit area which causes glare issues; furthermore, the illuminance decreases in a gradient along the depth leaving illuminance below comfort requirement towards end of the room making under-lit area, which demands use of artificial lighting. This creates an uncontrolled and non-uniform distribution of daylight along the depth. Moreover, daylight is very dynamic in nature that keeps changing along the time, this adds complexity in design; and hence it leads to use of computational design methods.<br/>This research aims to improve visual comfort efficiency of an office space with the help of computational methods by developing a facade system that distributes the daylight to indoor space more uniformly, bringing balance of light intensity between under-lit and over-lit areas of a space to a visually comfortable range or daylit range (300-2000 lux), adapts to various external factors that are responsible for dynamic daylight behaviour; and results in a controlled distribution of daylight throughout the depth of the space for occupant’s comfort. The strategies applied for the design development as computational methods is by mean of parametric modelling, daylight simulation and optimisation.<br/>The study results in a dynamic façade scheme that validates with visual comfort criteria, which also includes evaluation of glare and contrast. The study also covers constructability and feasibility aspects of the proposed scheme. As the final outcome, an average of 88% of working plane is found to be within the daylit range having average illuminance of 561 lux, which is distributed with an average uniformity ratio of 0.57 with minimal risk of glare and contrast; validating that visually comfortable environment is achieved. This further indicates that the use of artificial light can be reduced by 88%, saving equivalent energy consumption concerning artificial lighting.<br","dynamic facade; high-rise; office building; daylight; visual comfort; computation design; optimisation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","","51.9244,4.4777"

In the Achterhoek region from the Province of Gelderland, Netherlands, the agricultural lands and the forestry were lifelines of the living and leisure functions of the estates even in the early 20th century. <br/>In the production history of Achterhoek, two major events took place that largely determine today’s landscape character of the area. These events were respectively, the ‘Marken division’ in 1820’s initiated by the powerful estate owners and the ‘post-World War 2 land consolidation’ after 1950's mostly taken up by the farmers. Most of the forestry and the characteristic ‘backstage landscape’ of the estate area, were developed at the time of the Marken division. During the land consolidation after World War 2, the East Achterhoek landscape accommodated intensification of agriculture. Thus, the forestry and the characteristic landscape along with its diversity were somewhat lost into a more homogenized open landscape in the East Achterhoek. On the contrary, the estate owners protected the cultural landscape of the estate area for the appreciation of its experiential qualities, its nature value and the leisure opportunities it provided them. But over time, the productive hinterland lost its value and strong connection with the estates as it was not enough as an economy generator anymore. As a consequence, most of the estates were taken up by conservation organizations in the 1970’s for their maintenance and protection. <br/>Today, the richly protected heritage estate zones only cover the estate building and the garden, but the hinterland is not equally seen as an important part of the heritage. Once, the hinterland was an invaluable part of the estate and even during the post WW2 crisis, the estate owners ensured the protection of their hinterlands along with the characteristic features of the cultural landscape of Achterhoek. That is why, there is a need for re-exploring its value and finding new functional and experiential links between the hinterland and the estates. <br/>In the current scenario, the severe scarcity of water in the estate grounds can be seen rather as a possibility for new links. Going back in history of water management, it is found that the productive landscape and its processes have influenced and altered the ‘Baakse Beek’ (brook system) and the wetness storage capacity of the region especially the East Achterhoek area. Here, a lack of awareness of its impact on the adjacent estate area is noticed. Thus, we find another missing link between the estates and the the broader cultural landscape as well. <br/>If suitable measures are taken in the productive landscape, this situation might improve. This, in turn, generates new possibilities of re-purposing and revaluing the productive hinterland and restore its link to the heritage estates through different scales.<br","Heritage estates; Water retention; Cultural landscape; Resilience; Heritage landscape","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","",""

Further, with the changing climate these groups are increasingly vulnerable to hazards. This can be observed even in the Ganges River Basin where unplanned urbanization has caused a fragmented river system that puts several local settlements at increasing risk.<br/>The approach to planning water centric projects has not been a holistic approach in the past, and with uncertainties of changing times the planning approach needs to be more adaptive. The aim of the project is to relook at the current development trend within the existing system and derive a possible adaptive spatial planning model for design, that would include local communities and governing bodies into the planning process. The focus lies in emphasising the importance of a holistic approach to planning for the Ganges River Basin and bridging the gap between the national mitigation policies and local adaptation to climate change, to alleviate social, economic and ecological vulnerabilities.<br/>Designing for resilience for the Ganges River Basin, is based on the understanding of the relationship between the human systems and the ecological systems. The notions of SES (Adger 2003-2009), and the panarchy of adaptive cycles from Holliing (1986) are used to derive the process of designing infrastructure and interventions within the river basin. The derived framework of Adaptive Spatial Planning enables a flexible approach to planning for uncertainty, integrating local communities in the planning process. Local adaptation of multi-scalar strategies along with local knowledge from the community allow early testing of strategies and informing policies simultaneously, with results and local knowledge, reducing the time-line compared to traditional planning where policies are derived at central level without in-depth understanding of local context. The new adaptive spatial planning allows shift of pathways in times of uncertainty, making the system more flexible and resilient.","Socio-Ecological Vulnerabilities; Water Governance; Local Adaptation; Adaptive Spatial Planning; Climate Resilience; Ganges River Basin","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Transitional Territories","","25.354497, 85.080573"

The most common installation method for a jacket structure nowadays starts by driving the foundation piles in the seabed through a pre-piling template. The jacket is then lowered on top until the legs are resting on the foundation piles through friction-based stopper connections. In order to rigidly fix the connection, grout is pumped into the annulus between the pile and leg. During the curing period of grout, generally taken as 24 hours, environmental loads cause the jacket to oscillate in various directions. As a result, the jacket leg will move relative to the foundation pile. This movement, which is called Early Age Cycling (EAC), can cause crack formation in the cured grout therefore decreasing the shear capacity of the connection. The DNV GL has restricted this relative movement to a conservative 1 mm within the first 24 hours due to a research gap on the subject. The strict regulation forces companies to use expensive EAC mitigation concepts of which the real effects are a debated issue.<br/><br/>The objective of this research is to gain insight into the modelling approach and the magnitude of EAC movements and investigate how they can most efficiently be minimized. This is achieved by investigating three phases: 1) simulating a number of load cases on a global jacket model and extracting interface forces near the seabed, 2) using these interface forces to assess the EAC movement on a detailed pile-leg reference model with a full circular stopper 3) analysing this reference stopper by testing three modified configurations. These configurations are designed with respectively two, three and four brackets yielding the same contact area. A sensitivity study is then performed by increasing the contact area. <br/><br/>The largest EAC movement within all models can be measured at the tip of the jacket leg. The location of this movement on the circumference of the leg varies based on the loading condition and stopper model. In general simulations on the reference model showed EAC movements below 1 mm due to a uniform stress distribution from the stopper to the foundation pile. For larger wave loads, sliding occurred resulting in large EAC movements. The initial modified configurations show significantly larger EAC movement when compared to the reference stopper. In general, the EAC movement decrease when the number of brackets increases. This is the result of a more even stress distribution around the circumference of the pile. A phenomenon visible for the two bracket stopper is rotation around the axis of the wave direction resulting in large EAC movement. This effect, denoted as moment induced rotations, should be limited by all means. A sensitivity analysis on friction showed that sliding could most efficiently be solved by increasing the friction coefficient. This is highly recommended since it greatly improves the performance of the stopper connection for larger waves.<br/><br/>This research could be further extended by performing a large sensitivity study to normalize the current results. This would be needed to verify whether the current conclusions can also be adopted for general use.","Offshore Wind; Jacket installation; grout; Early age cycling; finite element method; Hydrodynamic behaviour; Stress analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","European Wind Energy Masters (EWEM)","",""

The main focus in this research was on the angular rate controller of a rotorcraft, since it required an idealised rotorcraft model to establish the IBS controller. The idealised rotorcraft model is established by means of the method of residualised dynamics, which assumes steady-state condition of the rotor dynamics. The idealised rotorcraft model would assure that the time-scale separation (TSS) condition is not, or at least less-likely, violated. However, the use of an idealised rotorcraft model for establishing the IBS control law would require a countermeasure when there exists a significant difference between the idealised and actual rotorcraft model. The problem lies therein that actuator and angular acceleration measurements are required for the IBS control law of the angular rate subsystem, but do come from the idealised and actual rotorcraft model respectively. This causes synchronisation issues. Based on findings it can be stated, that accounting for flapping dynamics when establishing the idealised rotorcraft model, is a requisite. However, accounting for lead-lag dynamics when establishing the idealised rotorcraft model, can be considered redundant, as it does not yield a significant difference with respect to the idealised model based upon steady-state flapping dynamics. In other words, an idealised rotorcraft model based upon steady-state flap-lag dynamics is almost the same as an idealised rotorcraft model based upon steady-state flap dynamics wherein considering the natural modes of motion and open-loop frequency response. From this it followed that the controller is robust to uncertainties in lead-lag dynamics, because the IBS control law and synchronisation can be established without requiring any knowledge of lead-lag dynamics. This is however, in great contrast with flapping dynamics, because sufficient knowledge is required of flapping dynamics when establishing both synchronisation filter as well as the IBS control law. Especially the control effectiveness matrix in the synchronisation filter, must be well-known, otherwise performance can be significantly harmed. This shows that there is some lack in controller robustness, when establishing the IBS controller based upon an idealised rotorcraft model.","Incremental Backstepping; Controller Robustness; Controller Performance; Routh-Hurwitz Stability; Helicopter Control","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","The project is situated in Parkstad, South Limburg, an administrative region consisting of 7 municipalities, formerly known as the East Mining Region. Deindustrialisation completely transformed the region, making it the first shrinking area of the Netherlands. Shrinkage commonly refers to a shrinking economy, shrinking population and increased urban vacancy. Deindustrialisation also caused serious aftermaths in terms of social problems. Many new urban park projects have been initiated to replace vacant housings and plots, these new parks also become ways to combat urban decay, poor social condition and crime rates. This huge need for parks is however seemingly difficult in a city that is already facing economic shrinkage. In the short run (or long run) where no new investment or residents can be expected in a shrinking area; parks rely only on government funding and appear as a losing investment or a financial burden. On the other hand, Parkstad faces an upcoming environmental threat of groundwater nitrate contamination which would not only impact drinking water and biodiversity but again, also lead to further financial burden for the government and for local residents. Nitrate problem is hard to tackle in the presence of intensified agricultural practice and Parkstad's signature soil type (Loess). The project questions the values of park, and more specifically the meaning of park in a shrinking city. It explores the possibility of marrying social restoration and nitrate remediation - two pressing needs of Parkstad, in the form of an urban park. The resulting design is on one hand a model of social-nitrate synergy through azolla (water fern), and on the other hand a park cooperative facilitating the azolla industry and the operation of an urban park. As a water-remediation and azolla-park prototype the project will also gain additional funding from research institutions, innovative start-ups and the water company. The designing of the Azolla City Park is an attempt to deliver such coexistence of the social layer and the functional nitrate-remediating layer of an urban park. It also aims to bring these multi-layer rhythms to life. The collective identity of the past is juxtaposed with the site's new function and identity. Azolla is the new coal, you may say. In the way coal mining used to give Heerlen its pride, businesses, social life and culture, so would the proposed azolla-city park create ripples of possibilities in the urban fabric of Heerlen.","Nitrate; Social restoration; Urban park; remediation strategies; Empowerment","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Landscape Architecture","Harvest Lab","50.895272, 5.967886"

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","The advantage of using protons to irradiate a tumour in cancer treatment, is that the energy can be delivered very precisely to the tumour without irradiating much of the surrounding tissue. The disadvantage of this is that small displacements of a patient can result in large deviations in the planned dose delivery according to the treatment plan. Therefore, many different dose distributions corresponding to different patient displacements have to be calculated to set up a robust treatment plan, which is computationally expensive. The solution to this problem is to use a combination of reduced order modelling and deep learning to perform computationally cheaper approximations of dose distributions corresponding to patient displacements. In previous research it has been shown that shallow and narrow neural networks were unable to predict the higher order modes of the reduced order model, which are required for the desired accuracy. Therefore, in this research it was studied how a feedforward neural network’s performance in predicting the higher order expansion coefficients of a reduced order model and the dose distributions depend on the neural network architecture and training approaches. \par First, a dose distribution was obtained by setting up a liver tumour patient treatment plan using treatment planning software matRad. Afterwards, dose distributions corresponding to simulated 1D, 2D and 3D displacements were generated using the optimized treatment plan. The amount of training samples was set to 1000, 2000 and 3000 and the amount of test samples was set to 200, 200 and 300 for the 1D, 2D and 3D case respectively. By using the singular value decomposition on the generated dose distributions of the training set, a reduced order model could be extracted and provided the expansion coefficients that represent the behaviour of the modes within the reduced order model. Afterwards, the expansion coefficients were inspected as a function of displacement to determine which mode showed strong non-linear behaviour. This mode was called the target mode or high order mode and all modes up until the target mode were included in the reduced basis that was used to approximate the dose distributions. Mode 18, 24 and 51 were chosen as the target modes for the 1D, 2D and 3D case respectively. Subsequently, the target accuracies of the dose predictions within the test set in terms of the average voxel fraction acceptances were calculated using a threshold of 1% difference between the true voxel dose and approximated dose, relative to the maximum dose of the true dose distribution. The target accuracies of the dose predictions within the test set were 99.86%, 99.64% and 99.46% for the 1D, 2D and 3D case respectively. In experiment 1, neural networks with varying amounts of hidden layers, neurons per hidden layer and loss functions were trained on the full set of training samples and, once trained, were used to predict the modes and dose distributions using the displacements from the test set. The amount of hidden layers and neurons per hidden layer were set to: 2, 3, 4 and 5 hidden layers with 40, 80, 120 and 160 neurons per hidden layer for the 1D-case; 2, 4 and 6 hidden layers with 100, 200, 300 and 400 neurons per hidden layer for the 2D-case; 2, 4 and 6 hidden layers with 150, 300, 450 and 600 neurons per hidden layer for the 3D-case. The chosen loss functions were the mean squared error and mean absolute error functions. Each hidden layer used the Rectified Linear Unit activation function and the Adamax optimizer was used. The highest achieved accuracies were 99.79%, 99.50% and 98.84% for the 1D, 2D and 3D case respectively. Experiment 2 was similar to experiment 1, but the networks for the 1D and 2D case were trained with half the amount of training samples. The neural networks of experiment 1 and 2 were trained with the displacements as input variables and all the corresponding expansion coefficients of the modes up until the target mode as output variables. In experiment 3, the neural networks of the 3D case were trained only with the target mode expansion coefficient instead of all expansion coefficients simultaneously. Finally, in experiment 4, a very wide but shallow neural network and a very deep but narrow neural network were compared with and without applying L2 regularization. The regularization parameter was set to 10^-3, 10^-4 and 10^-5. \par It was concluded that increasing the amount of hidden layers and neurons, up to a certain amount can improve the prediction of both the high order modes and dose distributions, after which the performance starts to deteriorate. The amount of hidden layers and neurons per layer at which this occurs is dependent on the loss function and the amount of training data. More precisely, the performance of neural networks that utilize the mean absolute error function deteriorate faster than networks utilizing the mean squared error loss function as the amount of hidden neurons and hidden layers increases. On the other hand, the amount of training data is also important to fully represent the features of the highly non-linear modes that deeper and wider neural networks are able to learn. Deeper networks trained longer than wider networks and regularization did not improve the performance of the neural networks within the trained amount of epochs and chosen amount of hidden layers and neurons per layer.","Proton therapy; ROM; deep learning; Proton dose calculation","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Uplift is considered a submechanism of internal erosion, together with heave and piping, where all three submechanisms must occur for the dike to reach a failure condition. The principle of the uplift phenomenon is straightforward: it occurs when high pore water pressures in the aquifer lift the cover layer, which is located at ground surface. If the pressure is great enough, the cover layer begins to float ('<i>opdrijven</i>'), and may also bulge ('<i>opbollen</i>') or crack ('<i>opbarsten</i>'). Currently, the assessment for uplift is based on a vertical equilibrium, which relates to a floating condition of the cover layer. The forming of an exit point for concentrated seepage is presumed to happen simultaneously with the increase in uplift pressure and is therefore not explicitly considered in the current assessment. This thesis aimed to investigate in what way the uplift assessment may be improved, both to describe the complex behavior better and to decrease the need for costly countermeasures. The evaluation of uplift was conducted in two parts: by making explicit what the causes of uncertainty are in the current assessment, as well as by proposing a new model to describe the complete uplift behavior better. It is recommended to evaluate the ‘floating’ and ‘bulging-cracking’ phases directly. In the ‘bulging-cracking’ phase, the forming of an exit point can either occur by a tension or shear failure.","uplift; piping; internal erosion; calibration safety factor; crack formation; dikes; backward erosion piping","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","",""

This research focuses on circular building from the perspective of re-using building components upfront and its relation with the project management of non-residential building projects in The Netherlands. The study aims to clarify the role of the project management and obtain more insight into the briefing, the project organization, and the selection of the project team, in relation to the re-use of building components. By conducting qualitative research, consisting of a literature study and empirical research, including multiple expert interviews with people involved in re-use projects and case study of a renovation and a newly built office project, a better understanding has been achieved. The research suggests that the management of the initiation phase is of great importance in setting a good starting point for re-use projects. The briefing could help in this by defining clear ambitions and goals. These can guide the team throughout the process. Besides, the way projects are organized could facilitate the inclusion of re-use. This includes the extension of the initiation phase, in which an inventory of reclaimed components is started. Throughout the process better integration between activities is needed to align the reclaimed components with the design, this comes with additional iteration. Lastly, the project team selection is found to have an impact on re-use. The composition of an interdisciplinary team is proposed to integrate planning and design activities and conduct them earlier in the process. This includes (new) collaborations with re-use experts. It is also found that the motivation of the team members could impact the amount of re-use.

These interdependencies are found as well between corporations and cities in decisions on mutations in the corporation’s accommodation, which is the subject of this research. Mutations are considered all changes in the accommodation. In this decision making, corporation often depend on cities for example for the granting of permits. At the same time, cities are in increasing competition to attract corporations to reap the benefits of boosting the local economy by increased employment levels. Thus within this decision making, actors of both parties need to communicate with each other. However, currently little is known about this actual interaction that is realised through communication strategies. At the same time, the importance connective capacity of individual actors is increasingly recognised in literature and practice and confirmed by this research. In this research the use of communication strategies of corporations and cities regarding the communication components when, who, how and what was analysed. By analysing these communication strategies in relation to the situation of the decision making and the motives of each party, interesting relations have been found. Among others, this research showed that communication strategies are supportive of the mutation process, either by speeding up the process or affecting slight preferences at decision-makers. Also, communication can be decisive by providing crucial information for the decision, such as location proposals. An aspect for further thought in both research and practice is the organisation of communication. This organisation includes the deployment of resources and additionally the appointment of a contact person. This appears to be related to the priority given to the mutation project. It seems that at cities, more priority is given to mutations with job creation in comparison with mutation projects focused on qualitative improvement. Also, communication often remains project-based and thereby both parties miss the benefits of early alignment of the plans with existing policies. This confirms the notion in literature that barriers between public and private still exist. All in all, the human factor remains present in decision making on mutations in the accommodation. Therefore this research encourages the recognition of communication strategies as a factor in decision making. <br","Corporate Real Estate Management; Urban Development; Communication Strategy; Communication; Accommodation; Strategy; Decision making; Decision making process; Corporate Real Estate","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Management in the Built Environment","",""

Accurate flood forecasting andearly warning is critical for disaster risk management. Tackling the problemof forecasting, in data scarce environments, has become increasingly impor-tant due to the changing climate. Remotely sensed river monitoring can bean effective, systematic and time-efficient technique to monitor and forecastextreme floods. Conventional flood forecasting systems require extensivedata inputs and software to model floods. Moreover, most models rely ondischarge data, which is not always available and is less accurate in a over-bank flow situations. There is a need for an alternative method which de-tects riverine inundation, using open-source data and software. This thesisaims to research the use of passive microwave radiometry for the detection,classification and forecasting of inundation.Brightness temperatures are extracted from the passive microwave radiom-etry and are converted in a discharge estimator: the C/M-ratio. Surfacewater has a low emission, thus let the C/M-ratio increase as the surfacewater percentage in the pixel increases. Sharp increases are observed forover-bank flow conditions. The research combines the identification of in-undation with a probability analysis via a quantile regressional fit. Floodforecasts can be obtained from an upstream catchment area. In the mostideal situation with a delay of2,5hours. This allows for probabilistic earlywarning decision making, with a lead time up to14days. (location specific)Strong Spearmans correlation coefficients between the discharge and C/M-ratio are found (&gt;0.883). Allowing the model to forecast floods as gaugeddischarge records do. The model used has a comparable skill to the localGloFas forecast. This research investigated the impact the remote sensedtechnology could have on the flood forecast, response and warning system.An added model to an Early Action Protocol has the ability to lower uncer-tainty within decision making and enlarges the intervention window. Theadvice is to use such a model in combination with other forecasting modelssuch as GloFas.The challenge using this technology is the integration of hydrological com-plexity. The method allows for automated, global-covered creation of gridbased flood forecasts, independent to cloud coverage. Creating low spatialresolution flood forecasts combined with a probability bound in hours aftersatellite detection. The method has a high potential for data scarce flood-prone river basins around the world. The future for this technology lies inthe global daily availability of the data. With satellite sensors improving,spatial resolution is expected to increase.

AkzoNobel invested in a new Joint Venture business entity Zervices (ZRVCS) to develop a service platform for the Have It Done paint service. The first market entry selected by this concept was in Belgium, which has currently not reached the predicted business KPI’s. The order intake has not reached the break-even point yet. Many suggestions were given for this slow start, but a concrete problem identification lacks. This led to the following question: “How can we improve service platform business models to enter new markets in the have it done professional paint industry?” In order to identify the problem for the slow start in Belgium and to propose future strategies for ZRVCS, a theoretical framework was made based on business model innovation, important factors for developing competitive advantage and market entry methods. This was used to analyse three case studies with interviews: Uw Schilderwerk, ZRVCS Belgium and ZRVCS the Netherlands. The first case, was the proof of concept Uw Schilderwerk in the Netherlands, which had problems during the start-up period. By resetting the business from year one with a good internal organization, improved platform and financial resources they became the biggest painting company in the Netherlands. This shows that the three factors from the framework are important for their success. Building on this knowledge the case of ZRVCS Belgium was analysed. Different reasons were given during the interviews and the target group of ZRVCS Belgium and Uw Schilderwerk was compared. All these things showed that the business model missed all three factors from the framework, showing the problems of the market entry in Belgium. The last case was the entry in the Dutch market ZRVCS together with de Consumentenbond using a market penetration strategy. The Dutch market is considered an attractive market due to the success of Uw Schilderwerk. During this entry the important aspects for market entry were shown, such as the importance of an attractive market and good collaboration with partners, such as established brands, de Consumentenbond and Sikkens/AkzoNobel.","Digital; service; platform","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-07-03","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

It is located on the North coast of Central Java, it is the largest city in the Central Java province and the fifth largest city in Indonesia. There is great economic and cultural potential in Semarang, especially taking into consideration Kota Lama- Semarang old town. Heritage buildings and the surrounding nature preserve areas are in danger of deterioration and dam- age by haphazard development and lack of urban planning by the central government. The objective of this project is to create a regional framework for the future of Semarang while providing a sustainable method of water resource usage, as well as keeping biodiversity intact and also offering a good living environment. The Ecopolis strategy framework by Tjallingii (1995) will be utilized as the overarching framework used in the design methodology. For the structural framework, the Layers Model by Ian McHarg (1995) and the Cas- co-Concept (Hull Concept) by Kerkstra and Vrijlandt (1988) will be used together. After studying the underlying structures of the landscape and strategically forming a framework for the future, the Ecocity Principle by Richard Register (1987) is utilized to create the strategical approach for the design. The method works in double because the design involves community design, which requires administrative and strategical approaches on top of the structural design. The design masterplan and details aim to build a framework for the future of Semarang, in the scenario which the coastal and mountainous areas are not suitable for residence due to flooding, subsidence and land- slides. The chosen site area is a suburban Semarang region, in which residents from the dangerous coastal ar- eas; the migration of residents can already be seen. Thus, measures have to be taken to not only encompass the new influx of residents, but also keeping the natural qualities of the area intact, and the aquifers and watersheds clean.","ecopolis; ecocity; casco concept; regional framework; heritage; nature conservation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Heritage & Architecture","","-6.974304, 110.427403"

NDVI is a widely used and useful indicator of vegetation health and quantity ­ however its retrieval using satellite data is hindered by the frequent presence of clouds in the Earth’s atmosphere. Zeng et al. (2016) developed a novel technique that estimates a surface's Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) with a Ross­Li­Maignan (RLM) BRDF model from a set of observations. This method, the Changing­Weight Iterative (CWI) method, uses iterative a posteriori estimation of observation errors to reduce the impact of cloud-contaminated measurements in the sample. Its performance was compared to two conventional methods, ordinary­least squares (OLS) and Li­Gao BRDF-fitting. The three different BRDF­fitting methods were compared in a numerical experiment. 6,000 surface types covering a broad range of surface types were modeled using the canopy radiative transfer model PROSAIL. For each surface, sets of pseudo-observations of the surface’s red and NIR band reflectance were generated using realistic sun­target view geometries from the MODIS and MERSI satellite sensors. The effects of cloud­contamination were simulated by adding different numbers of cloud­contaminated observation to the sample, with varying degrees of contamination. The RLM BRDF model was fitted to these samples using the three different methods to estimate the BRDF model parameters. These were subsequently used to calculate a NDVI composite value. Each method’s estimate was compared to a reference ­value generated by PROSAIL. Results for the 6,000 surfaces confirmed that the CWI method is more noise­resistant than OLS and Li­Gao in situations with many observations (i.e. a large sample), and resulted in estimates that more closely matched the reference value from PROSAIL, compared to the conventional Li­Gao and OLS methods. In scenarios of low­cloud contamination, all three methods failed to detect and significantly suppress the impact of noisy observations, which was expected from existing literature. For a large­sized sample of 13 pseudo­observations studied for the validation site Mongu, Zambia, the CWI method was observed to have a very accurate performance, for up to 5 contaminated observations in the sample. With smaller sized samples of 8 and 10 for two other validation sites, it was found that the RMSE of the CWI method would suddenly increase approximately tenfold when the number of contaminated observations increased beyond 2 and 3, respectively. After these ’tipping points’, the Li­Gao method was more accurate and outperformed CWI. The CWI method therefore performed promisingly when given a large enough sample size, and in these cases it was more accurate than the conventional Li-Gao and OLS methods. However, when it fails to correctly identify noisy observations, its accuracy could decrease suddenly, which should be taken into consideration for operational use. Since the results of the experiment were averaged over 6,000 different sampling points of the PROSAIL model's parameter space, it is suggested that the conclusions apply to a wide range of surface types found all over the Earth.","Remote Sensing; BRDF; NDVI; simulation; PROSAIL; reflectance","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geoscience and Remote Sensing","","40.005139, 116.383628"

The vision is to design a complete dry-assembly cast glass arch vault where the Notre Dame de Paris is the chosen case study. The main question is: To what extent can a historical masonry arch vault be reconstructed by using cast glass components? The method is based on literature research and FEA simulations. The thesis contains three main phases of the research. First, the background, problem statement and research objectives/ questions are discussed in the introduction. Then, the complete literature research where heritage, arch vault structures, structural glass and cast glass in structures will be discussed. The third part describes the complete design phase including the criteria and final design. The thesis finishes with a conclusion and discussion chapter. The main results of this thesis are that a historical arch vault can be reconstructed from cast glass, but this will bring high risks and costs. Therefore, the suggestion is to use cast glass for the structural arches as this meets the complex geometry but use traditional materials for complex nodes and float glass where single, abstract curves can be made. The connections between different components are dry thanks to interlayers, but the cast glass elements are adhesively bonded. From safety, assembly, and labor perspective, these connections are chosen. This way, the blurry effect of glass in a heritage is reached, but the method is simplified. This principle can also be applied as roof structures for future buildings, but also for small pedestrian bridges as the geometry possibilities are unlimited.","vault; reconstruction; cast glass; glass; Notre Dame de Paris; Building technology; structural glass","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Building Technology | Sustainable Design","","48.852966, 2.349902"

The increase in food production needed to meet the anticipated demands of the near future cannot be achieved by simply extrapolating current trends in production and consumption. A continuation of the recent historical trends of expansion and intensification will undermine the very resource base on which the food system itself depends.In order to address this, I used the system of Permaculture to shift from a mono-cultural farming policy to a more multi-story polyculture farming strategy which, along with yields, also attempts to regenerate biodiversity, community interaction and works with nature rather than against it.I ended up designing tool-kit and policy (which I tested on Parkstad, Limburg) which could also be used to shift from a conventional farming structure to a more resilient one by making the process self-sustainable and one which improves the natural layer around it.","Resilience; Sustainabilty; Agricultural landscapes; permaculture","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Landscape Architecture","","51.996300, 4.375900"

Setting foot on the Red Planet is the next stage of the human exploration of the universe. The travel to Mars is very lengthy and costly, nonetheless the planet still shows great potential for sustaining human life. To make this a possibility, there is a need for locally sourced energy. The presence of (re-)usable resources on Mars could pave the way to further expand the exploration to an interplanetary scale, and successfully maintain a human presence outside the Earth's atmosphere. The availability of energy will be a key indicator for the success of the human race in the colonisation of Mars. To answer this call for the need to generate locally sourced energy, the design of a renewable energy system was started by a team of students and staff from the faculty of Aerospace Engineering at Delft University of Technology: The Arcadian Renewable Energy System (ARES). The energy system will power the construction and operations of a Mars habitat, to support the livability of humans. The system will use complementary renewable energy sources integrated into a microgrid, to sustainably harvest energy from local Martian environment and resources. To ensure the design will be able to fulfil its purpose, a mission need statement and a project objective statement are generated: Mission Need Statement: To provide renewable energy supply of 10 kW to a Mars habitat. Project Objective Statement: Design a renewable energy supply system, primarily focusing on wind energy, which provides 10kW to a Mars habitat, by 10 students in 10 weeks.

Despite this, in the last century, bamboo has been out of spotlight in the architecture field and downgraded to scaffolding, decorative material and temporary housing.

Despite this, the conservation of these monuments is slowly being put under pressure by rapid economic development and the desire to make as much profit as possible. This development has raised awareness through the world of conservation about the importance of preserving and conserving our heritage. It is, however, hard to obey all the stated values and guidelines with existing materials and techniques. Many guidelines contradict each other, resulting in fierce debates about how monuments can be restored in the best and most appropriate way or whether they should not be preserved at all. Introducing cast glass as a new material into the field of reconstruction and conservation could bring the extremes of this ongoing debate closer together. By introducing a transparent material, in the form of cast glass, it becomes possible to safeguard the structural and mechanical stability of marble monuments and simultaneously allow for observing both its original and damaged state. Moreover, with cast glass, it is possible to re-shape these missing elements of monumental structures very easily and its texture and transparency can be easily altered to give them either a fully transparent appearance or one that resembles of the original material. In this research. the possibilities of using cast glass in restoration projects have been explored by creating a design and production line starting at the analysis of the case study and ending when the final piece is assembled. Using key conservation values like preserving authenticity, minimising visual impact and allowing for reversibility has resulted in a cast glass reconstruction design which is according to the conservation guidelines and feasible with the existing production methods of cast glass. The development of new techniques in 3D scanning and additive manufactured moulds allows this process to become more time and cost-effective than currently used conventional methods. By scanning damaged surfaces of the monument in combination with the use of 3D printed sand moulds, glass can be easily cast into complex shapes to fill up the missing parts of the monument. The key to designing these glass shapes lies in understanding and respecting the monument’s structural and mechanical behaviour. If these characteristics are translated into the connections, shape and composition of the reconstructed cast glass elements, transparent restoration could become a serious contender for conventional materials in the conservation of monuments.","Cast Glass; Marble Monuments; Restoration; Transparency","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Building Technology | Sustainable Design","",""

The phenomena of bioeconomy comprehends the sustainable conversion and production of biomass for energy, health and industrial products. A vital component of bioeconomy, is the concept of the biorefinery, which has the potential to rep¬lace conventional petroleum refineries in order to produce energy and material products with 2nd generation biomass feedstock. In the search for renewable production landscapes, the current situation of pollution and contamination cannot be neglected. Tis paper investigates the situation and possibilities for the industrial site of Shell-Pernis in the Port of Rotterdam. The soils of Shell-Pernis are highly contaminated with Mineral oils, heavy metals (e.g. Zn, Cu, Cd, Hg, etc), and PAHs. In order to clean these soils and provide feedstock for a proposed biorefinery, a set of 25 different plant species is contrived, which form building blocks for ecological interventions to transform a deteriorated, fossil-based industrial site into an accessible bio-industrial park. These interventions follow the rule of multiple functions, as all plants provide various ecosystem services such as production of biofuels, bioremediation, attracting wildlife, fixating nitrogen, preventing erosion and other additional benefits. Hence, the interventions have the potential to make a polluted industrial area safer and healthier, and provide a pleasant stay for the public. This research and design project shows how Shell-Pernis has the potential to become a flagship site of the green industry where bio-economic and rehabilitating activities are shown to the outer world in order to educate and stimulate sustainable growth.","Shell-Pernis; Energy transition; Regeneration strategies; Bioremediation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","51.887375, 4.354719"

(TU Delft Architecture and the Built Environment; TU Delft Landscape Architecture)","Piccinini, D. (mentor); Kuzniecow Bacchin, T. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","Transitional territories such as lagoons are among the most impacted and delicate environments, threatened by the combined effects of climate change and human action. This Master thesis in Landscape Architecture examines the Venetian Lagoon in North of Italy as one of the most endangered and critical cases, as the last extreme flooding event of November 2019 demonstrates. The thesis aims to address the Venetian Lagoon hydromorphological sufferance, the state of neglection of its secondary islands, and the over-engineered flood defence design as crucial issues. From the research conducted, emerges clearly the need for redefining the role of the entire Venetian Lagoon in the next future, shifting its role from passive, being exploited and consequently damaged, to active, able to sustain resiliently the rest of the territory. In order to do so, the main strategy to be pursued is to reinforce the “barene” landscape, the brackish marshlands, fundamental for the hydromorphological and ecological survival of the lagoon. These brackish marshlands are able to limit tidal and wind impact, favour water exchange and act as an expansion vessel, but, from 20th century onwards, 70% of their surface have been lost due to anthropic actions. Therefore, the goal of the thesis is to employ the agency of “barene” to mitigate the impact of anthropic and natural threats, acting as a nature-based flood defence (function), to recover hydromorphological sufferance (flow), and to support the cultural, ecological and productive heritage (form), making the Venetian Lagoon function as a sustaining landscape infrastructure. The “barene” act as pivotal means to achieve a comprehensive vision for the Venetian Lagoon where functions, flows, and forms are implemented and designed as part of a unique co-operating system. The central area of the Venetian Lagoon is chosen as project site, being the most damaged hydromorphologically. Having researched on how natural forces (tides, winds, etc.) influence this portion of lagoon, different combinations of under-water and above-water concave structures are designed in harmony with these forces, to capture suspended sediments and promote accretion. In the most compromised cases, the structures are partially supported by initial dredges. The islands of the central lagoon become the perceptive points from which experience the transformation and the growth of this new landscape. In the end, the intertwined system of “barene” and islands, once grown sufficiently and matured, will produce a beneficial effect over the hydromorphological, ecological and biodiversity, and cultural surrounding environment. Through the process of research by landscape design, the project seeks to mitigate the threats of climate change and relative sea level rise in the Venetian Lagoon; provide a nature-based flood defence; create brackish marshland’s habitat for ecosystem restoration; invest on alternative forms of slow-tourism and foster different duration of stay in Venetian lagoon; enrich local community livelihood and economical vibrancy. Moreover, the project wants to consolidate and enhance the cultural image of the Venetian Lagoon, consisting of the diffuse sense of horizontality, reflection and visibility conveyed by the diffuse and unceasing water surface.","Venetian Lagoon; Building-with-Nature; Landscape infrastructure; Landscape resilience; Brackish marshlands","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Landscape Architecture","",""

A doublet system, with a cold water injection well and a hot water production well, alters the stress situation in the subsurface, which can result in (micro)fracturing and fault reactivation. Even in water filled reservoirs, aquifers, with relatively good permeabilities, the acting in-situ stress on already existing fault can be changed such that there can be a seismic hazard. The three dominant phenomena that influence the fault reactivation and are triggered by geothermal water injection and production are the direct pore pressure change, poro-elastic stress change and thermo-elastic stress change. To predict and subsequently diminish or limit the seismic hazards in geothermal operations, Seismic Risk Analysis (SRA) are to be completed before such operations can take place in an often seismic risky location, like densely populated areas. In the current (Dutch) geothermal environment mainly three SRA’s are used; “Methodiek voor risicoanalyse ontrent geinduceerde beving door gaswinning” by the Staatstoezicht op de Mijnen (SodM), “Defining the Framework for Seismic Hazard Assessment in Geothermal Projects V0.1” by Q-con/IF-technology [6] and an Excel-model created by TNO/Geomech. By investigating and reviewing these three SRA’s in this thesis their shortcoming and limitations are exposed, for example their lack of physical foundation and explanatory results. From the foundation of the currently excising SRA’s a new alternative SRA, which corresponds in some steps with the older SRA’s, is created in this thesis. In order to successfully finish the new SRA one of the three steps should be completed, starting with SRA Step 1. In this first step of the new SRA a new Physical Screening Model (PSM) is created. When completing the SRA an indication of what type of seismic monitoring there should be done during production. This PSM is a fairly quick and simple in its use but provides sufficient informative data to investigate the seismic hazard for most geothermal operations in the Netherlands. In four different steps in the PSM, the potential reactivation of faults over the whole reservoir during production will be evaluated. With the spatio-temporal evolution of ΔP, Δσporo, ΔT (PSM Step 1) this model can predict fault reactivation at any place and time inside the reservoir, while it can also look at which parameter dominated this reactivation. In this thesis the physical background and results of the PSM will be explained step by step. Eventually there are three final results from the PSM; a Mohr plot that predicts if certain faults (at certain locations) are stable or not and the maximum Moment magnitude (Mw) in combinations with the Peak Ground Velocity (PGV), which predict the severity of a possible event. Sensitivity analyses and case studies done with the PSM in this thesis show the influence of dominating parameters, like permeability and injection rate, and what results can be expected when using this model.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Earth Sciences","",""

This implementation can only be made by density dependent forces, which are important in architectural models. Self weight, snow loads and roofing constraints are added in order to make more relieable calculations. To generate architectural geometry the methodology is translated to 3D geometry and several design problems are tested. These problems show generated domes, arches and the proper transferring of forces to foundations.

Designing a good customer experience is vital in ensuring a sustainable competitive advantage for Exact. In order for Exact to try to adapt to this change in environment, a shift towards customer centric initiatives showed over the past years within its organisation. Among these initiatives is the creation of a Customer Journey Management (CJM) team, about half a year ago, within the Customer Success department of Exact. Their aim is to improve customer satisfaction and reduce churn, by optimising the customer experience of Exact solutions. This project was initiated by the CJM team which asked: “How can Exact bring Customer Journey Management to the next level of maturity?” As CJM is slowly getting up and running, many quick wins can still be achieved in the Post-Sales process they are currently responsible for. It is debatable, however, whether this is the right approach for the long term, whether they have the right influence to make the desired impact and whether the metrics they are being held accountable for are fitting for its ultimate goal: the optimisation of Exacts end-to-end customer journey. In order to reach this goal, close collaboration between different departments is necessary, by empowering them to positively contribute to their part of the customer journey in an integrated way. This can only be achieved through a shared deep understanding of the customer and their journey and if the value of customer journey management is proven for all stakeholders involved. Ultimately, electing a board member responsible for Exacts customer experience in the form of a Chief Customer Officer (CCO) would be advised. The challenges that the CJM team face, identified in analysis, all seem to point towards the conclusion that user-centered design thinking is not embedded (enough) into the veins of the company. This does not mean that it’s employees do not have the customer at heart though, but it seems that often the customer is not understood well enough and thus mistakes are more easily made. In practise this approach seems harm the customer experience, hurting revenues in the long run. As long as the customer experience is not understood deeply enough by employees, Customer Journey Management does not have the means to impact the customer journey end-to-end, as recommended by literature to bring CJM to the next level. Therefore it was chosen to design a system that enables Exact employees to gain a deeper understanding of their customers. The solution was found in the design of a Game Development Guide. It enables the CJM team (and other employees) to simulate the customers experience through playing games. It is a step-by-step guide for its development and provides the process and tools necessary to design, play and evaluate the games based on different customer experiences. Once the game is ready to be played it can stimulate participatory learning by having employees temporarily step into the customers shoes. This creates deeper (richer) understanding of the customer’s perspective, including his/her (tacit and latent) needs, emotions and contextual factors. The resulting deep customer insights can then be used throughout the innovation process to validate assumptions and prioritize solutions, which results in improved Customer Journey Management. This way Exact will be able to better understand their customers, enabling them to design user-centered solutions that truly benefit their customers experiences. This will ensure that Exact will stay on top, giving them a sustainable competitive advantage over their competitors in the long run.","strategic design; customer journey; customer journey management; game design; Exact Software; customer experience","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","Graduation project",""

Digital Fabrication has the potential to offer such an alternative method. While 3D scanning, digital repair and 3D printing are all proven technologies, stucco ornament restoration often requires an on site fabrication solution directly onto a ceiling or wall due to the brittle nature of prefab stucco elements. The research explores how an in-situ 3D printing technique can be developed for the restoration of stucco ornaments by focussing on three main topics: 1) developing gypsum-based 3D printing materials, which are compatible to gypsum ceilings and comply with criteria for extrusion based 3D printing; 2) Designing and prototyping 3D printing tools including an extruder and material delivery system; 3) Conceptualizing a Restoration Robot Platform with which the developed printing material can be used with the developed 3D printing tools, for on site stucco ornament restoration.

Thinner wings with high aspect ratios tend to be more flexible, and thus, more susceptible to wing flutter, a dynamic aeroelastic instability characterised by diverging oscillatory motions of the wing. As propellers are flexibly attached to the wing, another aeroelastic instability, called precession or whirl flutter, can occur. The nature of this phenomena lies in the additional forces and moments created by rotating blades as the propeller hub describes a “whirling” motion about the static thrust axis due to gyroscopic effects. These dynamic instabilities can happen independently or coupled together causing severe structural damage on the aircraft and when occurred during flight, lead to fatal accidents. Hence, it becomes essential to analyse any new propeller-driven aircraft configuration regarding wing flutter and whirl flutter. A mathematical model has been derived to analyse the dynamic behaviour of a flexible cantilever wing with flexibly attached tractor propeller/s: the wing structural model is a linear dynamic Euler-Bernoulli beam model, the wing aerodynamic model is represented by a combination of strip theory and two-dimensional Theodorsen's unsteady aerodynamic theory, and the propeller aerodynamic model is defined by Houbolt-Reed propeller aerodynamic derivatives. The aeroelastic behaviour of a wing with flexibly mounted propeller/s may be very different from that of a wing with rigidly mounted propeller/s. Reasons lie in the interaction between the additional whirl modes and the wing modes due to gyroscopic coupling. Whereas propeller and wing aerodynamics may drive the (coupled) backward whirl mode unstable, wing aerodynamics alone may drive the (coupled) forward whirl mode unstable.","aeroelasticity; wing flutter; whirl flutter; wingtip-mounted propellers; distributed propulsion","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

When enemy forces establish counter-space capabilities, this could become a weakness. Responsive Space is a concept that focuses on replenishing lost capabilities and/or granting additional capabilities from space assets quickly. The continuous miniaturization of technologies has enabled small satellites to fulfill many desired functions. To launch such satellites, it might be possible to modify a missile into a small launch vehicle that can be launched from a naval ship using a shipborne missile canister launching system, the Mark 41 Vertical Launching System, thereby giving the military autonomous and quick-response space launch capability. Modifying a missile that has already been integrated in the VLS instead of developing a fully new launch vehicle could have the benefit that integration cost could be lower. Also, a fully new vehicle would require more development, which can be costly and time consuming. It is investigated what the maximum payload is of a launch vehicle developed from an already integrated missile that is launched from the Mark 41 Vertical Launching System and whether it is capable of launching microsatellites. The Block IIA version of the Standard Missile-3 anti-ballistic missile is determined to be the most capable missile to modify. A multidisciplinary design optimization tool has been created that maximizes the payload mass and the perigee altitude of the orbit of the new launch vehicle. The results show that it is possible to launch a microsatellite to various Low-Earth orbits from different launch locations. For example, for an equatorial orbit, it is possible to launch a payload mass of up to 17.8 kg to a near-circular orbit with a perigee altitude of 200 km.","MDO; launch vehicle; design; Navy; Responsive Space; payload; rocket; military; SM-3; Standard Missile-3; Mark 41; Vertical Launching System; VLS; Multidisciplinary Design Optimization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

It is precisely this atmosphere that grants a new perspective on the vegetative actors of the place and not only stimulates a re-joining with the territory but also with the inner self. The territory itself is subject to remediation through the vegetation on site. Phytotechnologies degrade substances and allow a subtle opening of the site through time. By that, hitherto marginalised port areas and the North Sea foreshore are increasingly reconnected with the city converting the site into a link between land and sea.","Bioremediation; Phytoremediation; Industrial Heritage; Contamination; Green infrastructure; Garden; Health; Well-being","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","51.041827"

The thesis focuses on the indoor environmental quality, the thermal comfort of the pilot house. Prior to the field visit, the significant parameters for the in situ measurement and the comfort standards for the region are chosen by literature studies. A systematic measurement plan is made in order to perform in situ measurements and field study. The measurements are done for a period of nine days. In addition to this, one of the objectives of the research is to develop an economical measuring and remotely accessible monitoring device for the thermal comfort parameters. It is achieved by programming Raspberry Pi and DHT22 temperature and humidity sensor. Hypotheses are formulated after the field visit. Then the measured data is sorted systematically and analysed. This analysed data is further studied and the comfort performance of the house is compared with the comfort standards of the region. It is found that the performance is quite satisfactory for all the spaces in the house except the attic space, which has higher temperatures than the upper comfort level. Moreover the usability of the existing doors needs improvement in terms of controlling privacy and air velocity. For the improvements, it is envisioned to have minimal interventions to the existing design and construction. For this two options are put forward. Both the options are compared with the existing design by making DesignBuilder models. The simulation results of the models are compared to find the better performing strategy. Final design is made with the inference from the comparison of the simulation results, and visits to the local architecture. From the final design, the following design improvement recommendations are put forward for the housing type: “openings for ventilation at sleeping height in the attic floor” “openings at top of the roof to enhance stack effect” “collapsible doors with louvered shutters for providing users with more option in controlling air velocity and privacy”","Indoor Environmental Quality; Tropical Climate; Thermal Comfort Performance; Compassion+Technology; Floating House Philippines; Climate Design; Traditional Architecture; Weather Monitoring; IoT","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Building Technology | Sustainable Design","Finch Floating Home","14°54'29.4""N 120°42'18.3""E 14.908154, 120.705082"

The aim of this project is to develop a game that can be played in Schiedam on an Android platform. An additional requirement is that the game can be adapted after the project is finished. That is, the client must be able to add new card sets and new locations through an interface without having to make changes in the codebase. Another part of this project includes a gamemaster interface, in which one person can keep track of all teams in a game, including their cards, points, locations and chat messages. Lastly, a server was created for storing and sending information between teams and the game master. This report defines the standard game play of a game of Hunting Happy Families. The main goal of the game is to learn about the history of the city of Schiedam. By walking around, teams can collect cards from other players, and identify locations associated with the various sets to try and gather as many points as possible. The team with the most points at the end of the game, wins. The system features a server connecting the teams and the game master using a string message system and lambda functions. Upon sending a message using this system, the server handles the requested data, and answers the request by forwarding the provided information, or relaying the information requested. The system was thoroughly field tested, including a playtest with external players. The verdict on the game by these players is positive, though the system needs a slight amount of fine tuning to ensure the best experience. That said, the game is completely ready for use, andHuntingHappy Families is bound to carve its niche in the market of group events.","","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science and Engineering","TI3806",""

Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a well-established depression treatment, and one of its therapeutic methods is to change negative thought patterns into positive ones. The new positive thoughts need to be more believable than the old ones, so therapists usually ask clients to complete sets of thought-strengthening exercises. However, psychologists have expressed concerns regarding patients’ compliance in doing these exercises, as the majority of clients encounter at least one hurdle that obstructs them from completing the exercises. Therefore, we developed a system aimed at motivating doctoral students to perform thought-strengthening exercises. The system allows the candidates to interact with a conversational agent (i.e., a chatbot) to address motivational barriers related to the exercises and complete the exercises within the same program. We used a double-blind experiment with a mixed design setup that included a healthy general public sample group (n = 174) and three conditions (chatbot support, text support, and no support) to test the defined hypotheses and evaluate the system. We hypothesized that the participants’ perceived usefulness and self-efficacy regarding the thought-strengthening exercises would be higher depending on the presentation format (i.e., motivation via text or interactive chatbot) and content (i.e., with or without motivation). The results related to perceived usefulness showed an increase in the conversational agent condition, which showed a significant difference when compared with the no-support condition. As for self-efficacy, various increases occurred in all three conditions; however, no significant difference appeared between them. In conclusion, the conversational agent support system showed the potential to increase PhD students’ motivation to complete the thought-strengthening exercises.","Chatbot; CBT; Conversational Agent; Support system; Motivation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","The extreme character of human activities and hard infrastructures in combination with the continuous variation of the climate has triggered an unprecedented fast rate of alterations in the environment. Hereafter the anthropogenically magnified climate change is increasing stress on ecosystems; especially interfaces such as coastal areas are in significant risk. Considering that the North Sea is one of the most urbanized seascapes, we can draw upon its susceptibility to three hazards: inundation, sea temperature rise, and growing harbors. Although an ambiguity will prevail concerning the magnitude and rate of transformations, certainly inundation will cover and drown habitats, as well as move large amounts of formations and sediments; that sea temperature rise will attract invasive species and decrease water quality due to habitat depletion; in addition to the demand on expanding ports which implies more pollution by ship traffic, industrial areas, and spills, hence the accumulation of externalities in the sea bottom. One of the most sensible as well as affected territories concerning these hazards is the Wadden Sea Re¬gion, which consists of a large intertidal zone surrounded by high productivity areas and rich marine ecosystems shared by three countries. Recalibrating this region could mean enhancing the exhausted North Sea ecology to embrace climatic risk, store externalities, and set an example for the manage¬ment of other conservation areas at risk. Our spatial measures have developed from the exploitation of ecology (1900s) to its conservation (1960s) , currently (2000s) we are looking towards shepherding nature by integrating them into our constructed systems. However this spatial management perspective overlooks the innate benefits resulting from the synergy by co-habitation of human life, non-human life and the environment. The proposed project recommends to look into a partnership with nature to join the intrinsic dynamics this planet offers, instead of trying to dominate them. This suggested co- habitation could be a chance to synchronize with the changing processes of our environment, which might lead us towards adapting progressively to them. The project claims to regenerate the multi- equilibria state of marine ecosystems and develop an evolutionary adaptation through an ecosystem suc¬cession approach(Davoudi et al., 2013; Hale et al., 2009). This entails the grad¬ual transformation of constantly obsolete infrastructures towards hybrid evolving systems consisting of Infrastructural Ecologies (Brown, 2019).The idea is to use a mixture of soft and hard infrastructures that reintegrate the bio dynamics of ecology, so that it can be colonized by socio- ecological elements. Hence the interplay of the anthropic designs and environmental processes would support the creation of habitats that allow a shared expansion space for dissimilar activities to meet (ecotone enhancement). To propose such infrastructures it was necessary to understand the dynamics of the different marine ecosystems in terms of time cycles, longevity and inter dependencies. The consideration of this temporal dimension of socio- ecological elements in the design, allows the proposed changes to eventually be coupled to the pace of environmental processes. Hereafter ecosystems could be able to embrace climatic risk, since they no longer present a hazard, but a trigger of transformation.","Ecosystem- based Adaptation; Ecotone; Natural processes; Hybrid habitat; Sea temperature rise; Sea level rise; Water pollution by port activity; Wadden Sea region","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Urbanism","Transitional Territories","53.588565, 8.532529"

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","In recent years blockchain technology has become a popular topic for research in multiple fields of discipline. For the transport sector especially, the technology is seen as disruptive. Because the research field is young and the research on the topic is developing fast, state-of-the-art knowledge is exclusive to a select group of academics. This review aims to provide an overview of the current state of blockchain technology applications in the transportation domain. Previous reviews on blockchain and transportation have already mapped the contributions for supply chain and logistics. Studies within the transportation domain on connected systems and vehicles have not been comprehensively reviewed, while the relevance on these kind of systems is growing. The focus of this review is on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), which integrates the connected transportation systems and vehicles. The demand for ITS is growing and the relevance of supporting blockchain solutions as well. The increasing amount of connected vehicles introduce security and privacy concerns. Connected vehicles share sensitive information on which other users base their behaviour, so correctness of information is very important. Next to that, the risk arises of losing complete control over the vehicle through attacks due to the remote accessibility possibilities of the vehicle. Blockchain offers a solution for these concerns by enabling a decentralized and secure way of sharing information. These features make secure and trustworthy communication between vehicles, roadside units and platoons possible, aswell as secure over-the-air software updates. Privacy concerns can be mitigated via the use of pseudonyms, partitions or fresh data keys. With its decentralized characteristic, blockchain technology creates a transparent and traceable way of storing and sharing data. For ITS applications this means efficient insurance processes and liability attribution. Furthermore, the traceability feature of blockchain can be used in fraud detection for rolling wrecks and odometer fraud. Also, ITS can benefit from blockchain technology by integrating smart contracts. Processes where a third party is involved can be replaced by a smart contract, making it possible to implement vehicle-to-machine payments. This makes transactions fast, cheaper and secure. Processes like tolling payments or vehicle maintenance can then be automated. The security and privacy features of blockchain technology offer a solution for the implementation of Mobility-as-a-Service principles, which enables vehicle sharing. Furthermore, blockchain is an asset for transportation solutions in smart cities. In smart cities, blockchain technology can ensure data integrity and encourage organizations to share data enabling transparent city management. Within smart cities, blockchain can facilitate the data sharing between vehicles and infrastructure, as well as energy trading via vehicle-to-grid principles. Another way in which ITS can benefit from blockchain technology, is through the use of incentive mechanisms. Blockchain is well suited for incentive systems because it can automate direct interaction between actors. With automated payments, people can be incentivized to share reliable traffic data or to participate in efficient energy distribution for the grid. Also, safe driving behaviour and environmental friendly transportation can be rewarded. Before real life systems can benefit from the advantages of blockchain technology a lot of challenges have to be overcome. For ITS, all applications exist only in theoretical form. Challenges that have to be faced are the high energy consumption, latency and throughput constraints, and governance issues. Although the benefits of blockchain technology are multifold, the challenges have proven to be to hard to overcome up until now.","Blockchain; ITS; Intelligent Transport Systems","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

Much of the PRD area lies between 0-20m above sea level and the rivers from the mainland feed the delta with 340 billion cubic meters of rainwater yearly (Weng, 2007). Water and sedimentation from the rivers up north and on the west side are constantly moving through this low-lying region, making the soil fertile and suitable for agriculture. This fertile low laying area is also home to one of the<br/>most densely urbanized regions in the world (Weng, 2007). Apart from agriculture, this region has also seen multiple cycle of different types of production subjugated upon their land. In past decades, with the rise of consumerism and globalization, parcels of rural land were transformed into factories manufacturing goods which brought about rapid rural industrialization and urbanization throughout the region. This industrialization of the PRD resulted to as much as 60% of new urban land cover being converted from previously non build-up areas such as agriculture land and forested areas in industrial cities like<br/>Foshan within 1988 -2003 (Hao, 2008). The change in landcover placed pressure to the drainage and capability water retention in the area which resulted in deadly flooding. Apart from rapid land cover change and massive urbanisation, industrialisation also usually bring about forms of pollution. Water plays an integral role during the manufacturing process and also as its byproduct resulting to most of the waterways in the PRD to be heavily polluted and toxic for the environment and people living around it. The environment, unfortunately took most of the direct impact of the rapid industrialisation and urbanisation. As cities in China began to prosper in the last two decades, the manufacturing economy started to focus more onto technology and innovation. In 2019, the PRD was rebranded to The Greater Bay Area (GBA), where economic development plans were lay out for market integration and advance development among the cities<br/>in the region. One of the impact of this new development plan is that most cities area have to shift to a higher skill labour and hightech advancement in their manufacturing industry. The shift from traditionally intensive production to advance and high-tech manufacturing will create changes in many different aspect ranging from the labour market to infrastructure. The streamlining of production due to the technological advancement implemented by businesses will result in the reduction of factory operation and labour size thus leaving cities<br/>with decommissioned industrial areas. Nevertheless, the transitioning period<br/>allows for the opportunity for transformation these scarred land sustainably, to one that remediate using landscape based solution and regenerates the area into a safe area redevelopment for the benefit of the ever changing community, environment and economy.

They are also used more often on the web, for example for visualisation but it is also possible to query, analyse, and edit data in this way. In this case, the network becomes a potential new bottleneck in time performance. Especially when a 3D city model contains a lot of attributes, there is a rapid increase in file size when the area of study is expanded.<br/>This presents challenges in efficiency and in this thesis I focus on the improvement of the inner workings of 3D city models to attempt to relieve this problem, in specific for spreading and using them more efficiently on the web.<br/><br/>By investigating and testing different compression techniques on 3D city models stored in the CityJSON format, I have attempted to relieve this problem. CityJSON is already more compact than CityGML and these techniques decrease the file sizes of datasets even further, allowing for faster transmission over a network. But on the other hand, additional steps are needed to process compressed files. The goal of using a compression technique is to result in a net speed gain, meaning that the time that is saved on download time should be larger than the additional time that it costs to process the file before transmission (compressing the data on the server) and after receival (decompressing the data in the client).<br/><br/>There are compression techniques for both general and specific purposes, and I have used combinations of them. Amongst these are Draco compression, zlib, CBOR, and a self-created technique. Specific ones are used for the main characteristics that CityJSON datasets have, which are the JSON structure, feature attributes, and feature geometries. To assess the impact that different combinations of compression techniques have, I take uncompressed CityJSON performance as the baseline and have come up with different performance indicators that include several use cases such as visualisation, querying, analysis, and editing.<br/><br/>I have benchmarked all combinations of compression techniques on the use cases of these performance indicators. For this I have created two types of server implementations: one with which datasets are compressed beforehand and are processed in the client based on the request made by the user, and one where the data is processed first and only then compressed and transmitted to the server. In the results, you can see the best-performing compression type per use case.<br/><br/>The benchmarking is performed on a variety of datasets that are split into four categories: larger datasets, larger datasets without attributes, smaller datasets, and smaller datasets without attributes. This ultimately makes for use cases that are very specific and choosing suitable compression types requires finding out which ones perform relatively well in most cases, and are not difficult to implement in order to keep CityJSON a simple file format. It turns out that Draco compression can give good results in specifc situations, but in general is not good to use. Not only regarding performance, but also from a developer point of view. CBOR, zlib, and a combination of these two are easy to use and generally affect the performance of CityJSON on the web in a good way.","CityJSON; compression; 3D city models; web; network; RESTful API; digital twins","en","master thesis","","","","","","https://github.com/jliempt/CityJSON-does-file-size-matter-","","","","","","Geomatics","",""

This has potential in minimizing user efforts and cost for data acquisition. The current state-of-the-art method involves two main components, the global depth map and plane instances. After investigating the current state-of-the-art methods, it is observed that there is inconsistency in reconstructed surface boundaries and depth estimation over the curvature and edges of the objects present in the scene, despite having good 3D representation in the surrounding regions. We devise a loss function for optimizing depth estimation during supervision of the neural network by providing geometric awareness to the pixels at local level based on its neighborhood properties defined by spatial compatibility and color similarity. A similar function is used during 3D reconstruction for orientation consistency in the point cloud. Based on the quantitative and qualitative analysis, it is observed that the proposed approach helps in improving the 3D reconstruction from a single image in an indoor environment.","3D Reconstruction; Deep Learning; indoor reconstruction; Piecewise Planar Reconstruction; Point Cloud; 3D Model; Convolutional Neural Networks; Depth reconstruction; Supervised Learning; Indoor environment; Single Image","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geomatics","",""

In the Netherlands and particularly in the Dutch River area (Rivierenland in Dutch) narratives have already shifted towards an adaptive planning (Davoudi, 2013). However, there is still a need to go beyond the physical cultural and programmatic separation between rivers -active areas in flood management- and the urbanized territory -passive areas in flood management-. The definition of these dualities in the Dutch territory not only feeds a model based on vulnerability, but it also leaves the problem of a fragmented landscape unsolved. Aiming at the enhancement of adaptive territories and the embracement of uncertainty, the thesis proposes the operationalization of an approach based on enhanced connectivity throughout the territory, where every part of the urbanized territory takes a role in the active management of floods and ecosystem restoration. An approach aiming at restoring systemic proximities between culture and nature and between local land management and territorial water safety. The main design outcome of the thesis is a transformation pathway towards the hybridization of the territory by increasing ecological densities and buffer capacities per land management unit. A pathway where synergistic coupling of functions are activated locally, triggering processes of innovation and cultural appropriation of the proposal, as opportunities for emerging ecosystem-based production models. The graduation research is positioned within an emerging urban paradigm, one that re-defines the act of urbanization as an act of re-territorialization (Deleuze and Guatari, 2000), where land uses are associated to evolutionary land roles that different occupation patterns perform in the establishment of a more symbiotic relation with the ecology in which these are embedded.

Funding for improvements is however lacking threatening the development of needed homes in the region as new development locations lack accessibility. The responsibility for plan making and development of housing and regional infrastructure has shifted to lower levels of government. Value capture funding instruments are successfully applied abroad where they supply parts of the required funding for infrastructural projects. The application of value capture instruments in the Dutch context is studied by looking at Dutch cases where regional public transportation infrastructure and urban development are combined and by expert interviews to explore the application of value capture instruments. Through a literature study it was found that the upgrade of public transportation infrastructure can lead to a 3 to 5 per cent rise in real estate values in the first kilometer from a new station location. By estimating a rise in real estate values using qualitative characteristics complex quantitative calculations can be avoided and an expected rise in real estate value can be found. A proposal for a value capture process is made where the choice for an instrument is related to the capture space and financial feasibility is considered in relation to the choice for value capturing. It is recommended that the Dutch government takes action to empower local public bodies to be able to apply value capture instruments by taking away legal risks. Timing, scale and governance are seen as key factors for local public bodies to be able to succeed in capturing value.","Alternative funding; Value capturing; Infrastructure funding; Randstadrail; Integrated development","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","",""

This sudden increase in wealth is causing urban developments and strong inequalities across different scales. Furthermore, it is causing friction between indigenous Sámi and non-indigenous worldviews, sustained within the culturally fragile county of Finnmark. The role of the Norwegian state is notably dubious - both historically and presently – by instating policies aimed at development through a modern lens and wealth from oil and gas extraction – especially in the city of Hammerfest. The fixation of space through this concept is disinheriting indigenous people as well as the climate, landscape and socio-economic state of Finnmark. Reindeer herders have a different conceptualization of time and space, accumulated through centuries of observation and adaptions to the seasonal cycles, and is highly dependent on the flexibility for their herds. Conflicts arise due to increasing urbanization impeding Sámi movement, creating a socio-territorial paradox. Strong uncertainties arise: will the oil and gas industry continue as planned by the Norwegian state? How does this relate to the vulnerable path-dependent relationship with the fossil industry in the future? Will development on the mainland further impede the ability of traditional practices? Through an understanding of different temporalities within urban planning and indigenous herding knowledge, the argument of the thesis unfolds over an in-depth spatiotemporal and on-site analysis of the island of Kvaløya. I argue that the triangulation of spatial modeling, research by design, cinematographic strategies and the integration of indigenous knowledge can help in improving the agency of mapping. I argue that the we should look more critically at the role of the modus operandi of urbanists and decision-makers, in their capacity of influencing and shaping the conceptual framework on which decision making is based, especially in the highly uncertain and contested territories. The thesis then moves towards a possible way forward by integrating the (indigenous) knowledge into scenario construction through transtemporal and transscalar mapping and 3d modelling. I end by arguing that the incorporation of both practical and conceptual knowledge of the territory and the ability to share and communicate this knowledge between academics, practitioners and stakeholders is critical to confront this uncertainty. The flexible and adaptive knowledge of indigenous people could therefore help into planning and decision-making processes. This will help to foster trust and build consensus among indigenous and non-indigenous participants for future decision-making. Ultimately it is a tool for (co-)creating awareness, action and allowing space for Sámi agency.","Territorialization; Indigeneity; Finnmark; Arctic Norway; Socio-territorial conflicts; Hammerfest; Temporality; Scenarios; Oil industry; Sámi reindeer herders","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Urbanism","Transitional Territories","70.663482, 23.682242"

This thesis describes one of the three subsystems of the SPPE, namely the Ultraviolet Germicidal Irradiation (UVGI). The UVGI subsystem provides the SPPE with an in situ disinfection system, in order to prolong the period in which the filters of the SPPE can be used to at least 8 hours. The UVGI is implemented by the use of UV LEDs. This implementation is done in two steps. Step one is a simulation which allows for the optimization of the LED placement depending on a multitude of parameters, including: distance between the LEDs and the filter, and the LED tilt angle. The second step is the design of a driver circuit, to allow for the adjustment of the dose applied by the LEDs. The simulation resulted in an LED array which offers the most optimal irradiation of the filter surface. The driver circuit has been designed, simulated to verify its functionality, and implemented in the form of a PCB design. The UVGI subsystem provides the SPPE with an in situ disinfection system by delivering a base dose of 305 mJ/cm2 and a driver circuit which allows for adjusting this dose, should this be desired. The UVGI subsystem should be able to extend the period in which the filters of the SPPE can be used to at least 8 hours.

In the project, a filter module with an in-situ ultraviolet-sterilization technique is designed that can serve as a new kind of smart personal protective equipment (SPPE). This technique is not used in wearable devices as of yet. The project thus aims to take the next step into the future of facemasks. The complete SPPE design is split into three submodules. In this thesis, the Sensing and Control submodule is designed. The Sensing and Control submodule is divided into three parts as well. In the first part of the design, a negative feedback control loop is developed. A photodiode transimpedance amplifier circuit provides the feedback, and the controller is programmed on a microcontroller. The control parameters are derived from a model in Simulink. In the second part of the design, the temperature and relative humidity are measured to transform the control loop’s reference value into a reference function. In the third part of the design, an estimation of the filter state of health is made by measuring the pressure drop over the filter material. Additionally, the airflow in the SPPE is calculated using equations from fluid mechanics to set the maximum allowable pressure drop. At the end of the thesis, the Sensing and Control submodule allows the SPPE to measure environmental conditions, control the ultraviolet intensity accordingly, and indicate if the filter requires replacement. The design is finalized with printed circuit board designs and an algorithm. With the design of the Sensing and Control submodule, the next step is taken towards the future of face masks.","SPPE; Sensing; Control system; Face mask; UVC; Sensing and Control; LED; COVID-19; Virus; Smart Personal Protective Equipment; PPE; In-situ ultraviolet-sterilization","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering","SPPE",""

Inhabiting is also creative: it is the activity in which a space, to a certain extend, is always re-created. The question then is how to see architecture as a generous and participating support for relations. A support hat is involved in life, not neutral but partaking; for relations to ourselves and our inner lives, to each other, and to our environments. Spaces that are generous and open to life. The site of the architectural investigation is one room in an existing building in Groningen that houses 15 people. This situates the project in a place and time as it joins in their ongoing life.

It is expected that in the coming years the construction industry will benefit from the free and lightweight forms that can be fabricated and the possible material savings. A few experimental results of 3D printed stainless steel are published, while no data is available on the material properties of wire and arc additively manufactured (WAAM) low carbon steel nor on specific connections. Carbon steel is widely applied in the construction industry and is less expensive, compared to other types of steel, as stainless, which was investigated for WAAM in other studies, at the TU Delft and abroad. Therefore, WAAM low carbon steel plates with thicknesses of 3 and 6 mm, produced by the company MX3D, were investigated thoroughly in this research. Tensile coupon tests were performed to determine the strength, stiffness and ultimate strain. The surface roughness, effective thickness and the influence of the thickness and the printing direction on the material properties were investigated by experiments and an evaluation of 3D scanning and Digital Image Correlation (DIC). The Archimedes’ principle was used to establish an effective thickness. The experiments were conceived to predict the tear-out failure behaviour of 3D printed plates. This is one of the basic failure modes in bolted connections. The conducted experiments provide the necessary evidence for the behaviour of single bolts and pins that interact with the WAAM material. A design formula for bolted and pinned connections is proposed based on experimental results. The results of the tensile and tear-out tests were compared with conventionally produced carbon steel and existing findings on WAAM stainless steel. The influence of the end distance of a double lap bolted connection is evaluated by comparing the experimental results with the existing standards and studies on rolled carbon steel. This research was performed to assess the applicability of current design standards for conventionally produced carbon steel to WAAM low carbon steel connections. The reliability of this method was checked by a statistical analysis. A new design factor for the tear-out strength of single bolts and pins in a WAAM low carbon steel plate is recommended. This factor reduces the design resistance of a tear-out connection and includes the ultimate tensile strength of the WAAM low carbon steel, the end distance, effective thickness of the plate and printing direction, compared to the applied force. The reduction factors that originate from the effective thickness determination and that reduce the ultimate tensile strength due to the surface roughness effect have to be incorporated for WAAM material as well. The starting hypothesis was confirmed by the investigation and following is concluded: WAAM carbon steel is a suitable material for structural applications, due to its lower costs and higher stiffness compared to the stainless steel alternatives. The experimental results of this research are meant to be used for design purposes and as input for Finite Element Modelling, so the resistance of more complex geometries can be studied accordingly. It is expected that with topology optimisation (TO) of connections, considering the printing direction, and the consequential material efficiency, full potential of 3D printing can be yielded for the manufacturing of structural parts.","Structures; Carbon steel; 3D printing; Wire and arc Additive Manufacturing; WAAM; Experimental; End distance; Tear-out; Shear; 3D scanning; Digital Image Correlation; Design; Tensile tests; Material properties; Bolted connection; Pinned connection; Double lap joint; Failure behaviour; Welding","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering","",""

A BGP monitor checks whether the local route is correct by comparing the local route to the route from hundreds of devices. The lower the percentage of the routes that are the same, the bigger the chance there is a route leak. Hence, a user can tell whether a hacker manipulated the route.

Urban growth, in combination with rapid climate change and the neglect of ecological processes, has had severe negative effects on the environment. Therefore, improving the quality of life in urban environments and transforming them into resilient cities has never been more relevant. At the same time, as current practices of urban development are failing to cope with the existing conditions, new opportunities are occurring. One of these opportunities are the unused and forgotten areas generated by urban growth that occupy large parts of the urban web. Despite their derelict appearance, these spaces provide a haven for spontaneous vegetation - the (so called) Third spaces. The Third space is a concept forged by the theories of Ignasi de Solà-Morales and Gilles Clément and refers to all types of places that constitute a territory of refuge for biological diversity. As a result of their abandonment, the Third spaces evolve into secondary landscapes that are colonized by pioneer species and perform ecological services. With Athens as the context of the proposal, this thesis aims to explore the potentialities of the Third spaces in the new processes of urbanization and re-envision their role as support for new ecological, morphological and cultural interrelations within the urban landscape. In order to do that, the area of Eleonas is chosen for intervention, as a characteristic example of an agglomeration of Third spaces among the post-industrial remnants and empty spaces found in the heart of Athens metropolitan area.","Third spaces; urban transformation; resilient environments; ruderal landscapes; ruderal refugia","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Landscape Architecture","",""

Several main questions raised during the study process: What are the causes of the regional resource crisis? What’s the ideological expression of the water infrastructures to Manhattanites? How to ease the climate- induced crisis, or even to end up the emergency by architectural interventions? Within these questions in mind, the main research question is formed: How can the architecture, concerning climatic crisis, cultural loss, evoke a more livable and healthier community for NE Midtown’s future development?","water pollution; human health; sustainability; Midtown Manhattan","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Complex Projects","Complex projects","73.9712, 40.7128"

To counteract the problematisation an adaptive planning framework is proposed linking urban morphology, governance capacities and socio-ecological systems as a way to approach vulnerable areas in the metropolis from a local perspective aiming for a collaborative and evolutionary process. Several areas with the potential to become sub-centers are defined in the territory in order to become strategic locations where endogenous development is possible creating opportunities capable of overcoming segregation and fragmentation by means of enhanced economic and community activities. The research recognises five main principles (systemic goals) which through spatial actions that act in a muldimensional level (scale, time and actors) stress capacities for adaptation embedded in the selected locations. Seemingly, potentials for connectedness and activation from a bottom-up perspective are revealed through exploration by design implementing a scenario construction departing from two levels of participation between stakeholders (high and low) and a further evaluation phase through pathways that inform possibilities and limitations of the strategies taken during the evolutionary process. This research allows to conclude that interests and their alignment with different actors, local capacities and operability of the actions taken are directly proportional to the transformation capacities and the effectiveness of the goals proposed by the adaptive framework.","Adaptive Planning and Design; Urban Morphology; Socio-Ecological System; Spatial Justice; Endogenous development","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Complex Cities","","19.510369, -98.964154"

The city hall is a place where citizens could equally and freely assemble to engage with each other and the politics, rather than only be an exclusive administrative center. In the profound history, a great amount of civic centers represented by Palazzo della Ragione defined this typology, with small spaces on the ground and big exclusive hall for higher classes on the top, whose influence could still be found in many city halls nowadays. Nevertheless, this model is no longer fitting the contemporary democratic mechanism. In this case, my principle ambition is to reverse the model and return the public resources to the citizens. Based on it, my objective would focus on how to make the space open to public without losing the basic functions of a city hall. However, this arrangement could also become normal if the relationship between the ground and the upper floors are not tight. So certain attention should also be paid to connect the ground and upper floors together, spatially and functionally. II Representative Character<br/>In Brussles City, the network of public is existed in the urban situation and citizens’ daily life, through the passages, libraries, stations and some other halls. Those public spaces are just like the jewelries on a necklace, and designing the new city hall could be seen as adding a new piece of gem on this necklace, which emphasize the representative characters of it. In contemporary context, the city halls are gradually losing their characters as a representative center for citizens celebrating their urban life, which could be evidenced by the gigantic office buildings in EU Quarter. By adding this representative ‘new piece’, my proposal is to create the public interiors which has the comparable spatial quality provided to the citizens on one hand, establish the exterior character through designing the façade and exterior spaces on the other hand. Of course the materiality and appearance would also considered in the next stage. <br/>III Structure and Activities The structure is always related to the shape or the scale of space, where all the activities happen. Through the study of office plan typologies, I choose to investigate on three scale of plan typologies, which is S,M,L. In this case, the structure is also following the demand of the space to stretch its span like a tree. Three different scales of structure combined together as a tree scheme to go through the whole building. During the next stage, on the outer aspect, how this structure reflects on the urban context should counted into consideration, and on the inner aspect, how the structure system influences all the spaces inside the building is also my objective.","city hall","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Interiors Buildings Cities","",""

This project is a part of Shared Heritage Lab studio that focuses on Semarang historical area, Indonesia, the former city center during Dutch colonialization period in Indonesia.<br/> <br/>Through heritage and socio-cultural approaches, the project utilizes heritage as a tool towards sustainable socio-economy and environment with community being the center of the driving force. The project incorporates colonial heritage that has been left disconnected, decayed, and deteriorated as a part of local community’s everyday practices. It transforms NV Cultuurmaatshappij der Vorstenlanden, a former agricultural trading office that was linked to the forced labor system into a co-operative (koperasi) office that integrates, manages, and educates the surrounding community’s informal trading as well as introducing permaculture production to the city.<br/> <br/>The project implements improved traditions as the design strategy. Close-readings of the existing architecture fabrics and the community’s spatial culture result in three types of interventions that consider the reciprocity between the old and the new: 1. Preservation of the high-valued entrance, with subtle changes to establish the building’s connection to the public realm. It is done by inserting elements without damaging the existing fabrics. 2. Interlocking the office’s upper structure with local crafts and communal spatial configuration to reverse the existing segregated spaces, 3. Adding a socio-production pod that introduces permaculture practices and connecting the site’s courtyard to the immediate surroundings.<br/> <br/>On the city scale, the co-operative is connected to the urban interventions, in which river, train, and three-wheeler bike (becak) are reactivated as environmental-friendly transportations for trade. The urban interventions also include the revitalization of storage and production land to support the trading and production activities.<br/> <br/>By reintroducing familiar elements as a new layer of the existing, the project intends to let the community appropriate the shared-heritage by themselves while nurturing a sense of belonging and keeping the memory of the past. The project also contextualizes the building that was built for and designed by the Dutch in Indonesia’s social and natural environment contexts as the future embodiment of shared-heritage.","Shared Heritage; Heritage & Architecture; Adaptive Reuse; Colonial Heritage; Spatial Culture; Community’s Practice; Ethnography; Semarang, Indonesia","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Heritage & Architecture","Shared Heritage Lab","-6.969105, 110.425703"

(mentor); Crielaard, R. (graduation committee); Coenders, Jeroen (graduation committee); Cox, Simon (graduation committee); Houben, L.J.M. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","In the design of steel structures, optimisation methods promise cheap, light and sustainable structures. However, the resulting designs tend to have a high diversity of profiles, making them unbuildable. Furthermore, the optimisation problem is mathematically complex, leading to a long and potentially unsolvable optimisation process. Grouping methods solve both issues by finding the optimum solution, for which the number of distinct profiles is limited. Multiple grouping methods exist in literature, and it is not known which is the best: the methods have not been applied on the same problems, and the computational effort has not been compared. This gap in literature leads to the following question: “Which method for grouping can find the lightest and cheapest steel structure with minimal computational effort?” To answer this question, a comparison of the existing grouping methods is made on their theoretical and numerical performance. The theoretical comparison comprises the size and properties of the search space, and the number of additional calculations. The numerical comparison consists of weight optimisation of eight benchmark problems. For each structure and method, the weight of the solution and corresponding computational effort is evaluated. Manually grouping of members, which is the most popular grouping method, relies on the engineer’s expertise and rules of thumb. This method requires no additional calculations but in general fails to find the optimum grouping for a light or cheap structure. Other existing methods include the geometry, axial force distribution or an ungrouped result in their grouping process, or adapt the optimisation problem. Of these methods, only the cardinality constraints method is guaranteed to potentially find the lightest grouped design, while reducing the search space for a small number of groups. However, it creates many local optima, which increases the complexity of the search space. In the aim of finding a grouping method which creates a simple and small search space and has low computational effort, the fully stressed combinatorial search method is proposed. In this method, the grouping is found by a combinatorial search, which evaluates the estimated weight or costs of a restricted set of groupings based on the weight per unit length of the members of a fully stressed design. Then, optimisation of a small and simple search space finds the corresponding optimum profiles. These steps are repeated, in which the fully stressed design uses the result of the previous optimisation as its reference design. The loop repeats until the grouping is unchanged, or the result diverges. In all numerical experiments, the new method gave results with a low weight, while it kept the computational effort to an acceptable level. It gave the lightest design for four out of eight problems and showed high certainty for converging to the lightest design in two problems. For the other two problems it performed second best. Conclusively, this method is the best available grouping method for steel structural optimisation. In case of cost optimisation, the new grouping method can efficiently find the optimum design including the optimum number of groups; the new method converges to cheaper design with less computations than in the case no grouping is applied. For a real-life case-study, the costs of a design were reduced with 7.3% compared to a manually grouped design and with 19.6% compared to the conventional design process. I suggest that further research focusses on further development of the new grouping method as proposed improvements can be made on the initial design, and the number of computations in the combinatorial search and fully stressed design. Moreover, the effectiveness of a suggested simplification of the new method should be investigated. This would allow application for engineers who are not able to apply a mathematical optimisation method. For practical application, incorporation of building codes and cost functions with a well-defined scope are desired. Finally, utilisation of the grouping methods in other applications is possible, but the performance of the methods should be evaluated per application.","Grouping methods; Structural optimization; steel structures; Diversity; Principle of commonality","en","master thesis","","","","","","Related dataset 4TU.ResearchData http://doi.org/10.4121/uuid:4e32b29f-6647-4a36-9ea1-8931c88f8864","","","","","","","",""

(mentor); den Heijer, A.C. (mentor); van de Voort, J.A. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","Historical campuses enabled post-Age of Enlightenment organizations’ operations and allowed them to adapt with times, supporting their processes of adaptive reuse transformation throughout the institutions’ recursive managerial cycles. However, the radical reforms which concerned these organizations since the second half of the 20th century, disabled those mechanics and instated a diffuse phenomenon of dismissal of their historic campuses, instating processes of abandon, demolition, degradation or degeneration and entailing the steady loss of their architectural, urban, functional, economic, historic and socio-cultural values.In the perspective of re-enabling, promoting and fostering fully-sustainable adaptive reuse transformations of the heritage to avoid the value losses, this research recognizes the lack of integration between the intervention domains participating in adaptive reuse operations as the main cause of the phenomenon. Specifically, it points to the impossibility for organizations to inform, support and assess such cross-domain broad-spectrum transformations following the serial structure of current adaptive reuse operational models.<br/>Once observed the specific managerial, entrepreneurial and architectural characters of such transformations, the research focuses on the analysis of their processes and procedures in order to define the extents up to which they can be integrated and synchronized. This results in a parallelly-structured operational model in which the coherent processes of the three intervention domains are executed synchronously throughout the identified procedural and operational phases. These phases are then consolidated by defining the conduction tools available to the process managers (and to the ones of each individual domain), the nature and the relevance of the information transfer among the processes within a same procedural phase and/or the previous/next one and finally the reciprocal contributions of each domains in respect to the others. <br/>The research then focuses on the theoretical validation of the proposed alternative operational model for adaptive reuse transformation of defunctionalized historic campuses. A comparative analysis reveals an increased ability of adaptive reuse operations conducted through the integrated operational model to consistently address the interests of the involved stakeholders and to be backed by major support networks. Additionally, it shows their higher aptitude in managing the risks inherently related to the operations by allowing its incremental phasing, which provides an otherwise absent degree of tolerance for ambiguity and proofs them from the excessive hindrance represented by intrinsic and extrinsic transformation factors. The integrated operational model also prompts to more fully sustainable transformations thanks to the coexistence of the control processes pertaining to each intervention domain. Overall, the proposed model better allows to restore, preserve and enhance the architectural, urban, functional, economic, historic and socio-cultural values of the dismissed historic campuses rather than the current ones. To achieve these performance increases, however, it relies on the presence of a favorable stakeholder environment at the local, regional and possibly national scale, whose involvement in the entire transformation process requires their availability for greater time and effort investments. Due to these requirements, the inclusion in the intervention program of elements such as a flagship project-orientation, the reliance on triple, quadruple and quintuple helix innovation models and the constitution of public-private partnerships should be strongly considered to facilitate the transformation process.","campus; campus management; campus development; archtectural heritage transformation; adaptive reuse; entrepreneurship; transformation viability; value; full sustainability; operational model; integration; real estate performance; process management; project management","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Explorelab","","44.350629, 11.706854"

(mentor); Knop, Tobias (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","The demand of small payload launch vehicles has been growing over the past years. Customers base their selection of launch vehicles on cost-effectiveness, flexibility, availability and reliability. A new launch vehicle, the Dawn Aerospace Mk-III, is proposed to be developed, while designed to take into account all these criteria.<br/><br/>For flexible and frequently available operations the launch trajectory is integrated in the common airspace. Manoeuvrability is identified as a key capability for safe operations in the common airspace. For high manoeuvrability the first stage is designed as a rocket propelled airplane, a so-called 'spaceplane'. The expendable upper stage is stored internally. After payload injection the first stage returns to the spaceport of take-off. This means the System is a Two Stage to Orbit semi-Reusable Launch Vehicle integrated in the common airspace.<br/><br/>Cost-effectiveness is a primary selection criterium in the decision making of customers, which is why cost is included from an early stage in the development. This study shows that for identifying the cost gradient in the design space the total dry mass of the vehicle is sufficient. In this way cost optimality is included, although the Cost per Flight cannot be determined. What is determined is the effect of different technical and operational considerations. Taking into account qualitative cost differences, a selection of cost derived mission scenarios are studied. This includes different Return to Launch Site methods, first stage engine design and lay-out, the prohibition of fairing usage and integrated landing gear for take-off and landing.<br/><br/>To analyse and optimize the different designs a Multidisciplinary Design Optimization tool is developed. This tool optimizes the vehicle and the ascent trajectory simultaneously to determine the lowest total dry mass solution meeting all requirements and constraints. To estimate the aerodynamic performance of the first stage the X-34 Advanced Technology Demonstrator is used as a reference vehicle. This means the geometry of the first stage is not optimized, while the size is. The upper stage is modelled as a conventional upper stage, of which the size and geometry is optimized.<br/><br/>The study shows that the proposed design is feasible, meeting all requirements and constraints. The result is a vehicle with a total dry mass of 6273.0 kg, Gross Take-Off Weight of 42972.8 kg and a first stage length of 19.4 m. Of the total dry mass 94.5% is reusable. The return of the first stage is driving the trajectory design, as a steep ascent trajectory is required for limiting the downrange of the first stage. This results in 30%-50% more gravity loss in the System, which demands for a high ΔV performance. Due to the size of the first stage and the propellant required for returning, the first stage ascent ΔV is limited. For that reason, the upper stage design has a Propellant Mass Fraction of 0.939, increasing the upper stage ascent ΔV performance. Achieving such a Propellant Mass Fraction is possible, but challenging. The upper stage design is identified as a key element in the System performance for successfully meeting all mission requirements.<br/><br/>Three different Return to Launch Site methods are compared. Two methods, in-plane pitch over and aeroturn, are active which requires return propellant. The third method, glideback, is passive. The study shows that glideback can be favourable. The total dry mass increase is 4.4% when compared to in-plane pitch over. The increase in heat load is ~16%, but the heat load in this study is limited with a total heat load of ~2.0 MJ/m^2. However, for glideback an even higher upper stage Propellant Mass Fraction of 0.946 is required. This means that the result of the upper stage design determines if this return method is feasible.<br/><br/>Using a shared engine design on the first and upper stage shows promising results. Using a single first stage engine reduces the first stage dry mass by 4.0%. However, using a shared engine design is expected to decrease the development cost drastically, due to the reduced size of individual engines. The prohibition of fairing usage shows a stronger effect on the result. Allowing the use of a fairing decreases the first stage dry mass by a maximum of 9.6%. Fairing usage on the other hand harms the safe operations in the common airspace as the ejection of uncontrolled material requires large safety zones. The penalty on mass is acceptable for allowing integration in the common airspace. A landing gear sized for take-off results in a heavier vehicle. When the first stage is supported by a cart during take-off the first stage dry mass is decreased by 24.6%. When the first stage is air-launched the first stage dry mass decreases by 33.3%.<br","Spaceplane; semi-Reusable Launch Vehicle; Return To Launch Site; Cost derived mission scenarios; Common airspace; Multidisciplinary Design Optimization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-07-02","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Hence, the judicial use of water must be coupled with water reuse to counteract the water depletion. To reuse water, we eye on available treatment technologies which can guide us to circular use and reuse of water and nutrients. Anaerobic digestion, is known for producing better quality effluent with a possibility of energy generation through biogas. It can also be coupled with post-treatment techniques to extract nutrients. Anaerobic membrane bioreactors have been used to treat high-strength wastewater to obtain higher particle and organic removal. Introducing limited aeration to such an anaerobic environments have been studied earlier to enhance the degradation process. Depending on the quantity of aeration added and the mechanism of aeration, studies have reported both positive and negative effects on the organic degradation. The existing studies only cover the effects of the applied aeration on the Anaerobic Digestion process. Little is talked about its effect on the sludge characteristics such as particle size and sludge rheology. This research focuses on studying the effect of applied aeration on the AnMBR performance, based on the effect of aeration on substrate degradation and on sludge characteristics. To study this, an AnMBR is operated with laboratory-made synthetic blackwater treating 5gCOD/l. A 2% increase in oxygen with respect to the sludge VSS is introduced through added air. The effect of this added aeration to the system is studied. The organic removal was enhanced by 11% when compared to the observed removal during the non-aerated phase. Ammonium concentration increased by 24% and sulphate concentration reduced by 12% in the effluent. The size of the coarser fraction of sludge, D90 increased by 13% and that of the finer fraction D10 increased by 15%. The viscosity profile of the sludge after aeration also increased. Inhibition caused to the Methanogenic activity of the sludge reduced as the sludge started adapting to the applied aeration. Activity changes to higher sets of aeration matching that of a Dissolved Aeration and Flotation system was studied. The feasibility of such a system is still a work in progress for the future. The obtained results are for an adapting sludge, and has to be continued for a better adapted sludge. Recommendations based on this study to future works on the same line, is given.","Anaerobic Digestion; AnMBR; Limited Aeation; Sludge Rheology","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-08-01","","","","Civil Engineering | Environmental Engineering","",""

The light rail project is a part of a transportation infrastructure upgrade that came as a response to the city’s urban sprawl and its heavy traffic problem. These two processes seem to be of a contradictive nature: one is of absolute separation and segregation, and the other is of interconnection and integration. The truth, as always, is more complex, and these two processes are deeply rooted in the colonization of the city. This thesis researches the relations between urban planning and the process of colonization, and, in particular, the role of transportation infrastructure in manifesting colonization patterns in the urban space in the city of Jerusalem. It analyzes the dynamics that influence urban planning in a divided city that is subjected to urban conflict and examines the problems, urban damage, and social injustice that are caused by it. The design part of this thesis explores the potential of urban planning and design as a means of a decolonization and reconciliation process and proposes a transition to a transit-oriented development framework to support it. From the understanding of the powerful role that transportation infrastructure plays in the colonization and segregation of the city, the main research question of this thesis is: How could Transit-Oriented Development (TOD) serve as an instrument for decolonization and inclusion in Jerusalem? To answer this question, this thesis takes the approach of alternative planning – grounded on the existing spatial and social conditions of the city while exploring alternative urban planning and design given a different political framework. This approach enables a critical debate about existing narratives and assumptions, stimulates discussion, and imagines a different future beyond existing political constraints. The design part of the thesis consists of three levels: Strategic planning, in the form of a city-scale urban vision that explores a transit-oriented development framework to the city as a means for decolonization. Governance design, exploring implementation strategies and governance transformation to support the urban vision and implement it on the local scale. Urban design: Two key projects on a local scale are designed in important nodes of the urban vision. The design of the key projects examines the implications of the urban vision on the local scale and explores the potentials of decolonization on the urban form and public space.","Divided Cities; Urban Conflict; Transit-Oriented Development; Decolonization; Israeli-Palestinian conflict","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Complex Cities","Planning Complex Cities","31.771959, 35.217018"

Various alternative interlayers are examined, as well as the effect their unique material properties have on the potential application of the interlocking system. The whole process, from fabrication to construction of the entire assembly, based on a chosen case study, is presented in a chain reaction manner, whose starting point is the interlayer itself. Cast glass presents significant geometrical and strength advantages over float glass, but the extended annealing times are discouraging, which is why using smaller elements, cast glass blocks is often preferred. In this research, the glass blocks are interlocking instead of rectangular, to ensure the structural stability of the system in the two planar directions. For the system to be applicable, a suitable interlayer needs to be placed among the glass components is needed, to prevent early failure due to concentrated stresses. After defining the desired design criteria of the interlayer, a list of candidates is proposed. The considerations for the fabrication of the unique glass block geometry and the various interlayer candidates are examined. For the detailing of the system, a residential building in Amsterdam has been chosen as a case study, which currently employs hollow glass blocks. All five proposed interlayers are considered during the detailing phase, which results in the proposal of two distinct assembly sequences, based on the material properties.

This project, called Synthetic Waste Generator (SWaG) can create synthetic waste data through the use of Blender and Python. Moreover, this project makes a contribution to the current state of research by having developed an automated synthetic data generation pipeline. This synthetic data can be used to train CV solutions to enable automated recycling procedures. With the help of adjustable parameters, the synthetic data can be customized, such that different unique images of waste can be created deterministically based on a seed. Furthermore, SWaG is fully portable as it has been containerized using Docker which makes it extremely easy to obtain even faster results by running SWaG on an NVIDIA GPU enabled system as a single local container, on the cloud as a farm or incorporate it in a container-orchestration system such as Kubernetes. SWaG also crushes 3D models, to mimic real waste using soft body dynamics. The pipeline has also been suited to automatically generate COCO datasets by using masking and image segmentation techniques. SWaG can also add textures and different colors to the waste objects in the synthetically created image. Furthermore, with SWaG different conveyor belt setups at recycling plants can be simulated with the help of variable camera heights, conveyor belts, backgrounds and lighting conditions. SWaG is currently deployable and is being used and built upon by our client. After conducting empirical research experiments with SWaG, it is noted that its performance speed is linear as the amount of objects that are in a given scene increases. In fact, with between roughly 40 and 80 objects SWaG performs sub-linearly.

The research methodology consisted of an experimental and a computational part. Galvanostatic EC experiments were conducted in an aerated beaker with 500 mL working volume, using iron electrodes with a surface area of 8 cm2. The pH, voltage and current were measured continuously for 50 minutes. Blank measurements were conducted in a 2 g/L NaCl solution. PFAS removal was tested from 0.25 mmol/L perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) solutions at current densities of 12.5 and 25 mA/cm2, as well as from solutions with a commercial humic acid (HA) source added at 25 mA/cm2. The removal of HA was also tested separately. Eventually, the removal from real leachate samples was examined. A computer model was constructed in PHREEQC (pH Redox Equilibrium Calculation), a program for modelling chemical processes in water. The model simulates the removal of all tested pollutants based on electrostatic adsorption to a continuously forming surface, associated with the precipitating ferrihydrite. Model rate constants for O2 and CO2 dissolution and Fe(II) oxidation were determined from the results of the blank experiments. Good model fits were obtained for these datasets. HA could be removed completely within 50 minutes at all tested current densities and initial concentrations. PFOA removal was unsuccessful with and without HA as co-solute, with a maximum removal of 17 %. PFOS removal reached 81 % at 25 mA/cm2, but the removal essentially stagnated after 5 minutes treatment time. The presence of HA did not significantly affect the PFOS removal. Instead, HA removal was retarded by the presence of PFOS. For the real leachate samples, no significant removal of PFAS occurred. Conversely, approximately 20 % PFAS removal was observed after 5 minutes treatment of a leachate sample spiked with 0.15 mmol/L PFOA, perfluorobutane sulfonic acid (PFBS) and perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA). However, this removal reversed during the remaining treatment time. The adsorption equilibrium constants were the most important model parameters. These parameters were determined for HA, PFOA and PFOS based on the experimental data. The model fits were good for HA and PFOA removal, indicating that these were indeed mainly removed by electrostatic adsorption. Contrarily, PFOS removal could not be represented accurately by the current model. Instead of stagnating after five minutes, the simulated removal continued to completion. The poor model fit may indicate that the mechanism of PFOS removal extends beyond strict electrostatic adsorption. Instead, charge neutralization of PFOS molecules causing their aggregation or mass transfer limitations in the vicinity of the electrodes could be involved. Further research is needed to explore these possibilities and determine improved equilibrium constants for the relevant adsorption reactions. In conclusion, this research did not confirm the high PFAS removal efficiency as observed in previous studies. Instead, significant removal of PFOA did not occur and removal of PFOS did not exceed 81 %. Competition effects were not observed in the simultaneous treatment of PFOA and HA. The presence of PFOS impeded the removal of HA, indicating that PFOS was removed preferentially under the current experimental conditions. The established model could simulate most experimental results accurately.","PFAS; Electrocoagulation; PHREEQC; Humic substances","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Water Management","",""

Moreover, the demand for glass buildings is rising (Eskilson, 2018). As designers look to make the buildings as transparent as possible, the ambition is to execute structural elements out of glass too. Glass has always been perceived as luxurious and through history has been associated with knowledge, modernity, quality engineering and technological progression. Additionally, glass architecture has always been a signifier of public identity (Eskilson, 2018). These characteristics are still true for modern glass buildings, which is part of people’s fascination with them. In the foreseeable future, to be able to keep captivating people the ‘marvels’ for the average urban viewer should be greater and kept fresh. This is why more variety should be added to the architectural expression while the current characteristics of glass elements should be kept or even enhanced. Another reason for adding new elements to the toolkit is to simultaeniously keep up with building requirements like safety and sustainability. Combined this is why the toolkit for architectural glass needs to be expanded upon to be able to keep up with future building requirements and expectations. A structural element would be a promising addition to the current toolkit because of the already great variety of non-structural elements and the ambition to make more structures transparent. A section-active structural glass element would be a promising addition to the current toolkit because these structural elements are implemented especially often and there is a lack of variety here specifically. To design this section active structural glass element from extruded glass would be promising because the extrusion process allows for complex geometry beneficial to the aesthetic experience and also the structural performance. Another benefit of this process would be that the borosilicate glass used for this is much more fire resistant than the glass used for structural fins (O’Regan, 2015). The research question thus is: what is the potential of section-active extruded glass structural elements for architectural design? To answer this question a design vocabulary is set out in three different design aspects: system, section, and connection. After designing principle solutions the best option is chosen through assessments. The assessment of all parts of the design at all stages will be done following the same criteria. For the criteria a wide perspective was chosen that includes the entire cycle of the element’s lifetime: safety, structural performance, building sequence, sustainability, costs, and aesthetics. After assessments, it is decided on a system comprising of individual post-tensioned segments of elliptical shaped glass section with steel cast connections, bolted together on site. The system is designed as modular, re-usable and recyclable. This draft design is dimensioned through hand calculations and numerical simulations in finite element analysis software. To evaluate the potential of the dimensioned system for implementation in architecture, it is compared to the glass fin which is its only direct competitor. In order to offer a fair comparison the same façade is designed with both systems. The conclusion of this comparison is that the designed system has a promising potential for architectural implementation with regards to structural performance, safety, building sequence, sustainability, and aesthetics. Obviously additional physical testing is needed to affirm estimations and more research has to be done should it be developed to a market-ready product. The exact costs are unclear too as no equipment exists at this point to produce the extruded glass segments in the required dimensions. The tooling costs will be high but the material costs are low, making it especially viable when mass-produced as products with standard dimensions. Summarizing the comparison the first indications and explorations necessitate to think positively towards the possibilities of such an extruded system for architecture.","structural glass; Glass structures; extruded glass; glass architecture; section active glass systems; Glass Beams; Tubular Columns","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Building Technology | Sustainable Design","",""

Therefore, there is a growing concern about diverse urban problems, such as climate change, emissions, congestion and the quality of life in cities. Hereby, urban mobility systems can be an important factor to solve these problems. Besides, new developments in ICT, the adaptation of smartphones, the increasing availability of data and are changing current mobility systems in cities by creating new possibilities for the application of smart solutions. An example of these new smart solutions is new shared mobility services. New shared mobility services (.e.g. car sharing, ride-hailing and bike-sharing, etc) are technology-based, on-demand and provide alternatives to traditional transport models. These services are seen as an opportunity for more sustainable transport in the city and to address equity in transportation. But without thoughtful planning, there is no guarantee this will happen. Moreover, giving the fact that virtual mobility is growing by the enhancement of ICT and will potentially be a replacement for physical mobility these shared mobility services can bring new equity barriers and opportunities for disadvantaged neighbourhoods. This research will focus on shared mobility services in the context of Rotterdam-South. The area of Rotterdam-South is an urban renewal area, which is struggling with large concentration socio-economic problems. Besides, studies have shown that the inhabitants of Rotterdam-South are the least mobile and suffer from transportation poverty, causing them to come across more barriers to the accessibility of various services and opportunities. Based on the defined problem, the following main research question is formulated for this research: “In what way can public parties use shared mobility services to stimulate urban neighbourhood renewal in Rotterdam-South?”. To answer the main research question it was decided that a qualitative approach would be appropriate. The qualitative method includes the review of literature, interviews with advisors, the municipality and providers of shared mobility service in combination with a case study of the neighbourhood Tarwewijk, which is located in Rotterdam-South. From the results, it can be concluded that by the implementation of shared mobility services in a disadvantaged neighbourhood, public parties can positively affect and stimulate two aspects of urban renewal. These are the social and environmental conditions of a neighbourhood. Although the implementation of shared mobilities can offer opportunities for urban renewal areas, it can also bring several barriers and challenges. So, before implementing shared mobility services to stimulate urban renewal, public parties must consider how to implement policies/strategies. This to ensure that the barriers to using these shared mobilities are eliminated. Hereby, this research has suggested several policies and strategies for public parties.","Smart Mobility; Shared mobility services; Urban renewal; Public parties; Service providers; Disadvantaged neighbourhoods; Rotterdam-South","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Management in the Built Environment","",""

Through my theoretical research based on various literature and case studies, including that of Baroque Rome and Paris, it is evident that axes bear certain characteristics and influences especially in shaping perspective and facilitating movement. It appears that pertaining to visual perspective, axes bear influence in one or more of the following ways: 1) Centrifugal perspective, 2) Contained perspective, and 3) Centripetal perspective. Importantly, it shapes the ways a city is viewed and symbolically perceived, and is an important architectural tool for the planning of a city. Upon closer inspection of the topic, the study of the perspective in the axis presents and interface with the field of scenography. The research into the theory, phenomenon, and historical understanding of the perspective will bring about new information in the project. In the city of Tashkent, Uzbekistan, the invasion of the Tsarist government resulted in the intrusion of Western ideologies into a predominantly Asian city. One of the prominent interventions was the presence of clear axis. However, through fieldwork and in observing the urban fabric of Tashkent, it appears that the axes largely deviate from how axes commonly are like in previous case studies. While other case studies reflect the ways axis shape perspective as mentioned above, many axes in Tashkent do not bear such characteristics. As such, this graduation project draws on the observations and study of such deviations to derive learning opportunities and apply it to a new architecture. The intended outcome is a design of a monumental architecture that has a regional impact for Tashkent and its position on the New Silk Road.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","",""

In the Netherlands it is determined by the four Point Bending (4PB) test on laboratory prepared specimen. During the past years there is an increase in desire to validate the laid down asphalt pavement to the established functional properties. The most practical test setup applicable is theCyclic Indirect Tensile Test (CY-ITT). Both fatigue tests differ on many fronts from each other. The resulting traditional fatigue line between them is therefore not coherent. A solution is previously sought in applying the energy based method of the Ratio of Dissipated Energy Change (RDEC). Developedby Shen &amp; Carpenter. This research is a continuation of those works. The objective of this research is therefore formulated as follows: Establishing a fatigue life relation through the energy methods, which couples the fatigue life results of both the CY-ITT and 4PB fatigue tests and preserve the asphalt mixture characteristics.In total 12 different mixtures were used to establish a wide field of mixture variation. Differences in RAP content, bitumen, PEN-grade and max aggregate size were used. Each mixture was tested on both force controlled CY-ITT and displacement controlled 4PB. Additional 4PB force controlled and Uni-axial displacement controlled fatigue tests were conducted on a single mixture.The results were analysed by the two main energy methods: The RDEC and the Viscous-Elastic Continuum Damage (VECD) model of Kim. The RDEC method is based on the slope ratio of the dissipated energy. The dissipated energy is calculated by the hysteresis loop. The VECD method is based on thelinearization of the strain by the pseudostrain energy function. The rate of the pseudostrain energy function (GR) is then used for the fatigue relation.For the RDEC is concluded that the method is a single line relationship. Independent of frequency, temperature, mixture type, mixture density and stress strain relation for each mode of loading. The test setup independence between the CY-ITT and 4PB was found for 6 out of the 12 mixtures. The 4PB force controlled test did not deliver an evident result. The Uni-axial displacement controlled fatigue test validated the RDEC independence of test setup. It is therefore not recommended to use the RDEC in the current configuration as a practical application for validation between laboratory prepared specimen and the road constructed asphalt concrete layer.For the VECD is concluded that the CY-ITT and 4PB did not form a single coherent fatigue line in the log(GR − NfatSN) relation. The relation is for a single test setup however mixture type dependent. The hypothesis that the fatigue line is dependent on the linear stiffness from the frequency sweep and could be shifted similar as on the mastercurve, proved preliminary to be true for the same test setup. However to be untrue between the CY-ITT and 4PB GR fatigue relation. The used relation between log(GR−NfatSN) is therefor not applicable in linking the CY-ITT and 4PB fatigue test setups.","4PB; CY-ITT; Dynamic IDT; RDEC; VECD; fatigue; asphalt concrete; type-testing; Ratio of Dissipated Energy Change; pavement engineering","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering","",""

This thesis describes the design process of the optimisation unit and the verifcation of its feasibility. Originally, the plan was to test the design on a remote terminal unit (RTU), but unfortunately due to the current crisis, this was not possible. Therefore, the implementation and testing were carried out only in MATLAB. Tests were performed using a MATPOWER system model which has been derived from a real wind farm topology. The optimisation unit makes use of a meta-heuristic algorithm to solve an optimal reactive power flow dispatch optimisation problem. In this thesis, the feasibility of this optimisation unit is investigated. Furthermore, it is determined which devices should be controlled and of which the usage is optimised. This makes the treated optimisation problem a multiple objective optimisation.

The Dutch office of IKEA CBF made the transition to an open office in 2016, to support an activity-based way of working. This new way of working has to lead to an increase in complaints, about noise and distractions within the office. Co-workers commonly related this experience nuisance to auditory stimulation, however, visual or temporal stimuli could contribute to this as well. The experience of the office was researched from a co-worker centered perspective, through interviews and contextmapping session. This revealed that co-workers mainly experience nuisance, when they are being distracted during individual focused work activities. Co-workers identified that they experience nuisance caused by six main sources, both relating to the behavior of co-workers and office facilities. Where most co-workers experienced nuisance from co-workers conversation and movement/foot traffic. The amount of nuisance a co-workers experiences is mainly dependent on their role and the amount of individual work activities they perform. nuisance, than other co-workers. Next to this the individual experiences of co-workers are influenced by factors that influence the presence of specific sources and co-workers general ability to deal with nuisance. Co-workers here most frequently identified that individual needs and a low awareness about their own effect on their surroundings, to affect their general experience of nuisance. Finally co-workers all had an equal access to tools to protect themselves from nuisance. Consequently, co-workers’ general experience of nuisance could most effectively be decreased through a design intervention that improves co-workers’ ability to protect themselves from nuisance during individual work. Next to this Co-creation activities with the Com&amp;In teamshowed that a physical design intervention, that could be applied as an individual solution to protect co-workers from nuisance, would most likely lead to valuable insights for the Com&amp;In team. Following I developed Fridfold, a stimulation barrier aimed at decreasing the amount of nuisance that co-workers experience from auditory and visual stimulation, while working at their desks. This design aimed to make working at an individual deskspace feel ‘fridfull’ or serene, by having a calming effect on co-workers. To achieve this Fridfold was developed to both decrease the amount of stimulation and co-workers perception of stimulation. To achieve this, Fridfold aims to decrease co-workers perception of stimulation by increasing co-workers sense of control, through the interactivity of the design, and the perceived sound damping of materials, through the application of a three-dimensional textured screen. The evaluation of the design with students and co-workers showed that the Fridfold influenced the amount of visual stimulation and improved co-workers sense of control, through the interactivity of the design. Furthermore co-workers envisioned that Fridfold could decrease the nuisance experienced from interruptions. While three dimensional-texture of the screen could not influence the perceived sound damping due to other characteristics of the screen. Therefore, Fridfold should be evaluated within the context of the office to identify how the design can influence coworkers’ general experience of nuisance.","visual perception; Sound design; open-plan offices; office design; User-centered design; Auditory","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

The life cycle assessment method was adapted using certain assumptions to account for circular design approaches. End-of-life scenarios for all the materials were formed and compared using the assessment method. The analysis of materials in different building applications presented a significant difference between bio-based materials and other conventional materials such as steel, aluminium, and concrete. A reduction of almost 120% in the total carbon emissions of the studied building was estimated when bio-based materials were used over the existing materials. The proposed materials, along with energy recovery potential at their end-of-life, even showed the potential to achieve a carbon negative structural system. The proposed scenario of using bio-based material solutions in a building with a longer life span displayed better potential than a circular building construction.

Although traditional models such as decision trees are understandable, they suffer from adversarial attacks. When a decision tree is used to differentiate between a user's benign and malicious behavior, an adversarial attack allows the user to effectively evade the model by perturbing the inputs the model receives. We can use algorithms that take adversarial attacks into account to fit trees that are more robust. In this work we propose an algorithm that is two orders of magnitudes faster and scores 4.3% better on accuracy against adversaries moving all samples than the state-of-the-art work while accepting an intuitive and permissible threat model. Where previous threat models were limited to distance norms, we allow each feature to be perturbed with a user-specified threat model specifying either a maximum distance or constraints on the direction of perturbation. Additionally we introduce two hyperparameters rho and phi that can control the trade-off between accuracy vs robustness and accuracy vs fairness respectively. Using the hyperparameters we can train models with less than 5% difference in false positive rate between population groups while scoring on average 2.4% higher on accuracy against adversarial attacks. Lastly, we show that our decision trees perform similarly to more complex random forests of fair and robust decision trees.","Adversarial Machine Learning; Decision Trees; Cyber Security","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science | Cyber Security","",""

But there exists a lot of uncertainty about which physiological signals and features are the best classiﬁers and a lot of discrepancies in classiﬁcation accuracies exist. This study proposes a novel method for the detection of stress. This method contains a two-layered approach to the stress detection problem. Since most features are inﬂuenced by speaking, this study suggests that before stress detection takes place a speaking detection algorithm is used. During this study both ECG and respiration data are used to classify stress. The linear inﬂuence of the respiration is removed from the ECG data with orthogonal subspace projection to improve the ECG features. An average classiﬁcation accuracy of 80% is achieved on the test dataset, and a classiﬁcation accuracy of 77% is achieved on a second dataset which was obtained with a diﬀerent experimental setup. This shows the real-world applicability and robustness of the designed algorithm. This study, also shows that the inﬂuence of speaking on the features is crucial. In literature, a lot of classiﬁers for stress incorrectly ignore the inﬂuence that speaking has on the classiﬁcation. Combined with a faulty data acquisition method, this possibly results in classiﬁers trained on detecting speaking instead of stress. With this newly proposed method, the stress detection algorithm is more robust against the inﬂuence of speaking.","Stress Detection; Machine Learning; ECG","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

They create both physically- and digitally-based escape rooms across many different scales. These events consist of a variety of puzzles and tasks the player(s) have to solve in order to finish or `escape' the event. For their digitally hosted events, the Massive Online Reactive Serious Escape 2.0 (MORSE) system is used for creation and configuration of the needed underlying rules of the event. The system uses the `If This Then That' (IFTTT) principle for creating rules, where a trigger activated by the player/game can initiate a check about the state of the game which then results in an action by the game. In MORSE the user (usually the game host) can choose from the multiple types of triggers, conditions, and actions to create logical statements in the IFTTT format. These statements together form the rules of the game. This system, although a good improvement over the previously hard-coded procedure, has proven unintuitive to program for most of the employees at Raccoon Serious Games. The IFTTT format used is unwieldy to work with for the designers, who have little to no programming background. Furthermore this existing system provides no overview of the rules system making it challenging to visualise the whole game and its dynamics. To solve the unintuitive nature of MORSE, our team designed and developed Feather: A graph-based visual editing tool that is integrated into MORSE. It can generate rule and ruleset logic needed for the client's escape events. It uses visual components and presents the user with a graph of the whole game during the design process. The editor can be used together with all other, earlier existing, features for creating rulesets of the MORSE system. This tool has most of the functionality the current system has, with the possibility of easily extending it with new components. The product was built as an addition to MORSE over the course of 10 weeks. In the initial part of the project a thorough research was performed on the needs of the client as well as useful resources or libraries and design practices for domain specific visual languages. The second part of the project was devoted to the design and implementation of the tool. Throughout the duration of the project a number of user tests were conducted with the employees at Raccoon Serious Games to assess the understanding and usability of the product.","visual editor; visual modeling language; escape room; compiler","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this research, it is suggested that especially in our working life, the Interface affects us intensely. The labor-leisure dichotomy has become obsolete. Labor and leisure are not binary opposed anymore, but instead seamless concepts and therefore to be considered as one. This results in a new definition of the workplace, beyond the nineteenth century factory and twentieth century office building. The traditional company deterritorialized and humans reterritorialize into new labor-leisure assemblages, resulting in free and constantly fluctuating use of time and space. The activities done are what Simondon calls technical activities: creating new relations among heterogeneous entities, knowledge production, and lifelong learning. Humans no longer work for one company at one location, but they move extensively throughout the day, the week, the year.Their activities and collaborators differ simultaneously, too. It is concluded that an intelligent building complements and provokes accidents to enhance technical activities. A building should work with the Interface, rather than attempting to be it or set it self apart from it. This research is explored in a architectural project in Rotterdam Pompenburg.

The assignment was to redesign the park by improving the circulation and ecological conditions while keeping the sport equipment and transport infrastructure in use for longer, enhancing the productivity of the existing resources. To do so, I adopted several guiding principles from “Landscape Ecology Principles in Landscape Architecture and Land-Use Planning” by Dramstad, Olson and Forman.

The combination of this practice with the software development workflow can however be cumbersome at times. One recent effort into evaluating the effects of integrating monitoring directly into the software development workflow has been done at the large-scale payment company Adyen in cooperation with the TU Delft. This project is a new attempt at making a flexible, open-source and useful monitoring tool based on the results of that research effort. This report will detail how the system is designed, implemented and the development methodology that was used for its creation. After researching popular monitoring stacks and solutions, an architecture for the Hyperion pipeline was designed that would maximize compatibility with logging setups. The monitoring data is first retrieved from a log source like Logstash or Elasticsearch. It is preprocessed by a pipeline consisting of configurable and flexible plugins. A large range of plugins is supported: functionalities include debugging, transformation, load balancing, and adding new data from third-party systems. There is also extensive support for third-party developers to create their own pipeline plugin to manipulate data in any way required, which allows Hyperion to account for unconventional logging setups. The pipeline typically ends at some type of aggregator, which exposes an interface for developer tools to retrieve metrics. These metrics can be queried with the Hyperion IDE plugin, which visualizes them in the development environment itself. To verify that the designed Hyperion pipeline adheres to the requirements defined in the research report, validation tests have been performed on every module of the system. All code is extensively tested with unit, integration, and container-based system tests. An evaluation of the performance of the pipeline additionally verified the scalability of the system even when provided with a large number of incoming logs. Finally, in order to ensure easy extension and adoption of the Hyperion pipeline a large amount of documentation was written, that explains the architecture of the project and how a third-party developer can adjust and extend it.","DevOps; Monitoring; IDE","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science","",""

The value of this information lies in its use. Geoportals play an important part in allowing users to discover and access suitable data for their use cases. However, the user-friendliness of these geoportals is not as it should be. As the communicational layer between a system and its users, a more user-friendly UI can result in a more user-friendly geoportal. In an explorative research methodology involving a literature study into UIs and geoportals, assessing existing geoportals, and a user requirements session, I developed a guideline for user-friendly geoportal UIs: the Geoportal User-Interface Design Evaluator (GUIDE). The elements captured in the GUIDE cover the different parts of the UI: the content presentation, the interaction with available services (system interaction, navigation, search mechanisms, access mechanisms, and communication mechanisms) and the enabling information (metadata and help mechanisms). Concrete implementation examples of these design elements are provided by implementing a mock-up in accordance to the GUIDE. To assess whether or not the elements of the GUIDE result in an increase in user-friendliness, the results of a benchmark usability session are compared to the results achieved during a follow-up usability session with the mock-up. The tasks participants perform during these sessions are all related to the most important reasons why users would visit a geoportal: discovering data, assessing whether the discovered data is suitable for a specific use case, and accessing the data. The comparison of the results of the two usability studies suggests that the elements listed in the GUIDE as implemented in the mock-up indeed result in a more user-friendly geoportal UI. In the adopted usability metric that covered 128 fields related to performance and self-reported metrics, the mock-up outperformed the benchmark in 95 fields. This improvement is confirmed by qualitative comments of the six participants of the usability sessions and by experts of the Dutch geo-platform PDOK. Especially the increase in efficiency is appreciated. Based on the foundation the GUIDE and the corresponding mock-up provide, there is room for more in-depth research to further improve the user-friendliness of the UIs of geoportals. This, for example, involves looking into what communication mechanisms and help mechanisms, icons, terminology, or controls users prefer. Furthermore, additional research into the possibilities of adaptive UIs for geoportals can be valuable to suit possible differences in the needs and preferences of the different individual users.","User-interface; (Geo)portals; Open Data; Usability","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geomatics","",""

Indoorsolutions rely on pre-installation of infrastructure, such as Bluetooth beacons or ultra-wide bandtechnology. Recently, there has been growing interest in the use of Augmented Reality (AR) for indoorpositioning. AR devices use an algorithm known as Simultaneously Localisation and Mapping (SLAM)to scan an environment and find a position inside. This make it possible to estimate a position on-theflywithout any pre-installations. The Microsoft Hololens (MH) is a head-mounted display AR devicethat is able to perform SLAM. The use of SLAM for indoor positioning can be beneficial in the case ofEmergency Response (ER). The place of impact in ER is unknown and there is no time to install anyinfrastructure beforehand.Two problems arise with the use of SLAM for indoor positioning. (1) A position is a pin point in spacethat is defined by a reference frame. In the case of SLAM, the frame is the scanned object. In mostsituations, a map or floor plan is more appropriate as reference frame, in order to give a full context.(2) The SLAM algorithm suffers from drift, a growing error over time. This research tries to solve theseproblems using shape registration. The SLAM output can be aligned to a reference floor plan, by use ofa spatial matching technique. This alignment is a continuous process to account for the drift errors ofthe SLAM algorithm.Three spatial matching techniques are compared: Iterative Closest Points (ICP) iteratively tries to minimizethe distance between two shapes using least squares; Instantaneous Kinematics (IK) is a varianton ICP that makes use of a velocity vector; and Hough Transform makes use of the Hough domainproperties, where rotation is invariant to translation and scale. These algorithms are compared on theiraccuracy, computation time and robustness.It is concluded that the Hough Transform algorithm gives the most accurate results and is fastest. In thisresearch it was found that an average accuracy of &lt; 1m can be maintained over 80% of the experiments,with maximum errors up to 5 meter. In 20% of the experiments, the error can extremely diverge upto &gt;100 meter. It is suggested that the quality of the scan and the existence of artefacts (e.g.furniture,people) are the cause of these errors. That makes the method unsuitable for indoor positioning in thecase of Emergency Response, that needs extremely reliable systems. Research is needed to create a morerobust method, that uses better outlier detection methods. However, the results are promising and doopen the door for indoor navigation using Augmented Reality.","Indoor Positioning; Augmented Reality; Microsoft HoloLens; Spatial Matching; Point Cloud Registration; Emergency Response","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geomatics","",""

Research suggests that these crowds can even outsmart experts. To gather the wisdom of the crowds, this project utilizes a prediction market. To successfully gather the wisdom of the crowds, a predictionmarket has to overcome serious challenges, such as gathering a large and active user base, and deciding on a fair initialmarket value. The main goal of the project is to create a prediction market that can overcome these challenges and successfully gather the wisdom of the crowds. Research has been done in the field of prediction markets. This process started with researching the theory behind prediction markets, the wisdom of the crowds. After that evaluating existing prediction markets and reviewing literature related to those markets was useful. Before and during the research phase, clear goals were set for the project, together with a clear set of requirements. These goals can be divided into: leveraging the wisdomof the crowd, solving problems associated with predictionmarkets and developing a product that is easily maintainable. The final product reaches the goals of the project and meets the requirements. The prediction market correctly aggregates the estimations of users on the market, and provides probabilities on real-world events. These probabilities are contained in the values on the market. The prediction markets solves the problems encountered on other prediction markets. The project makes use of gamification, an automated marketmaker and a reward system to correctly initialise market values. The system was thoroughly tested and developed with maintainability in mind.","","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science and Engineering","",""

The tool is designed for only a limited range of puzzle types and styling options because most of the puzzles require physical items in order to solve a puzzle and only the answers have to be entered in M.O.R.S.E. Because of this design, it is really difficult to create online escape experiences, especially rich and immersive ones. It also requires a lot of programming outside of the M.O.R.S.E. system to do so. Raccoon Serious Games , the client, does not have many employees with programming experience and, therefore, it is not feasible for them to create the rich and immersive online escape experiences they want. To be able to create such immersive experiences, we are extending M.O.R.S.E. with editable domains and web pages. Game designers can add domains and web pages to the existing event schedule and then puzzles can be created for web pages. Players can view one or multiple of these domains and for each domain, the active web page will be served. Web pages can be created and stored in the domains, but the actual contents of the web pages still have to be made. Because making web pages is often a programming intensive task, a page builder has been created in M.O.R.S.E. This page builder allows the user to load and save web pages created in the M.O.R.S.E.<br/>system. It uses a drag-and-drop system to place building-block elements inside the web pages and allows for directly visible styling of those elements. Because of this, the user does not need programming knowledge of the underlying implementation of the web pages. It also facilitates the linking between M.O.R.S.E. features and the domains such as puzzles and triggers for buttons. Using the import and export functionality, users can easily copy previous web pages created with the page builder. This is not only limited to internal web pages but can also be used to import external code from outside the page builder. With user-friendly features such as the ability to undo and redo changes, the page builder tries to make creating web pages as easy as possible. An important aspect of the escape games hosted by Raccoon Serious Games is team building. We extend upon this notion by adding roles and a leaderboard screen to M.O.R.S.E., both of which increase the need and opportunity for interaction between players. The addition of roles allows game designers to enforce cooperation in their escape events, by restricting the access to resources required for solving a puzzle to only a subset of the players in a team. This way they have to cooperate and combine their information and resources to solve all puzzles. The addition of leaderboards is also an extra incentive for a player in a team to work together efficiently because this will positively impact their score and, therefore, ranking on the leaderboard.","Escape events; AR; Software Development","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science and Engineering","",""

The enormous growth and serious drop in prices has created an ecosystem of very large airline groups and increasing consolidations of companies forced by very low profit margins. The airline environment can be conservative and innovation processes can be relatively slow, therefore startups can be an interesting and valuable sources of innovation for the airline industry. The survival rate of startups in general is very low and sources indicate that the airline industry is even more challenging for startups. Therefore, the objective of this research is to investigate the key success factors for startups in the airline industry and identify a strategy to exploit the key success factor successfully. The final objective of this research is to gain a better understanding of the success factors and find a strategy for startups to successfully exploit the key success factor. This should lead to an increased survival rates for startups in the airline industry and more efficient innovation.

The number of visitors is continuously growing for the World Heritage Site at Kinderdijk. Visitors arriving via the water network have to cross a busy road to reach the heritage site. This is an unsafe and unfavourable situation. A new water entrance at Kinderdijk is the solution to this problem. The plan is to add the function of a pedestrian passage to the existing discharge sluice at Kinderdijk named the Elshoutsluice. The discharge sluice is part of a flood defence and must keep its original function. The objective of this thesis is to provide a conceptual structural design for the multi-functional use of the discharge sluice at Kinderdijk including the functions for water discharge, flood defence, passage for (motorised) vehicles and pedestrians, which fulfils standards for flood safety and buildings in the Netherlands. This thesis shows how to approach a design case for adjustments of an existing hydraulic structure as a part of a flood defence. A conceptual design was made for the adaptation of the Elshoutsluice. For this study a design method according to Roozenburg and Eekels (1995) and Voorendt (2020) was used. The Elshoutsluice was divided into different subsystems and elements. The concepts for the location of the new pedestrian tunnel, the floor configuration, the roof and gates were developed. After the functional verification and evaluation, a selection was made from the best remaining alternatives for the elements and subsystems. The selected alternative is a pedestrian tunnel above culvert number 2. As a result, the existing gates of culvert 2 will be replaced with new gates to provide flood protection in case of high water. A flap gate and a vertical unfolding gate are selected. The existing technical area expands above culvert number 3. A multi-functional space is included above culvert number 3. Culverts 1 and 4 remain unchanged. Additional soil will be placed on top of the structure to provide a slope for the connection of the heightened road on top of the sluice to the road at the adjacent levee. The conceptual design and construction phase was checked for the flood safety based on the WBI 2017 and OI 2014 and fulfils the requirements. Stability checks were performed for governing load situations of the Elshoutsluice for the construction phase and use phase. The difference in loading on the structure for the initial design and the new situation was analysed. Additional checks are needed for the lateral walls in all the culverts and the top slab of culvert 1 and 4 due to the increase in shear force and bending moments. The conclusion is the resulting conceptual design.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering | Hydraulic Structures and Flood Risk","",""

Tendencies also show that cooling degree days around the globe will also increase and this will display a greater impact on developing countries with warm climates. Subsequently, this gives interest in reducing energy demands on buildings through both innovative passive and active design strategies that can convert these buildings into energy efficient buildings whilst reaching their desired comfort values. The potential to integrate these strategies for cooling system into a building façade has been looked into by recent research. As is the case of the thermoelectric technology, which is a promising cooling technology that has gained interest from architects in the past few years, and it has a great potential for integration. This device has the advantage of generating a temperature difference between the device’s two sides when direct current is applied it and so it has been widely studied and used as coolers at small scale. There are not enough studies and experimentation of integration at façade level has been conducted with this technology, and those that exists show that the system’s performance is still much lower than traditional air-conditioning systems. Thus, this graduation project focuses on a performance-based design, where the heat dissipation system’s design and its integration with the TE is explored and investigated, what parameters affects its performance, and, subsequently, their effect on the façade and the architecture of the building within a hot-arid climate in Mexico. For this, a combination of experiments and simulations were used to determine the effect certain design parameters have on the thermal performance of the heat dissipation system. Parallel to this, an office case study was selected, and simulations performed to determine the ideal passive strategies for reduction cooling load in a hot-arid climate. A stepped methodology was used for the experiments and simulations for the heat dissipation system and a comparative evaluation on different passive design strategies for the office design was applied. A simplified heat transfer model for the heat dissipation of the thermoelectrical technology was developed, where a series of design strategies were possible to be tested. Analysing the results determined which parameters had a greater impact on the design, for the heat dissipation system its performance was evaluated through its COP, and for the office design lower cooling loads were the defining parameter. General trends were identified on both evaluated levels and each show their potential. These were then translated into design guidelines for the heat dissipation system and office building design and then visualized as a final thermoelectrical facade design. The final COP of the cooling system based on the heat dissipation designed was 1.40. An evaluation on the designed TE façade was done, its limitations and potentials stated, as well as future possibilities that be further developed with this technology.","Thermoelectric; Façade Design; Climate design; Passive Design; Active design; Integrated Facade; hot arid climate; heat dissipation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Building Technology | Sustainable Design","","25.686600, -100.316100"

Literature research is used to provide an insight in factors influencing compliance. Furthermore, an optimisation model in Excel comprising LTM, individual route guidance, and effect estimation is built. The model is tested across three cases and multiple scenarios varying in compliance rate, objective, and distribution of unguided traffic. The achievability of effects is complex: depending on network haracteristics and compliance assumed different impacts can be found. In general, the best results are obtained with advice aiming at a more balanced distribution of traffic. However, the weight attached to local residents is of strong influence on the optimal distribution. An important limitation of this research is that the optimisation model only considers effects in upcoming time step, causing extreme advice with negative effects on liveability. For future research it is therefore important to consider the effects in multiple time steps ahead.","Individual traffic management; Social routing; Compliance; Liveability","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Transport, Infrastructure and Logistics","",""

They support a diverse and productive coastal ecosystem that provides valuable goods and services (Airoldi et al., 2005). In these areas, urbanization and other land-use activities are rapidly increasing. However, human activities represented by urban expansion, agricultural production, and industrial development have led to the deterioration of ecosystems in coastal areas (Zhai et al., 2019). Climate change and extreme weather events will also pose an increasing threat to coastal ecosystems. In the long run, the current model of economic development is not suitable for the future development of coastal cities, but it does not mean to stop the urbanization of coastal areas or their development activities. The project selects the Metropoolregio Rotterdam Den Haag (MRDH) as the research object, and explores the possibility of the symbiotic development of human activities and ecosystems in coastal areas. The main idea is not only to change the economic model, but also to consider the impact on ecosystem services, which means that the material flows in the region will be changed. In order to achieve this goal, it is necessary to strengthen the participation and collaboration of stakeholders in the area, and multifunctionalize the biophysical space as well.

A major result, although already known, is a theorem that gives tractable conditions on the Hamiltonian such that the Boltzmann functional is reflection positive. In this thesis, the theorem is used to give conditions on free parameters in four different models, such that the model is reflection positive with respect to certain chosen reflections. The evaluated models are (a) the antiferromagnetic quantum Heisenberg model; (b) the spin ice model; (c) the 6-vertex model and (d) the 16-vertex model. For the Heisenberg model we found that for reflections in a reflection plane there are certain parameter values such that the Boltzmann functional is reflection positive, this is an already known and published result. For the spin ice model we found that for the spin invariant reflection there is no symmetry that yields a reflection positive Boltzmann functional, this is a new result. For both the 6-vertex and 16-vertex model we showed that, for certain energy values, the Boltzmann functional is reflection positive with respect to reflections in the diagonal, which are also new results. In the case of the 16-vertex model, this boils down to checking whether or not a matrix is positive semidefinite. Using this result we showed that energy values that allow for the existence of magnetic monopoles do not yield a reflection positive Boltzmann functional. A topic for further research is investigating the occurrence of phase transitions in the models that are shown to be reflection positive, for which chessboard estimates seem to be a promising approach. Furthermore, in this thesis it was not rigorously proved that the spin ice model with a spin inverting reflection gives a reflection positive Boltzmann functional for rotational symmetry or symmetry in a reflection plane. This is believed to be true, but does require further investigation.","reflection positivity; Heisenberg; spin-ice; 6-vertex; 16-vertex; phase transitions","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics | Applied Physics","",""

The social development is similar to many post-war urban plannings outside of city centers. After the moving out of the first very homogenic young family population in the course of a suburbanization trend in the late 60s’ and 70s’, the district lived through a process of urban decay. Spatial aspects as a vast amount of unused green space, the generic public realm and a mostly monofunctional structure are influencing the attractivity of the district. Multiculturalism but also relatively high unemployment, poverty and low education are lived reality in Morgenstond. The social structure is characterized by low social cohesion, low life satisfaction and minor engagement with the immediate surrounding. These conditions result into a passive lifestyle of inhabitants, which feel worthless, lonely and depressed. They don’t see the necessity to engage with the public life. Plans for gentrification and densification with new social classes could increase social segregation and frustration in the existing social environment. The new vision of the municipality ‘bestemming Zuidwest gebiedverkenning’ is aiming for an intense densification of the neighborhood with new dwellings and with this ‘diversify’ Zuid-West economically. Without any interventions for social cohesion in this process, social tensions will intensify. One answer addressing these problems is creating a new identity through empowerment of the inhabitants. Empowerment, which is created through a deep inner motivation and a new self-confidence, can build bridges and form a base for a resilient social structure. I believe that the ‘public condenser’ for Morgenstond is a chance to contribute to the establishment of a diverse and stabile society and functions as incubator for empowerment.","Public building; Public space; architecture","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Building Technology | Sustainable Design","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","Secularisation is leading to an increasing amount of obsolete churches in the Netherlands. There is a need for decision making on which churches to preserve and how to deal with the preserved churches. Adaptively reusing these buildings can safeguard them from demolition. Adaptively reusing churches is a matter of making concessions. Every stakeholder has its interest. These interests are interrelated, and it is almost impossible to meet every stakeholders’ goal to the maximum. Therefore, one should strive to find the optimal solution. Finding this optimal balance is the task of the decision maker. Theory shows that aligning the following four goals can help: physical, functional, financial and organisational goals. These are based on the CREM perspectives. This is tested by interviewing several decisionmakers and by comparing this qualitative data and the additional literature research with the theory. The aim is to strengthen the position of the decision maker with this new information and tools. Equally important as finding the optimal solution, is making supported decisions. The use of the DAS-frame guides this. Comparing the four steps derived from the literature with the steps decision makers take leads to the findings. This information is derived from interviews. A step-by-step plan for future decision makers helps making substantiated decisions, and a database and reference booklet, compiled in this thesis, help broadening the solution framework for adaptively reusing churches. This step-by-step plan is compiled based on the DAS-frame and the information for the interviews. Tips from finding the optimal solution merge into this step-by-step plan. The step-by-step plan, database and reference booklet form a toolbox to support private and public decision makers in fulfilling their task.","Religious Real Estate; Strategy; decision making; Church; Conflict management; DAS-frame; CREM-perspectives; Kerkenvisie","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Heritage & Architecture","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","The Circular Economy (CE) in the built environment has gained ever more attention as discussions around the threats of global warming, resource scarcity, environmental impacts, and energy emissions intensify. The building industry accounts for approximately 40% of carbon emissions and reusing vacant buildings – thus slowing resource loops – is one of the strategies on offer to address this. However, research shows that the adaptive reuse of vacant buildings also contributes to their embodied emissions if the process is not fully aligned with CE principles. In addition, the CE is often conceived of as a binary outcome: either projects are fully circular or not circular at all. Identifying how far a project still has to go to become fully circular is an essential step in closing this gap, but how can this be done? This research contains an examination of the processes which are considered to be of importance at the inception of a project. In it, the results of two case studies, exploratory interviews with experts, and a literature review are used to design a decision support framework (DSF) to support decision-makers in housing associations in pursuing greater self-sustainability in their assets. This research also includes an exploration of existing, complementary CE methodologies, and an illustration of how they can be applied to adaptive reuse projects. This involves an examination of the complexity of these CE methodologies, and the delivery of a series of practical steps to achieving a low, medium or high degree of circularity. Using the DSF, an evaluation of a circular project in the Netherlands is then carried out, and recommendations and a step-by-step plan for achieving a completely circular project are set out.","circular economy (CE); adaptive reuse; Housing associations; housing; sustainability; business model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","",""
