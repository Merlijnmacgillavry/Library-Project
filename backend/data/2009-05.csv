(mentor); Van Duin, J.H.R. (mentor); Mensch, T.C.A. (mentor)","2009","Schiphol is a very important transfer hub for KLM and therefore short connection times are important to be competitive with other hubs. KLM sells flights with a minimal connection time of 40 minutes between European flights and 50 to, from, and between intercontinental flights. However passport control and security checks for transfer passengers can take much time resulting in missed (or delayed) flights. The passenger terminal at Schiphol is divided into a part for flights to and from Schengen countries which do not have border control between them (including most European countries) and a part for Non-Schengen countries. Transfer passengers crossing the Schengen border must pass passport control. Transfer passengers into the Schengen area also pass a security check (the transfer passengers to Non-Schengen countries have this check decentralised at the gate). Often congestion occurs at the border control and security check causing passengers to miss or delay flights. Therefore KLM would like to gain more insight into the performance and influence of border filters at the Non-Schengen/Schengen filter in the terminal on the transfer passenger process for flights of KLM. The main question is therefore formulated as follows: Which, when and why do problems occur in the transfer passenger process at Schiphol and how can this situation be improved for KLM?","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Delft University of Technology","Transport, Infrastructure and Logistics","","TIL","",""

(mentor); Van Maaren, H. (mentor); Witteveen, C. (mentor)","2009","We present a new method to break symmetry in graph coloring problems, which can be applied in many classes of combinatorial problems. While most alternative techniques add symmetry breaking predicates in a pre-processing step, we developed a learning scheme that translates each encountered conflict into one conflict clause which covers equivalent conflicts arising from any permutation of the colors. Our technique combines Extended Resolution with domain specific knowledge. Although the Extended Resolution proof system is powerful in theory, it is rarely used in practice because it is hard to determine which variables to introduce defining useful predicates. In case of graph coloring, the reason for each conflicting coloring can be expressed as a node in the Zykov-tree, that stems from merging some vertices and adding some edges. So, we focus on variables that represent the Boolean expression that two vertices can be merged (if set to true), or that an edge can be placed between them (if set to false). Further, our algorithm reduces the number of introduced variables by reusing them as much as possible. We implemented our technique in the state-of-the-art solver MiniSat2. It is competitive with alternative SAT based techniques for graph coloring problems. Moreover, our technique can be used on top of other symmetry breaking techniques. In fact, combined with adding symmetry breaking predicates, huge performance gains are realized.","Satisfiability; Graph coloring; Symmetry breaking; Conflict-driven learning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2009-06-11","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Algorithms","","","",""

With the continuous development and demanding environment in industrial and research fields many proposals exist to extend the language in order to facilitate a more easier development and implementation of applications. Many extensions have been implemented by applying several program transformation techniques such as Domain Specific Languages (DSLs), extensions to existing compilers, language extension assimilation, intermediate code transformation and strategy rewriting frameworks. A particular extension that has not yet been integrated in the Java programming language and merits further research is generators. This extension allows an easier implementation of iterators and is suitable for many other patterns due to its semantics. In this thesis report we introduce generators and discuss the design and implementation of a non-intrusive solution that extends the Java programming language with this construct by means of intermediate code manipulation (bytecode weaving). We also evaluate the implemented solution and demonstrate a sample application where we assess the performance of generators. Finally, we discuss our experiences of implementing this extension in relation to a solution for language extensions in general by means of this non-intrusive approach.","Program trasformation; bytecode manipulation; bytecode weaving; Java; Generators; Language extensions","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Software Technology","","","",""

Virtual machines offer among other things support for high-level object-oriented languages, dynamic memory management and protection, hardware abstraction, and efficient code distribution. The main challenge is to ensure good programming tools and a minimal footprint for the virtual machine to match the limited amounts of memory available on typical WSN platforms. This thesis describes the design and implementation of Darjeeling, a virtual machine modelled after the Java VM and capable of executing a substantial subset of the Java language, but designed specifically to run on 8- and 16-bit microcontrollers with 2-10kB of RAM. The Darjeeling VM uses a 16- rather than a 32-bit architecture, which is more efficient on the targeted platforms. Darjeeling features a novel memory organisation with strict separation of reference from non-reference types that eliminates the need for run-time type analysis in the underlying precise garbage collector. Darjeeling also includes a linked stack model that provides light-weight threads, compacting garbage collection, and synchronization. The VM has been implemented on three different platforms, and was evaluated with micro benchmarks as well as a real-world monitoring application. The latter includes a pure Java implementation of the Collection Tree Protocol (CTP) conveniently programmed as a set of cooperating threads, and a reimplementation of an existing environmental monitoring application. The results show that Darjeeling is a viable solution for deploying large-scale, heterogeneous sensor networks.","Java; Virtual Machines; VM; Microcontroller; Wireless Sensor Networks; WSN","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Embedded Software","","","",""

(mentor); Uijttewaal, W.S.J. (mentor)","2009","Tijdens experimenten in een stroomgoot, waarvan de bodem grotendeels bel<leed was met kiezeis, werd iets opmerkelijks opgemerkt. Op de plek waar de kiezels ophielden, een groot abrupt verschil in bodemruwheid dus, ontstond bij bepaalde combinaties van debieten en schuifhoogtes een verschijnsel wat leek op een golvende watersprong. In de literatuur is er niets te vinden over watersprongen die ontstaan door een verschil in bodemruwheid, dus dat is de aanleiding voor dit onderzoek. Kennis over dit soort verschijnsels kan belangrijk zijn voor ontwerp van (waterbouwkundige constructies in) waterwegen, tevens zou het een toepassing kunnen vinden in de recreatie voor bijvoorbeeld kanoÃ«n, surfen of raften. De watersprong is een overgang tussen een superkritisch en een subkritisch stromingsregime. De golvende watersprong is een speciale vorm van de watersprong waarbij een staande golf zich manifesteerd, samengaand met een grotere waterdiepte. De vraag is hoe de ruwheidsovergang in de goot ervoor zorgt dat er (iets wat lijkt op) een golvende watersprong ontstaat en of de eigenschappen ervan, zoals amplitude en waterdieptes, te voorspellen zijn. Daarnaast is het interessant te kijken naar de randvoorwaarden waarbij het verschijnsel zich laat zien en de toepasbaarheid op bestaande situaties en nieuwe ontwerpen. De eerste hypothese is dat het verschijnsel voldoet aan het theoretische verband (dat voor watersprongen geldt) dat bestaat tussen het bovenstroomse Froudegetal en de ratio tussen benedenstroomse en bovenstroomse waterdiepte. Omdat er sprake is van golven die niet meer als lange golven bestempeld kunnen worden is er een uitdrukking voor het golfgetal k afgeleid van een Boussinesqvergelijking voor middellange golven, zodat de niet-hydrostatische drukverdeling wordt meegenomen. De tweede hypothese is dat met die uitdrukking de ontstane golflengte kan worden voorspeld. De metingen zijn vrij eenvoudig van opzet en bestaan uit enkele dieptemetingen met de peilnaald op verschillende plekken, het meten van het debiet en het meten van de golflengte. Tevens wordt er een foto van het verschijnsel gemaakt zodat deze digitaal bewerkt kunnen worden tot een golfprofiel. Deze metingen worden een scala aan debieten herhaald om zo genoeg data te hebben om de hypotheses te kunnen toetsen. De resultaten van het experiment ondersteunen beide hypotheses en het is dus aannemelijk dat het hier daadwerkelijk een golvende watersprong betreft en dat middellange golftheorie die watersprong goed kan voorspellen. De randvoorwaarden nodig voor het ontstaan van de golvende watersprong kunnen nog niet goed in kaart gebracht worden vanwege het beperkte debiet dat, vanwege angst voor beschadiging van de opstelling, gehanteerd kan worden. De toepassing in bestaande situaties en nieuwe ontwerpen moet vooral gezocht worden in het feit dat met deze kennis kan worden bepaald of er golvende watersprongen zouden kunnen optreden in bepaalde situaties. Eventueel vervolgonderzoek zou zich vooral moeten richten op het kijken van de toepasbaarheid van de middellange golftheorie op model om het gehele golfprofiel te voorspellen, verdere analyse van de voorwaarde voor het ontstaan van de watersprong, het gedrag bij hogere debieten en een voorspelling van de amplitude van de staande golf.","watersprong; bodemruwheid","nl","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Environmental Fluid Dynamics","",""

It has been suggested that such enhancement is due to current-induced refraction but it is actually the result of a balance between many processes. To understand this balance and its possible effect on the occurrence of freak waves, the relative importance of all processes of wave propagation, generation and dissipation in the Agulhas Current are shown with high-resolution (1/32Â°) maps of the intensity of these processes (including the transfer of energy between waves and currents). These computations are carried out for three representations of the Agulhas Current: an analytical approximation of the coastal jet, an analytical approximation of a ring and one realistic case over a 2000 x 2000 km2 area. Since an increased directionality of the waves seems to greatly enhance the probability of generating a freak wave, we do not use the conventional technique of approximating quadruplet wave-wave interactions which over-estimates that directionality. Instead we use a near-exact approach which is deemed to be more accurate. An inspection of the computational results shows that the currents do enhance the wave heights and the directionality somewhat but the degree to which this occurs is hardly enough to seriously affect the probability of freak wave occurrence. The intensity of all processes is of the same order of magnitude except that of the transfer of energy between the waves and the currents, which is one order of magnitude smaller than the other intensities.","wave physics; currents; SWAN; freak waves; XNL","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Bertels, K. (mentor)","2009","One of the key kernels in scientific applications is the Sparse Matrix Vector Multiplication (SMVM). Profiling OpenFOAM, a sophisticated scientific Computational Fluid Dynamics tool, proved the SMVM to be its most computational intensive kernel. A traditional way to solve such computationally intensive problems in scientific applications is to employ supercomputing power. This approach, however, provides performance efficiency at a high hardware cost. Another approach for high performance scientific computing is based on reconfigurable hardware. Recently, it is becoming more popular due to the increasing On-Chip memory, bandwidth and abundant reasonable cheaper hardware resources. The SGI Reconfigurable Application Specific Computing (RASC) library combines both approaches as it couples traditional supercomputer nodes with reconfigurable hardware. It supports the execution of computational intensive kernels on Customized Computing Units (CCU) in Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA). This thesis presents the architectural design and implementation of the SMVM product for the OpenFOAM toolbox on an FPGA-enabled supercomputer. The SMVM is targeted to be a Custom Computing Unit (CCU) within the RASC machine. The proposed CCU comprises multiple Processing Elements (PE) for IEEE-754 compliant floating point double precision data. Accurate equations are developed that describe the relation between the number of PEs and the available bandwidth. With two PEs and an input bandwidth of 4.8 GB/s the hardware unit can outperform execution in pure software. Simulations suggest speedups between 2.7 and 7.3 for the SMVM kernel considering four PEs. The performance increase at the kernel level is nearly linear to the number of available PEs. The SMVM kernel has been synthesized and verified for the Virtex-4 LX200 FPGA and a hardware counter is integrated in the design to obtain the accurate performance results per CCU. Although the synthesis tool reports higher frequencies, the design has been routed and executed on the Altix 450 machine at 100 MHz. Based on our experimental results we can safely conclude that the proposed approach, using FPGAs as accelerator, has potential for application speedup for the SMVM kernel against traditional supercomputing approaches.","FPGA; Double Precision Floating Point; Sparse Matrix dense Vector Product; OpenFOAM","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2009-06-04","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Computer Engineering","","","",""

Thuan","","2009","Becoming an entrepreneur is always attractive but challenging. Consequently, it would be convenient to have a place where entrepreneurs can find enough support to turn their idea into real business. The Generic Portal for Entrepreneurs (Business Portal in short) has been a project using ICT to build this place. To develop this portal, choosing an appropriate software development procedure is a crucial factor for its success. Having compared with other methodologies, Rapid Application Development (RAD) has been chosen as the software development procedure of the portal. However, the fact that the failure rate of software projects keeps increasing [2] forces us to improve this procedure. Two of the main reasons for this failure are the poor business process modeling and the vague requirement definition. Design and Engineering Methodology for Organizations (DEMO) - a methodology that has proven itself successful in capturing business processes in organizations - is a good candidate for this purpose. The aim of this master thesis is to combine RAD and DEMO in a new framework for the analysis phase of software development process. This framework has been applied to develop the Business Portal concepts. On that scope, the thesis report is organized in eight chapters, in which the first chapter has provided the overview of the thesis. The second chapter has discussed the thesis's background about RAD procedure and DEMO methodology. The main work of this thesis has been stated in the next six chapters and will be shortly summarized in the following parts. Firstly, the concept of the Business Portal has been clarified through its goals, the current situation and the desired situation. Since the organization structure of the business portal has not been developed yet, the current situation has been analyzed by reviewing the difficulties and related aspects of an aspirant entrepreneur. In the desired situation, five phases in the entrepreneurship life have been identified. Each phase has captured the functions that the entrepreneur wants from the portal. As the result of these analyses, the vision of the Business Portal is clear. Before transferring the Business Portal's concepts to the design, a new framework for the analysis phase of software development process has been developed. The design of the framework has started with identifying the difficulties in the software requirements definition. To solve these identified difficulties, we have found that the activity diagram in RAD can be updated by the Interaction Model and the Process Model in DEMO methodology. These DEMO models have been added to generate a new framework which has combined traditional RAD's steps and DEMO's steps. In each step, its purpose, techniques, results and added values have been discussed. Besides, the practical contribution of this framework has been verified in this part where we have applied every step of this framework to the Business Portal concepts. These concepts have been transformed to a list of requirements. Then, the business processes of the portal have been captured by the storyline, Interaction Model and the Process Model. Finally, by comparing between the requirements and business steps in Process Model, the missing requirements have been identified and updated. From this point, all business activities of the portal have been taken into account in its design and implementation. Fourthly, building a prototype that satisfies the above mentioned identified requirements takes a lot of time and effort. Due to the limited time in the thesis project, eight (8) key requirements and two (2) optional requirements has been chosen for a prototype of the portal. Besides the analysis performed by steps in the framework, the analysis of this prototype has been captured by its use case, class diagram and sequence diagram. All these analyses have become the input for the design and the implementation in the next phase. Both the design and the implementation of the prototype have followed the steps in RAD methodology. In the design section, the three main parts are: the question list, the website structure and the interface design. Within the question list design, a semantic network has been developed to support the communication between the businessmen and the question list designer. In the implementation section, Ruby on Rails has been chosen as the development platform. Based on above design, the prototype has been coded in Ruby language. The documentation, testing and installation of the prototype have also been discussed in this section. Finally, all the work has been summarized in the conclusion part. In short, our thesis has answered the proposed questions in the beginning of this thesis. It has successfully proved the feasibility of building the Business Portal and constructed a new framework for software development process. This framework is evaluated by applying to the Business Portal concepts and the result of this process is a prototype where the main concepts of the Business Portal are implemented. This thesis has ended with the discussion about the future research directions.","DEMO (Design and Engineering Methodology for Organizations); RAD (Rapid Application Development); Business Portal; Business plan; user requirements; business process modeling; framework","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2009-05-28","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Information Systems Design","","","",""

In dynamic environments, it often happens that - after a problem has been modelled as an STP - a change occurs in one of the constraints. This can lead to an inconsistent situation, in which case there are negative cycles in the distance graph representation of the STP. In this thesis, we discuss heuristic algorithms for solving such disruptions in STPs. More specifically, we try to find a minimum set of constraints that has to be changed to remove all negative cycles from the distance graph. First, we give an overview of known approaches for solving disruptions in STPs. After that, we present some new algorithms. We look at the basic case, in which constraints may entirely be removed from the graph. Then, we discuss the case in which preferences are added to the model. Furthermore, we investigate the situation in which a single constraint is known to be the source of the inconsistency, and we want to repair the STP without changing this specific constraint. Finally, we empirically evaluate the performance of our algorithms for the basic case, and for repairing an STP with a known source of inconsistency. In these experiments, our new algorithms are shown to outperform existing algorithms.","Simple Temporal Problem; Simple Temporal Network; temporal planning; plan repair; negative cycle elimination","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Software Technology","","","",""

Together these sensor nodes form a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN), which has the purpose to sense information about the environment. Before a WSN is deployed, it is tested using simulators and testbeds. Both simulators and testbeds are not able to fully capture all non-deterministic behaviour of the environment in which the WSNs are deployed. Passive inspection is an approach that detects problems within a WSN during deployment. Passive inspection makes use of the broadcast nature of wireless communication and is realised by overhearing messages sent by sensor nodes. The limitation of passive inspection is that operator of the WSN has to wait until a sensor node transmits a message and that this message contains the specific information is needed. To overcome this limitation active inspection can be used, and is realised by injecting messages into the deployment to force a reaction from a sensor node. The concept of passive inspection is not new and has already been evaluated in a simulator and presented in a demo. In this thesis we will further evaluate the practical use of passive inspection using real hardware and we will try to extend passive inspection with active inspection. In order to evaluate passive and active inspection, we designed and implemented an inspection network and an analysis tool. The evaluation compared the normal operation of a deployment with an operation containing a previously resolved bug. The result of this evaluation is that the analysis tool is clearly capable of detecting the previously resolved bug. In this way we showed that passive inspection would have been able to detect that problem when it occurred in a real-life deployment. The evaluation of active inspection showed that active inspection can be used without negatively effecting the behaviour of the sensor nodes in the deployment.","Wireless Sensor Networks; Debugging; Packet Sniffing; Passive Inspection","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2009-05-12","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Embedded Software group","","","",""

Meanwhile, a lot of functions are added to the mobile devices. GPS and camera functions are integrated into the mobile phones. Energy consumed for the communication functions also grows more and more due to rapid improvement of communication technology and the demand for more communication between people, which means that we need larger battery capacity to increase the service time.

Instruments installed are a Single Beam Echo Sounder (SBES) for depth measurements and accurate GPS for positioning (RTK-GPS). The quality of the Jetski as a platform for bathymetric surveys has been assessed. The vertical (depth) accuracy is of order 0.1m; the horizontal position accuracy is of order 0.5m. The local morphology shows a shoreparallel subtidal bar, situated 500m offshore and around â4m NAP. The position of the bar is monitored within weeks before and after storm events between September and December 2008. The bar has migrated approximately 10m onshore during a calm weather period. In a stormy month the bar migrated 25m - 30m offshore. Coastal modeling: The numerical area model Delft3D is set up to reproduce the morphological changes as monitored in the field. Wave conditions from the offshore Europlatform buoy were used. Model results show offshore bar migration during storm as well as some flattening of the bar crest. Other results from a simulated storm show that where subtidal bar is higher, the longshore and cross-shore flow velocity are also higher and more sediment is transported in cross-shore direction. Synthesis: Theory and observations described in literature show agreement with the field observations at Ter Heijde. They show onshore bar migration during fair weather conditions, whereas the bar moves offshore during storm conditions. The main onshore driving component is wave asymmetry whereas the main offshore driving component is undertow. Also the model results look very similar to the resulting patterns from the field measurements. One dissimilarity is that the bar crest in the model flattens more during storm than it should be considering the field observations.","Jetski; Delft3D; Survey; Bar migration","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2009-06-05","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Coastal Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2009","The computational simulation of many engineering problems requires solving linear, sparse, systems of unknowns. Also in the field of aerodynamics, where discretization of equations governing ow problems produces these systems. Improving efficiency of iterative methods used for solving these systems decreases the costs of simulations and is therefore an important research area. The most important iterative methods for solving linear systems today are Krylov subspace methods. One way to accelerate convergence of these methods lies in eliminating the influence of specific problematic subspaces. This called deflation. The two main methods of deflation are preconditioning with a projector and by augmenting the Krylov subspace. Both these deflation types have been investigated in combination with GMRES, a popular Krylov subspace method, in order to better understand convergence behaviour of defeated problems. Some theoretical aspects are introduced and numerical experiments have been done. It was shown theoretically that deflation preconditioning and augmentation give identical convergence results when the deflation subspace is an eigenspace. Furthermore, the importance of not disturbing the Krylov subspace was emphasized. These aspects are both illustrated with an example. The numerical experiments were done using three types of deflation subspaces: eigenspaces, approximate eigenspaces and spaces spanned by algebraic vectors based on coarse grids over the physical domain of the problem. This third type is cheap to construct and has raised interest because it has shown to be very effective for SPD problems. The test cases in this work concern a convection-diffusion problem with varying convective strength and the ow around an airfoil. Eigenvectors associated with small eigenvalues are known to often hamper convergence and this was shown in the test cases as well. Coarse grid subdomain deflation showed to remain effective for the convection-diffusion problem, even when the nonsymmetry was decreased by increasing the strength of the imposed convection. This is because the new deated eigenspectra lie away from the origin. The cases concerning the ow around an airfoil only benefited from subdomain deflation in a limited number of cases. Therefore, subdomain deflation does not seem an effective method for this type of problems.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","","","","",""

A properly designed control strategy with various control measures is effective in handling traffic flows in diverse traffic conditions. Regarding the limits and low performance of existing control system, this paper presents a novel route information traffic control strategy (RICS), which integrates the route demands into traffic control strategy design. RICS aims to optimize network traffic performance and facilitate the movements on some specific routes with maximizing the capacity of infrastructure and maximizing the utility of certain route. It is potential to relieve movements blocked problem in saturated condition or improve the movements of big traffic demand route in some special traffic conditions. The measures of RICS are in a wide variety, which include adjustments in the signal timings and roadside geometric. They can be designed corresponding to the route demands in the network. RICS enjoyed big advantage in generating higher flexibility in signal control setting and adaptability to various traffic conditions. RICS potentially provides special control for preferential routes. The application system of RICS involves input system which provides traffic condition and route demands and output system such as traffic signal control and traffic management. RICS can be pre-designed or it can react or adapt to the real time traffic condition. This report presents a general concept of RICS including its design, application and evaluation. Finally, the case study of delft proves that the proposed RICS is promising and well-performed to improve the traffic performance of preferential routes.","route information; OD matrix; traffic control strategy; network optimization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Transport & Planning","","","",""

Therefore a validation of the surf zone currents computed using the 2DH (depth-averaged) and 3D approach in Delft3D is made. The 2DH and 3D approach are compared using an idealized case and validated using data from the laboratory experiment performed by Reniers and Battjes and data from SandyDuck97 field measurements. The 3D approach underestimates the wave-driven longshore current compared with the 2DH approach. The longshore current computations in the 3D approach are dependent on the thickness of the computational layer just above the bed. In the 3D approach the bed shear stress is computed using the quadratic friction law and the velocity in the computational layer just above the bed as input, and the assumption of a logarithmic distribution of the longshore current. The dependency is caused by the assumption of a logarithmic velocity distribution in the computation of the bed shear stress. Due to wave breaking enhanced turbulence this assumption is not valid. Computing the bed shear stress using the velocity in the computational layer just above the edge of the wave boundary layer solves the layer dependency. This new method of computing the bed shear stress in particular and the longshore current computations by Delft3D in general are extensively validated. The 2DH and 3D approach agree well with the measurements for both the laboratory and the field data. For the laboratory experiments the longshore currents are underestimated in the bar trough. The wave height is the bar trough is overestimated, which might causes the underestimation of the longshore current since too little wave energy is dissipated. It is recommended to further examine the translation of wave forces to a current. For the field experiments the longshore currents are generally overestimated near the coast. The wave height computation showed a reasonable agreement with the measurements but also a systematically overestimation. More attention should be paid into accurately modelling the wave height and the wave height decay. Also the vertical distribution of the current velocity is compared with data from the SandyDuck97 measurements and showed a reasonable agreement.","Longshore current; Hydrodynamics; surf zone; waves; numerical modeling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

To investigate these scenarios a numerical model (Delft3D) is used to study the tide-induced flow and sediment transport in and around the scour holes and the storm surge barrier. The two most important conclusions resulting from the analysis on the vertical processes in the scour holes are: (1) A vertical flow recirculation develops behind the barrier-sill, but no vertical flow recirculation inside the scour hole is expected and (2) The hydrostatic model with a $\sigma$-coordinate layer distribution in Delft3D shows significantly higher flow velocities at the bottom of the scour hole than the model with a (hydrostatic and non-hydrostatic) Z-coordinate layer distribution. Due to a lack of field-measurements it is difficult to determine the accuracy of both models, but the differences can be of importance when a 3-dimensional model is constructed in the future. In the analysis on the horizontal transport patterns around the Roompot inlet, the 2DH model results show mainly import of sediment from the south-western channel during flood and large seaward-directed transports through the northern part of the inlet during ebb. In this way the seaward scour hole forms a blockage of the sediment transport from the ebb-tidal delta towards the storm surge barrier. At the eastern side of the storm surge barrier, much smaller net sediment transport rates are found compared to the seaward side. In the scenario analysis, all model runs show a trend where the adaptations mainly increase the net sediment transport in the direction of the ebb-tidal delta, rather than transport towards the basin. Also, the absolute net yearly transport rates are very small compared to the total sand demand of the Eastern Scheldt to reach a new equilibrium. Although the model results contain some uncertainties and improvements have to be made, one conclusion from the present study is that the studied scenarios do not seem to be very efficient measures in order to significantly decrease the sand demand of the Eastern Scheldt on a short time scale.","Eastern Scheldt; Oosterschelde; Storm surge barrier; sediment transport; scour hole; process-based modeling; Delft3D","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2009-05-26","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2009","Tijdens het stage project TAG eForms is een prototype ontwikkeld, dit prototype dient na de stage verder ontwikkeld te worden tot een product. Dit verslag probeert ook enkele recommendations aan te leveren hiervoor. Het bedrijf TAG software & consultancy bestaat ondertussen een jaar of 20. In deze tijd heeft het bedrijf een enorme schat aan ervaring opgedaan op het gebied van kwaliteitsmanagement, interne audits en performance scans. Tegenwoordig levert TAG software & consultancy ook standaard software hiervoor en hoogwaardige consultancy diensten op het gebied van kwaliteits-, proces-, risk- en klachtenmanagement, strategische beleidsvorming en organisatie vraagstukken.TAG software & consultancy heeft 22 medewerkers, waaronder enkele internationaal aangestelden. Formulieren worden binnen een organisatie zo vaak gebruikt dat het soms gewoon niet meer opvalt, dat hetgeen waarmee gewerkt wordt in essentie als een formulier gezien kan worden. Zolang voor deze formulieren geen software oplossing gekocht/gemaakt is, dan zijn dit veelal Microsoft Word of Excel bestanden.Deze zijn vaak niet uniform, leveren een berg papier op of moeten geprint of gekopieerd worden alvorens gebruikt te worden. Dit zijn enkele nadelen die met eForms opgevangen kunnen worden. De opdracht was dan ook het ontwikkelen van een prototype van eForms. Een product waarmee formulieren gemaakt, beheer en gebruikt kunnen worden. Daarnaast moet het product nog aan een aantal specifieke eigenschappen voldoen welke terug te vinden zin in de requirements definition. Het product dient uiteindelijk te functioneren i.c.m. een windows of linux server en een MySQL of SQL server database. TAG eForms zal gebruik maken van MySQL of msSQL, verder wordt er geprogrammeerd in PHP en JavaScript. Deze code dient te worden gedocumenteerd door middel van een tweetal tools, JSdoc en PHPdoc. Deze genereren documenten aan de hand van de objecten methoden, attributen en het commentaar hierbij. Voor de planning en project structuur is sterk gekeken naar eXtreme Programming en pair programming. Het betreffende project team bestond buiten de twee eerder genoemde studenten uit: Rene ten Oever, Emiel van Goor, Danny Hoogendoorn en Michael van Rijswijk. Het project is 4 globale fasen ingedeeld, formbuilder, workflowbuilder, mailboxen en back-end. Deze onderdelen zijn vrijwel niet in de code gekoppeld en kunnen dus prima los van elkaar ontwikkeld worden. Elke fase heeft 3 subfasen namelijk ontwikkelen, testen en debuggen. Aan het begin van het project is, zoals eerder genoemd een aantal requirements opgesteld. Deze requirements zijn vervolgens onderverdeelt in een MoSCoW document, waarin de prioriteit van de functionaliteit in het stage project verduidelijkt wordt. Verder is er in het ontwerp rekening gehouden met de verschillende database servers waarmee de software moet kunnen werken. Verder is het belangrijk dat eForms kan werken met het ASP model van TAG software & cosultancy. eForms is gemaakt met het MVC principe als framework Tot slot is er in eForms gebruik gemaakt van extJS, een javascript library die het ontwikkelen van gebruiksvriendelijke clientside vereenvoudigd. Het is Versie: 2 Status: definitief 8 enorm belangrijk dat het maken en beheren van formulieren zo natuurlijk mogelijk is voor de gebruiker, wil een dergelijk product aanslaan bij het grote publiek. Er werd gebruik gemaakt van pair programming, een methode waarbij 2 programmeurs een workstation delen, zodat zij gezamenlijk tot een resultaat komen. Dit levert een kwalitatief beter product op en een prettigere werksfeer, naar mening van de programmeurs. Voornamelijk omdat de discussie tijdens of voor het schrijven van de code al gevoerd kan worden en zo de beste keuzes gemaakt worden. Het project heeft een prototype van eForms opgeleverd waarmee verder gewerkt gaat worden om te zorgen dat het een product wordt. De meeste van de vele gemaakte keuzes zijn goed bevallen. Vooral de keuze voor extJS is hier een goed voorbeeld van. Ook de ervaring die opgedaan is binnen TAG bij dit project, wordt gezien als een interessante aanwinst.","eForms; IN3405","nl","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","2010-05-31","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Computer Science","","software technology","",""

These downtimes are often caused by voltage sags of durations up to 1 s. Currently many systems exist which can help to mitigate these voltage sags such as Dynamic Voltage Restorer, UPS and FACTS based devices. With the recent development in semiconductors the voltage-source-converter based high-voltage direct-current (VSC-HVDC) system has also become feasible to deal with power quality problems. With the Siemens Multifunctional Power Link (SIPLINK) also industrial customers can benefit from the advantages of the VSC technology. These benefits are due to the VSC making use of pulse width modulation (PWM) and are amongst others short circuit reduction and independent control of active and reactive power. In this thesis the applicability of SIPLINK to mitigate voltage sags in an industrial power system is studied. Two different solutions are researched which make use of the VSC technology. One solution is based on the current rating of the converters such that the converter can continue to extract nominal power from the grid in an undervoltage situation. This method is called overrating of the system. The other is based on an auxiliary supply containing supercapacitors to replenish the grid power that is reduced during undervoltage. The research is carried on in Matlab/Simulink making use of the SimPowerSystems package. An industrial grid with three medium voltage induction motors serves as a base case for these two solutions. The important parameter to be monitored will be the speed of the motors during a sag with and without mitigation of any form. To simulate the applicability of an overrated SIPLINK to mitigate sags a symmetrical voltage sag of 45% (i.e. 55 % remaining voltage) is applied to the grid that lasts 50 ms and another that lasts 1 s. The results will show that an 80% overrated converter is enough to mitigate these sags. To test the applicability of sag mitigation by supercapacitor, symmetrical voltage sags of 90% and 10% are applied to the grid each lasting 50 ms and 1 s. The results will show that fast mitigation can be accomplished this way.","VSC-HVDC; Vector controller; Voltage sags; Supercapacitor","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2009-05-20","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Electrical Power Processing","","","",""

This graduation is done in the Explorelab, a research driven graduation-laboratory for exploration of fascinations in the profession of building sciences, in a broad sense. Subject Slums are noncities in big cities. They are illegal. The slums represents the worst of urban poverty and inequality. Almost 1 billion people, or 32 per cent of the worldâs urban population, live in slums, the majority of them in the developing world. Moreover, the locus of global poverty is moving to the cities, a process now recognized as the âurbanization of povertyâ. Without concerted action on the part of municipal authorities, national governments, civil society actors and the international community, the number of slum dwellers is likely to increase in most developing countries. And if no serious action is taken, the number of slum dwellers worldwide is projected to rise over the next 30 years to about 2 billion (UN-Habitat 2003). Project In the period in which I have worked for the organization (YWAM) I have met some good friends. Their goal is to help people in one of the most dangerous slums in Belo Horizonte, Pedreira Prado Lopes. Therefore, they really need a center where they can help them towards a transformation in the spiritual, physical, emotional, intellectual, social and economic areas of their lives. This plan inspired me to develop a graduation project in which this fascination and architecture is combined. To design and realize a communitycenter for this vulnerable target group, is trying to give a positive impact to the negativity of a slum. I donât have the illusion to save the world, but trying to make lives better. I would like to help by giving the people a building which have the focus on the wishes of the users: the favelados. It was a great pleasure to work on this research and hopefully you will enjoy reading it. Structure This research starts with a short introduction (chapter 1) about the problems of urbanization and the consequences on slum-developing. In chapter 2 the research-question will be launched, which will be the structure of this research. In chapter 3 the field of research (the slum Pedreira Prado Lopes) will be analyzed, which gives a good reflection on the problems of this slum. Chapter 4 is a theoretical chapter, which gives theoretical answers on the research question. In chapter 5, these solutions will be applied in the slum, where a clear answer will be made on how the treat the slum in the hole context of the city. Chapter 6 is a conclusion on the discussed chapters before.","non-cities; favela; community center","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture","Architecture","","Explore Lab","",""

(mentor); Van Timmeren, A. (mentor); Guse, E. (mentor)","2009","Cities all over the world need to respond to the demographic and economic pressure that is causing urban growth1. In this aspect, the Indian government, classified as a developing nation with a fast growing urban economy, is impatient to see big changes that can classify India as a power Nation and Mumbai as the Asian financial Capital. Parts of the government changes include disappearing all decrepit areas to make way for new modern spaces. One of these areas is Dharavi-Mumbai. However, Dharavi is not just an example of how rural population is concentrated chaotically in the suburbs of a coast line city, where the lack of basic infrastructure and government support, trapped one million habitants in the cycle of poverty. Dharavi is also a land of opportunities where the hard working residents are unconsciously trying to break out the social caste system throughout a progressing informal industry. The graduation project formulates an alternative plan to reach the goal that the government wants: a âSustainable, slum free Dharavi of middle class peopleâ, while: Â integrating bottom-up strategies by taking the needs, wishes and foremost the skills of the slum dwellers in the whole design process; Â using sustainable design principles from the concept phase till the construction detail. This study used the backcasting2 method as a tool to determine the desired future vision for Dharavi and to stimulate the creative process of adaptation in order to attain this future. The resulting methodology is called urban acupuncture. New elements are put into the city as generators to provoke pre-determined changes. The city will change by itself, and the generators are starting and guiding this change. This previous definition is translated into a concept plan for Dharavi based on a node that will generate positive ripple effects. This concept stimulates independency from the surroundings in basic services (water and energy). The design intervention is called âthe master pilot projectâ. The intervention is going to be the node that intends to introduce quality to the area and connect Dharavi to unused economic potentials. The general intervention concept: to organize the âlucrative artisanal occupations of Dharaviâ3 in a way that it can be exposed and accessible to external consumers. The goal is to intensify the commercialization of their products. The three phases of the project summarized: 1.- Macro Phase: reciprocity between the design project and the context. Includes the following elements: . The boulevard: increase connections on city level and on province level. . The Mahim Creek: stimulate new incomes by alternative agriculture such as bamboo plantation. . The Mithi River: improve water quality by introducing water plants (reed and lilies) and increase productivity via floating agriculture and floating market. 2.- Meso Phase: the design proposal The first architectural element proposed is the so-called âthe craft towerâ. The building will attract new market potentials and will exteriorize its content âcraft show room-production âand it gives space to people, animals and plants. The low-tech icon is an eight floors open plan structure conceived as a multilayer building. The layers of the building consist of a climbing plants system, a structural bamboo system and a rammed earth skin. Other aspects such as position of the volume, rainwater collection, night cross ventilation, and replacing the bamboo columns are part of the design principles used. The second architectural element, called âthe community centreâ, deals with the need that the area has to generate a common space where the community can interact culturally and organizationally. It is organized in two scales depending of its type of activity: the âopen air theatreâ and the âmain hallâ. The third architectural component is the integrator feature called the âliving bridgeâ. The main function of the bridge is to introduce consumers into Dharavi in a friendly and captivating way. 3.- Micro Phase: detail level . This phase included the structural analyses of the living bridge. For which a constant interaction was necessary within Bentley GenerativeComponents (GC) program and the finite element analysis program Diana. With the parametric module developed in GC different parameters were established allowing the remodelling of changes more easily and visually. Furthermore, Diana has been used as a technical tool to optimize the bamboo structure. In order to understand the behaviour of bamboo as a building material better a testing experiment was carried out. The goal of this experiment was to know whether structural continuity exists between bamboo and concrete. To test the approach of the proposed module for the living bridge a prototype scale one to one has been built. The prototype concerns one node of the bridge which contains the highest amount of connections between bamboo elements. Based on what is already there, coming from inside out, working with local culture and local workmanship, trying to keep the economy together, are the foundations for the new development proposal in this graduation project.","acupuncture","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2010-02-13","Architecture","Architectural Engineering and Building Technology","","","",""

Na de afsluiting van de Lauwerszee is het bekken continu in verandering. Dit heeft gevolgen voor de bevaarbaarheid van de vaarroute naar Schiermonnikoog. In dit onderzoek wordt een voorspelling gedaan naar de ontwikkelingen voor het komend decennium en de gevolgen van deze ontwikkelingen voor de bevaarbaarheid. Daarnaast wordt gekeken of er een simpele effectieve wijze is die de bevaarbaarheid van het laatste deel van de vaarroute onder Schiermonnikoog kan garanderen. Dit deel heeft het meest te lijden onder de veranderingen. Tot slot wordt de mogelijkheid onderzocht om een nieuwe geul te baggeren naar een nieuwe aankomstlocatie op Schiermonnikoog. Deze locatie moet dan dichter bij het dorp liggen. Aan de hand van de historie, de theorie, eerdere onderzoeken en peildata van Rijkswaterstaat zijn er analyses en voorspellingen gemaakt van het bekken. Dit is gedaan met een semi-empirische benadering en een model in Delft3D. Uit beide benaderingen blijkt dat de geulen in het bekken smaller en dieper zijn geworden en dit ook in de toekomst zullen blijven doen. Daarnaast is de hoogte van de platen afgenomen ten opzichte van het verleden. Maatregelen om de bevaarbaarheid van de geulen te blijven garanderen zijn van toepassing op het laatste stuk van de vaarroute, het stuk onder Schiermonnikoog. Het blijkt dat met het uitdiepen van de geulen, het anders kiezen van een dumplocatie voor het gebaggerde materiaal en het verlengen van de geul de bevaarbaarheid niet verder achteruit gaat. Daarnaast is er een mogelijkheid om een nieuwe geul te baggeren. Echter deze geul vergt gedetailleerder onderzoek. De bevaarbaarheid van de vaarroute komt in het geding bij het uitblijven van effectieve maatregelen en het is te overwegen om een nieuwe geul te baggeren naar de huidige jachthaven om daar ook de veerboot aan te laten komen.","morphology; Frisian; Inlet; navigation; Schiermonnikoog; Delft3D","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

Current research on multi-class molecular classification typically treats the classes on a nominal scale and thus does not take any relation between classes into account. The ordering is however valuable information which may be used to improve the predictive power of a classifier. A few ordinal classifiers have been published, but they have not been applied in the analysis of molecular data, where there are only a limited number of samples in comparison to the number of features. This paper describes a comparative study in which current ordinal classifiers are benchmarked in a molecular analysis of gene expression. This helps to determine whether using the relation between classes can help to improve the prediction results. The results of the comparison study shows that there is not a lot of difference in performance between nominal and ordinal classifiers evaluated on real datasets. Several experiments were executed to further investigate any difference between both types of classifiers. It seems that by selecting monotonous features (i.e. features that correlate linearly with the class labels), the performance of nominal classifiers can be significantly improved. This allows for the usage of well-known and less complex classifiers, which is beneficial in p > n problems.","Ordinal; Classification; Multi-class; Molecular","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2009-05-09","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Bioinformatics","","","",""

(mentor); Peperkamp, W.J.M. (mentor)","2009","In dit verslag wordt een discrete modellering gemaakt van een vlakke plaatvloer. Daarbij wordt een vereenvoudiging van het probleem gemaakt waarvan de belangrijkste vereenvoudiging bestaat uit het verwaarlozen van wringing en dwarscontractie. Verder wordt een oplossing gezocht voor star, lijnvormig ondersteunde platen, puntvormig ondersteunde platen zullen buiten dus beschouwing gelaten worden. De platen worden gemodelleerd door ze te verdelen in balkjes in beide richtingen. Het is duidelijk dat de verplaatsingen van de onderste en bovenste balkjes op de knopen van de balkjes gelijk moeten zijn. Tevens moet er bij elke knoop evenwicht zijn. Er wordt een modellering gevolgd waarbij de invloed van elke resultante op een verplaatsing wordt gekoppeld door een invloedsfactor. Deze factoren worden bepaald door een speciaal af te leiden vergeet-me-nietje. Met behulp van de vergelijkingen voor evenwicht en verplaatsing kunnen de onbekende verplaatsingen en resultanten bepaald worden. Met de gevonden oplossingen kunnen verder de momenten en dwarskrachten worden bepaald. Er kunnen wederom invloedsfactoren worden bepaald die het verband tussen de kracht en moment of dwarskracht koppelen. Op deze manier kan de krachtswerking in de vloer opgelost worden. De uitkomsten van de methode, die in dit verslag Dimod is genoemd, kunnen worden geverifieerd met een eindige elementen methode. Daartoe moet de wringstijfheid in het pakket op vrijwel nul worden gesteld. De uitkomsten bleken exact overeen te komen. De modellering klopt dus. Verder kunnen er, nu de methode klopt, vergelijkingen gemaakt worden met andere methoden. Dit wordt ten eerste gedaan met de VBC-methode. Hiervoor worden de momenten uit Dimod omgerekend naar dezelfde dimensieloze factoren als gebruikt in de VBC. Het blijkt dat Dimod altijd aan de veilige kant zit. De afwijking is maximaal als alle randen scharnierend zijn opgelegd en is minimaal als alle randen zijn ingeklemd. Een volgende vergelijking die gemaakt kan worden is de vergelijking met een EEM plaatmodel. Uit de grafieken komt duidelijk naar voren dat Dimod een veilige methode is. Uit de vergelijking van het EEM model met de VBC-methode blijkt dat ze nagenoeg dezelfde resultaten geven. De verschijnselen die verwaarloosd zijn en wel belangrijk zijn voor platen zijn wringing en dwarscontractie. Doordat dit niet meegenomen is ontstaan er verschillen die verklaarbaar zijn. In het hoofdstuk âtheorieâ wordt ingegaan op de achtergrond van de verschillen die bij de vergelijkingen met andere resultaten geconstateerd zijn. In de âconclusieâ wordt een conclusie geschreven naar aanleiding van de gevonden resultaten die hier niet ten overvloede zal worden herhaald.","vergeet-me-nietjes; plaatwerking; discrete modellering; vloer","nl","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Design and Construction","","","",""
