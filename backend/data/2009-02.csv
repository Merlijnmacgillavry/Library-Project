In these systems, the increasing requirements on detection resolution,points towards the use of higher frequencies. In view of this, frequencies at W-band are very attractive due to the otential of high spatial resolution, while chip size and antennas can be made more compact. However, to realize such a high performance FMCW radar system, a W-band high bandwidth LNA-mixer chain needs to be developed in a high-end integration technology. Key design parameters are low noise, high conversion gain and linearity, and above all a large operating bandwidth. Due to the application requirements in this project, high isolation between received signal and the down converting LO signal needs to be established. System considerations have been given in support of understanding and defining the LNA-mixer specifications.","94ghz; direct conversion architecture; lna mixer chain","en","master thesis","TU Delft, Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science, Microelectronics","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","","","","",""

(mentor)","2009","Cycle scavenging (CS) is the process of using otherwise idle computational resources to provide large, aggregate, amounts of computational power. It is the core principle of so-called desktop grids and volunteer computing, which use the idle cycles of desktop computers to do computations. However, resources in a multicluster grid likewise may have idle time, and so, multi-cluster grids go through periods of low efficiency. In addition, many practical grid applications are of the Bag-of-Tasks (BoT) type, which are large collections of embarrassingly parallel tasks. These require a vast amount of computational power, which multi-cluster grids can provide. Claiming an entire grid for one application would however not be fair to other grid users. In this thesis, we design a system for multi-cluster grids that detects and uses otherwise idle resources, specifically to execute BoTs. By combining CS with the computational power of the grid, we increase grid efficiency, we are able to provide the resources needed by BoTs, and, at the same time,we can guarantee unobtrusiveness to all grid users. The system we design, KOALACS, is an extension of the KOALA grid resource manager. We create a framework for submitting CS jobs through KOALA, and implement several policies for fair sharing among such CS jobs. We then evaluate the performance of the complete system, and demonstrate its capabilities, through a series of experiments on a real grid system, the DAS-3. With these experiments, we show that KOALA-CS does not hinder non-CS grid users, that it ensures fair sharing of resources among CS jobs, and that it is robust and fault tolerant.","cycle scavenging; grids; koala; distributed computing; bag-of-tasks","en","master thesis","TU Delft, Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science, Computer Science","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","","","","",""

Nowadays, Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) designs contains hundreds thousand, million or even billion transistors and not only the experience of the designer, but also Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tools and some methodology is needed. The purpose of this thesis is the design in 90nm UMC technology of an 8-bit microcontroller for its final manufacture using Modelsim, Design Compiler and SoC Encounter and following a standard cell design methodology. During the different steps of the VLSI flow (behavioural specification and verification, synthesis and layout generation), it will be shown how to deal with the design issues that arise: (DFT insertion, clock gating, clock\&reset tree generation, etc.). Starting from a tested FPGA implementation in VHDL based on the AVR ATmega103 microcontroller from ATMEL, the final result is an 8-bit microcontroller with the following features: 16k x 16 bits of Program Memory (PM), 8K bytes Data Memory (DM), 256 bytes parameter memory, 3 8bits I/O ports, UART, SPI, JTAG interface, additional PM programming capability (apart from the JTAG) and Wishbone interface including an USB 1.1 slave and another slave to implement and test a simple scan chain prototype.

(mentor)","2009","In December 2007 Royal Haskoning has won an international design competition organized by the Great Wheel Corporation in which they ask for a concept master plan for a unique hotel. The design of Royal Haskoning featured a 185m tall Ferris wheel in which the hotel was situated. The main difference between a classic Ferris wheel and the design of Royal Haskoning is that the design of Royal Haskoning hasn’t got spokes. More and more Ferris wheels are build all over the world as landmarks, up until the design of Royal Haskoning the focus was on building taller and taller, in Beijing a Ferris wheel of 208m is currently being realized. This raised the question why is the Great Dubai wheel only planned at 185m, and even more importantly: “What is the maximum possible diameter of the Great Dubai Wheel?” In this Master thesis the maximum possible diameter of the Great Dubai Wheel has been investigated. To be able to state the maximum diameter of the Great Dubai Wheel the Master thesis can be broken down in three parts. [1] Limitations of the current design; [2] Possible improvements to the design; [3] Maximum possible diameter of the improved design; In the first part the limitations of the current design have been analyzed. This made clear that the proposed design wasn’t feasible; the main problem was the lack of effectiveness of the used material. In the second part of the Master thesis some proposed solutions have been investigated, and in the third and final part of the Master thesis the improved design has been analyzed and the maximum diameter of the Great Dubai Wheel has been stated. Throughout the project parametric design has been used as a very useful tool. Because the intention of the project was to find the maximum possible diameter of the Great Dubai Wheel, the structural model had to be changed continuously. Via a spreadsheet the complete input-file for the structural analysis program was written, this made it possible to quickly change the model and to determine if the proposed solutions were actually effective or not, and also to easily derive the maximum diameter of the Great Dubai Wheel.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Design and Construction","","","",""

In this thesis, a clone management strategy based on dynamic inferring of clone relations based on monitored clipboard activity is described. A tool is introduced that is able to track live changes to clones and offers several resolution strategies for inconsistently modified clones.

(mentor); Verheij, H.J. (mentor); Verhagen, H.J. (mentor); Ursem, W.N.J. (mentor)","2009","The safety of a large part of the Netherlands depends on sea dikes. Due to climate change, a sea level rise is predicted. Together with stronger storms and more wave attack, wave overtopping on the current dikes will increase. As a response, crest levels of the dikes need to be raised in order to meet the present regulations for wave overtopping. Alternatively, these regulations could be lowered if the dikes can be proven strong enough to cope with the increased loads. The SBW ('Sterkte & Belastingen Waterkeringen' or 'Strength and Loads on Water Defences') project with respect to grassed inner slopes focuses on the improvement of reliable overtopping criteria for the present dike structures. Experiments are carried out using a wave overtopping simulator. This device is developed to create full scale overtopping conditions on a inner slope. Experiments show initiation of erosion of the grass layer downstream of the transition of the slope and a horizontal part. The focus of the present research is modelling of the erosion process at a transition. The erosion process is described by two different models. The Transition Model (TM) is derived to describe the development of the scour hole due to the impinging forces of the overtopping wave tongue, known as surface erosion; The SSEA (Sites Spillway Erosion Analysis) model is taken to describe the headcut erosion process which occurs after the scour hole has reached a certain depth. The TM is based on a oblique impinging jet and a depth variable strength profile, in where near the surface the root system dominates, whereas with increasing depths cohesion and internal friction of the clay dominates. Since irregularities, found at the real dikes, are not taken over in the model discrepancies between model and experimental results occurred. According to the defined erosion model, the present guidelines are stern and the actual strength of a grassed inner slope is underrated. The work is done in cooperation with Deltares.","grass erosion; wave overtopping; sea dikes; erosion model; water jet","en","master thesis","TU Delft, Civil Engineering and Geosciences, Hydraulic Engineering","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","","","","",""

TNA can be used as a tool to help understanding where traffic jams occur in road networks it can also be useful in the field of optimization and logistics. The main user group for TNA software was identified as traffic authorities who are responsible for organization of the road networks. TNA uses as input topology of the network, delay function of network links and total required inflow. Based on the given input TNA calculates the minimum delay using Minimum Flow Deviation algorithm and provides the result set by specifying which route will have the shortest delay. Using TNA software it's users can get an overview of the performance of a network, given a certain amount of total inflow and also get the optimal route to flow commodities from a given sauce to destination. Having these results traffic network authorities or anyone using TNA will get overview of the performance of the network. TNA software was build using a classic waterfall in combination with extremeProgramming methodology. This report gives a description of the activities which took place during the course of project. Each chapter of the report mainly represents a major phases of the project. Section 2 describes the project analysis phase from the point of view of the coordinators.

This is a very complex problem for organizations, because of heterogeneous technology and complex processes. Together with the continuous change in organizations, managing “Who has permission to do what on which data and why?” is a real challenge. (For example: change of working processes, change of people, change of jobs, change of information systems or change of the organization when merging with other organizations.) Current insights, based on practical experience, reflect that IAM is 20% about technology and 80% about processes and IT Governance. In general IT governance literature and frameworks, IAM is only a small topic. IAM specific literature is often only about technology, of course with a few exceptions. One may conclude a gap exists between IAM technology and IT governance literature/frameworks. In short, this research will try to: “Close the gap between IAM technology and general security or IT governance frameworks.” This knowledge will enable organizations to establish IAM more efficiently, without having to go through every known pitfall. The research is performed in 7 chronological steps: 1. Using the results of the literature study on COBIT as guidance in practical applications. (Chapter 2.) 2. Setting the research environment and boundary by a general introduction to the term Identity and Access Management as it will be used in this research. (Chapter 3.) 3.

Het gebied rondom Den Haag CS profileert zich vooralsnog tot een onaantrekkelijk overgangszone tussen het historische stadcentrum en een modern kwartaal. De gemeente Den Haag schreef voor de nieuw te bouwen hoogbouw naast Den Haag CS een prijsvraag uit. Dit gebeurde in samenwerking met NS Poort en Multi Vastgoed. Het winnende ontwerp kwam van O.M.A., het architectenbureau van Rem Koolhaas. Deze ontwierp hiertoe een spraakmakende stationsentree die perfect aansluit op de stedenbouwkundige richtlijnen voor dit gedeelte van de stad. Het ontwerp omvat ruim 100.000 m² waarvan 42.000 m² is bestemd voor kantoren, 34.000 m² voor woningen en 4.300 m² voor commercie en overige voorzieningen. Daarnaast wordt onder het koningin Julianaplein parkeergelegenheid gesitueerd (11.500 m2), tezamen met een fietsenstalling (7.300 m2). Hoewel het ontwerp één geheel vormt, bestaat er een duidelijk onderscheid tussen een woon- en kantoorgedeelte. Laatstgenoemde steunt hierbij af op de woonvleugel en geldt zodoende als afhankelijk. Voor de uitvoering betekent dit dat het woongebouw voldoende gereed dient te zijn alvorens de koppeling gemaakt kan worden. Architectonisch gezien vormen beide gebouwdelen een volledige harmonie. Constructief gezien gelden echter grote verschillen. De uitdaging bevindt zich hierbij vooral in het kantoorgedeelte. Deze wordt gekenmerkt door 22 verdiepingen met aan weerszijde twee enorme overstekken.

Besides the cell phone there are many other devices that can keep track of GPS data, including the GPS device made by Sony. If all this GPS data is collected and organized, one could get a good overview of peoples whereabouts. That is why the goal of this project was to develop a tool that keeps track of peoples movements, share a visualization of these movements with other people and allow for other means of social interaction, such as chatting, messaging, finding other people and so on. To realize this goal we created the Sococa system. The name stems from the full name we had devised at first, Socialocalize. Additionally, the Japanese phrase 'sokoka' can be taken to mean something akin to 'over there?'. The system consists of a client part and a server part. The client program can parse and upload users' locations to a server in real time. The server has an interface which also allows other programs to upload their location data. Because the user doesnt always have an internet connection available, it is also possible to upload files with location data at a later time. This can be done on the website or with the client program. The server hosts a website on which a map with all positions of the users are shown. When a user uploads a new location to the server, this is directly updated on the map. The map also has the capability to show animated routes the user took in the past. The website has some social networking features. It is possible to create an account and add some personal information to it. It is possible to look up ones friends using the search option and add them as friend on the website. After they are added, users can chat in the global chat or send private messages to each other. To ensure the users' privacy, the user can choose to limit the availability of his location data to his friends or only to himself. The most important things the current system is lacking are full OpenId support and support for the Opensocial API. OpenId is a service which allows users to have only one account for the whole internet. This technology is supported by the website, but not by the client program. The OpenSocial API links social networking sites to each other, i.e. friends can be easily imported from one site to another. Because of the complexity of this technology, we have chosen not to implement this.","gps; movement tracking","en","bachelor thesis","TU Delft, Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science, Computer Science","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","","","","",""

The design is a pile supported concrete structure with a considerable complex superstructure. The superstructure of the reference design consists of a perforated inclined wall and a vertical back wall. Since the hydraulic processes and variable wave pressures on the superstructure are not trivial and hard to predict more research is required to design similar structures in the future. The objective of this study is to get an understanding of the hydraulic processes and variable wave pressures on the reference structure. The research is divided in an analytical part and a part of physical model tests. The near shore wave conditions are calculated with SWAN. The design conditions are a storm surge of 6m, a wave height of 2,2m and a wave period of 5,25s. In order to obtain an understanding of the hydraulic processes and wave pressures on the reference structure first a simple and impermeable sloping structure is considered. It is found that for the local conditions in combination with steep sloping structures non-breaking wave conditions occur. Therefore it is assumed that the linear wave theory can be applied for determining the variable wave pressures. A model is made for the influence of a gap at the bottom of an inclined wall on wave reflection; wave run-up and wave transmission. In the physical model tests different experimental set-ups are tested. The expectations drawn on the basis of the results of the analytical part are verified by the results from the model tests.","stormsurgebarrier; wave; pressure; reflection","en","master thesis","TU Delft, Civil Engineering and Geosciences, Hydraulic Engineering","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","","","","",""

(mentor); Verhagen, H.J. (mentor); Labeur, R.J. (mentor); Van Spengen, J. (mentor)","2009","After New Orleans was struck by hurricane Katrina on the 29th of August a consortium including Iv-Infra was in a tender, which involved the design of a storm surge barrier at the east side of the city of New Orleans. This consortium designed a piled-supported structure including a concrete superstructure. The superstructure consists of a perforated inclined wall in front of a vertical backwall. The inclined wall has an energy dissipating function and the vertical backwall does have a water retaining function. However, there is no standard theory to determine the optimal configuration of the superstructure having such a configuration. To find the optimal configuration total insight in the occurring hydraulic processes in front of and inside the superstructure is a requisite. In this research an analytical analysis has been performed for the water movement in the basin of the superstructure; for the wave run-up and wave overtopping over the perforated inclined wall; for the emptying process of the basin of the superstructure; for the wave induced inflow through the gap at the bottom of the inclined wall and for the length spreading effect, which is the spreading of the extreme overtopping rates in longitudinal direction of the basin. In the analytical research a reduction factor was found for the influence of the gap in the inclined wall on the wave run-up and wave overtopping. The reduction factor is equal to the reflection coefficient and has to be implemented in the formula for a non-perforated inclined wall. In this analytical research it was also stated that the inclined wall did not influence the water movement in a different way than a vertical wall should do. The water level fluctuation would resonate for a basin width of 0,5L. Physical model tests have been performed to solve the encountered uncertainties, which were encountered during the analytical research. Besides solving the encountered uncertainties verifying the analytical results was an objective of the physical model testing. From the physical model testing it has become clear that the gap has no influence on the wave run-up, however it influences the wave overtopping. An explanation for this phenomenon is that the overtopping time decreases when a gap is implemented in the inclined wall. By comparing and combining the results obtained by the analytical research and the physical model testing the hydraulic processes have become clear and a numerical model combining these different hydraulic processes has been constructed. The numerical model provides one a tool to calculate the overtopping volumes over the vertical backwall; the outflow through the gap and the overtopping volumes over the inclined wall. It is not possible to perform an automatic optimization with the model. One has to check different configurations whether they fulfil the imposed criteria or not. The most important criteria are that the structure has to be as low as possible and that the overtopping discharge over the vertical backwall is not allowed to be larger than 0,1l/s/m. A configuration consisting of an 1:1 sloped inclined wall with height of 8m and a gap of 1m at the bottom of the wall and a vertical backwall with the same height with a distance of 7m from the inclined wall based on still water level is the result of using the numerical model. The water movement in the basin and the wave induced inflow are not included in the numerical model. However, from the analytical research it is known that the water level fluctuation for a basin width of 7m does not resonate. Therefore the water movement is included in the determination of the configuration.","New Orleans; hydraulic processes; configuration","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

The present equation, Van der Meer 1998, gives results for depth limited conditions but is not validated. The empirical equation is based on physical model tests done by Gerding 1993. The Van der Meer equation implies deep water and breaking waves on the structure slope. For shallow water conditions this assumption is not valid. Waves start breaking at the fore shore slope and toe which results in a different hydrodynamical wave load at the toe. Toe material is exposed to waves and starts behaving as armour rock. The uncertainties, introduced by shallow water situation are investigated in this research. The objective for this thesis is finding a more reliable design equation in this situation. Fore shore slope and wave steepness are considered of influence. The research is done by performing scale model tests in a two dimensional wave flume. The observations from the experiments and the analysis of the performed dataset gave following conclusions: Fore shore slope is strongly influencing toe stability. This is not only valid in shallow water but also in deep water. In shallow water, wave steepness influences toe stability as well. This is not proven for deep water. Very shallow water shows different hydrodynamic behaviour. Wave breaking occurs at the fore shore. The toe structure is attacked by breaking or already broken waves. Although a reduced wave height reaches the toe, damage is larger because the toe is exposed to turbulent wave attack. A new design equation for very shallow water is suggested in which fore shore slope and wave steepness are included. This is an empirical relation, using dimensionless relations like the Hudson stability number and a new damage number in percentages.","toe stability; rubble mound breakwater; depht limited; shallow water; fore shore","en","master thesis","TU Delft, Civil Engineering and Geosciences, Hydraulic Engineering","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","","","","",""

(mentor); Staufer, U. (mentor)","2009","The start of 21st century saw an increasing level of competition among automotives. Automotive company needs to cope with the challenges of production of high quality, cheap and environment friendly cars. This becomes possible by the use of High Strength Steel (HSS), Advance High Strength Steel (AHSS) and Ultra High Strength Steel (UHSS) with thinner gauges for automotive bodies. Besides this, automotive has also to face the issue of the reduction in “Design to Market time” which plays an important role for the company to remain competitive. This issue can be best met by the production of a “first time right” product and process and becomes possible by the use of Computer Aided Engineering (CAE). In most sheet metal forming operations, springback, which is undesirable, takes place at the end of operation which results in the deviation of final geometry from the design geometry. Springback is found higher for the metal with higher strength and for the thinner gauges and this is the reason of the higher amount of springback when HSS, AHSS and UHSS with thinner gauges are used for automotive bodies. The need of prediction of springback before an actual operation is therefore emphasized so that it can be compensated in the manufacture of expensive dies and tooling. The current practise of the manufacture of these dies is trial and error process which is time consuming, labour extensive and very expensive. An advance approach, which eliminates these problems, is the use of Finite Element (FE) analysis for the prediction of springback. In most cases, the springback with FE analysis is under predicted. There are many factors which contribute to the inaccurate springback prediction. One factor responsible for the inaccurate springback prediction is the assumption of constant Young’s modulus in FE analysis. Young’s modulus, however, is found to decrease during plastic deformation. Therefore, an accurate model is needed to be implemented in FE analysis which can predict the decrease in Young’s modulus. With passage of time, Young’s modulus is found to restore to its initial value. The present study focuses on this aspect of springback prediction. Bake Hardenable (BH) steel has been selected to investigate the degradation and recovery in Young’s modulus. Two models are presented from literature in this report which are responsible for degradation when sheet metal is subjected to plastic deformation. The recovery in BH steel is considered to be due to strain ageing phenomenon in BH steel. The degradation in E modulus is found to be a function of dislocation density and average dislocation loop length between pinning points. In order to estimate the Young’s modulus as a function of prestrain, these two parameters need to be known. The decrease in Young’s modulus and its recovery has been measured experimentally by two methods i.e. the dynamic method (Impulse Excitation Technique) and a static method (Tensile Test). The results are thoroughly discussed and some conclusions are drawn from it. At the end of the report, some recommendations are suggested for the future work. The report also compares the two methods of measurement and helpful tips are given for future work using these methods of measurement.","Young's Modulus; cold forming","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2010-01-15","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Precision and Microsystems Engineering","","","",""

Dit project biedt een mogelijke oplossing voor deze vraag in de vorm van een softwaresysteem. Het ontwikkelde systeem zal moeten bewijzen dat het verbetering biedt ten opzichte van de huidige situatie. Dit is geprobeerd door een zo volledig mogelijke analyse uit te voeren. Aan de hand van deze analyse zijn eisen opgesteld voor het systeem, waaruit een ontwerp is voortgevloeid. Het systeem zal de kwantiteit en de kwaliteit van een BHV-inzet vergroten. De kwantiteit wordt vergroot door efficier gebruik te maken van BHVers. Wanneer een BHVer dicht bij een calamiteit is, kan deze snel ter plekke zijn. De kwaliteit wordt verbeterd door het overzicht wat alle BHVers van de situatie hebben. Tijdens het ontwerp is rekening gehouden dat het systeem uitgebreid moet kunnen worden. Om deze reden is het systeem modulair opgebouwd, waarbij elk deel zijn eigen informatie bevat en controleert. Het systeem bestaat uit twee delen; de server en de PDA's. De server staat in de alarmcentrale waaruit de gehele BHV-inzet wordt geconeerd. Hierop is een goed overzicht te zien van alle informatie die aanwezig is tijdens een inzet, zoals locatie van BHVers, taken en observaties. Op de PDAs is slechts het deel van de situatie te zien van de desbetreffende BHVer tot de locatie van zijn taak. Op deze manier beperkt het beeld van de BHVer zich tot de voor hem relevante informatie. Vanuit de tests is gebleken dat het systeem kans van slagen heeft wat betreft het bewijzen van zijn meerwaarde. Tijdens de tests bleek dat de routering die door BHVers zelf gedaan werd niet altijd de optimale is en door ondersteuning kan worden geoptimaliseerd. Verder wordt verwacht dat de BHVers de situatie beter onder controle zullen hebben doordat zij een beter beeld hebben van deze. Ten tijde van het schrijven van dit rapport zijn er nog geen tests uitgevoerd met ondersteuning van het systeem.","TNO; verkenningsoperatie","nl","bachelor thesis","TU Delft, Electrical Engineering, Mathematics, Computer Sci, Media and Knowledge Engineering","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","","","","",""

Door het combineren van deze warmtewisselaars, een kas en bodemopslag kan zonnewarmte worden gewonnen voor ruimteverwarming. In de zomer wordt de kasruimte met koud water gekoeld, waarbij het water opwarmt en wordt opgeslagen. In de winter wordt dit opgeslagen warme water gebruikt om de kas en de woning te verwarmen. Het water dat gebruikt wordt om de kas te verwarmen koelt af en kan in de zomer weer worden gebruikt om de kas te koelen. Hiermee herhaalt de cyclus zich. Op deze wijze moet het gebruik van fossiele brandstoffen voor ruimteverwarming worden teruggebracht. Het ontwerp voor de KlimaatPlusWoningen in Amsterdam is de aanleiding van dit onderzoek. Men wil dit systeem van warmtewinning toepassen om het gebruik van fossiele brandstoffen voor ruimteverwarming aanzienlijk terug te brengen. Door dit concept te combineren met opwekking van duurzame elektrische energie wil men woningen realiseren die netto elektrische energie produceren. Dit ontwerp is de aanleiding van dit onderzoek, dat zich richt op kaswoningen met Fiwihex en Smart Skin in het algemeen. Er is in dit rapport een formule afgeleid om het vermogen dat de Fiwihex levert te berekenen. Vergeleken met andere warmtewisselaars is de Fiwihex niet efficiënter. Wel is de verhouding tussen de hoeveelheid geleverde hulpenergie en het geleverde vermogen redelijk gunstig. Het geringe geluidsniveau, kostenoverwegingen en comfort kunnen redenen om toch te kiezen voor de Fiwihex. Deze aspecten zijn in dit rapport echter niet nader onderzocht. De Smart Skin is nog in ontwikkeling. Uit de beschikbare meetgegevens is het gedrag van de Smart Skin lastig te analyseren. Ook is het lastig om parameters af te leiden voor simulatie, de Smart Skin is dan ook niet opgenomen in de simulaties. De vermogens die dit systeem aan de ruimte levert zijn in de beschouwde meetsituatie behoorlijk. Ook de energie die wordt gewonnen door middel het water in de leidingen is substantieel. Het is lastig te bepalen hoe dit is op andere momenten. Wel moet opgemerkt worden dat de temperatuur van het water in de buisjes maar een beperkte invloedslengte heeft over het glas. De warmteoverdracht tussen het water en de lucht wordt effectiever als men de tussenafstand kleiner maakt. Het optreden van oppervlaktecondensatie op het glas is zeer waarschijnlijk. Als er geen warmtewisselaars in de kas worden ingezet worden er bij grote instraling relatief hoge temperaturen bereikt. In de winter kunnen de temperaturen relatief laag worden. Als warmtewisselaars in de kas worden geplaatst kan de kastemperatuur beter beheerst worden, toch blijven er in de onderzochte situatie incidentele pieken en dalen in de kastemperatuur. De periode dat de kas gebruikt kan worden als verblijfsruimte is beperkt. Uit analyse van de warmtestromen blijkt dat bij de uitgangspunten en aannames van dit onderzoek met twee warmtewisselaars in de kas kan worden voorzien in de warmtevraag van de woning. Het temperatuurverschil dat het water in de Fiwihex ondergaat is relatief klein. Als er meer warmtewisselaars worden ingezet wordt het temperatuurverschil kleiner.","","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Design and Construction","","","",""

Possible approaches that deal with this problem can roughly be split up into two parts: online mechanism design with and without monetary payments. By far, most research until now has focussed on the former of the two. Our main contribution is to the field of online mechanism design without money, where agents are allowed to trade items with other agents, in an attempt to improve their own allocation. In an off-line context, this problem is known as the House Allocation Problem (HAP). We present a general framework that extends HAP to an online problem, and call it the Time Slot Reservation Problem (TSRP). A key issue in both HAP and TSRP is that we want to reallocate items that are owned by agents, rather than the mechanism. As a consequence, agents are capable of blocking the outcome of a mechanism by not relinquishing their allocation. We present an algorithm, called the Time Slot Shifting Algorithm (TSSA), that takes this intricacy into account. A mechanism that uses TSSA as its allocation rule is shown to be strategy-proof, individually rational and Pareto optimal. Moreover, we argue that any mechanism that obtains an outcome in TSRP that cannot be obtained by using TSSA fails to be either strategy-proof or Pareto optimal.","house allocation; mechanism design; online dynamic; top trading cycle; pareto optimailty","en","master thesis","TU Delft, Electrical Engineering, Mathematics, Computer Sci, Computer Science","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","","","","",""

(mentor)","2009","The ongoing increase of imperviousness in urban areas and the increase of heavy storm events trigger the urge for more sustainable urban water systems to combat flooding in Brazil. In developed countries source control measures have been developed to combat the negative impact of these two factors and more sustainable urban water systems are developed. In developing countries, however, this is not the case. Most solutions in developing countries still focus on end-of-pipe measures. Rapid urbanization during the last decades, without adequate urban planning, has resulted in severe hydrologic and environmental impacts in Brazilian cities. This has already led to drought and flooding problems. Continuing this developing pattern, by increasing the imperviousness in urban areas, as well as expanding cities by low-density developments, will lead to exacerbation of these problems and does not lead to a sustainable water system. The sanitary philosophy, by which urban drainage systems are based on the concept of draining the water from urban surfaces as quickly as possible, is still much applied in Brazil. Canalization of urban streams, clandestine urban flood plain occupation, a lack of environmental awareness, a large sediment production and a large amount of solid waste disposal into the drainage system have lead to a systematic degradation process of urban streams. The triplet applied in The Netherlands of first retaining, then storing and ultimately discharging of stormwater contributes to a more stable urban drainage system. Measures like bioretention cells, infiltration trenches, green roofs and micro-reservoirs are getting more and more common practice in drainage systems in developed countries. Through a case study in a 6 km2 urban catchment (part of the Arroio da Areia catchment) in the city of Porto Alegre, the influence of different drainage approaches on the runoff is assessed. The catchment is modelled with the SWMM5 stormwater model, applying the kinematic wave approach. By modelling the current drainage system the bottlenecks are identified. In the current situation flooding occurs in 14 of the 31 nodes when modelled by a 10-year return period storm. The total flooding volume accounts up to almost 30,000 m3. The construction costs of the current macro drainage system are estimated at R$ 14.3 M. The objective of this case study is to present and assess alternative drainage approaches to combat these flooding problems and to present recommendations for future developments. It is shown that enlargement of the conduit diameters in the current drainage system layout to combat flooding is almost 2 times more expensive than solving the flooding problem by implanting detention basins or by adopting low impact development. It is also shown that the peak runoff produced by enlargement of the current drainage system is between 1.5 to 2 times higher than the peak runoff generated in case detention ponds or low impact development is adopted. It is concluded that by continuing development in the conventional way, by accelerating discharge of runoff and building low-density neighbourhoods, costs for society as well as the impact on the environment and on the liveability in the city are redundantly high. It is recommended that low impact development demonstration projects should be developed to build capacity among urban water and drainage professionals, in municipal departments as well as among companies active in the sector, and to increase awareness about the environment among the population.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Transport & Planning","","","",""
