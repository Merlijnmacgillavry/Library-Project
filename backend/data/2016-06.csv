(mentor); Verbruggen, A.H. (mentor)","2016","When the size of a system is reduced to the scale of single particles, classical thermodynamics fails to predict the system’s behaviour as quantum fluctuations come into play. Recently it has been proven by Binder et all. [1] that theoretically a quantum battery, consisting of qubits, can be charged faster (i.e. with higher power per qubit) when the qubits become entangled during the charging process. In this thesis such optimal charging is investigated for one specific type of quantum battery: an array of two identical electron spin qubits rotated by microwave radiation, coupled by nearest-neighbouring exchange interaction and considered in an environment without dissipation. As the wave function notation does not support environmental impact, the density matrix notation is used to describe the quantum dynamics of the driven electron spins. Solving the Von Neumann equation results in the solution describing the time evolution of such a quantum battery. This solution is used to calculate the extractable work; the result is an expression for extractable work which is not dependent on the exchange interaction. The reason for this independence is that exchange interaction couples two states which have the same energy level. Therefore, coupling qubits does not lead to faster charging of quantum battery. This conclusion is true for a quantum battery as defined before. For other assumptions entanglement could lead to optimal charging.","","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Applied Sciences","Kavli Institute of Nanoscience","","Applied Physics","",""

(mentor); Kooijman, A. (mentor)","2016","Travelling has the ability to gives us freedom to discover our surroundings in a spontaneously manner. However, struggles and frustration during travelling can cause many difficulties to reach this state of mind. In the current travel situation, we have to bring our luggage from our departure place to a transfer hub. After arriving at the destination, we recollect the luggage and wherefrom we travel to the final destination together with the luggage. This project started with the vision that in some years, we pack our bag or suitcase at home with what we need on our trip. Then, from the moment when we close and lock our suitcase or bag, until the moment when we arrive at our final destination, we do not have to care or think or worry about it. As a starting point, a scenario was used to set boundaries for the analysis and further design phases. The starting scenario was an innovative transport service, which takes away many struggles passengers experience during their journey from location A to B. The goal of the research was to test the current market state with the proposed scenario to be able to make the conclusion if there is a foundation to further develop this scenario into a service. Through an extended analysis of the current market, stakeholder (traveller, airport, airline, security and travel management companies) and technology state, a promising future for the presented scenario has been seen. Within the aviation travel industry, all stakeholders (except the traveller) show focus to increase the user experience of provided products and services. The traveller will start appreciate experiences more than buying products. In addition, their busy work schedule will increase the interest of travellers to use concierge services to manage their activities and let them redesign their work-life balance. In the analysis phase, a promising future for the presented scenario is presented, following by an extended ideation and conceptualization phase. Three concepts were created with the goal to provide travellers with a service that will allow struggle free door-to-door journey. Each concept is designed for a market introduction further in the future. The first concept is using transporters that pickup the travellers luggage from their departure location. From this moment until the moment of arrival, the service is taking care of all the luggage arrangements. With use of location tracking sensors, the luggage will communicate its location in real time to the traveller and other stakeholders. Drones are used to transport the luggage in the second concept. With the use of advanced scanners, the luggage will be checked when being transported from the departure location to the airport. With the drones dropping of the luggage close to the airplane, the benefit for airports are saving on their extended luggage transport system. For the final concept, the core value of current travelling is challenged by questioning why we are bringing luggage with us while travelling. What if we can travel without luggage and still enjoy our trip to the fullest. The designed service will provide the traveller with products needed on the trip. By using the method of weighted objectives, the no-luggage concept was chosen for further development. The concept evolved into the service James, that gives travellers the possibility to travel without any luggage and get a personalized offer based on the activity they want to undertake. Besides this practical offer, James also challenges the assumptions travellers have about the way you have to travel. The current type of travelling is based around planning most of your steps, where James offers the traveller to not plan at all and follow their impulses on the activities they want to undertake on their trips. James will take care of all the details. James offers travellers a personalized product offer based on the activity the traveller wants to do, the location they are and their personal preferences. Before use, each traveller has to create a Digital Fashion ID that consist of their body measurements, their eye, hair and skin colour and their brand and fashion preferences. This combination of variables, combined with the activity to undertake and location will be used by the algorithm of James. This algorithm will make a selection in the available products and provide every user with a suitable and personalized offer. For travellers the service James will free them from many travel irritations, since no luggage has to be carried around. When you can start travelling without the need to arrive at the airport hours before a flight, a flight and a holiday will start more relaxed. In addition, when you arrive at your destination, without the urge to bring your luggage to a hotel or other place of accommodation, you can immediately start exploring a destination, attend a meeting or meet with friends. In addition, James gives travellers the possibility to decide what they want to do when they want to do this, without the urge to plan these activities beforehand. Airlines, airports and security will see major benefits of the service James as well. Airlines will experience a decrease of luggage to transport from A to B, which benefits their total operation. First, they will save on their fuel bill. Second, the possibility exists to rent the leftover cargo space to transport companies. Finally, when their planes need replacement, they can decide to order smaller planes since the space is not needed anymore. Airports and security will experience even bigger changes in their operation structure. Their future operational system does not need to manage a huge amount of luggage anymore, which is currently the focus. In addition, a major part of airport security is related to luggage. When less check-in luggage is used, airport security can change their work focus to other security aspects. For both stakeholders this creates possibilities to focus fully on increasing the total passenger experience. The no-luggage service of James can also be an extension for travel management companies (TMC). The service has the capability to improve the overall travel experience of its clients and add more concierge functionality to their total offer. This means that the user of the service will be provided with everything that is needed. In a combination with planned activities, a TMC can use James to provide its clients with a completely organized trip and activity. James shows many benefits for its stakeholders; however, its main strength is its ability to challenge the assumptions stakeholders have about the way we have to travel. Instead of accepting that you have to travel with luggage, James offers the possibility to do the opposite.","smart travel; travel; luggage; future; innovation; service design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Garcia Gonzalez, Y. (mentor)","2016","Marine pipelines at the sea bottom are protected by a coating to prevent corrosion. Lifetime of coating are limited by coatings delamination. Delamination is caused by ingression of seawater through the coating and later attack of the metal. A zirconium conversion pre-treatment applied on the metal is used to improve the adhesion between the coating and metal substrate. During in-service lifetime, pipelines encounter cyclic loadings due to vortex induced vibrations or movements of fluid within the pipe which might affect the mechanical properties of the coating. The goal of this work is to investigate the effect of these cyclic loadings combined with immersion period on the epoxy coatings on the steel with and without a zirconium conversion layer. Samples are stressed in the elastic, and plastic region (of the steel) in uniaxial tensile direction, and also they strained up to 5% to investigate the effect of mechanical damage. After these tests, samples are immersed in NaCl solution for 30 days to evaluate the barrier properties of the coatings and compared their performance with the unstressed immersed samples. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is used to monitor the protective properties of the coatings. Finally, adhesion tests are performed to see whether or not the adhesion strength of epoxy decreases by the combination of mechanical loading and immersion. Immersion of 30 days does not affect the coating barrier properties and Epoxy coated systems with and without Zr-pretreatment showed high barrier properties after 30 days of immersion in corrosive environment. Coated samples with and without Zr-pretreatment were not affected by cyclic loading in the elastic region. No cracks in the coatings were detected. Only a slightly increased of the roughness was noticed. EIS results showed that barrier properties of the coatings after elastic cyclic-loading are not affected and remained constant after the 30 days of immersion. Different behaviour after cyclic loading in the plastic region between treated and un-treated samples is observed. Samples without pre-treatment showed a decreasing of the barrier properties during the immersion test while treated-samples showed still high performance. An explanation is that cyclic loading in the plastic region affect significantly the polymer structure, creating a more open network. Then the penetration of solution is facilitated, affecting the protection properties of the coating. Additionally the roughness of the coatings increased significantly for (un)-treated samples. This is caused by a rougher steel substrate and the formation of shear bands in the epoxy coating. However the pre-treated samples showed no changes in the barrier properties. This may be associated to the better adhesion between the polymer and coating by the presence of zirconium layer. The adhesion strength is significantly affected by elastic/ plastic cyclic loading and 30 days of immersion for untreated and treated samples. More investigation is needed to discover if cyclic loading affects the adhesion strength or the combination of cyclic loading and immersion period. However it is believed that cyclic loading has an influence on the adhesion strength; the decrease of adhesion strength by only immersion is limited while the adhesion strength after cyclic loading and immersion has a much higher detrimental influence.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Marine and Transport Technology","","Maritime Technology & Materials Science","",""

Further cost is incurred if panels have variable thicknesses throughout their cross-section. These variations can take the form of edge-returns in cladding elements (required for detailing), stiffening ribs (required for structure) or simply surface textures (required for architectural expression). In the context of free-form concrete geometries, fabrication of such features becomes even more difficult. Current moulding systems for such elements are in no means cost-effective as individual moulds are still required for every unique panel. What is required is a more flexible approach to the fabrication of complex free-form geometries: a hybrid system of already-existing techniques. The proposed setup will be a combination of existing systems which includes flexible moulding to cast double-curved panels of uniform cross-section and concrete additive manufacturing for the addition of surface details. The study will explore the possibility of efficiently fabricating complex free-form concrete panels with integrated edge details, ribs and/or surface textures in a more effieient manner than current moulding techniques","adaptable mould; concrete additive manufacturing; freedom fabrication; robotic fabrication","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Architectural Engineering and Technology","","Building Technology","",""

The city of Varna in Bulgaria is a site for the application of an approach. The water streams, which flow around the city centre, and which are the source of both a great hazard and potential, are chosen for a utopian expression of an urban authenticity through the landscape. The design shows possibilities for their integration in the city. The streams are directed through the urban interstices as an illustration of enrichment of spatial, cultural, environmental, and economic qualities of the place. The resulting conclusion however is that initial flows of the stream can be treated as a dynamic feature for understanding possible relations between the city spaces, and reveals existing values of the city interstices. And, the authentic landscape is concluded to resonate with the human environment it approaches.","landscape architecture; placeness; authenticity; identity; public space; flowscapes; water management","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Urbanism","","Landscape Architecture","",""

This research discusses the possibilities for building product supplier to transact their product by using alternative transaction methods, known as Product-Service Systems. It has done so by examining five case studies in which five different building products are used to determine the financial yield of two types of PSS transactions: sale and buyback and lease. The findings from the case studies have been compared with the yields of a regular sale transactions and do not appear to be financially feasible, due to extra costs, expenses and risks the supplier would need to take during the use of the product. The findings from the case studies of both sale and buyback and lease have also been used to determine the possibility of a building being developed with the use of PSS only. Based on the financially negative finding, this is assumed not to be possible.This leads to the assumption a circular economy is only to be implemented successfully in case resource prices increase, possibly in combination with decreasing labour costs for the supplier.","circular economy; construction industry; suppliers; building products; circular building; financial business model; PSS","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Management in the Built Environment","","","",""

(mentor); Hausleitner, B. (mentor)","2016","Waste is one of the core problems in sustainable city design. In current city planning waste management systems are often disregarded. However, concepts that deal with waste and resources within urban areas are getting more and more attention. ‘Zero waste’ is one of the most visionary concepts for solving waste problems. The concept of the zero waste neighbourhood includes a 90% recycling rate and recovery of all resources from waste materials. However, it has been found that there are many challenges in the development of zero waste concepts in the urban context. The challenges relate to social, political, economic, technological and environmental contexts. This thesis focuses on Buiksloterham, a neighbourhood in Amsterdam. In order to design (spatial) interventions for zero waste Buiksloterham, 31 solutions are developed that aim to reduce, re-use and recycle household waste in the urban district. These general solutions are combined in the booklet ‘Waste Solutions to use in Urban Districts’. An integrated approach has resulted in the design of seven zero waste interventions for Buiksloterham. The design showed that there are five conditions that contribute to the development of Buiksloterham as zero waste neighbourhood: the available space, the mixed use area development, the level of participation of stakeholders, the different stages of development and the scale. The interventions in Buiksloterham can provide interesting urban program, contribute to the urban quality of the area and create a new public domain. It has been estimated that by implementing the interventions Buiksloterham could transform in a 85% zero waste neighbourhood. The design has resulted in five recommendations for zero waste Buiksloterham and five recommendations for zero waste Amsterdam. Nevertheless, in the transition to circular cities there is more needed than urban design. We have to think and act different and we have to invest in new ways of working, producing and consuming. However, this thesis showed that zero waste interventions can be integrated in an urban area, can bring urban quality and in that way can contribute in the transition to circular cities.","zero waste; circular cities; circular economy; waste solutions; household waste; urban metabolism; urban design; Buiksloterham; Amsterdam","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Urbanism","","","",""

In every step of the design process the geometry was tested for its structural efficiency and the goal was to reduce the amount of the needed materials in order to reduce the costs. Furthermore, perforations were created on the canopy so that light can penetrate the canopy and to reduce the needed material. The final step of the optimization of the structure was to find the ideal combination of shell thickness and FRP laminate thickness. The designed canopy that has spans of 40m between some of the support points has a shell thickness of 7cm and plies of laminate of 5mm. When the geometry was optimized issues like panel division, transportation of the panels, water management and drainages, connections between the panels and the production technique of the panels were solved.","Form finding; Shell structures; Canopy; FRP; Composites; Fibres; Polymers","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Architectural Engineering and Technology","","Building Technology","",""

(mentor)","2016","In the last decades, measurement while drilling, or MWD, technology has set foot in the drill and blast tunnelling industry. Penetration rate, thrust, torque pressure, percussive pressure, rotation speed, water flow and water pressure are registered on a centimetre scale and processed to parameters more dependent on geology. These parameters could ideally be used to adapt the blast design for a more efficient blast and to predict the amount of rock support needed. In reality, MWD technology is often only used to document geology. The main reasons for this could be that the workflow is not fully adapted to the MWD technology, the knowledge about MWD is not sufficient or the ability of MWD to represent the geology has not been extensively investigated and verified for drill and blast tunnelling. MWD has great potential since it is a relatively cheap and simple method of collecting a larger amount of data, which does not interfere with the workflow in drill and blast tunnelling. The aim is to investigate the ability to detect discontinuities and their geometrical properties in MWD data and to evaluate the usability of MWD data in terms of detecting discontinuities. The first of five objectives is a literature review on the subjects of MWD technology, discontinuities in rock masses, previous research and statistical data analysis methods. Raw MWD parameters are processed and filtered by software, which can somewhat be seen as eliminating influences such as depth dependency and percussive pressure. This results in modified penetration rate, torque or water pressure which represents rock mass properties. Previous research showed the inability to compare MWD data and available geological reporting about fractures was due to a large difference in scale. For statistical analysis of MWD data in this study 4 methods are considered. Principle component analysis and k-means cluster analyses are forms of unsupervised learning and can potentially help to understand and reduce complexity of multivariate datasets. Linear and logistic regressions are forms of supervised learning that can give insight into predictability and potentially predict the presence discontinuities. The second objective is to gather data, which is appropriate and detailed enough to study relations between MWD data and discontinuities. Two tunnels under construction are visited where limestone and highly foliated phyllite are the dominant rock types. These are the Solbakktunnelen and Bjørnegårdtunnelen. While not disturbing the construction work, different methods of detailed geological mapping are used. Blasthole remains used as scanlines for mapping discontinuities and mapping discontinuities in the contour and face led to a dataset reflecting the geological situation in tunnels. Another method for mapping discontinuities, which is not influenced as much by blasting, is borehole inspection. The use of an inspection camera and an optical televiewer resulted in 11 video footages and 25 detailed recordings of 5 meter long boreholes. The third objective is to evaluate the data by a visual comparisons of geological data and MWD data. Comparing the mapped geology and 3D images of MWD data showed that fractures with a certain infill or aperture are visible in MWD data. The more detailed geological data showed that an open fracture or a fracture with soft infill and an aperture wider than 1cm often leads to a peak in penetration rate, rotation pressure, processed penetration and processed rotation pressure. The fourth objective is to apply statistical methods to come to a more in depth understanding of the relation between MWD data and discontinuities and confirm findings in objective 3. Since it is suspected that only the actual location and aperture can be predicted, a vector is made by assigning the number 1 to each MWD sampling depth between the upper and lower boundary of a discontinuity. For intact rock, a 0 is assigned to each MWD sampling depth. The principle component analyses showed that the dataset could be reduced to a manageable number of 5 to 7 components and that around 80% of the variability was retained. K-means cluster analyses is found to be an appropriate analysis for 2 out of 4 datasets. It led to the understanding that responses in MWD data due to lithological discontinuities without an aperture cannot be separated from intact rock. Training the data with logistic regression analyses confirmed this finding. Logistic regression did however differentiate MWD data of open fractures from other MWD data in half of the collected data. 2 out of 3 fractures were predicted, but the exact location and size of predicted fractures differ slightly from the real location. The regression for the fractures with soft infill was successful for a quarter of the data. 6 out of 9 fractures with clayey infill were predicted, again with a small deviation in size. Testing the regression equations on test datasets, which were not part of the input for data training, did not lead to the correct prediction of fractures. The last objective is to discuss the current and future usability of MWD data for the Norwegian Public Roads Administration. Even though the statistical analyses did not fully succeed in separating responses of fractures in MWD data, visually responses are found to be characteristic. The fact that not all discontinuities give a distinctive response, makes calculations of rock quality designation unreliable. Therefore, in terms of rock support, MWD data can only assist in decision making concerning spot bolting to secure wedges due to large fractures. This research might contribute to help understand and predict grout volumes. The use of 3D images of MWD data could give a better understanding of the in situ fracture structure. Ideally, this knowledge can be used to anticipate possible under- and overbreak due to these fractures before blasting. Considering the findings in this study, it is still presumed that MWD technology has great potential even if it might not lead to the prediction of each type of discontinuity.","MWD data; Drill and Blast tunnelling; discontinuities in rock; principle component analysis; k-means cluster; logistic regressions","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","","",""

This landscape is facing the transition due to the decommissioning of nuclear power plant. Decommissioning involves dismantling power plant at the final stage. But it takes more than that. Decommissioning deletes atomgrads economy, population, identity, cultural and technical achievements, threatens built structures in the city and raises questions about the role of the buffer landscape. Considering the impact of the decommissioning and the potentials in remaining spatial and social structures, the project upcycles energy structures and knowledge, enhances and maintains the rich nature and uncovers the potentials of the nuclear power plant to be seen as industrial heritage. It proposes an alternative decommissioning process that adds to region’s economy and strengthens natural and cultural qualities. The strategy with 6 layers, which derives from exploratory scenarios, is built to upcycle spatial and social structures. It gives the ability for people to control radiation, uses phytotechnologies to clean the sites and prevent from further contamination, biodynamic farms as means to increase biodiversity and for a safe food production in areas with higher levels of radionuclides, it proposes an energy transition from centralized energy generation to regional distributed energy generation subgrid, facilities, diversity of workplaces for the researchers and entrepreneurs, preservation of industrial heritage.

(mentor); Bilow, M. (mentor); Turrin, M. (mentor)","2016","The pop-up office graduation project is inspired by technologies developed in the field of fabric products (structures and technologies that can be efficiently incorporated within the field of construction). The aim is to come up with a new approach for mobile temporary structures and more specifically a working space unit (high-tech but with relatively low cost). The main reason for such an attempt is the design idea for transportable working spaces that would follow the mobile character of services provided by many professionals. It is entirely true that in many cases all that professionals need, to work, is a laptop that includes their personal database and an inspiring place at the right location. Nowadays the phenomenon of vacant office buildings is very common. The economic crisis has caused a decrease in activity in business sector. A complementary parameter though is that working spaces are being built for companies that do not have a long term plan. The consequence of this is that after a short period of time the company closes or transfers somewhere else and the building hosts no use. Obviously, a temporary structure would have been a better option in this case. This situation initiates the pop-up office idea. The technological background of the project is prevalent, on the essence that every element of the design has its functional purpose and the minimal architectural expression, achieved through the design details. As in the saying of functionalist Luis Sullivan “Form follows function”, it is part of architecture to take care of the product that it is “solid, useful and beautiful”. This thesis investigates practical configurations of fabric structures that can create the effect of a fodable unit that can pop-up with the help of air support and a lightweight sub-structure. Next to this, all the complementary elements are also parts of the investigation. The idea is to make a design that can be efficiently used and fixed in case of failure. Next to this, all the technology incorporated does not need to be hidden but is nicely highlighted. This is a way to combine components and services’ accessibility with a unique state of the art that as aforementioned exists in the nice detailing of the functional elements. Within the context of building temporary structures the main goal of this research is to end up with an innovative design for a single-storey, fabric structure unit. The small size of the unit has to do with the innovative character of the design that demands a scientific background and a lot of testing of mock ups and small scale structures, in order to prove the efficiency of the system and examine the potential for units of a bigger size. The priorities set to indicate the preferable materials for the design are the following: The structure should be easy to install, uninstall and transfer. So the materials should fit in the concept of a “flexible” structure that can be folded and unfolded several times, on the way that the finally chosen technology indicates. Next to this, thermal comfort and tightness are very important, to make the use of this unit possible with the least support of extra installations to provide thermal comfort. From a building physics perspective, the scenario of designing an office has the advantage that it is used on average only for 40 (fourty) hours per week, during the sunniest hours of the day. To summarize, this is a design project, developed through an extensive research on fabric construction and prototyping with fabrics and films. The result of the research is a suggestion about a fabric skin in which the layering and configuration based on specific materials and technologies meet the requirements set for the design. The exploitation on fabric structures started from recognizing the type of textile construction that presents the highest potential for the pop-up office design. Since it has been decided that the structure will be inflatable, the focus was shifted on developing this specific technology. The main vision that guides this project is the transformation of the engineering of a fabric design on a level that the final result will be closer to a well- thought building construction and further from common tent structures. This vision is meant in the essence that the tightness of the façade and the thermal performance of it have been taken into consideration, together with the energy efficiency of the “building”. This is a big step to be taken towards using fabric and film materials with the purpose of building sustainably. All the inspiration sources, the knowledge gained within the project and the storyline of the design are included in this report. The means used for the development of the design are: at the preliminary stage sketches, prototypes and later on 3d modeling was added. The benefit gained from the practical approach of “getting your hands dirty”is the insight grown on how the fabric skin can be simply produced and which are the directions for its optimization. Furthermore, the prototyping process has functioned as a step towards the production of the proposed design. It has lead to deep realization of the design and influenced the project development radically.","fabric; structure; pop-up; inflatable","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Architectural Engineering and Technology","","Building Technology","",""

Who takes a look at the maps of Netherland spread through the centuries, realizes how structuring the water is for the Delta. The Dutch don’t panic when there is a large storm flood or when the riverbanks are flooded again. They deal with the water ingenious and with a lot of knowledge, if they want to control, stop or guide. They use it in their advantage, at sea or in the harbour, which is the link between the maritime world and the economy of the hinterland. They enjoy the beauty of the water and can enjoy it intensely by swimming, sailing and even ice-skating. The knowledge and technology that the Dutch use for centuries in dealing with water, are a source of amazement for the rest of the world. With the changing climate –if this is temporarily or structural, if it is created by mankind or is caused by a natural cyclus- the water urges for action. It rains more and heavier, the rivers are overflowing and not least of all the sea level rises. Again all eyes are focused on the Dutch; how are they going to deal with this? And what can the rest of the world learn from this? Nationwide there is a shift in dealing with water, water is no longer seen as the enemy. It is no longer kept out, but more and more plans show that water is treated as a friend. Polders are allowed to flood, dams are opened, living areas are build in and on the water, dikes and dunes are combined, rivers are widened. Engineers and designers learn to speak each others language and the creativity in relation to water gets a new impulse.

As the company is moving from products to products and services, there is a need for understanding the value created by the product service system for creating better justified propositions. In this B2B scenario, value can be defined as the tradeoff between benefits and sacrifices. The value in use for each airline which can be broken down into multiple value creating activities. The analysis contributes to the ongoing debate on value based pricing for services in the domain of servitization. It also brings in a new perspective for pricing with value creation activities for value based pricing. The study also demonstrates that it is possible to convert product and service features into value creating activities and use the monetary values to convert benefits and sacrifices for value based selling. A tool is developed for the context of an airline trolley, which can be expanded to other areas of the sector. At it current level of detail, the tool helps sales managers to communicate the value-in-use of the trolley, for each airline based on its fleet size, trolleys used onboard etc. This value quantification could enable the sales team to define value-in-exchange (price) more in line with the value-in-use and create better value propositions between the supplier and stakeholders. This tool could also help in developing market intelligence, effectively categorising the customers by their preferences on value creating activities. In conclusion this enables ZCAE to have an overall perspective of the benefits and sacrifices for the airline as well as the supplier.There are however, a few limitations to this study and subsequently to the tool. Multiple parameters of the tool have been subjectively defined through their perceived importance for certain airlines. Due to the exploratory and dynamic nature of the study, more clarity is required for certain assumptions which is achievable through a more expansive research.","value-in-use; servitization; value quantification","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","","",""

(mentor); Turrin, M. (mentor)","2016","The Adaptive membrane envelope subject originates from the upcoming need for more lightweight structures in the building sector. Since high amounts of energy are wasted for construction and erection of buildings, the idea for lightness becomes essential especially in the case of office buildings, the glass facades of which can weight thousands of tonnes. On the other hand despite the need for glass facades in office buildings in order to perform working tasks more effeciently and create a healthy indoor environment, there is also need for solar control. The reason for this is that even though daylight is essential for the users it can create problems when it occurs either in large quantities or in bad quality, causing discomfort to the users. Therefore, in order to achieve efficient solar control and consequently acceptable visual comfort levels in a working space, the users need a facade system that can be transparent and protective at the same time. A pssible solution to that problem could be an adaptive envelope that can respond to both needs at the same time, giving the possibility to the users to choose the desired level of transparency that they need at different points in time. Combining the two problematics mentioned before we end up to the subject of the current Master thesis, which tries to provide a solution for an adaptive envelope for office buildings using really lightweight materials and more specifically membranes that are efficient for buildings. The proposed solution that is the outcome of this research includes an adaptive mebrane envelope system, using innovative materials and techniques, with an experimental character. Therefore the design of that envelope includes Fibre reinforced Polymers as structural elements, along with membrane cushions in the form of modular components, finally achieving the desired solar control with the incorporation of techniques and materials, used in the field of Soft robotics, a field that provides really innovative solutions in adaptive mechanisms. Based on that solutions, the adaptivity in our case is provided by pneumatic silicone rubber modules that can take various different positions, providing the indoor space with various degrees of shading, just by adjusting the internal pressure in their chambers. However, since that field is currently emerging, a lot of research was needed regarding the materials and the way they perform, as well as the design of pneumatic systems. In order to achieve the desired effect various physical models were fabricated, until the final version that performs according to the basic idea. However there is still space for a lot of improvement and many ideas that could be implemented to increase the value of the system, bringing it to a whole different level of performance, since the opportunities in that field are currently blossoming.","adaptivtivity; membranes; building envelope; solar control; soft robots","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Urbanism","","Urbanism and Building Sciences","",""

(mentor); Qu, L. (mentor)","2016","The amount of one person households is rapidly growing in the Netherlands. Unfortunately solo dwellers are still disadvantaged, stigmatised and forgotten in urban design since society expects them to be in a relationship. This is exemplified by the focus on families and couples in cities and housing developments. As a result there is a lack of suitable housing for solo dwellers and the living quality among one person households is low. Therefore this thesis investigates the needs of people living solo and uses this information to re-design the Pols on Katendrecht, a neighbourhood within Rotterdam. The living quality of one person households can be improved by considering social places, centralities and housing. Social places facilitate the need for social interaction among solo dwellers and therefore enhance their appreciation of the living environment. Social places should be present both in public space, like bars and restaurants, and in the residential environment by creating transition zones. Especially these transition zones create the opportunity to casually interact with others like neighbours. Centralities facilitate the social places in public space as well as other amenities. These amenities on one hand create a convenient living environment for solo dwellers with shops, takeaways and small enterprises. On the other side it also attracts other users resulting in an dynamic and lively environment. Special attention within the living environment should be given to developing suitable and affordable housing. Suitable housing results in a mixture of housing typologies to fit the needs of the multiplicity of solo dwellers. Affordability is needed to make sure one person households can afford a house despite their single salary. If these three themes are taken into account, as this graduation project exemplifies, a neighbourhood based on solo dwellers arises which is also attractive to other household types.","One person households; solo dwellers; Katendrecht; Rotterdam; Transition zone; social places; centralities; ViP model; public space; living quality; social interaction; lifestyle","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Urbanism","","","","51.90233, 4.49166"

(mentor)","2016","A teleoperation system consists of an operator interface (master) controlling a slave system in a remote virtual environment. When the slave’s environmental forces are fed back to the operator, this is called haptic force-feedback. An impedance-type master device ideally has a large range of stable achievable impedances, i.e. a small free space impedance, together with a large stable closed-loop impedance. In addition, the rendered force should be accurate: the resemblance between the rendered and desired force should be large. In haptic design, those properties are quantified as the Z-Width and the Transparency. However, the properties to achieve those results, often contradict. This thesis develops a method that relates component level choices the selected performance criteria. This allows direct design trade-offs, enabling the designer to optimize for desired haptic performance. It consists of three steps: first the Key Performance Indicators, KPI's, are determined: the Z-Width and the Transparency. Then the effect of individual physical properties on maximum stable rendering and the KPI's is evaluated. The final step is to determine how component level choices affect the physical parameters and thereby the KPI's, since the physical parameters are often interrelated in component level choices. The focus will be on the well-known Haptic Paddle Configuration, and tests will be performed on the Gemini haptic paddle device. This experimentally validated approach, in combination with the reduction in computational effort, enables designers of haptic devices to optimize for closed-loop haptic performance","haptic feedback; force-feedback; impedance-type device; virtual environment","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2017-06-30","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Precision and Microsystems Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Jansen, J. (mentor); Stuyfzand, P.J. (mentor); Schoups, G.H.W. (mentor)","2016","PWN is the drinking water supplier for the Province of North Holland in the Netherlands. They manage a deep infiltration system (DWAT) since 1990 with wells between NAP -55 and NAP -90 meters, which are used to inject water and to extract it after at least 60 days to produce drinking water. Renovation of these wells will lead to an increased pumping capacity (from 50 to 90 m3/hour/well) of the extraction wells and creates opportunities for a more flexible operation. Seasonal fresh water storage can be applied to deal with the difference in water demand between summer and winter. PWN applies a continuous injection (30 m3/hour/well) and aims to get an annual injection volume which is 5% larger than the extraction volume. A period of maximum extraction is compensated by lower extraction rates during the remaining months of that year so that the total extraction volume remains the same. The objective of this research is to examine the effects of a more flexible approach on the extracted chloride concentrations and the salinity around the system. A new combined flow and transport model for the DWAT area is developed. Two programs are used in order to derive a stable transport model without large initial fluxes. First, MODFLOW's SWI package was used to develop a large groundwater model with a low computational effort. SWI was used to simulate the interface position and to find boundary conditions that matched with measured interface depths and groundwater levels. Second, the boundary conditions, interface depths, and groundwater levels were used to set up a smaller flow and transport model with SEAWAT. PWN constrains the application of seasonal storage by requiring a minimum residence time of 60 days which limits the duration of maximum extraction. Borst (2015) has shown that the maximum extraction rate of 90 m3 /hour/well can be applied up to 45 consecutive days with standard injection. No significant effects on the fresh-salt interface can be seen after this increased extraction period. Model results show that the past 26 years of DWAT operation have formed brackish cones just outside the DWAT system, particularly at the sea side. Measurements confirm the occurrence of upconing around the system. Seasonal storage has a small influence on the brackish cones: it influences the salinity around the system by a slight expansion of the brackish groundwater volume, but the extracted chloride concentrations do not increase over the years since PWN requires an annual infiltration surplus of 5%. This research indicates that the limitation on the extraction of groundwater is influenced more by the residence time restriction (as computed by Borst (2015)) than by the chloride concentration restriction (<150 mg Cl-/l). A more flexible approach can be applied if the system design is modified to increase the residence times. Another option is to perform an optimization of the operation approach that minimizes the salinity and maximizes the residence times while storing and recovering water.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Water Management","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","The Pokemon video game franchise is based on players, also known as trainers, capturing and battling with fictitious creatures called Pokemon. Competitive Pokemon battling is a complicated business. Before even stepping into the arena, a trainer must design a competitively viable team of six Pokemon to battle with. This task is a difficult one because there are currently 721 species of Pokemon to construct a team from, and new Pokemon are revealed every year. The author therefore developed the Score-Based Pokemon Analysis algorithm, also known as SBPA, to aid users in easily and quickly designing new Pokemon teams. The SBPA algorithm relies heavily on user interaction, and therefore requires the user to have already chosen at least one Pokemon to build his/her team around. The algorithm then analyzes the Pokemon the user has already chosen and returns a selection of Pokemon that would best further the development of the team. The user then chooses another team member, and the process is repeated until the user has developed his/her team. The SBPA algorithm analyzes the inputted team using three factors: Base Statistics, Typing, and the Popularity Factor. These three factors are then combined to determine the best potential team members per iteration. The algorithm focuses not only on user interactivity, but also on time efficiency in order to provide valuable information to the user in a time frame that would be impossible to a technologically unaided trainer. As a cost for its speed and user-friendliness, SBPA is less accurate in determining the absolutely optimal team than certain other algorithms. However, when considering the target market of the algorithm, the author found these compromises worthwhile.","","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Delft Institute of Applied Mathematics","","","",""

By this way, they obtain more job opportunities and better education resources. However, also because of it, they are caught in a dilemma. On one hand, they want to learn more, a survey shows that the situation of lacking basic skills like English and basic science is very serious in Mexico. An interview of student and worker commuters also reveals their great demands of learning basic skills. Students need these basic knowledge to catch up with their class, and for workers, they want to know what they are doing so that they can help themselves. However on another hand, they actually do not have time for this self-developing learning. Every day they have to spend averagely 6 hours on bus and crossing the border, which means a terrible five-to-nine routine. Especially on the border crossing, they have to join the lines to cross the border and in maximum they could have a 2 hours delay here. This lost of time is directly linked to the lost of life quality. Commuters are too exhausted by the long-time transportation and have no time to join the basic life activities such as going to the active markets in Juarez, let alone developing themselves. These kinds of “border” situation then lead me to a design assignment that I want to build an efficient system that can turn their terrible routine into a time-saving one along with quality educational and social services. So that the time lost situation of them can be converted to a time investment system.","border; library; markets; commuters; complex projects","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Architectural Engineering and Technology","","Complex Projects","",""

The research part of personal experiment of packing my own apartment. Activities timeline is introduced to estimate the usage of one day and the studies is focused on how much volume we can save by packing the unused space. The result we have is 80% volume saved by fully pack the space, and 61% for picking space according to activities time-line in one day. Applying the same method of calculation from the research chapter, we got the average volume use of one dwelling floor in the block over one day is 18.9%. Taking the advantage of “PACK and PICK”, is that means we can put 3 times more people in the floor because of “PACK and PICK”? As result, there are conflicts between neigbourhood once the density glowed, in term of volume, privacy, view & light, the limited condition on the floor. The PackCity is now an attempt to introduce as less mono-function stable elements in the block, by redefining the function of packs and elements and sharing condition in the block, to achieve the mimimum volume of packs and maxmium the freedom on the formation of activities with the right value of space condition. From the principle of space performance to the technical built environment transformation, the relationship between each elements in the block became the important focus to achieve the goal of maximum density and new space possibilities.","pop-up; architecture; tailor-made; bottom-up; change-over-time; co-housing; the why factory; egocity","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Architecture","","","",""

(mentor); Borota, D. (mentor)","2016","Underwater robotics face an interesting challenge. Since electromagnetic waves barely propagate underwater, systems like GPS are unusable. However, for a robot to function autonomously, it needs to be able to know its position. Because of this, using acoustic waves for transmitting signals underwater has been established to be the way forward. As of yet this has been insufficiently researched for confined and shallow-water environments specifically. Fleet Cleaner is a start-up company working on a ship hull maintenance robot that functions both above and underwater. This thesis is written in part as the next step in their research to develop an underwater acoustic positioning system for use with the Fleet Cleaner robot. One of the challenges faced is that of multipath propagation. Acoustic waves from a transmitter arrive at a receiver through multiple paths at different times. This makes localisation significantly harder. Being able to predict these propagation paths would alleviate this problem. The main objective of the project this thesis is part of is therefore: ""Developing a propagation model of an underwater acoustic signal in a shallow-water environment"". The project was split up in three parts, where this thesis describes the part titled ""Validation of model properties"". Here, the main objective is to answer the question: ""Does the product or system meet the needs of the client?"" This thesis describes the process of finding the answer to this question given the requirements and constraints of the project within which was operated. This thesis contains evaluation of channel deconvolution methods, methods of signal and data comparison, testing procedures and validation methods and schemes. The results of these evaluations are explained and whether the models developed are useful in localising a transmitter amidst a set of receiver is determined.","","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","2021-07-01","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics","","BSc.

(mentor)","2016","Heavy transport vessels (HTVs) are widely used in long-distanced dry-tow transport. Currently, two end operations, loading and discharge, are executed in harbours or protected waters where waves are virtually non-existent. There is potentially a huge market demand to execute these operations at offshore sites. To expand such operations to the offshore open seas, a systematic investigation of vertical motions between HTV and cargo is needed. The main challenge brought by these offshore discharge and loading operations is the small gap between HTV and cargo, both subject to environment conditions (waves, current, wind etc). Non-linearity due to gap flow is found from previous forced oscillation tests and CFD calculations. This thesis seeks to tackle this non-linearity in the time-domain framework. The thesis report starts with the literature study based on Molin where the external forced due to forced-oscillation is described for a deeply-submerged circular disc extremely close to seabed. It has been found that inertial and cushioning forces are dominant for the small gap problem. Essentially, both forces can be expressed by added mass. The evaluations cases in the thesis are circular cylinders with certain drafts, for which the free surface effect must also be addressed by employing separation of frequency technique. The problem is divided into two parts for time domain equations in convolution form: gap part and free surface part. Gap part is frequency independent whereas free surface part is frequency dependent due to radiated waves generated by oscillating cargo. For the latter, it has been concluded that free surface part is largely independent of gap part, thus keeping radiation force by convolution integration untouched. After separation of frequency, the main task is to find the proper formulations to quantify the gap part force. Two important variables have been identified: gap height and inclination angle. The quantification starts with verification for two numerical tools: AQWA and New method. Both tools are sufficiently accurate to quantify the influence from gap height and inclination angle on added mass of vertical motions. Thus, the external force is obtained and validated against measurements from forced oscillation tests and analytical results from Molin. With constructed formulations for added mass, the DLL for external force can be implemented into time domain solver. The implementation can be done via two approaches: interpolation of database approach and direct formulation approach. Moreover, a systematic scheme has been proposed to implement time domain simulations for the small gap problem. Preliminary time domain simulations of regular waves at natural frequency show that the conventional linear results over-predict the heave response compared to non-linear results. This systematic methodology to implement time domain simulations will throw light on further analysis for workability.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-06-30","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Marine and Transport Technology","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

(mentor); Wetzer, J. (mentor)","2016","Power transformers are valuable assets in the power network, and have as the primary function to regulate the transmission and distribution voltage. A large amount of capital is required to manufacture, transport, install and maintain them. As the load in the network changes, the voltage needs to be regulated. Load change is the result of demand fluctuations and of the gradual increase over time of average demand. Power Transformers are static devices and the only moveable part present in the power transformer is the tap changer which is used to change the turns ratio. With the change in load the voltage is regulated to reduce the losses and prevent from losing the synchronization. Tap changer failure is one of the leading causes of failure of power transformers. The majority of the tap changer failures are caused by degrading contacts. This may be the result of contact wear or of carbon deposition on the contacts due to on-load tap changing action. Proper maintenance therefore requires a diagnostic system which can judge the conditions of the contacts. There are various methods to diagnose the conditions of the tap changer contacts. The diagnostic system studied in this thesis is the Dynamic Resistance Measurement which is an offline technique. There are different tap changing mechanisms and two of them are covered in this thesis: • The MR tap changer which is an example of a “diverter switch type tap changer”. • The SMIT tap changer which is an example of a “selector switch type tap changer”. After introducing the tap changer and its operating mechanisms, for the most commonly used mechanisms, this thesis will firstly focus on explaining the working principles of the measurement system. The method to perform the measurement on the power transformer is independent of the tap changing mechanism, but it does depend on the type arrangement in which the three phase windings are connected on the primary side. Secondly, the thesis will show the influence of the different faults on the data that is acquired by the measuring system, which is dependent on the tap changing mechanism. Thirdly, based on the indicators of failures; a MATLAB code is written for each of the two tap changing mechanisms separately that shall extract those fault indicators from the measured data to identify and locate the fault. The analysis is applied to real life measured the data of different transformers achieved by the dynamic resistance measurement. The main conclusion is that it is definitely possible to perform an automated analysis on dynamic resistance measurement data. This was demonstrated by building a code and confronting the results with those of expert analysis for a number of power transformer tap changers. Several more detailed conclusions are drawn, and recommendations are given to further improve and apply the methodology of automated interpretation in future.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-06-30","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Electrical Sustainable Energy","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","Shell structures are expensive structures due to their extensive construction time and costs making them unpopular in spite of their material and structural efficiency. Temporary support structures are now based on the weight of the structure without taking into account what the incomplete structure can carry by itself. Structural characteristics of shell structures and modern computational methods do provide a solid platform to optimize the construction procedure of these nature adaptive and esthetically pleasing structures. This would save time and money through exclusion of set up time, reduced scaffolding costs and enabling of simultaneous construction phasing (building under the roof while the roof is being build). Recent research into historical and newly available methods has unveiled methods to nearly exclude the use of temporary support. However, these methods have not been tested on large scale designs and do not prove to be fit for up scaling. In the last five years structural patterning and the influence of a panel pattern on force flow have also come up as a research field for building construction. A combination of features found in past methods and recent research can be joined into an improved modern construction method. To know the minimal amount of supports needed the structure will need to be monitored every step of the construction process. Simultaneously it will have to find the best panel to put in next. To retrieve this information from the ground up, every panel that can possibly be installed will need to be tested. On large scale projects this will be a time costly process. That is why Ir. P. Eigenraam and Msc. S. Luitse have developed their own method: Deconstruction and reversed Deconstruction. Deconstruction is the initial analysis method that works from the top, the complete assembled structure, down. Based on a finite element analysis (FEA) at each iteration it finds the least stressed panel and removes it. This can be compared to finding the loosest block in Jenga. This will continue until the structure is fully deconstructed. This will provide a reversed construction order that can be used to construct the structure with the least amount of stress and deformation. This construction method is called reversed Deconstruction. Although the deconstruction algorithm is still under development first analysis show up to 75% reductions of temporary supports during construction. Further reductions can be done by preassembling parts of the structure. This report will research the possibilities of this analysis and construction method. A historical review of shell construction methods combined with research into force flow through complex free form prefabricated shell structures will provide the pointers and tools. Along these pointers and tools the Deconstruction analysis method will be set up. The method is tested through FEA and concluded upon. It is the search for a smart construction method.","deconstruction; algorithmic; construction optimization; structural design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Building Technology","","","",""

Especially cost savings, and cost reductions form a vital component to stay competitive in the airline industry. For this work the deicing procedure is studied, which is part of the ground operations. Deicing is of paramount importance to ensure safe flying conditions in wintry conditions. This work considers a deicing at-the-gate operation. In our work we specifically looked at the operation for Aviapartner, which has a relative small operation of five deicing vehicles. On a worst-case day, Aviapartner would have to deice between 30 and 50 aircraft. We hypothesised that proper planning can lead to an improved capacity estimation. We have modelled the deicing operation using a Resource Constrained Project Schedule Problem (RCPSP). This RCPSP is translated into a mixed integer linear program. Using a MILP solver we were able to provide for 94% of the day problem sizes an exact planning. Our implementation provided solutions in acceptable time for a problem size of up to 40 aircraft. To deal with larger problem sizes, we introduced three heuristic algorithms that optimise towards a specific objective (KPI). The second part of the research deals with how we can adopt a planning, such that it can cope with operational concerns. We have modelled three operational concerns: delay of aircraft, weather severity increase, and vehicle breakdown. Finally we have built a proof of concept web implication to interact with plannings from our algorithm.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Software Technology","","","",""

(mentor); Domhof, J.F.M. (mentor); Happee, R. (mentor); Krasnov, O.A. (mentor)","2016","The Delft University of Technology intends to aid in the development of autonomous vehicles by building their own experiment platform in the DAVI project. To be able to make valid decisions, an autonomous vehicle needs to know its surroundings. Many sensors are used to detect any objects within range, but the sensor information has to be processed to form a map of the environment with all objects of importance on it; this process is called tracking. Current methods of tracking and associating objects are accurate enough to be safely used in an autonomous vehicle, but require significant computation power. Increasing the speed of the algorithms without losing performance is a real challenge. As with many methods, the joint probabilistic data association (JPDA) algorithm gets exponentially slower with more objects and more measurements. It is therefore proposed that a method that splits the survey area into smaller regions could lead to a faster algorithm. In this research, a region is dynamically constructed while the vehicle drives around using extended maps that contain all the information on the infrastructure (eHorizon). The region is created by merging polygons that are defined by the road shape. Objects within the region are tracked with a JPDA algorithm, while objects further away (outside the region) are tracked with a fast and simple nearest neighbor Kalman filter. Once an object gets inside the region, the track will automatically be handled by the JPDA algorithm. Experiments show that the region tracking algorithm performs faster than a JPDA algorithm without clustering and manages to keep track of objects in challenging environments. Compared to a clustering JPDA algorithm the processing times are slightly higher, but the region trackers shows more robustness in densely cluttered scenarios where large clusters mean more processing time for the clustering algorithm.","region of interest; ROI; tracking; eHorizon; autonomous; vehicle; self-driving; automotive; JPDA; infrastructure; map data","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-06-29","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Biomechanical Engineering","","Bio-Mechanical Design, Automotive Human Factors (BMD-AUT)","",""

The housing shortage following from this urbanisation has resulted in 830 million people living in informal settlements, better known as slums1. Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, is one of these cities that is rapidly growing and evolving. Ethiopia’s urbanization of the past decades has proposed many opportunities for economic growth, but has also resulted in an enormous shortage in decent affordable housing in cities. The same way it has happened, and is still happening, in many other countries in the Global South.

(mentor)","2016","In aerospace industry, composites structures are widely used because of their high stiffness to weight ratio. To ease the manufacturing process, components are assembled together using fasteners which leads to introduction of holes in composites. The failure of these composite structures is affected the high stress concentration region around hole. Therefore, it becomes necessary to take into consideration the effect of hole while predicting composite failure. Current practices such as finite element method (FEM) and analytical solutions are predominantly used for failure analysis. However, in case of a variable stiffness composites laminate it is difficult to apply these methods as material properties changes with change in fibre orientation. Therefore, a generalized failure criteria is required to qualify a variable stiffness composite laminate as safe to use. In this thesis, a simple analytical solution has been proposed which is independent of fibre orientation and thus can be easily used to qualify a variable stiffness laminate. In this context, the concept of strain invariance, as proposed by Tsai and Melo, is implemented to remove the dependency of fibre orientation. A novel analytical solution is formulated which combines the strain invariance with the stress concentration analysis to predict the failure envelope for an open hole system. The parameters on which the proposed solution depends are the applied loads for a biaxial loading. Hence, there is no need to analyze the stresses around hole at each and every point to construct the first ply failure envelope for open hole system. Further, the methodology was extended to the region away from the hole, and the limiting distances based on Tsai-Wu and LaRC03 failure criteria for different materials is found. It is observed that the limiting distance is not constant and depends on material properties. The results are compared with experimental, numerical results and found to have similarities with the final failure reported. The result of this thesis work will not only ease the design process but can also be used as a validation tool, to certify a composite structure with open hole.","composites; omni strain failure envelope; open hole stress concentration; quasi-isotropic composites","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Aerospace Structures & Materials","","Aerospace Structures & Computational Mechanics","",""

(mentor); Gielen, M.A. (mentor)","2016","The thesis is concerned with the development of the building kit (the building experience) for a bamboo balance bike. It starts with research on the company and target group. The research is based on several sources: literature, observations, interviews, generative research (workbook) and a questionnaire. The company of the KaboogaBike is a start-up that aims to make socially responsible and sustainable products. The company aims to involve the users in the building process and stimulate the parent-child bonding by offering a building kit for the bike. The target group for the building kit consists open minded, experience driven adults, and their toddlers (age 1½-2 year). The research showed that the child is in the middle of an internal struggle “the creation of the own identity”. Parents have a strong influence on the child, the child’s development and character. The parents feel socially responsible and are interested in sustainable products. In their daily interactions with the child they take a caring, teaching, observing and supporting role. Participants in the questionnaire showed an interest in the building kit because they expect that building the bike will be a fun activity. Parents who are not interested see their limited technological skills and the young age of the child as a problem. The research also made clear that the product should shift the parents’ mindset from a goal-oriented mindset towards a more exploring and playful mindset, in order to design a building kit that provides a positive experience for both parents as child. The parents also have to allow the child to engage more into the process instead of only asking the child to give the components. Finally, the parents need to release some control. This thesis describes the design process of the building experience in five iterations. The first idea of the product comes from an advent calendar: to obtain the bike components gradually. Later on it is decided to divide the product in five steps. The steps are called “adventures”. In every adventure, about 2 to 3 small activities are suggested to explore and play with the components. The activities are small, and focus on exploration by the senses (they are adapted to the child’s interest and capabilities). A story about ”Wanda de panda” and her parents is used to guide the user. This story is integrated in the packaging. Parent and child can build a part of the bike after every adventure. It was decided that the product could look standard from the outside, but it should have interesting interactions (surprising elements) and look less standard from the inside. Moreover, every user should obtain the components in the right order, even if they do not read the instructions. This resulted into a product that only shows the door to the next components after the previous door is opened. The hidden parts trigger curiosity and together with the green lines, holes, the story and images of Wanda de panda, users are activated to open the next door and to do the activities. The product is made from recycled corrugated cardboard. It has an optimal size for transport and the sustainability and sustainable image of the product are hereby taken into account. The packaging consists of 7 parts: the outer box, the outer frame of layer 1, door 1, door 2, a sheet between layer 1 and 2, the outer frame of layer 2, and door 3. The outer box and sheet between layer 1 and 2 can be re-used by shaping it into a bike stand. A prototype of the product is developed and tested with actual users. This user test made clear the product fits the design goals: the parents are activated to explore and play and to take the time for it. Moreover, they also engage the child into the process. Compared to a regular building setting, the parents release control, but they are more goal-oriented as with regular play. The product also fits the qualities of the interaction vision: everybody enjoyed using the product, believed the product was easy to use, worked together, and was positively surprised. The parents appreciate the guidance and they think it offers them enough freedom and/or inspiration to explore by themselves. Finally, the thesis provides recommendations for the production and suggestions to improve and develop the product further.","experience; building kit; toddler; sustainable; bike","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design for Interaction","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","Phased array antennas require a distance of the array elements to be smaller than half a wavelength in order to avoid grating lobes while scanning through the whole visible space. In the case of planar dual- or multi-band antenna arrays, the capability of wide-angle scanning at the operational bands defines strict constraints on the electrical inter-element spacings, especially at the low frequency band. For patch antenna arrays, these requirements lead to the formation of closely-spaced antenna elements and thus, increased levels of mutual coupling. This thesis aims firstly on understanding the physics of mutual coupling phenomenon between closely-packed patch antenna elements by investigating the behavior of different field/power components that are associated with the space, surface and total waves obtained from some simplified analytical models of patch antennas. The second aim of the thesis is to decrease mutual coupling between antenna elements by using dielectric contrast techniques. To reach this aim, different vertical/lateral dielectric stratifications inside the homogeneous substrate have been investigated and applied to reduce the mutual coupling while having no negative impact on the scanning performance, radiation pattern characteristics or radiation efficiencies. The performance of the MATLAB-based mathematical model has been evaluated both via theoretical analysis and FEKO/CST simulations. The simple model has shown great potential to explain the origins of mutual coupling and to be used for optimization purposes in the vertical stratification technique. More detailed analysis and optimization have been performed in CST in order to understand the limits and capabilities of vertical/lateral dielectric stratification. The results of the simulations have shown that by proper selection of the position, permittivity and thickness of the additional high-permittivity layer, it is possible to achieve satisfactory performances in terms of mutual coupling for E-plane arrays. Furthermore, a novel four-layer substrate design has been proposed that combines high and low permittivity layers and is able to decrease mutual coupling in E-plane while improving the efficiency without any need to redesign the array topology.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microwave Sensing, Signals and Systems","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","Stratified two phase flow is one of the flow regimes that is of importance in multiphase flow transport through pipelines, such as used for example in the oil and gas industry. Its application also extends to chemical production, energy conversion and food processing. The phenomenon of turbulence further complicates the stratified flow behaviour. Having a simulation tool that accurately predicts the pressure gradient and liquid level in a turbulent channel or pipe flow can lead to better designs of multiphase flow systems. The common RANS turbulence models (such as 𝑘−𝜔 and 𝑘−𝜀) artificially produce too much turbulence at the liquid-gas interface. Therefore, these models need to be modified such that turbulent viscosity is sufficiently damped at the interface. To ensure this, in the present study the specific dissipation rate (𝜔) is imposed at the interface. Here 𝜔 is an appropriate function of the surface roughness factor (𝑘𝑠), which represents the effect of interface waves. The present work is a follow up to a previous research project where a MATLAB tool was developed for the prediction of stratified flow in channels. The first and main objective of the present thesis is to find and test a model for 𝑘𝑠 and to apply that to obtain a modified version of the Standard 𝑘−𝜔 (SKW) turbulence model and the Shear Stress Transport (SST) model. MATLAB can be used to find solutions for the channel flow. The simulation results are compared with experimental data. The second objective is to compare the results obtained using the turbulence models in the MATLAB model with predictions using similar models in Fluent. The third objective is to extend this study to a 3D setup of a two phase pipe flow where only the liquid phase is simulated. This is a so-called Segregated Liquid Phase (SLP) simulation. RANS predictions in Fluent are compared with experiments and DNS data. The main conclusions are: . The calculation of 𝑘𝑠 has been automated. . The predictions of the flow rates for the experimental case by Fabre et al. are better than those for the experimental case by Akai et al. . MATLAB predictions of the flow rates for the experimental cases are better than those of Fluent. This is because it is difficult to correctly impose an interface condition in Fluent, whereas this is straightforward in MATLAB.","channel flow; fluent; MATLAB; pipe flow; stratified flow; turbulence models; liquid-gas interface","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Process and Energy","","Sustainable Process Energy Technology","P&E Report Number: 2755",""

Efficient algorithms are necessary for generating such joint random numbers in an untrusted environment in settings such as, but not restricted to, multi-party computation (MPC). Applications range all the way to secure license plate identification or facial recognition. In this thesis, we give a brief introduction into the field of cryptography. Then, we focus on a core component in MPC protocols, namely on how to generate these joint random numbers. We first analyze the existing work. Then, we propose two new protocols to efficiently achieve joint random number generation, both in terms of computational demand and communication. We show that our second protocol can also omit the need for secure networks, meaning all the messages can be public. In addition to these protocols we also introduce an extension for general joint random number generation protocols in large networks based on a star topology, with explicit protocols for parties that are joining or leaving. We analyze all our proposals in terms of security, complexity and performance. Finally, we discuss questions that remain open after this thesis.","","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Applied Mathematics","","Optimization","",""

Use of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) combined with the experiments is desirable to be able to find the most efficient geometrical shape of VG and the installation of it based on the flow characteristics of the problem. However, there is a challenge of using CFD for VG simulation which is the large number of grid points required to obtain an accurate solution.

The primary improvement in treatment is due to subtyping, where the high complexity cancers are divided in types of cancer and subgroups. In a study by Dr. Parker it was found that by looking at mRNA only, the intrinsic subtypes of breast cancer could be identiﬁed. In our work we will create images out of gene expressions, which we use to train a convolutional neural network to classify the created images on cancer subgroup. This report describes an analysis of using convolutional neural networks on images created using the correlations between gene expressions. We focused on using deep learning to identify cancer related gene-gene interaction sub-networks. Prior research has shown that using gene expression assays can be used to improve classiﬁcation of subtypes of cancer. We created two dimensional images, preserving the correlations between genes as distances in the image and used convolutional neural networks to classify the sub-types. These networks can do object recognition, and in the case of our images the object could be build up of sub-networks of genes.","","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Intelligent Systems","","Pattern Recognition and Bioinformatics","TI3806",""

First of all, a hierarchical structure for a technical system breakdown is developed, and different types of relations between systems and components in this structure are defined. It is then investigated how marine engineering first-principle models can be used to mathematically define these relations in order to arrive at a model estimating work content for new projects. Using two surface combatants and two platform supply vessels as examples, it is demonstrated that, if some initial effort is put in correct definition of a benchmark project and deduction of relation factors between systems and components, relatively detailed production man hour estimations can be made using only a limited set of input data. Moreover, the proposed method can be used to fine-tune ship designs and other complex structures in terms of production cost.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Marine and Transport Technology","","Ship Design, Production and Operations","",""

The project objective was to build a platform for online mortgage advice, which could substitute a real-life, human adviser. The use of such a platform costs far less than hiring a human adviser, but a major problem to solve is that a website usually cannot give personal treatment to the user. In the research phase, we looked at how to apply the fields of affective and adaptive interfaces to our problem domain, as well as how A/B testing is commonly done for software products and how the results are statistically analyzed. With the knowledge we gained from the research, we came to an agreement of what to build with the client. The result of this agreement is the specification of the ’hybrid workflow’ interface (tailored to the philosophy of the client’s vision), a personalisation feature and an empirical test. We implemented said specification and conducted a proof-of-concept A/B test with 47 users. After statistical analysis, we concluded that the results of these tests were not significant: there was no significant difference between the users that got a variant of the platform with the personalisation feature and the users that got the variant without our feature. In the discussion segments, we discuss the results and make further recommendations.","","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Software Technology","","Technische Informatica","",""

Fenêtre is a company that provides online solutions like web applications and consultancy. The dashboard displays different existing pages in the form of widgets which are freely movable and resizable by the user of the dashboard and give the user a high level of personalization. The Dashboard is made using the Gridstack framework. This framework provides the functionality to move and resize the widgets. The choice made on using this framework took place in a three week research phase at the start of the project, where multiple different dashboard frameworks and examples were investigated. Gridstack was chosen because it gave the most freedom in implementing the dashboard around the existing features. Other frameworks gave too much of a restriction on implementation. To make sure that an unauthorized user cannot view confidential content the existing authentication of Fenêtre is used to only load widgets that meet the rights of the user. During the development stage of the project, scrum was used to organise the project team. Using the scrum methodology made it easier to recognize the different tasks which needed to be done. However, since the product team consisted of 2 people scrum made things sometimes more tedious than it has to be.

(mentor)","2016","Quantum computers hold the promise to solve problems that are intractable to classical computers. Since qubits suffer from extremely short lifetime and unreliable operations, Quantum Error Correction (QEC) forms a vital part of a quantum computer to enable Fault-Tolerant quantum computing. The usage of a Pauli frame can relax the time constraints on QEC by keeping track of detected errors in classical logic. For the first time, in the background of a heterogeneous quantum computer architecture, we clarified the input/output and working principles of a Pauli frame, which can soon be mapped to a hardware implementation. We proposed the first functional quantum computer architecture simulation platform, QPDO, which can connect to different quantum simulators, such as QX Simulator or CHP, and is used to verify the logical operations of a Surface Code 17 (SC17) logical qubit. Finally, by using QPDO we found that a Pauli frame does not improve the Logical Error Rate (LER) of a SC17 logical qubit, which is opposite to previous understanding. By further reasoning, we also expect no improvement in LER by using a Pauli frame for surface codes with a larger distance. Nevertheless, the usage of a Pauli frame is still crucial for relaxing the timing constraints on QEC.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Computer Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","In the Netherlands infrastructural works, such as bridges and overpasses, are generally constructed using blast furnace slag cement (BFSC) concretes, because of the relative high resistance against chloride penetration from de-icing salts. However, sheltered elements constructed in BFSC concrete are prone to carbonation, for example abutments and support beams. From the field investigation at the Hattemerbroek overpass, concrete damages were found at the abutments and attributed to chloride induced corrosion enhanced by carbonation. This research focuses on the influence of carbonation on the chloride penetration resistance of BFSC mortars and the effect of slag content. For the influence of carbonation on chloride penetration resistance it is assumed that there is a sheltered carbonation period before exposure to chlorides, like an abutment exposed to chlorides after a joint starts to leak. This research was needed since there are up to 2000 concrete structures like Hattemerbroek, executed in BFSC and prone to carbonation enhanced chloride induced corrosion. In order to identify the influence of different slag contents (0-70%) on carbonation, chloride penetration and their coupled effect, twelve slag cement blends were tested. Chloride penetration resistance was expressed by means of electrical resistivity and chloride diffusion coefficient determined from the RCM-test in accordance with NT Built 492. Research shows that carbonation of slag cement mortars increases the porosity, consequently decreasing the chloride penetration resistance. A 70% slag sample with a relative high chloride penetration resistance before carbonation was found to have a significantly lower resistance after carbonation. The chloride penetration resistance is strongly dependent on the carbonation duration and its corresponding carbonation depth. Mortar specimens with a slag content between 35-55% carbonated before chloride exposure showed less influence of carbonation on the chloride penetration resistance.","Blast furnace slag cement; carbonation; chloride ingress; durability; materials characterization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","Materials and Environment","",""

Its function as shoreline defence has gained strong interest in the recent years, since it may offer sustainable and cost-effective solutions to coastal protection problems. Predictions of wave dissipation by macrophytes require understanding of the hydrodynamics, plant motion and the coupling between the two. The Dynveg model focuses on the interaction between the organisms and the surrounding fluid at the stem-scale. It describes the motion of a blade based on the balance between the parameterized flow-induced loads and the restoring action of the stiffness and the buoyancy of the plant. The present thesis validated its performance for the small deformation regime under oscillatory flows using experimental data. After the validation, the model was used in a one-way coupling by introducing prescribed velocity profiles under varying wave conditions and changing plant properties. The asymmetric plant motion observed in the field by a number of authors was not obtained when depth-uniform oscillatory flows were used as an input. It appeared when linear wave theory was used, before including non-linear effects or the eulerian flow. The results suggest that the driving mechanism of asymmetry in plant posture is the orbital motion, although higher harmonics or the streaming in a canopy may enhance it even further. This may have important implications on the methods use to study plant motions under waves, particularly about the use of U-tubes or depth-averaged models. Neglecting the variations of the velocity along the horizontal coordinate for the tested conditions did not introduce significant errors and in the results, although the differences may be larger for very flexible plants or very energetic waves. Stems with different rigidities were modelled under the same wave condition. Stiffer plants dissipated more energy. Nevertheless, it was found plants with appreciable tip excursions, of about the 20% of its height, could produce the same amount of work than a completely still plant. Longer plants reduced their relative motion with respect to the flow for a longer fraction of the wave period compared to shorter stems, which remained pronated and still over a longer part of the wave cycle and consequently produced more work. The curves of the dimensionless wave-averaged work as a function of the Cauchy number for different plant heights showed a good collapse, which may open the possibility of developing more simplified frameworks to account for wave attenuation in large-scale coastal models.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","CoMEM","",""

(mentor); Meijers, B.M. (mentor)","2016","Developments such as smart cities, the Internet of Things (IoT) and the Infrastructure for Spatial Information in Europe (INSPIRE) are causing a growing amount of observation data to be produced. The Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) has developed Sensor Web Enablement (SWE) standards for modelling and publishing this data online. However, their use is currently limited to geo information specialists, who have knowledge about which data services are available and how to access them. With the use of the semantic web, online processes can automatically find and understand observation metadata. This opens up the SWE services to a large user audience. Therefore, this thesis has designed a conceptual system architecture that uses the semantic web to improve sensor data discovery as well as the integration and aggregation of sensor data from multiple sources. A conceptual system architecture is presented containing two web processes. The first process automatically creates an online semantic knowledge base of sensor metadata, by harvesting Sensor Observation Services. Metadata based on the Observations and Measurements (O&M) data model are retrieved, which includes the location of deployed sensors, what they observe, how they observe it and at which SWE service their data can be requested. The second process automatically translates logical queries of users into observation data requests. It also performs further processing before returning the observation data to the user. Both of these processes have been tested in a proof of concept implementation. A Web Processing Service (WPS) has been created as a proof of concept, making the two processes available online. The proof of concept is able to harvest sensor metadata, convert it to linked data, and publish it on the semantic web with links to and from other metadata. It results in a semantic knowledge base of sensor metadata, which improves the discovery in a machine understandable way. It allows multiple Sensor Observation Services to be used in combination with each other, due to the harmonisation involved in creating linked data. The WPS is therefore able to retrieve and process observation data from multiple Sensor Observation Services, using queries such as: What are the average particulate matter levels per month in neighbourhoods of Delft over the last five years? In conclusion, the presented conceptual system architecture contains two processes which improve the discovery, retrieval and aggregation of sensor data from multiple Sensor Observation Services using the semantic web. However, creating a completely automated process for harvesting metadata, which works with every Sensor Observation Service is not yet feasible, as non-meaningful identifiers are allowed to be used according to the SWE standards. Linked data ontologies should also be extended to include all available metadata. Currently there are no ontologies able to define the concept of a geo web service. Another conclusion is that the SPARQL endpoints used in this thesis cannot cope with complex vector geometries. This is due to their inability to handle verbose queries. Nevertheless, the proof of concept shows that the semantic web can enable current SWE services to be used in new ways, making observation data available to a larger user audience.","sensor web; semantic web; sensor web enablement; linked data; observation data","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","OTB","","Geomatics","",""

De gravitatie circulatie is een stroming die bovenin de waterkolom een andere stromingsrichting kent dan onderin en ontstaat doordat het water niet een uniforme dichtheid kent in het bekken. Daarvoor is eerst bekeken hoe de dichtheid in het Vlie-bekken varieert. Deze hangt vooral af van de watertemperatuur en de saliniteit (zoutgehalte). Om de verschillen te bepalen zijn beschikbare meetgegevens over temperatuur en saliniteit gebruikt. Bij deze tijdreeksen is een verband gezocht hoe deze twee factoren van tijd en plaats afhangen. Deze resultaten zijn vervolgens gebruikt om een profiel op te kunnen stellen van de dichtheid afhankelijk van plaats en tijd. Het blijkt dat de dichtheid varieert tussen de 1012 [kg/m3] bij Harlingen en 1022 [kg/m3] aan de kant van de Noordzee.

(mentor); Bokel, R. (mentor)","2016","This master thesis of the Building Technology track concerning fire resistance in a sun shading element as an alternative for fire retardant glazing was produced by the idea of Wiebe Schotanus from the Safety Region Haaglanden, who proposed the idea of combining sunshading and fire retardant properties as an alternative design solution for fire retardant glazing. The subject fire safety has grown in the past years into a major field of study, which is becoming more important in the building industry. This growth can also be seen in changes in the Dutch Building Decree the past years and in the built environment. Also in architecture there is an increasing demand for glass. Because of these factors also the demand for fire retardant glazing has increased as well as the demand for other fire retardant products and sunshading. In order to meet the increasing demand for glass in architecture, coupled with the increasing demand for sunshading elements and the growth of fire retardant products, in this thesis a concept design is developed for a fire retardant sun shading element as a design alternative for fire retardant glazing in public buildings. Herewith the chance on the development of fire by flash-over via the outside of a building should decrease and a cheaper design alternative for fire retardant glazing is proposed. To develop this concept research studies has been done to fire development, rules regarding fire safety in public buildings in Holland according to the Dutch Building Decree, fire retardant and sunshading products and materials in order to set a program of requirements. This is followed by simulations in the computer programs TRA and TRISCO in order to simulate the heat transfer during a fire in a room, especially in the glass and the façade and in order to determine the optimal distance between the window and the sunshading element on the inside. Also simulations are made with the same distances (75 and 100 mm) between the window and the element as the distances used in the measurements in order to compare them. With the use of prototypes made out of playing cards, wood and steel a couple of problems were solved and the mechanism to open and close the sunshading were tested. The mechanism of the fire retardant shading element closes automatically in case of fire, without the use of human effort or electricity. This is done by a wire which melts at high temperatures, with the result that the lamellae close automatically. At last measurements are performed in an oven of 700 degrees Celsius in order to test this self-closing mechanism and to measure the temperature rise in the glass in different situations, with the use of the fire retardant shading element and with two different glass thicknesses of 4 and 6 mm. The fire retardant shading element is tested at a distance of 75 and 100 mm from the window, in opened and closed situation and at last also a closed element with a fire retardant coating at a distance of 75 mm is tested. The system closed itself, because of the high temperatures and the melted wire, in around 10 seconds. One of the most important conclusions for as well the simulations as well as for the measurements is that how further away the element is from the heat source (fire), the less radiation it receives and how longer it takes for the glass pane to break. Also it takes longer for the glass to break when the 6 mm glass pane is used, because of the bigger mass. The fire retardant coating expanded because of the high temperatures from 1 mm to 20-30 mm, but did not have a remarkable effect on the time in which the glass pane broke. This probably because of the higher temperature in the oven in comparison to the other measurements and because of the conducted heat from the steel frame to the glass, because the frame was not coated or insulated and heat transfer from the steel to the glass was possible. But the fire retardant coating prevented the flames from raging to the outside of the element and the window when it was broken. So the element does prevent flash-over via the outside. Hereby a concept design is developed for a design alternative for fire retardant glazing. Naturally, this concept needs further study and more testing before it will become a definitive alternative design solution for fire retardant glazing.","sunshading; Fire retardant glazing; fire retardant sunshading; fire safety; flash-over; public buildings","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Building Technology","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","The outermost strong part of a planet is called the lithosphere. When loads, such as volcanoes, sediments, or intrusions, are applied to the lithosphere, it flexes. The amount of flexure is controlled by the flexural rigidity of the lithosphere. The elastic thickness Te is the thickness of an equivalent fully elastic spherical shell which flexes in the same way as the real lithosphere. It is an important quantity because it strongly depends on the lithospheric heat flux at the time that the load was applied, which is controlled by the thermal evolution of the planet and varies in space and time. The loads and the associated lithospheric deflections cause gravity anomalies and topographic relief. Observations of these can be used to constrain Te. In this study, a global map of the elastic thickness of Mars is presented. Several recent missions to Mars have provided global spherical harmonics data sets of gravity and topography. These data are inverted for the shape of the crust-mantle boundary, or equivalently the crustal thickness. This is assuming that all gravity anomalies are caused by only two density interfaces which are the surface and the crust-mantle boundary. The large amplitudes of the Martian gravity field necessitate the application of a finite amplitude correction. A simple, but realistic model, which allows loading and compensation at the same two interfaces, is derived. It uses the differential equations for the flexure of a thin elastic shell and depends on six parameters: the elastic thickness Te, the ratio F of the amplitude of the loads at the two interfaces before flexure, the correlation r between these loads, and three parameters of a covariance function of the isotropic Matérn class which describes the topography before flexure. The input data are localized to specific grid points of a map using multitaper spectral estimation. Contrary to most elastic thickness studies which compute observed and modelled admittance or coherence to find a best-fit solution for Te, this study uses maximum likelihood estimation as first proposed by Simons and Olhede (2013). This technique allows to determine the parameter set which is most likely to have produced the localized estimates of the topography and the shape of the crust-mantle boundary. Maps of the most likely parameter sets are presented for different localization window sizes. The results generally agree with previous studies, yielding Te ~10km in the southern uplands and higher values at the large volcanoes. This also corresponds to thermal evolution models predicting a more rigid lithosphere in more recently formed areas. Log-likelihood contours and Monte Carlo simulations with synthetically generated topographies reveal the quality of the results. The elastic thickness is well constrained in the southern uplands and at Elysium and Ascraeus Mons, but poorly constrained in the northern lowlands and at the other volcanoes. While this study shows that it is possible to retrieve Te with maximum likelihood estimation, more research is needed to explain these poor constraints","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience and Remote Sensing","","","",""

(mentor); Van Dongeren, A.R. (mentor); Tissier, M.F.S. (mentor); Den Heijer, C. (mentor)","2016","Low-lying tropical islands are highly vulnerable to the effects of sea-level rise and climate change. Most pressing is the threat posed to their fresh water supplies by wave-induced flooding. This thesis attempts to generalize previous site-specific studies of flooding on coral atolls and apply it in a framework that can be used for early warning systems or long-term climate change impact studies. To do so, a large synthetic database of representative reef properties and hydrodynamics was developed using the numerical wave model XBeach, and then analyzed using a Bayesian probabilistic network. The resulting tool allows us to make real-time flood predictions based on offshore wave or sea level conditions, and the unique characteristics of a given island (e.g. topography). Narrow, smooth reefs with steep fore reef slopes are the most vulnerable to runup. Extreme flooding is associated with anomalously high, resonant low frequency waves, which are more likely to occur on narrow, smooth reefs subjected to extreme swell waves (large wave heights with long periods). These extreme swells are ""blue sky"" events which originate from distant storms. Thus, they may thus arrive without warning, since they are completely independent of local weather conditions. This bolsters the need for more effective prediction tools. Validation of the results presented in this study is limited by the small number of field observations against which the model can be compared. Thus, there is a need to develop a comprehensive database of reef morphology and hydrodynamics. Offshore wave conditions, water levels, and reef width are the most essential variables for predicting runup, so future research efforts should be directed towards collecting those data. This model can also be used to ask questions like, ""which islands will be most severely impacted by climate change?"", or ""can we increase flood resilience for a given island by restoring its coral reefs?"". Hence, there is also potential for its use in guiding decision-makers to allocate limited funding in the places where it will have the most impact.","low-lying tropical islands; coral atolls; flooding; Bayesian network; disaster risk reduction; early warning system; climate change; swell; wave hydrodynamics; XBeach; non-hydrostatic; nature-based flood defenses","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","CoMEM","",""

(mentor)","2016","The objective of this study is to identify the mechanisms that drive the morphodynamic behaviour of the sediment disposals in the subtidal zone north of the intertidal shoal Walsoorden. The morphological development of the sediment in the subtidal zone near this shoal has been monitored and measured. The gathered bathymetric data show that one year after the sediment disposals had stopped, the sediment was spread out mainly in the flood direction. Little lateral spreading was found. After one year, 1.45 million m3 of the 3.72 million m3 sediment had disappeared from the control polygon. Sixty percent of this sediment disappeared during the execution of the disposals and 40 % can be assigned to the morphological development between September 2010 and October 2011. The new Delft3D Flexible Mesh (DFM) software was used to simulate the hydrodynamics and sediment transport around the disposed sediment. During the course of this study, the Delft3D Flexible Mesh software is still under development and not all functions are available yet. This is the reason why no simulations with a varying bed were performed and why a different model grid is used for the hydrodynamic calculations than for the sediment transport calculations. To include the seasonal variations in the water level, the hydrodynamic model simulates a full spring- neap tide cycle. The results are used to find the impact of the disposed sediment on the local water levels and flow conditions. Three model simulations with different bathymetries but the same initial and boundary conditions were produced. The first simulation is the reference situation and contains the bathymetry prior to the sediment disposals. The second contains the bathymetry just after the first sediment disposals. And the third contains the bathymetry just before new sediment disposals are executed. Because it was not possible to run a DFM model with sediment transport in parallel model during this study, a reduction of the grid was necessary to calculate the sediment transport with the used model. The simulations of the model that calculate sediment transport investigate a period of one tidal cycle. Similarly, as in the hydrodynamic simulations, the model that calculates the sediment transport was performed with three different bathymetries. For all three bathymetries this was executed for a spring tide and a neap tide. A discrepancy between the measured data and the modelled sediment transport was found. The model calculated a residual sediment transport into the balance polygon around the disposed sediment for all the sediment transport model simulations. This implies that the sediment volume within the balance polygon increases while a decrease of the sediment volume is obtained from the data. A conclusive reason for this has not been found. The migration of the sediment in the flood direction can be explained by the gradient of the residual sediment transport that is introduced by the disposed sediment. An increase of the flow velocity at the location of the disposed sediment and a decrease of the velocity at the downstream end of the disposed sediment during flood are responsible for this gradient. The impact of the disposed sediment turns out to be the largest on the peak flood velocities. During flood, the increased peak velocities at the location of the disposed sediment transport more sediment towards the shoal. In the downstream area of the disposed sediment the flow velocity decreases again and part of the transported sediment is deposited. The strongest gradient, and thus changes in bed level, occur during spring tide conditions.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Coastal Engineering","",""

Subsequent sections define different façade design scenarios, which are studied as test cases for applicability to an existing building within the TU Delft campus. Sixteen façade scenarios are proposed. Four of the scenarios are selected for further study. A methodology that follows, the cost estimating of the façade construction and the financial analysis of the cost under the different financial archetypes, generates information that allows analysis and identification of the market environment —for the demand and supply side stakeholders.

The A* uses the interior empty nodes and the network graph to find a path. Finally, benchmark test were conducted to identify the effect of octree operators and A* operations on the path length and computation time. The A* path finding computation time is positively effected by: firstly, pre-processing a network graph, using a Manhattan distance and by keeping the octree depth to a minimum. The path length is positively influenced by: extending the path connectivity, by using an Euclidean distance type and by increasing the octree depth. Although, the octree depth depends on the minimal and maximal spatial resolution needed for path finding. And this is dependant of the size and orientation of the point cloud. By pre processing a point cloud the spatial resolution can be increased.","path finding; octree; point cloud; collision avoidance; network graph","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Urbanism","","Geomatics","",""

To predict when breakage occurs, the objective of this research project is to obtain knowledge on, and measurements of the rocking behaviour and failure mode of single layer armour units. A single cube on a breakwater slope is subjected to investigations. An analysis of previously conducted research by CUR C70 reveals a number of important weak points. The first point is the assumption for the fixed number of 3 collisions per moving unit. The second point is the deployment of a one-directional accelerometer. Consequently, the impacts, which occurred in different directions relative to the orientation of the accelerometer, were not captured accurately. The third point is the exclusion of the wave steepness during tests for impact velocities. The outcome of the calculation by CUR C70 is largely dependent on the mentioned points. Therefore, it is chosen to take those points into account in the current research. Wave flume tests are conducted, in which a similar set-up as in the theoretical analysis is applied. This is chosen to have a better insight in the physical processes. The tested parameters is: degree of exposure of cube, wave height, wave steepness and position on slope in relation to the water level. It is chosen to measure the accelerations due to movement. A three-axis accelerometer, which is placed in the cube’s centre, is applied during this Master's Thesis. Data processing shows that crosstalk occurs in two accelerometer axes. Therefore, only the accelerometer z-axis is processed. To come to the desired impact velocities, a synthetic model is used, which takes the time period of movement and the angle of the cube before and after movement as input values. Subsequently, the output is the angle of the cube in time. Differentiation of the angle in time results in the angular velocities, in which the impact velocity is taken to be equal to the occurring velocity before collision. Analysing the data shows that the number of collisions is dependent on the wave height, wave steepness, position on the slope and degree of exposure of the cube. Hence, an assumption for a fixed number of 3 collisions by CUR C70 is proven to be inaccurate. Therefore, it is recommended that the amount of collisions of a moving unit is regarded as a function that has dependencies on hydraulic and geometric conditions. For multiple conditions the number of collisions is observed to become very large and hence, concrete fatigue becomes important. Consequently, it is recommended to incorporate fatigue in the calculation procedure by CUR C70. Furthermore, it is concluded that the wave steepness is of influence for the probability distribution functions and hence, the exclusion of the wave steepness by CUR C70 is proven to be incorrect. The wave steepness should be included as a variable parameter in the probability distribution function for impact velocities. In addition, it is observed that the data is described best with a Weibull distribution, which is different from the exponential distribution obtained by CUR C70. However, the two distribution types are from the same family of distributions and hence, the differences between the distribution functions remain small. Next, it is clearly observed that the probability distribution is dependent on the type of movement and therefore, it is advised to consider multiple types of movement to find the governing impacts. Lastly, analysis shows that the analytical model overestimates the impact velocities and therefore, is too conservative. The assumptions made for the analytical model should be further investigated to derive a more accurate calculation method.","rocking; armour unit; cube; breakage; wave flume; slope; impact velocity; acceleration; accelerometer; breakwater; single layer","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Stouten, P.L.M. (mentor)","2016","It is expected more cities in Europe are going to encounter shrinkage because of changing demographics. Shrinkage can also occur because of a negative migration balance. When a city shrinks, municipalities take measures on the urban hardware, software and mindware in order to maintain the liveability for the remaining residents. This research studied the measures taken in two shrinking cities: Heerlen in the Netherlands and Gelsenkirchen in Germany. Both former mining cities. Most measures are taken on the urban hardware and software aspects. Measures include demolishment of dwellings, redesign of the public space and involving residents in the redevelopment plans. In both cities that were studied, there is no significant change in liveability noticeable because of the measures taken. Since it is expected that when a municipality takes no measures, the liveability decreases, there must have been some positive effects because of the measures. Which measures caused which effect can, however, not be determined because municipalities implement multiple measures at the same time. It does seem to be important to involve residents in the planning and to take measures which have a visible result so that residents notice the attention from the municipality.","Mining cities; Shrinking cities; Liveability; Urban regeneration; Shrinkage; Heerlen; Gelsenkirchen","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Management in the Built Environment","","","",""

(mentor); Zlatanova, S. (mentor)","2016","Acquiring point clouds of indoor environments became increasingly accessible in recent years. However, the resulting 3D point cloud data is unstructured, and does not contain enough information to be useful for complex tasks like pathfinding. Indoor models which are currently derived from point clouds do not include furniture and stairs. The necessary graph to enable multi-storey pathfinding is not available in the point cloud. This thesis proposes a workflow to semantically enrich indoor point clouds using an octree data structure. Meaning is added to the point cloud scene that allows to act as a basis for a graph. This graph can then follow navigation constraints of humans through an indoor environment. The approach for semantic enrichment of this study is capable of separating storeys, detecting floors, walls, stairs and obstacles like furniture. Strict preconditions are used, like walls being perpendicular to each other and using noise free point clouds. The implementation works as a proof of concept and the octree proves to be a helpful data structure. The contribution is a novel approach of using octrees for the semantic enrichment of indoor point clouds, including the detection of stairs. Combining and extending different works from various fields of research helped to develop the presented methodology. The semantic classification of floors and stairs in 3D point clouds allows to create a graph across multiple storeys. A big part of the methodology was implemented and tested on different types of buildings and scanned with dissimilar kinds of laser scanners. Mobile scanners were found to be advantageous, because they are less dependent on the line of sight. On top of that, they can provide a path of the scanner, which is precious information that can support several structuring improvements of the acquired data. The octree generalises the point cloud to leafs and adds a structure to the empty space. This does not only improve the calculation performance, but also provides more distinguishable results. Concluding, the thesis proposes to extent the framework to cover a wider range of architectural structures. Furthermore, future research should deepen the knowledge for the stair detection of the presented conceptual framework. As the representation of stairs differ for every scanner, future research should focus on point clouds acquired by one kind of scanner first.","point cloud; indoor; pathfinding; octree; semantics; stairs","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Urbanism","","3D Geo-Information","",""

(mentor); Esrail, F. (mentor)","2016","Even though composite materials are being applied more and more often, these materials are often not used to their full potential. In particular, composite materials are very sensitive to Compression-After-Impact (CAI), typically leading to knockdown factors in the order of 0.65. Many researchers have tried to predict the effects of Compression-After-Impact, either using finite element or analytical methods. While non-linear finite element methods can capture most of the damage mechanisms accurately, large computational power is required rendering such methods unpractical for optimisations. On the other hand, many analytical methods are limited in accuracy, especially at higher impact energies, which are often critical for design. In particular, no analytical model has ever been developed which can capture the progressive post-buckling behaviour of a panel with elliptical delaminations, let alone in a variable stiffness laminate. In order to solve this problem, a novel general theory for post-buckling was proposed. With this theory, the non-linear effects of post-buckling phenomena can be captured using a quasi-linear system of equations. This theory was used, in combination with the Rayleigh-Ritz method, to model the progressive post-buckling behaviour of variable stiffness composite laminates with single and multiple delaminations under compression. In general, very good agreement was found in comparison with non-linear finite element methods. A novel theory was also proposed to predict growth of post-buckling elliptical delaminations by analysing the delaminating resin layer as elastic foundation. The methods developed in this thesis shows promising results for applications in models which determine the compressive strength of composite panels after impact or the compressive strength of composite panels with delaminations in general. In particular, models using these theories will be able to capture the combined effect of various damage phenomena for panels with larger delaminations, which is typically a limitation of existing models. Moreover, the developed theory for post-buckling is not only applicable to the Rayleigh-Ritz method but can be used for general post-buckling calculations of panels and beams. In particular, this theory could also be interesting for finite element calculations.","buckling; post-buckling; composites; composite panels; compression; delamination growth; impact","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Aerospace Structures & Materials","","Aerospace Structures & Computational Mechanics","",""

(mentor)","2016","Google uses the PageRank algorithm to rank the web. The algorithm models the behavior of a random surfer. It follows an outlink or it goes to any page by entering a URL into an address bar. This is also called teleportation. The probability that a surfer teleports to a page is given in the personalization vector. The PageRank algorithm returns a Pagerank score for each page. The score determines the position of the page. The higher the score, the higher the page will be on the list. However, some people want to increase their PageRank score artificially. Link spamming is the name for adding and removing links between pages with the sole purpose of increasing the PageRank score. We want to find a method to lower the effect of link spamming. One way is to change the personalization vector. If we restrict the pages the random surfer can teleport to, we can avoid having the surfer teleport to a page that is suspected of link spamming. So one way to suppress the effect of link spamming is to optimize the personalization vector. In order to combat link spamming, we have looked at the role and in uence of the personalization vector. We describe two different methods to optimize the personalization vector. The first method generates a number of personalization vectors and calculates the sum of the PageRank scores of the pages that are suspected of link spamming. The lowest score belongs to an optimal personalization vector. The second method uses linear programming. We minimize the PageRank scores of the suspected pages and find the optimal personalization vector. The results were not always useful. For that reason, we added two extra requirements. One was setting an upper limit for all the pages on the probability that the surfer can teleport. The other one was suppressing the pages in the irreducible subsets. If a surfer gets into an irreducible subset, it will never leave the subset by following outlinks.","","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Delft Institute of Applied Mathematics","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","This research studies the use of thin glass on adaptive facade panels with the objective of increasing the knowledge of the use of this material in the built environment. Thin glass is a material that is harder, stronger and flexible than common glass. As some of the main current challenges faced in glass design are material use and building element’s weight, thin glass can be seen as an interesting and sustainable alternative to common glass. While many different applications of thin glass in the built environment are possible, this research focus on embracing its main characteristic, the flexibility, by studying the use of this material in adaptive façade panels. The behavior of thin glass in this context depends on different factors, first the glass size and thickness define its bending limits, while the desired geometry and movement affect its stiffness and visual outcome. To integrate these factors different configurations of panels were analyzed in numerical models. These analyzes showed the importance of understanding the desired movement and geometry in order to correctly define the supports and degrees of freedom of the panel, avoiding stress concentration (especially on the edges) and allowing for an unobstructed movement of the panel. The development of these analyses resulted on the conception of a design example, taking in consideration the design guidelines developed in the research. This example was then applied in a case study, in order to analyze it in a real context. Although there is still the need for research to be developed so that thin glass can become a building material, this research showed that this is possible and that interesting results, regarding visual effect, ventilation and dead load reduction (in larger scale, an environmental impact reduction is also possible) can be achieved","thin glass; adaptive panels; glass structures; glass design; lightweight facade; kinetic facade","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2016-12-28","Architecture and The Built Environment","Architectural Engineering and Technology","","Building Technology","",""

The province has much to offer in the sense of historical and cultural heritage, in the form of old farms and churches. The subject of being safe in these kinds of monuments isn’t the only challenge. It can be said even that it is equally important to preserve the heritage, because it’s often a carrier of highly valuable knowledge in the sense of building technologies and cultural history. The problem of this challenge lays in the contradiction of the prevailing desire to keep a monument authentic, while earthquake-proof interventions often ask for rigorous interventions. Recently developed solutions are balancing on this contradiction, mainly because most of the interventions are initiated by heritage-minded institutions. The thing is that if you don’t allow rigorous actions, the heritage can be destroyed forever.

Urban sprawl in many cities in the world tends to trigger severe urban mobility challenges because the development is rarely supported by adequate infrastructure. In addition, the monocentric characteristic of the city worsens the fact that urban sprawl has encouraged massive commuting activities from peripheral areas to the city centre. In the case of high dependency to privately owned vehicles, both in the developed and developing countries, traffic congestion have become inevitable vernacular reality. The context chosen for this project is Bandung, Indonesia, the second largest cities in West Java. Bandung has been acknowledged as Jakarta’s backyard and experiencing quite massive urbanization since 1960’s. The city has grown into one big agglomeration of 17,000 hectares area where almost 3 million people live in. Regretfully, the urban development in Bandung has outpaced the government’s efforts in providing adequate infrastructure to connect the new (housing) complexes in the peripheries to the existing urban core, or providing new urban cores. The development trend has resulting certain tension between the city centre and the peripheral areas in the form of a severe daily traffic jam. There are three main development issues in Bandung, Indonesia addressed in this project: inefficient mobility, degradation of environment quality, and the lack of comprehensive planning in addressing the development. This project aimed to promote sustainable urban development in Bandung City as a response to current development trend which, one way another, encourages urban sprawl.

The purpose of this modeling effort was to test the ability of the numerical model and statistical model in properly simulating salt marsh-hydraulic interactions which occur around the world. Additionally, testing of the ability of this model to quantify wave attenuation over salt marsh habitats while under extreme hydraulic conditions (high wave heights and water levels) was performed. First, the numerical model was calibrated, tested, and validated based on both a field and flume study which measured wave attenuation over natural salt marsh. Next, the numerical model was used to produce many results for wave heights at various locations over a salt marsh platform. These results produced a dataset which was input into a Bayesian Network (BN) for further organization and quantification of wave attenuation by global salt marshes. Finally, the salt marsh components were tested for their influence on the BN, and the results were compared to the Xbeach-vegetation results for several cases in order to provide an example of how each method produces results. Initially, the numerical model was calibrated and validated based on wave data which was provided by members of the BE SAFE study and was recorded during a winter storm in 2015 at Hellegat Polder, Western Scheldt, the Netherlands. The numerical model simulated the recorded wave heights accurately, and proved to be effective in reproducing results for extreme hydraulic conditions recorded at Hellegat. Additionally, the numerical model was tested on the conditions of the Hannover wave flume study, which generated extreme waves in one of the largest wave flumes around the world, in order to measure wave attenuation by a 40 meter section of natural salt marsh at the end of the flume. Once the model was calibrated and validated, the set-up for a batch of numerical model simulations took place. In order to assign inputs which were representative of global coastal salt marsh habitats, data was collected from many sources to form a database. Next, the numerical model was set-up in order to simulate waves occurring over an arbitrary salt marsh platform for many different salt marsh characteristics and hydraulic conditions. Wave heights were obtained at five distances across the salt marsh platform, and the results were input into a BN for further data handling. The BN (Netica) was used to structure and organize the data into a compiled network, which was completed before the network could be used further. Once the network was compiled, the various salt marsh characteristics and hydraulic conditions were varied within the network in order to see which characteristics and conditions were most likely to produce certain wave heights at various distances throughout the salt marsh platform. The influence of each characteristic and parameter could additionally be quantified in a probabilistic manner using the network. In selecting the various values within each node of the BN separately, an assessment could be performed in order to see the influence of each salt marsh component on the resulting wave heights. The results produced by both the Netica program and the Xbeach-vegetation model were presented in order to show a comparison of how each method presents the results. Finally, a sensitivity analysis of the various salt marsh characteristics was performed to obtain knowledge on how these components influenced resulting wave heights. Once all of this was completed, conclusions were made based on the results, and recommendations were provided for the improvement of future research efforts within this field.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","CoMEM","",""

(mentor)","2016","In magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) the interest in electric properties tomography (EPT) is growing. In current EPT applications the reconstruction is performed based on the Helmholtz equation which relies on the assumption of a homogeneous contrast. The goal of this thesis is to present new approaches to reconstruct the electrical properties that require less assumptions on the contrast. Two fundamentally new approaches are presented, one based on first order differentiation and one on the global integral field equations using a contrast-source variable. In this thesis these methods are described alongside the existing Helmholz based approach, the contrast source inversion (CSI) - EPT approach, and a deconvolution approach. Reconstruction of both two- and three-dimensional simulations as well as the reconstruction of an in vivo measurement are performed to compare the five different methods. It can be concluded from this comparison that methods that are not based on the homogeneous contrast assumption perform much more accurate (overal) than the Helmholtz equation based method. Both CSI and the direct inversion method based on the global integral equations perform comparable, but the latter is significantly faster and offers almost the same range of flexibility regarding regularisation and preconditioning. The direct inversion method is an improvement on the deconvolution method, performing equally well regarding noise robustness, but offering better reconstructions in all cases due to the lack of an apodisation step. The first order differential method provides a surprisingly robust, accurate and extremely fast way to get insight into the data, and shows that the inversion problem in MRI is actually very well behaved as far as inversion problems go. These new methods provide new insight into the inversion problem in MRI, specifically for EPT and get us one step closer to accurate electric properties reconstruction from an MRI scan.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2017-06-30","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics","","Electrical Engineering — Signals and Systems","","51.998831, 4.373474"

(mentor); Prins, M. (mentor)","2016","In recent years the concept of Circular Economy (CE) has gained momentum in business and the built environment. The reason for this boost, can be traced back to the recent economic crisis and the new wave of disruptive innovation in the construction industry. Besides, the current state of construction projects, linear construction, is full of inefficiencies which causes a tremendous waste of big potentials. Thus, there is an urgency for developing new proactive strategies for implementing circular economy in the construction industry. The concept of circular economy introduces material and product after-use value as an important aspect of construction industry. To date, little research has been conducted to investigate the effect of circular economy and its principles on the supply chain organization in the construction industry. Also there exists an ongoing discussion between the market parties about the shift in the responsibilities when implementing the circular economy concept in the built environment. One can argue that in near future there would be a big change in the traditional construction process. This is not only because of the integration of the circular economy in the buildings, but also because of the change in the role of the end-user in today’s world. Contrary to the past, the construction is evolving as a more end-user centric industry. Based on this demand for new approaches and new outlook, this research was set up. The scope of this research is constrained to the Dutch building sector, since the way how countries can approach a CE concept and CE business models is different. With introducing the performance - service system model as a possible ideal outcome of the circular economy in construction industry, the following question has been answered: How can the supply chain be rearranged in order to develop and implement a performance – service system?","circular economy; supply chain organization; construction industry","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Real Estate & Housing","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","Fixed steel structures in the North Sea that are approaching end of life are increasing in mass and dimensions, this imposes challenges on the current decommissioning strategies. The main challenges arise during removal of the barge-launched substructures. In contrast to the topsides of these large structures the substructures cannot be easily removed by reversed installation methods. For these large structures, a single lift removal is not possible as heavy lift vessels (HLVs) will be limited in lifting height and/or lift capacity constraints. Therefore, offshore disassembly in multiple sections, also known as piece small decommissioning, is required for large substructures from approximately 4,000 tonnes and up. Over one hundred fixed steel structures are currently located in the North Sea with a substructure mass of over 4,000 tonnes and so far twelve have been removed. According to the OSPAR Convention, decision 98/3, all fixed steel structures in the North Sea region must be decommissioned at the end of their useful lives. Business opportunities for Seaway Heavy Lifting lie in this growing decommissioning market of large structures. The objective of the thesis is set to optimize piece small decommissioning of large substructures such that Seaway Heavy Lifting can offer more competitive removal solutions. Reference projects have been analysed in order to obtain a better understanding of piece small decommissioning. These projects have shown that approximately half of all HLV-time is spent on cutting operations. The day rate of the HLV is one of the main expenses in decommissioning projects; therefore it is preferable to minimize the HLV-time. The thesis goal is set to optimize piece small decommissioning of large fixed steel structures (> 4,000 Mt). The focus is put on optimizing the cutting strategy to ensure a cost effective decommissioning solution. The result is that Seaway Heavy Lifting will be able to provide more competitive removal solutions. The focus of optimizing piece small decommissioning is put on decreasing (HLV) cutting time whilst maintaining structural predictability and operational feasibility. The processes and results of all steps for selecting an optimal cutting strategy are combined to form a decision support tool (DST). This tool consists of constraints, guidelines and a data processing file. A generic overview of the DST is given in figure 1. The tool optimizes the piece small decommissioning process by focussing on the most time efficient solution whilst maintaining structural integrity and operational feasibility by selecting the optimal cutting strategy. This is achieved by integrating the results of SACS structural analysis into the decision tool. Selecting the key factors of decommissioning and decomposing them into manageable steps in the DST has decreased the complexity of piece small decommissioning. The DST gives Seaway Heavy Lifting the opportunity to offer more competitive removal solutions for piece small decommissioning. This vastly improves the opportunity to enter the growing market of piece small decommissioning of large structures. The DST presents a novel optimization method in the form of phased substructure decommissioning and is universally applicable in the piece small decommissioning market.","decommissioning; offshore decommissioning; piece small decommissioning; piece meal decommissioning; offshore cutting; phased decommissioning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-06-28","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Hydraulic Engineering","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

(mentor)","2016","Deepwater drillships are nowadays capable of drilling to oil in water depths up to 4000m and reservoirs at 12000 m depth and greater. Active Heave Compensation at these large drilling depths and station keeping with the Dynamic Positioning system leads to large fluctuations in the electrical power system. The electrical power is now directly produced by medium speed synchronous Diesel Generators, making them operate at low-average fluctuating loads. This leads to poor fuel efficiency, high emissions and increased maintenance costs. The loads of a drillship can roughly be divided in 3 categories; mission equipment, dynamic positioning and the auxiliaries & hotel load. The loads in the first category show large fluctuations both due to the activities and due to the environmental conditions. The loads from the second category also show fluctuations, due to the environmental forces. The third load can be seen as a more or less constant load. An Energy Storage System (ESS) is used to reduce the load fluctuations of the Generator Sets (GenSets) and make it possible to operate more often with a single GenSet running on each of the three switchboards of the ship. With the latter, the emissions and fuel consumption are reduced. Most load fluctuations are periodically with the wave period (4-12 seconds) this means that the ESS is exposed to an extreme high number of load cycles. Due to this high amount of load cycles (up to 2E6 per year), batteries are not suitable as ESS. In this thesis Lithium-ion capacitors and flywheels are investigated. In order to quantify the performance of different ESS on the Huisdrill, a model is built in Simulink. This model simulates the behaviour of the energy sources and sinks of the ship and thus determines the amount of power generated by the generator sets and withdrawn from the ESS. The ESS and its control system is optimized for drilling with active heave compensation, since this activity forms 61% of the operational time of the drillship. Apart from the simulations of drilling with active heave compensation, a total operational profile is simulated. The goal of the model is to compare the performance of the drillship without ESS with configurations with different types of ESS (Lithium-ion Capacitors and flywheels) and different sizes of ESS (800 kW to 2MW). The most important output of the model is the fuel consumption. The emissions, the average partload and the running hours of the GenSets are also monitored. Different control strategies for the ESS are implemented in the power management system. These strategies determine how much power is extracted from of fed to the ESS at each moment. Apart from the implementation of the ESS, configurations where the two equal sized GenSets of 6.5 MW per switchboard are replaced by a 5 and 8MW GenSet are simulated. The relative performance of the different configurations and control strategies have shown to be sensitive for the load profile which was used in the simulation. However, compared to the configuration without ESS, the performance of the configuration with ESS was almost always better. When the weighted average of all simulated load profiles (representing different environmental conditions, drilling depth, etc.) is taken, each combination of configuration (size and type of ESS and variation in GenSet size) and control strategy performs better than the configuration without ESS. The most important performance parameter is the fuel consumption, since this can directly be translated to a cost reduction. The application of an ESS resulted in a reduction in fuel consumption of 4.3% during the active heave compensation load profiles and 3.2% for the operational profile. When the implementation of an ESS is combined with the implementation of different sizes GenSets, the reduction in fuel consumption is 7.1% for active heave compensation and 5.2% for the operational profile. This reduction makes the implementation of an ESS economically feasible. Apart from the fuel consumption, large improvements in terms of emissions, average partload and running hours of GenSets have been made. It can thus be concluded that the implementation of an ESS on a deep-water DP-3 drillship leads to large advantages in terms of fuel efficiency, emissions and expected maintenance costs.","DP-3; dynamic positioning; drillship; energy storage; efficiency; peak shaving","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-06-28","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Marine and Transport Technology","","","SDPO.016.016m",""

New designs, technologies and materials are constantly introduced and tested in shading industry. Nowadays, adaptation in solar shading systems is the almost exclusive goal of every design. Adaptive solar shading systems are preferable as they adapt to external climate conditions and indoor needs, succeeding high performance and efficiency at the same time. The term “adaptation” is eventually related to movement. The plurality of adaptive solar shading systems perform by making use of integrated movement mechanisms. Ten Bucky-lab projects and ten study cases are analyzed in terms of visual comfort and analytical daylight simulations are conducted for the latter. The computer-based simulations focus on the annual daylight performance of each system in Athens. This procedure contributes in understanding in depth the way that adaptive shading systems perform, by evaluating their efficiency performance. This research highlighted the most efficient systems, under basic shading principles. However, their movement mechanisms are relatively expensive and require frequent maintenance or even replacement. The proposed solar shading system introduces a new generation of adaptive shading systems which are static and their adaptation mechanism is related to the material of the system and its properties. Smart glass technology and PDLC (Polymer Dispersed Liquid Crystal) devices allow the fluctuation of the transparency coefficient of the glass. They are mainly used as vertical glazing on the building envelope in order to provide shade to the interior. Nevertheless, being vertical, they do not only block daylight but also view to the exterior space. The proposed solar shading system makes use of this innovative technology in a more efficient way. An external three-dimensional grid, with vertical and horizontal components perpendicular to the facade of the building is placed in front of the curtain wall system, shading the interior and allowing view to outside simultaneously. Computer-based simulations are performed in detail for west and south orientations. A reference room on the 10th floor of an office building located in Athens is concerned. In addition, the proposed system is evaluated for the same reference room but located in Amsterdam via basic daylight simulations. The concept of this shading system is to provide the opportunity to control the transparency in great variety. Each component of the system can be controlled individually. Thus, either all or particularly selected horizontal and/or vertical shading components may be transparent or translucent. If shading is not needed, it may be totally invisible. As a result, the proposed shading system performs efficiently at any orientation and under any daylight conditions. Regarding efficiency performance, the proposed shading system provides acceptable indoor daylight conditions throughout the year in both examined orientations. The system requirements set for this research (daylit area, daylight autonomy, useful daylight index and glare percentage) are fulfilled. Focusing on its contribution in the energy consumption of the reference room, 35% energy saving is accomplished in south orientation and 16% in west orientation. These outcomes concern only the location of Athens","adaption; solar control; smart glass; adaptive solar shading system","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Building Technology","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","The determination of wave penetration in ports is of great importance for the design of coastal structures and for the efficiency of port operations. Nowadays, coastal engineers can make use of numerical models for the assessment of wave climates in ports. Various numerical models exist, including the phase resolving models SWASH (TU Delft) and MIKE 21bw (DHI). Van Oord Dredging and Marine Contractors are currently using the numerical model MIKE 21bw. To get a bit more familiar with SWASH and to see how the two numerical models relate to one another, they initiated this master project together with TU Delft. Therefore, the main aim of this thesis is to compare the numerical models SWASH and MIKE 21bw in terms of their accuracy, computational requirements and numerical stability for waves encountering approach channels and waves propagating into ports. A theoretical analysis between the two numerical models is presented first which shows that they are fundamentally different, i.e. based on different equations and assumptions. The main difference is that SWASH uses the non-hydrostatic non-linear shallow water equations, including the vertical coordinate, while MIKE 21bw uses the (enhanced) Boussinesq equations which exclude the vertical coordinate. Another difference is that SWASH may use multiple vertical layers, improving its dispersion characteristics. Therefore, the application range of SWASH is larger in terms of the maximum water depth to deep water wave length. Furthermore, SWASH can include more physical phenomena and does not require a minimum water depth as MIKE 21bw does. Beside the theoretical analysis, a comparison study was performed making use of a physical experiment of an approach channel (Case 1) and of a harbour basin (Case 2). From the comparison of the measurements with the numerical simulation of the approach channel (Case 1), it was found that both numerical models are capable of resolving wave-channel interaction for long waves (f < 0.13 Hz) and the accuracy in both models is comparable, although the significant wave height based on the total wave spectra is under-estimated in both numerical models. Numerical damping cannot (fully) explain the under-prediction of the significant wave height. Further, it is believed that inaccuracies/uncertainties in the physical experiment regarding the measurements and the setup were quite severe. This may explain the observed differences between the numerical models and physical model results. A comparison of the numerical simulations of the harbour (Case 2) with the physical experiment shows that both numerical models can accurately model wave penetration of primary waves into ports when simulating on prototype scale. However, the simulations performed on physical model scale (same scale as the physical experiments) resulted in critical numerical instabilities in both numerical models, especially in MIKE 21bw. The accuracy in predicting the significant wave height and energy period is comparable for both numerical models. Furthermore, SWASH turned out to be numerically more stable while the computational requirements are less in MIKE 21bw when two vertical layers are used in SWASH. Finally, a general guideline is presented for the selection of SWASH or MIKE 21bw for wave modelling purposes.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","CoMEM","",""

(mentor)","2016","Inverted pendulums have been classic setups in the control laboratories since the 1950s. They were originally used to illustrate ideas in linear control such as stabilization of unstable systems. Because of their nonlinear nature, pendulums have maintained their usefulness and they are now used to illustrate many of the ideas emerging in the field of nonlinear control. Typical examples are feedback stabilization, variable structure control, passivity based control, back-stepping and forwarding, nonlinear observers, friction compensation, and nonlinear model reduction. Pendulums have also been used to illustrate task oriented control such as swinging up and excellently suited to illustrate hybrid systems and control of chaotic systems. The purpose of this project is to apply, compare and extend some recently developed methodologies for optimal control with input saturation constraints to the problem of control of an inverted pendulum. In particular we will focus on two strategies: a model based actor-critic strategy, and a sum-of-squares based control strategy. All these strategies aim, from different perspectives, at optimal control of nonlinear systems. For this reason, to evaluate and compare the performance of the algorithms, I will apply them to the task of swinging up an inverted pendulum. The swing-up task is chosen because of its low-dimensional, but challenging, highly nonlinear nature. As the process has two states and one action, it allows for easy visualization of the functions of interest (value function, control policy, phase plane). The numerical simulations show that in model learning methods for actor-critic control, although ideally the neural network (NN) approximation can approximate any smooth function to arbitrary precision, it looks like model based actor-critic (MBAC) algorithm is not always able to reach the optimum. In contrast to the MBAC approach, the nonlinear policy iteration approach guarantees that every new control policy will be stabilizing and generally lead to a monotonically decreasing cost, whereas in the MBAC approach neither stabilization nor monotonic convergence can be guaranteed. In particular, in the MBAC approach, it is observed that the best value function is not always corresponding to the last one.","Swing-Up Inverted pendulum; Optimal Control; Model Based Method for Actor-Critic Control; Piecewise Policy Iteration in Nonlinear Systems with Input-Saturation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Delft Centre for Systems and Control","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","Linear aerostatic bearings are frequently used in high precision stages for their advantageous bearing properties, with low friction and absence of stick-slip being most notable. To improve relatively low out-of-plane stiffness of air bearings, pre-loading is applied. A common method of pre-loading is by utilizing vacuum, where a constant vacuum force decreases film height resulting in increased stiffness. Other methods for increasing stiffness are available, which is an active field of research. However, high stiffness results in strong coupling between bearing and running surface, transferring unwanted external vibrations. The amount of vibration transfer is quantified as transmissibility, which is the ratio of displacements between coupled surfaces. This property is frequency dependent. To reduce disturbance from external vibrations, this research focusses on reducing air bearing stiffness by combining pressurized and vacuum bearing pads, which to the knowledge of the author has not yet been researched. To analyse stiffness behaviour, air bearings have been modelled based on Reynolds equation. The effect of a vibrating running surface is modelled by linear perturbation of Reynolds equation. Resulting equations have been solved with a self developed finite volume method code, resulting in air film stiffness and damping as a function of frequency in an computationally efficient manner. Two combinations of thrust and vacuum bearings with a stable low stiffness operating point have been designed with the developed models. By offsetting vacuum and thrust surfaces or by using a micrometer pocket in the thrust bearing surface, vacuum and thrust stiffness cancel out, creating a range of low stiffness between regions with higher stiffness. To validate the models, air bearings have been manufactured. Measurements on restrictor properties have shown the literature model to be invalid for realistic pressure drops. Without taking the measured restrictor behaviour into account, model and measurement will not match. Also shown is that controlling surfaces flatness is essential for predictable bearing behaviour. Performance of available production methods is thoroughly researched. Model and measurement correspondence can only be achieved by taking surface properties into account. Also, the low tip-tilt stiffness of a single air bearing has been found to negatively effect measurements on film height. By using three bearings in the measurement set-up, tip-tilt stiffness has been significantly increased. This reduces measurement uncertainty. By taking these findings into account, excellent agreement between measurements and model has been achieved. This clears the way for development of a low stiffness prototype, combining thrust and vacuum bearings. Ideas on model improvement and prototype development are shared in the recommendations.","air bearings; aerostatic thrust bearings; low stiffness; vibration isolation; Reynolds equation; linear perturbation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Precision and Microsystems Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Diakite, A.A. (mentor)","2016","Navigating to a human target is underexposed in the current literature. However, there are cases where it is necessary to get to the moving target as fast as possible. This thesis supports navigation of a person to another person in motion that they lost or need. In this way, children, elderly, family, coworkers and friends could be found more quickly. This research thesis proposes the Semantically Enriched A * (SEA*) method to use semantics, in the form of points of interest, to determine the prediction of the target and uses this prediction to approach the target. Overall the SEA* method uses the positive components of the iterative A* algorithm, semantics and the direction of the target to predict where the target is going to, to successfully reach the target. Points of interest, landmarks, are critical points to check where a person is moving towards. These static locations are promising for navigating to a person in motion. Estimating the predicting location of the target is recommended by first limiting down the points of interest by the approaching points of interest by the target and then using the point of interest that is the closest to the target. This process gives a good prediction of the target in both implementations. The proposed SEA* method is tested both in an indoor environment, as in an outdoor environment. The SEA* method shows promising results in both the simulated indoor environment, represented by a 2D square regular grid, as in the outdoor environment, represented by a road network, using real GPS data. In this thesis the SEA* method is compared to the iterative A* approach and shows promising improvements. This thesis provides a framework that could be implemented to always find a person in motion or find them faster by using shortcuts to get to this person. A variety of different spatial models could implement the SEA* algorithm as long as the spatial model supports the A* algorithm, is able to translate the positions of the user and the target to the spatial model and supports adding points of interest to the model. Finally this research discusses further implementations of this method. Future research must provide answers to the questions if this method also works in a real-time case or if it works using a 3D spatial model to support 3D indoor navigation.","human navigation; point of interest; dynamic destination; A* algorithm; semantics; moving target","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Urbanism","","Geomatics","",""

When we wish to test the hypothesis H0 : F = F0 for some known function F0, we are doing a goodness of fit test. To do a goodness of fit test, several test statistics can be used. Examples are the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test statistic p n supt jFn(t) 􀀀F(t)j and the Cram´er-Von Mises test statistic n R (Fn 􀀀 F)2dF where Fn denotes the empirical distribution function of X1, . . . , Xn. When looking at several goodness of fit test statistics, one might p notice that most of them can be expressed in terms of the function Un(t) = n(Fn(t) 􀀀 F(t)). This process is called the empirical process and its asymptotic behaviour tells us a lot about the asymptotic behaviour of the goodness of fit test statistics. However, various problems can be encountered when looking atUn as a function. Even the question whetherUn is a random function whenever X1, . . . , Xn are random variables has an answer that is far from trivial. In this thesis, this problem will be solved by introducing a function space equipped with a metric such that the empirical distribution function becomes a random element of this function space. In order to make sure that the empirical distribution function is indeed a random function, we will consider the uniform metric and the Skorohod metric and discuss the corresponding Borel s-fields. Furthermore, we will look into some asymptotic properties of the empirical process and prove Donskers theorem. This result will be used to estimate the distributions of some goodness of fit test statistics using R.","","","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Delft Institute of Applied Mathematics","","","",""

(mentor); De Schipper, M. (mentor); De Vries, S. (mentor)","2016","A survey dataset taken at the Sand Engine mega-nourishment on the southwest coast of Holland was analyzed in an attempt to locate beach scarps and characterize their development. A beach scarp is defined as a vertical discontinuity in the upper foreshore slope generated through the removal of sediment by natural processes. More specifically, this report defines a scarp as a feature with a minimum height of 30 cm and a slope of 0.15. A few studies on beach scarp behavior have been investigated in recent years, but there is still quantitative ambiguity regarding the parameters that determine their post-nourishment generation, which can partially be attributed to their ephemeral nature. In turn, this lack of knowledge has directly hindered our ability to predict and/or prevent their existence in future nourishment projects. Scarps were identified by use of an automated tool created to locate the steepest sections in the beach profile. This tool identifies the scarp crest (top) and toe (bottom) by the local minimum and maximum of the second order derivative of the profile elevations. Scarps were also identified by means of manual transect analysis to validate this automated process. These features were observed during 15 of the 33 measurement periods, with 8/15 being summer months and 3/15 being winter months. Thus, this scarping phenomena yields a strong seasonal signal with the majority of removal periods occurring during winter months when the wave climates were more energetic; however, it was also observed that calmer periods interrupted by storm events were also capable of altering scarp geometries. Scarping at the Sand Engine consistently occurred between +3 & +2 m NAP, with the average scarp height at the southern flank, head, and point being 0.85, 0.78 & 1.0 m respectively. In general, scarps follow an overall pattern of periodic variability at the Sand Engine depending on the original profile geometry, water levels (storm surge & tidal elevation), and wave runup events. Observations showed that already developed scarps were only affected when the maximum runup levels (RHI) exceeded the scarp toe (SLO), which occurs during the collision, overtopping, and inundation regimes. The collision regime is responsible for the landward migration of the scarp without destroying the entire feature; the runup elevation is able to reach the scarp base inducing an undercutting effect which leads to slumping of the scarp face, but not necessarily to complete removal. Furthermore, scarps were completely removed only upon entering the overtopping and/or inundation regimes. It appeared the swash regime had no effect on the scarps at all considering the geometric characteristics remained approximately constant between measurement periods, insinuating the water levels were not high enough for the resulting runup to reach the scarp base. Thus, storm surge and tidal elevations have a strong influence on scarp generation/degradation at the Sand Engine, by exposing a greater area of the coast to wave attack.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","CoMEM","",""

(mentor); Kamp, L. (mentor)","2016","Fossil fuels will run out in the foreseeable future. Out entire economic system is build upon fossil fuels and building up another base for this economic system is challenging. The only alternative for making materials that normally are derived from fossil fuels is the Bio-Based Economy. Materials in this way get made from biomass, such as sugar cane, sugar beet, and soy, and are called Bio-Based Materials. The switch between producing chemicals and products from fossil resources to producing them from biomass resources has to be done in a sustainable way. In order to achieve this, sustainability criteria for the production of these Bio-Based Materials (BBM) are developed at the moment. It is not known, however, how sustainability criteria influence the development of the BBM sector. The objective of this research is to understand how companies, at different stages of the supply chain of a BBM, are influenced by sustainability criteria. Therefore, the main research question in this paper is ’How do sustainability criteria in the bio-based materials sector influence companies across the supply chain?’. Three main factors were deemed important to shed light on this question, namely sustainability criteria themselves, mechanisms through which these criteria diffuse through society to the companies, and the responses companies eventually have on these. The factors were formulated into four research questions. The research questions were answered through describing the societal context in which these companies operate and asking the companies themselves how they deal with this context. Concerning the first factor, it was found that natural resource efficiency, greenhouse gas balance and GMO usage were sustainability criteria that could be institutionalized in the BBM sector. Natural resource efficiency dictates the efficient use of resources such as fossil fuels, primary energy, forests, and animals. Greenhouse gas balance is linked to climate change and dictates that greenhouse gas emissions should be reduced as much as possible. GMO usage might not be a sustainability criteria on itself, but seems to be treated this way by companies. Social sustainability criteria didn’t seem to be common. Concerning the second and third factor, companies addressed mostly legislative sustainability criteria linked to biomass when they were a biomass producer inside Europe. Other companies addressed sustainability criteria that were either connected to the company culture or when they were asked by customers. In the discussion, these elements, natural resource efficiency, greenhouse gas balance and LCA, usage of GMO, social sustainability criteria, and legislation and customer pressure were further explored. First, natural resource efficiency was discussed on general and specific level. Generally speaking it is of utmost importance that the shift from abiotic resource depletion to biotic resource depletion or impacts is limited as much as possible. Furthermore, the efforts on European level to establish a market that considers natural resource efficiency are noteworthy. Specifically, it was found that a focus on biodegradability was present at the companies. This biodegradability or industrial compostability focus is not necessarily sustainable. Either recycling pathways need to be setup for these kind of plastics or the plastics should be used in specific situations where they are sustainable. The companies in this study addressed this nicely by either working on recollection, recycling pathways or on specific business cases where it makes sense to use the product. Second, there was a focus on greenhouse gas balance and the usage of LCA in order to prove the greenhouse gas balance. Whether greenhouse gas balance makes as much sense to focus on for Bio-Based Materials (BBM) as for biofuels or bioenergy is debatable. The fact that LCAs are used in the sector is useful. Policies can be set to include targets for BBM. A reformation of the Renewable Energy Directive to include BBM is one of the advices from this report. The Netherlands have a similar mechanism (SDE+) in place which should also be extended to BBM. Third, there was a focus on not using GMOs in production. Although this might be necessary from the companies standpoint, it helps the institutionalization of not using GMOs in the BBM sector. This might affect future development in a negative way. The Netherlands is preparing to enter this debate and companies are advised to do the same. Fourth, Social sustainability criteria are only moderately taken into account by the sector. The Netherlands has a leading role in developing and stimulating certification systems for BBM with its own NTA 8080/81. The certification need for biomass can be circumvented, however, by using locally produced biomass. Fifth, legislation in the Netherlands concerning environmental and social sustainability criteria is advanced. Companies take these into account. Through customer demand, other sustainability criteria are also taken into account by companies. The government should take this more into account than it has in the past and use it towards the benefit of sustainable development and market formation. Several suggestions were made at the end of this work. The findings in this report point out that the Netherlands has a strong focus on sustainability in the BBM sector. The development of criteria and support of certification is noteworthy, but these do not equal actual sustainable development yet. This is especially the case when considering the end-of-life phase of BBM. Extra efforts are needed to stimulate the market and sustainability at the same time. This report ended with some recommendations and identified opportunities.","bio-based material; bio-based economy; sustainability criteria; boundary objects; the Netherlands; Institutional theory; Industrial Ecology; natural resource efficiency; recycling; compostability; LCA","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Applied Sciences","BT/Biotechnology","","Industrial Ecology","",""

(mentor)","2016","The rise of shale gas production, has been the greatest revolution in the U.S. energy landscape since WWII and it is argued that market governance facilitated the process. This study analyses the feasibility of EU shale gas development. The publicly available shale gas analyses are inconclusive about the impact of future market design on shale gas feasibility. As the current EU governance structures are expected to change under influence of the GTM, it is interesting to examine whether they fit the prospect of EU shale gas development. The aim of this thesis is to gain a better understanding regarding the feasibility under EU future gas market design, by analysing the alignment of shale gas transactions and GTM governance structures. TCE identifies the transaction attributes of EU shale gas exploitation and GTM governance structures by looking at technical characteristics and by analysing GTM key characteristics. These transaction attributes, together with GTM governance structures form the basis of the alignment analysis. A desk research is performed that applies TCE theory and compares the EU gas market developments with the U.S. and U.K. market conditions. By analysing, the degree of (mis)alignment of the shale gas transaction attributes with the characteristics of the future market design (GTM), the limiting and/or enabling factors for EU shale gas development are clarified. A synthesis of these factors provides an indication of EU shale gas cost efficiency (feasibility). Specific shale gas transactions are characterized by a stochastic production profile. This leads to the requirement of flexible and transparent trading and more complexity that needs to be bridged by balancing mechanisms. The EU gas grid is extensive and storage facilities are numerous, so required shale gas infrastructure investments are minimal. Possible new investments are characterized by high asset specificity, high costs and hold up problems. The analysis of governance structures shows that the GTM combines market governance forms to create and connect markets, with hybrid governance forms to realize security of supply and infrastructure investments. This provides trade flexibility but limits infrastructure investments. EU shale gas development has the potential to be feasible depending on the requirement of infrastructure investments and the way infrastructure investments are organized. With minimal required infrastructure investments, the most likely scenario given extensive EU gas infrastructure, shale gas can be developed and subsequently flexibly traded at European gas markets. However, if infrastructure investments are required, it is expected that shale gas producers will be hampered in exploitation, as a consequence of the hybrid GTM infrastructure investment mechanism that results in inefficient expensive long-term contracts. A deeper analysis of the required infrastructure investments (potential locations) and a better understanding of the way infrastructure investments are organized (extent of hierarchy), contributes to a robuster conclusion on European shale gas feasibility under EU future gas market design.","European shale gas development; Gas Target Model (GTM); Transaction Cost Economics (TCE); desk research; alignment","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2016-06-27","Technology, Policy and Management","Economics of Technology and Innovation","","","",""

(mentor); Van Engelen, J.M.L. (mentor)","2016","In low-resource settings, like Uganda in Africa, fever is commonly measured by means of tactile contact with skin. However, for patients, caregivers and healthcare workers, self-assessment of fever is significantly inaccurate. Inadequate healthcare leads patients to be over-diagnosed with malaria and therefore over-treated with antimalarial medicines. Moreover, misdiagnosis results in neglected treatment for patients with non-malaria febrile illnesses, which in turn brings related risks for the patient. This project aimed to investigate the current barriers for accessible and reliable fever diagnostics and to develop a new ‘frugal fever diagnostics’ product service system (PSS) including a fever diagnostics device and connected health services, with the focus on the interaction between the users and the device as well as the interaction between the device and the eco-system. One of the challenges in this project was to develop a product service system for the healthcare system, which is a large social system, involving many participants and roles in addressing the recovery of individual. Therefore, the research employed a Context Variation by Design approach to explore the topic of the research with a holistic perspective and to gain diverse insights from different parts of reality. Firstly, five types of factors that impeded people to have adequate fever assessment in the Ugandan health system were identified from the literature review. Based on the findings, three considerations were proposed that could give an impact on how fever diagnostics are designed and implemented in low-resource healthcare systems. Firstly, the fever diagnostics journey shows the involvement of people in the different phases of diagnostics, from awareness to monitoring and a follow-up. Secondly, there are different user groups of thermometers within the same healthcare system and those user groups have different conditions of access to fever diagnostics. Lastly, these different users have different needs regarding the information that was offered. The healthcare system in Uganda is separated into public and private providers, and it is clear that the choices available for communities in low-resource settings were limited. In order to enhance the access to fever diagnostics in these contexts, specific and potential user groups and their needs should be looked at. Based on the insights, the informal healthcare sector was selected as the promising innovation opportunity for the development of a new ‘frugal fever diagnostics’ PSS. Since the people in Uganda have the common perception that care for febrile symptoms is sought from the informal sector before visiting the formal sector, an informal provider is the first touchpoint in the fever diagnostic journey. However, the informal provider was the only provider that does not make a diagnosis before selling medicines among the health providers visited by the febrile people. Therefore, those people, who have no access to the formal healthcare, need to be provided access to fever diagnostics in the remote communities. Besides the study on the barriers of access to fever diagnostics in Uganda, six different types of thermometers were evaluated in order to identify optimal features of a frugal thermometer. It was revealed that measuring temperature with an infrared sensor on the forehead is suitable for the informal healthcare context. In addition, a large display with a numerical and colour-coded reading could make the use-flow simple and easy. Those findings were applied to design frugal thermometer concepts in a later phase of the project. Healthy Entrepreneurs (HE) was involved as a good example of the informal health sector. HE is an organization offering access to health information, and reliable, affordable essential medications and health products for households in resource-constrained countries. Through the research on the fever diagnostic provided by HE, the fever diagnostic journey of the people in the remote community was understood and beneficial innovation opportunities were selected among several insights in order to develop a preliminary ‘frugal fever diagnostics’ PSS scenario. The scenario included three perspectives: helping the patients to obtain the information they need for their febrile symptoms, combining a temperature measuring service with the Rapid Diagnostic Tools (RDTs), and cooperating with the formal health sectors to improve the quality of care for patients with febrile illnesses. These perspectives were translated into two solutions in the preliminary PSS. Firstly, a fever case management service was adopted to enhance the rational use of medicine and good quality of treatment for febrile diseases by implementing temperature taking services and RDTs. Secondly, temperature data collection was included to build the frugal fever diagnostic service system. Through an evaluation workshop of the preliminary scenario with the stakeholders, two ideal fever diagnostic PSS scenarios were identified based on the preliminary scenario. One of the scenarios focused on utilizing temperature data in the fever management service provided by Healthy Entrepreneurs to identify appropriate care for febrile patients. Another scenario focused on collecting temperature date for scientific and epidemiological research purposes in order to study febrile diseases and their treatment. Based on the insights from the evaluation, two fever diagnostic PSS concepts were designed. The PSS concept for HE incorporated the fever management in the service system of HE in order to provide inexpensive and reliable fever diagnostics, and the access to complete and relevant diagnostic information in the remote communities. Another PSS concept integrated temperature data collection through the fever management service for a broad range of scientific studies. Both PSS concepts were supported by physical evidence: the tablet, the frugal thermometer, the Rapid Diagnostic Tools (RDT) and the referral. A free fever temperature taking service, a rental thermometer service and a RDT are provided as a fever management service, in order to attain an investigation of non-febrile people and non-malaria febrile people, and deliver the relevant care for their symptoms. Within the PSS design, frugal thermometer design concepts were proposed to facilitate the process of fever diagnostics by the Entrepreneurs and by the care seeker, and the temperature data collection. Ultimately, two final PSS designs and a final frugal thermometer design were proposed after the evaluation with the stakeholder. For further development of the project, the considerations regarding to the final PSS designs and the frugal thermometer were discussed.","product service system; thermometer; Uganda; fever diagnostic; design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","Design for Sustainability","",""

(mentor)","2016","In order to achieve savings on energy consumption within Dutch governmental office buildings, several technical innovations are tested and implemented in the building portfolio of the Central Government Real Estate Agency (Rijksvastgoedbedrijf). One of these innovations is the implementation of Internet of Things (IoT) applications that enhance reductions on energy consumption through the use of tailormade adjustments for employees regarding climate, lighting and wayfinding. Although these innovations have proven to be technical feasible, uncertainties remain with regard to their reduction potential and their acceptance by the end-users. A longitudinal research project currently conducted by the TU Delft and The Green Village focusses on this first uncertainty, while this thesis will cover the second uncertainty: the end-user acceptance of IoT applications in office buildings. Recent history has shown us that user-acceptance is a critical factor for the adoption and large scale diffusion of innovations. For instance, similar to the failed introduction of the smart-energy meters in Dutch dwellings, privacy concerns could hamper the acceptance of these innovations and result in high sunk-costs. Therefore, this research will study the factors that affect the acceptance of IoT applications in office buildings and combines the theory of Responsible Innovation and an adjusted model of the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT). In this research several qualitative and quantitative measurements are conducted among the 494 users of the living lab and resulted in support for the claim for a significant relation between the acceptance of the IoT applications and the factors Performance Expectancy and General Privacy. After a review by a user-group of the living lab, several recommendations are made regarding the redesign of the current technology-system and implementation-policy in order to increase the acceptation of the IoT applications. The most important recommendations are: 1. All applications should have an opt-in / opt-out option. Users should be able to switch the applications off and work in ‘privacy modus’. 2. The data that is collected with the applications should not be stored for a long period and should only be used for the purpose of the applications. 3. A clear disclaimer and user policy should be included during the launch of the applications. 4. Future-users should be actively involved before, during and after the launch of the applications. The scientific relevancy of this research can be found in the better understanding of the factors that enhance or hamper the acceptance of certain IoT applications in office buildings and in the fact that support is found for the integration of the research models of Responsible Innovation and Technology Acceptance. Practically the findings of this research could support the Central Government Real Estate Agency or other organisations that want to invest in IoT applications in office buildings, to enhance the acceptance of these IoT applications and reduce the risk for sunk-costs.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2017-06-27","Technology, Policy and Management","Engineering, Systems and Services","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","A current limitation of using Micro Air Vehicles in teams is the high risk of collisions between members. Knowledge of relative location is needed in order to perform evasive maneuvers from such collisions. We propose an on-board Bluetooth-based relative localization scheme. Bluetooth is a light-weight and energy efficient communication technology that is readily available on even the smallest Micro Air Vehicle units. In this work, it is exploited for communication between team members to exchange on-board states (velocity, height, and orientation), and the strength of the communication signal is used to infer relative range. The data is fused on-board by each Micro Air Vehicle to obtain a relative estimate of the location and motion of all other team members. Furthermore, a collision avoidance controller is proposed based on collision cones. It is designed to deal with the expected performance of the localization scheme by adapting the collision cones during flight and enforcing a clock-wise evasion maneuver. The system was tested with a team of AR-Drones 2.0 flying in a 4m×4m arena. The task requested the AR-Drones to repeatedly fly from wall to wall whilst passing through the center of the arena, hence making collisions highly likely. The system showed promising results. When using two AR-Drones and off-board velocity/orientation estimates, the drones are able to fly around the arena and avoid each other for the entire flight time as permitted by the battery. With three AR-Drones under the same conditions, flight time to collision was 3 minutes. With two AR-Drones flying with on-board velocity estimation, the time to collision was approximately 3 minutes due to the disturbances in velocity estimates. Simulation results show that significantly better results can be expected with smaller units.","Micro Air Vehicles; Bluetooth; Relative Localization; Collision Avoidance; swarm; indoor; drones; team","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Control & Operations","","","",""

As part of a research project on wind turbine icing carried out by the German government, a method to estimate the icing risk for a wind turbine rotor at an early stage has been developed and programmed in Python for the wind turbine manufacturer Enercon. This ‘Kalkulativer Icing Risk Analyser’, in short ‘KIRA’, uses discretised wind turbine blade geometry and meteorological icing parameters as input to determine the icing risk of the rotor by using a critical icing rate limit that is characteristic to a certain wind turbine type. The method for determining this icing rate limit has been employed on the Enercon E-82 2MW wind turbine using a power curve comparison strategy.","Windenergy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-06-27","Aerospace Engineering","Aerodynamics, Wind Energy & Propulsion","","EWEM European Wind Energy Master","",""

(mentor); Kolen, B. (mentor)","2016","River floods are considered one of the most important natural disasters and causes huge damages every year, both in economic consequences and fatalities. Out of historical perspectives, human settlements are located in fertile and economic attractive delta regions. Deltas tend to be constantly changing nodes of economic and urban growth leading to increasing exposure to flooding. Climate change may lead to a higher intensity and magnitude of flood events in the future. This development puts huge pressures on government and other decision-making authorities to cope with these threat by developing adequate flood mitigation plans. It is recognized that prevention is not possible and a shift towards integrating flood management into urban planning making it both robust and adaptive to future uncertainties is required to reduce the risk. Finding the set of measures appropriate for the risk situation of a city is difficult, because for a lot of non-structural measures the benefit is not yet defined in a quantitative way. Flood risk assessments are useful tools for indications of economic damage and identifying the most vulnerable cities worldwide. However, only considering economic damage as flood indicator will lead to an one-sided quantification of flood risk. Therefore, other risk indicators need to be considered to give a more comprehensive indication of flood risk. In this research, a framework is suggested to get a quick overview of the flood risk management of a city containing preventive, spatial, emergency, recovery and adaptive status. The economic risk is extended with the risk indicators; individual risk, household risk and a damage distribution. Based on this, an evaluation of the flood risk situation of a city can be derived, resulting in a preliminary advice for the appropriate measures and measures where the highest cost benefit ratio can be achieved. Focusing on the most beneficial measures could save a lot of time and resources. Next to that, this framework could eventually lead to a more proper flood risk assessments for identifying vulnerable cities and a way to communicate flood management status leading to some sort of competition between cities to come up with sustainable solution to be as safe as possible. Two historical flood events are being used as case study, namely the 2011 Thailand Flood and the 2013 Central Europe flood focusing on Germany. Both events are being assessed using the Flood Risk Assessment Tool (FIAT), where the calculated damages of the events are compared with the official reported damages. This gives an indication of the validity of this tool for damage calculations. After that, a closer look into the flood management of Bangkok by looking at the risk reduction plans after the flood event is conducted related to our suggested framework. For Germany, the cities of Hamburg and Dresden are being assessed by combining the flood risk indicator and smart city flood risk framework to come up with a qualitative assessment if the cities recognized their shortcomings and turned the tables. This is also done for Rotterdam and Vienna eventually leading to a comparison between these two cities and Hamburg and Dresden to assess the multi-layer flood management status. In the end, the calculated damages compared to the reported damages were in the same order of magnitude for both events within a 10% boundary. However, looking more closely at the German state, results are less accurate. A closer look at the city of Bangkok showed that the weak spots of the urban flood management are still not recognized and focus on preventive measures still dominates. Including individual risk, household risk and damage distribution led to evaluation of the top 25 German cities, where differences between cities led to different advises. For instance, the city of Bonn has really high individual risk and high share of residential damage making insurance, precautionary measures and flood prove building appropriate measures. The city of Dresden managed to reduce its vulnerability from 25% to only 4.5% by finding appropriate measures. Hamburg is the frontrunner for flood risk management integrated into urban planning by shifting to an adaptive flood risk approach. By comparing the four citieswith approximately the same economical and individual risk showed that each city has managed to incorporate measures from different flood mitigation layers into the urban footprint. Rotterdam and Vienna largely rely on the high protection standards, where the German cities shift the responsibility more to household level. Rotterdam and Hamburg are inspirational cities how flood mitigation measures could be implemented in urban planning to cope with increasing urbanization rates and climate change threat. However, shortcoming are also recognized for all cities which makes room for improvements possible in the future.","Flood Risk; Flood Risk Management; Bangkok; Germany; Danube; FIAT","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

Famagusta, a city on the eastern coast of Cyprus, is used as a demonstration site for exploring ‘urban peacebuilding’ strategies seen through the lens of spatial practices. The Turkish invasion of 1974 resulted in the territorial division and occupation of 37% of the Island’s territory, while its two main communities, the Greek and the Turkish Cypriots, have remained alienated ever since. The partition and the presence of a violent buffer zone a ‘no man’s land’ along the islands’ east west axis, is the driving force behind a country of two systems and two cultures. Partition was to affect most dramatically the political geography of future development in Famagusta. On August 14th 1974, the whole of Famagusta was occupied by the Turkish army and Varosha, its southern suburb, was sealed off as a no-go area under the control of the Turkish Forces undermining the growth and development of the city. From April 2015, a new momentum in politics has given hope to the people of Cyprus for reunification, with Famagusta on the forefront of the negotiations. The research builds upon the potential of a ‘shared Famagusta’ to offer strategic motivations for a ‘shared future’ and a prototype of peaceful coexistence in a reunified Cyprus. How peace can be materialized in the urban environment and how the city could be transformed into an arena where common imaginaries and shared urban narratives are negotiated and developed between warring communities is explored. This work draws attention to the complex connection between space, identity and politics and although addresses the specific context of the Cyprus case, it provides insights to a much wider discussion of academic and societal relevance.","contested cities; urban peacebuilding; collaborative planning; Cyprus","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Urbanism","","EMU European Postgraduate Masters in Urbanism","","35.00000, 33.00000"

(mentor)","2016","As a ways of avoiding issues with conventional socket suspended prostheses, a new type of fixation for limb amputees has been developed and is gradually gaining popularity around the world. Rather than tightly clamping the prosthesis around the skin of the residual limb, a titanium fixture is implanted into the bone and a transcutaneous pin is used to anchor the prosthesis directly to the skeleton. This method, called osseointegration, has been common practice for dental implants for decades but since it is relatively new for limb amputations some challenges still remain. One of these challenges concerns below-the elbow amputations. As there are two bones in the forearm, two titanium implants and transcutaneous pins are present. When performing pronation and supination of the forearm, these two pins make a complicated motion that has proven to be difficult to preserve in a prosthetic attachment device while maintaining stability and reliability. In this thesis an attachment device is designed and validated that preserves natural forearm rotation for below-the-elbow amputees making use of osseointegrated prostheses. Tests are performed to examine how well the motion is preserved, how the ability to perform the motion affects the performance of everyday tasks, and how the device distributes loading over the two implants. The developed device was tested by a single patient. Nearly the full range of pronation and supination was preserved, performance improved in a number of tasks requiring forearm rotation, and it was shown that it can be predicted which implant receives the majority of the loads when carrying weight so an as natural distribution as possible can be simulated. A number of challenges remain present for existing patients. These include issues with satisfactory prosthetic control through surface electrodes, carrying of large weights, and adjustability to various patients. Future developments will hopefully tackle some of these challenges, further enabling the device developed in this thesis to contribute to the development of the next generation of prosthetic limbs","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Biomechanical Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","In this thesis, focus lays on converting a MATLAB model to Python. Models are used a lot by students and researchers at universities and they provide an unique way of calculating and reviewing data and results. However, at the Delft University of Technology, a lot of these models are written in MATLAB. MATLAB is a programming language which requires a expensive license. Many researchers in- and outside universities can’t afford this licensewhich means that models are not available for everyone although lots of people would like to work hands on with these type of models. By making the first step in solving this problem, the WAM2-model originally created by R.J. van der Ent, is converted from MATLAB to Python. This conversion is done due to the fact that Python is open-source software which makes the model free to use for everyone. Also, MATLAB and Python syntax is generally the same which makes conversion even easier. Ultimately, theWAM2-model is converted to Python and ready to use by everyone. There are two versions in Python available, namely 1.0 and 2.0. 1.0 is the version with the same structure as the model in MATLAB. However, itwas found that the overall running time for version 1.0was much larger than the original model in MATLAB. This is due to Python executing notebooks inside of one masterscript notebook, which is not very fast with Python’s data structure. To solve this problem, Python WAM2-model 2.0 is created. Version 2.0 makes more effective use of Python’s data structure and this has led to running times almost twice as fast as the original model in MATLAB. Another benefit of conversion is that both model versions in Python are more user-friendly. Headers are possible in Python and by defining the data paths in the beginning of every masterscript, users don’t have to go through every script to change directories. In the tracking of moisture, sometimes the first day requires data which is not available. To make the calculation possible, empty arrays are needed which are now automatically created in Python whereas inMATLAB, the user has to do this at his own expense. Ultimately, the plots created in Python are the same as inMATLAB.However, one additional plot is added, called the contourplot. With agreeing statements from the supervisors, these contourplots are more pleasing to the human eye and therefore they are included in the Python model. Next to converting the model, a readme has been made which can be found in Appendix B. This readme is a step by step guide, helping users by explaining lots of the Python syntax. This guide is therefore also included with the Python model. The WAM2-model in Python is used to create an evaporation shed for Eurasia and an precipitation shed for China to find a correlation between the two areas. In previous research done by Cömert et al. (2016), the correlation between precipitation in China and evaporation in Eurasia was studied. By making the aforementioned precipitation and evaporation sheds, this study by Cömert et al. can be validated and maybe improved for future purposes. It is important to research moisture recycling in China. Currently, there are lots of droughts happening in China and precipitation is decreasing. The origin of this precipitation needs to be known and moisturerecycling provides an answer for this. Cömert et al. (2016) already made an attempt and they proved that there is a high correlation between source region Eurasia and sink region China. They quantified this with the Pearson correlation coefficient and for their used dataset, they found a correlation coefficient of 0.84. To validate these results, precipitation and evaporation sheds for respectively Eurasia and China can be made. The precipitation shed is defined for the region equal to that of Cömert et al. The same holds for the evaporation shed. The results are quite interesting in comparison to that of Cömert et al. The correlation coefficient found with the WAM2-model is 0.87, which is higher than the one found by Cömert et al. This is explainable since theWAM2-model removes the sea mask whereas Cömert et al. took the sea into account. The sheds resulting from theWAM2-model show that the defined regions by Cömert et al. are quite good estimations. However, a more precise source and sink region can be defined and further research should look at increasing the correlation coefficient as high as possible by redefining these regions. The model is available at https://github.com/ruudvdent/WAM2layersPython.","","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Water Management","","","",""

There is little experience with the Eurocode passenger comfort criterion in the Netherlands. It is relevant for the industry to have a way to fulfil this criterion, also in an early stage of railway bridge design. A sufficiently simple method to give a proper first estimation would be really useful. According to the Eurocode, the comfort experienced by passengers in a train passing a railway bridge must be sufficient. The comfort level is expressed as a maximum vertical acceleration inside the coach. In this research, a method to compute this vertical acceleration is developed. The scope of the research is limited to steel tied-arch bridge with vertical hangers. To find the accelerations in trains passing over bridges a numerical vehicle-bridge interaction model was developed using Ansys, a FEM program. Several bridge models and vehicle models were made using mass, spring-dashpots, bar and beam elements. Simple versions of the Ansys model were compared with analytical-numerical solutions written in Matlab and with literature. The more complex Ansys models were compared with measurements in a Dutch train travelling over a bridge. Apart from looking at the vertical accelerations also frequencies of vibrations were considered. The used modelling technique proved to be feasible to execute with acceptable time to make and time to run. The results did compare well to analytical-numerical solutions for the simple models, but unfortunately the coach acceleration of the most complex bridge and vehicle model did not compare well with the performed measurements. Although the results are applicable specifically for the Dutch VIRM train and steel tied-arch bridges with vertical hangers, the modelling technique can easily be generalized to other train types and other bridge types.","Eurocode; passenger comfort; arch bridge; acceleration; ansys; train","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","This paper presents an attitude controller for a small helicopter Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) based on Incremental Nonlinear Dynamic Inversion (INDI). INDI is a sensor-based control method which responds quickly to the commanded input, but also to disturbances. While previous implementations of INDI used a control effectiveness matrix describing effects on rotational accelerations, the implementation presented in this paper uses rotational rates. This is possible with small hingeless-rotor helicopters since the rotational rates are achieved almost immediately, but also the transient is taken into account. By doing so, the matrix contains only constants and the control structure is much simpler. The proposed controller is implemented on a small helicopter which weighs less than 50 grams. The performance of the controller is demonstrated with step responses on roll and heading angles. Also disturbance rejection capabilities are demonstrated. Finally, the controller is deliberately configured incorrectly with wrong control effectiveness and actuator model parameters. A theoretical derivation is provided to predict the effect of incorrect parameters. With experiments, it is demonstrated that the helicopter can be stabilized over a wide range of incorrect values. It is concluded that the demonstrated controller is a suitable choice for small autonomous helicopters.","INDI helicopter uav control attitude","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Control & Operations","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","Currently, after a traffic accident happens and the police arrive at the scene it takes some time for them to gather the necessary evidence. This means that the road is closed for quite some time. To speed this up our client Geodelta has developed Raida. The idea is that the police will take photos of the area using a calibrated DSLR camera. They will then use Raida to generate an accurate computer model of the scene. This model can then be used to gather further evidence, such as measurements of tire tracks. This means that less time is needed on the scene, and the road can be reopened sooner. Our software will be using that structure. The pictures and other data from Raida will be referred to as the Raida data. Often, the police are able to gather photos taken by bystanders using low-end uncalibrated devices, such as smart phones. Many of these photos are taken before the police arrive, which mean that they can contain relevant information that is no longer present when the police take their photos. Currently, the police is uncertain on what to do with these photos. It would be useful to be able to use them to enhance the Raida model. To this end Geodelta asked us to create a way to use smartphone photographs to enhance the Raida model. In this report we will describe the software product we have created. Our product is called Visual Pointcloud Enhancer, or VIPE. It will take as input an accurate 3D model in the form of a point cloud, the photos used to generate this point cloud, and a number of additional uncalibrated photos. It will show additional information about the scene. This report will discuss the algorithms and libraries used for developing VIPE. As Raida has a very limited visualisation of the point cloud, VIPE focuses on a clearer and more informative visualisation of the point cloud so the point cloud can also be used to examine the accident scene. The external photographs are linked to the Raida data using a SfM pipeline which produces a 3D point cloud. The point cloud consists of feature points from the pictures and the camera positions of these pictures. We know that the Raida data is relatively accurate as there is a quality control in the program. We calculate a transformation matrix by comparing the coordinates of the Raida data en SfM pipeline data and can add with this transformation matrix the camera positions of the external data to the Raida data. Within the pipeline SIFT is used to extract features from the photographs and match these features using a nearest neighbour algorithm. While implementing the software some important software goals were taken into account. Geodelta wants to use our software and extend it or use parts of it. Documentation and readability of the code was focused on intensively during the development phase. Also modularity and extensibility were taken in account when writing the software. Testing is also an important part of the code. The software is tested thoroughly using unit tests and continuous integration. These unit tests were executed on Linux and Windows to guarantee VIPE works on both platforms. Also a user test is executed, to check if the software program is clear to the user. The software product we made is a working beta implementation that includes all the requirements set with the client. The product can be extended or partly used for future products of Geodelta.","","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Computer science","","Technische Informatica","TI3806",""

Moreover, data such as imaging, humidity and temperature could be collected by the drone whilst navigating in a greenhouse. This data proves to be insightful for the horticulturist as well as a consultant. We have created a prototype drone which can navigate through a greenhouse, collecting, analysing and visualising crop growth data. This report will give an insight into the process of creating such a prototype. A suitable drone for this task has been selected with the appropriate obstacle sensing sensors for indoor flight. An algorithm to explore the greenhouse has been constructed to navigate through a greenhouse, con- sisting of four states. The drone first searches the wall of the greenhouse, to consequently follow the wall so it can determine the perimeter. Next the drone searches for posts. If the perimeter is determined and if the posts are located, a map of the greenhouse can be generated. Information about the posts and walls is collected using ultrasonic and imaging sensors. Using image recognition techniques post can be detected and with the use of ultrasonic data distance to the posts and walls is determined. Our prototype could be extended with additional sensors to create more insight into greenhouse crop growth.

(mentor)","2016","Thermo-active structures, such as energy piles, are used to store and extract heat energy from soil. In areas with seasonal freezing and thawing, such infrastructure is subjected to changes in the soil structure and, consequently, the soil strength. This research investigated the influence of repeated freeze-thaw (FT) cycles and different freezing rates on the shear strength of a frost susceptible Illite clay. Samples of saturated clay were subjected to between 1 and 20 FT cycles, and the shear strength was determined using undrained unconsolidated triaxial tests on the thawed samples. Soil subjected to freezing exhibited a reduction in shear strength compared to never-frozen soil. Slower freezing rates (warmer surface temperatures) resulted in lower shear strength. Results indicated an inverse relationship between the number of FT cycles and the shear strength with a constant applied freezing temperature. Strength recovery occurred between 1 and 3 freezing cycles. Between 3 and 7 FT cycles, the shear strength decreased, after which it approached an equilibrium shear strength between 7 and 10 FT cycles. The increase in shear strength between 1 and 3 FT cycles at a high freezing rate was not identified in the literature reviewed, but coincides with a decrease in stiffness and ice lens thickness. The reduction in shear strength with increasing FT cycles was attributed to movement of pore water through the sample and formation of ice lenses, which damaged the soil microstructure. The ice lenses formed via cryogenic suction pulling unfrozen pore water towards the freezing front and layer where a new ice lens was growing. Macro-CT scans showed decreasing size of ice lenses with increasing FT cycles, and denser ice lens formation near the freezing surface. The largest change in shear strength and ice lens formation occurred between a surface temperature of -5 and -10°C. Ice lenses increased in size moving away from the freezing surface, and a saturated ‘slurry’ layer formed when the samples thawed. Samples failed along the plane of the largest ice lens. Slower freezing rates resulted in thicker ice lenses and slurry layers, which resulted in lower shear strength and stiffness. At high freezing rates, the soil stiffness was almost double that of the never-frozen clay due to local consolidation of clay fragments. With decreasing freezing rates, local consolidation was offset by formation of large horizontal ice lenses. CT scans indicated that after being exposed to multiple FT cycles, the microstructure of the clay was destroyed. The evolution of shear strength should be taken into account in geotechnical design, as a period of thermal consolidation may be required prior to full loading and the rate and number of times a soil is frozen significantly impacts its shear strength.","geotechnical engineering; frozen ground; thermo-active structure; ice lens; freeze-thaw cycles; freezing rate; shear strength; clay","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2016-12-31","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","","",""

The client for this project is the Tribler Team. Most of the Tribler Team's work revolves around Tribler: an open-source peer-to-peer program which enables its users to find, enjoy, and share content. An earlier bachelor end-project implemented a partial, functional prototype of this idea. We improved the existing concepts and re-implemented a decentralised market from scratch with scalability and as much security as possible, given the limited available development time. This market is the first electronic marketplace to be fully decentralized. There were previous attempts to create such a marketplace, but those implementations fell short in scalability and security. During the research phase, we discovered that the previous decentral market project was not scalable and not production ready, so we made the decision to, together with our client, instead build our application upon a more production-level network platform known as Dispersy. As nothing on the Internet can be trusted which is a problem on its own, we could not make the product as secure as we would have wanted to. At a technical level our contribution consists of 7000+ lines of code, 50+ test suites with a code coverage of +95% and documentation for Dispersy.","electronic market; decentral system; tribler; peer-to-peer; multichain; bitcoin","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Software Technology","","Parallel and Distributed Systems","",""

For the farmhouse that embedded with heritage value, it’s very important to strengthen the building in a heritage friendly way. The notion of heritage value is thus discussed in the paper as to give a clear transformation requirement for the retrofit. The paper takes a specific farm, Onderdendamsterweg 8, as an example to elaborate the topic. Earthquake damages and their formation mechanism are studied to achieve a solid revising proposal, which contains four parts: reinforcement of single components, reducing deformation constraints at connections, adjusting the system stiffness ratio and optimizing load paths and load distribution. Unlike most of the safety-oriented anti-seismic retrofit methods, a kop- hals-romp boerderij intervention assessing system is established to help clearly response to the heritage and aesthetic value of the original building. Based on the assessing system, further design is carried out on several relevant details. Although the research is carried out mainly focus on the example farmhouse, it’s main purpose is to give a reference for the anti- seismic intervention on the kop-hals-romp boerderij, and the methods in judging the heritage value of the farmhouse and the suitability of the intervention can be applied to other farm as well.","Anti-seismic intervention; Heritage evaluation; Transformation Requirement; Earthquake damage; Damage formation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Architecture","","","",""

(mentor); Franzen, A.J. (mentor)","2016","Due to several shifts in the construction industry, organisations start to collaborate. An example of this inter-organisational collaboration is a strategic alliance. Such an alliance can be defined as a close, long-term, mutually beneficial agreement between two or more partners in which resources, knowledge, and capabilities are shared with the objective of enhancing the competitive position of each partner (Spekman, Forbes, Isabella and MacAvoy, 1998). 50 to 60% of those alliances fails and one aspect for success is the organisation (De Man, 2006; Kalmback and Roussel, 1999). However, not much research has been performed to the organisation (Albers, Wohlgezoen and Zajac, 2013). This thesis focusses on the organisation of strategic alliances in which the Dutch engineering agency Sweco participates. Based on the grounded theory approach, the phenomenon strategic alliances has been explored. The combination of a literature review and an empirical research in which the cases Robuust Watersysteem, Ballast Nedam, Strukton and Dekker are analysed, has resulted in a first understanding of strategic alliances. The main conclusion is that strategic alliances in which Sweco participates are based on coincidence and do not have a very clear organisational structure. Hypotheses are that instead of strategic alliances, the collaborations are more tactical alliances. Second one is that there is a relation between the number of participants and the organisational structure. Final hypothesis is that due to the project-based orientation of the construction industry, strategic alliances in this industry are less likely to succeed compared to alliances in a less project-based orientation","strategic alliance; collaboration; construction industry; organisation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Management in the Built Environment","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","For our bachelor project we have been using machine learning to predict account balances for a large Dutch bank holding company. The company’s main interest is the integration of machine learning techniques in their systems. To enable this we have been asked to develop a product to predict account balances for the clients of associated banks. With the clients interest in machine learning in mind we have developed a framework enabling the user to implement different machine learning and non machine learning models. The framework makes it easy to compare the implemented models using different error measures, parameters of inputs and lets the user visualize the results easily. In this framework we have implemented our own models for the account prediction. To compare our models we started with implementing a baseline, next to this baseline we have implemented two non machine learning and one machine learning model. The data we used to train and validate our models has been derived from the clients data warehouse. We have cut the accounts on different criteria like activity and the period they have been with the bank. After that we have normalized the data to be able to better interpreted and process it. The machine learning techniques we want to implement require a lot of training examples, this made us decide implement a clustering model as well to create more data to train our models on. Eventually the clustering did not give us the expected results and we decided not to use it for our final model. To give our client a suited recommendation about the machine learning libraries to use on their systems, we have implemented the same clustering method with two different libraries. After this comparison we were able to recommend our client the Scikit-learn library over the more low level Tensorflow library. From this point on we used the Scikit-learn library as well for the implementation of SVM model. For the regression we implemented the L-1 prediction, OLS method and an SVM. Compared to the baseline, our SVM model gave the best results, however the results of the L-1 prediction closely followed the results of our SVM model. After a better comparison we have discovered that in some cases the SVM model makes a prediction is almost exactly the same as the L-1 prediction, one the other hand, various other predictions are not based on this pattern at all. We therefore assume that after tweaking the SVM more, it will preform better and show significantly better results than the L-1 prediction. For now we did not have time to tweak our SVM, but we have tried different inputs and parameters. As a future improvement these parameters can be tested in more detail and it would be interesting to take a closer look at different militarization methods and error measures. In conclusion we were able to test machine learning techniques with the client’s data by implementing a well working SMV model for account balance prediction. This model works on the clients systems and is validated on real client data. Furthermore we provided our client with a framework that allows them to easily implement machine learning and non machine learning models. This framework provides the user with interfaces to build models, standard data operations and error measures. This allows the user to quickly research many different con- figurations. We used this framework ourselves during this project to compare our machine learning and non machine learning models.","","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Computer Science","","","",""

It is using the city of Kavala as an example of intervention, in order to experiment the outcomes of a new suggestion of design and planning tools. The research started by analyzing the Greek historical and socio-political context. Starting with the fundamental ideals about Plato’s Polis and the way Greece has been developed by its planning history, the project presents the way, in which the Greeks have been diverged from the classical ideals and became very private persons. However, recent history showed that people are seeking for more responsibilities as there is a big mistrust to the very centralized political system. On top of these, the current economic crisis gives even more “food for thought” concerning how public projects should be developed. The goal of the project is to bring resilience into the process of execution. In order to activate the local community into taking actions in the design/decision making, as well as executing, a workshop with citizens and stakeholders took place during the design period of the Thesis. The design itself is consisting of a permanent implementation, executed in the different phases of the project and used as a base for more temporary implementations, according to the area’s and the city’s needs. The local community will be able to use the offered public space as a platform for multiple uses, and create a new kind of destination for recreation, sports, culture and slow tourism.","Kavala; Greece; waterfront; urban design; economic crisis; tourism; participatory design; resilience; workshop","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Urbanism","","","Urban Fabrics",""

One of the courses of the Computer Science BSc curriculum is the Big Data Processing course. The Big Data Processing course teaches students ways of doing so. A popular and teached method is using MapReduce, a programming model to process large quantities of data. Big Data Processing students currently write their implementations for MapReduce related assignments of the lab in the Cloudera Virtual Machine (VM). This VM is slow, cannot be used interactively and it cannot be used to teach all MapReduce principles like memory separation. Since there are no existing solutions that solves these problems we have decided to write our own. Writing our own solution required diverse knowledge including but not limited to JavaScript, ECMAScript 6, WebWorkers, HTML5 (&CSS), PHP, MySQL, API development, Wordpress, Linux, QUnit and Selenium. Our solution, Trifle, overcomes previously mentioned and other shortcomings. Trifle is a web-based solution that simulates MapReduce within the browser. The framework uses JavaScript together with WebWorkers and our front-end is written using Wordpress. By simulating MapReduce within the browser we managed to create a solution that requires no cluster, is easy to use, works multi-platform and most importantly enables lecturers to teach some MapReduce principles that could not be taught before. Furthermore, we integrated a submissions system that can be used to do interactive lectures in which the lecturer can see problems in real-time and explain obstacles. A user test we have done verifies that Trifle helps to better grasp the idea behind MapReduce.","hadoop; mapreduce; big data; javascript; active learning","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Intelligent Systems","","Web Information Systems","",""

(mentor)","2016","Cloud computing has given users access to virtually infinite computing power. Cloud service providers operate data centers consisting of hundreds, sometimes thousands of interconnected machines. The machines dissipate heat that is undesirable because it may lead components to overheat. Air conditioners are used to cool the air and regulate the temperature in the data center. Nerdalize is a company that aims to create a cloud by replacing servers in a data center with CloudBoxes in people's homes. A CloudBox contains servers and a boiler. The heat dissipated by the servers is used to warm up the water in the boiler and complement the central heating system. The challenge set out by Nerdalize is to develop a workflow management system to run on their infrastructure while making optimal use of generated heat. Many workflow management systems exist but none supporting a containers based environment. Flower is a workflow management system in a containerized environment with heat-aware scheduling. Flower consists of several components. The first component is the workflow management system responsible for executing a workflow on a cluster of machines. The second part contains various temperature-based scheduling policies. To the best of our knowledge we are the first ones to introduce the notion of heat when making scheduling decisions.

Hiervoor is kennis over grondwaterstromingen en stijghoogteveranderingen vereist. Deze zijn beide afhankelijk van de systeemdimensies en lokaal geldende bodemkarakteristieken. <br/>In dit rapport is onderzocht hoe de systeemdimensies en bodemparameters de optimale bronscheiding van monobronnen beïnvloed. Doormiddel van een varierende capaciteitsrage van 2.5 – 50 m3/h zijn verschillende monbronnen gesimuleerd onder anisotropie-waarde 2, 5 en 10. Daarnaast is onderzocht hoe de systeemdimensies afhankelijk zijn van de dikte van de aquifer en voor welke dimensies geldt dat warmteverliezen geminimaliseerd worden. <br/>Uit de simulatie volgde dat de optimale bronscheiding profijt heeft van een hoge anisotropie en lange filterlengte. De filterlengte is echter weer van invloed op de vorm van de thermische bel en zo ook bepalend voor warmteverliezen. Bij een hoger vergund volume moeten een langere bronscheiding gehanteerd worden. Een verhoging van het volume gaat gepaard met een minder sterke toename in warmteverliezen. Er geldt dus dat voor grotere systemen een hoger rendement behaald kan worden.<br/>In 5.3 zijn de systeemdimensies gegeven voor minimale systeemlengte en in 5.4 de dimensies voor minimale warmteverliezen.<br","bodemenergiesystemen; monobronsystemen","nl","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This has been offering affordable housing and was built by the municipality of Amsterdam over fifty years ago. It is situated adjacent to the Amsterdam marine terrain which is now in the process of decommissioning and will be redeveloped as a clean-tech/start-up campus. This is likely to attract many highly-educated professionals to the city, aspiring to live close to their workplace. Given the transformation of the marine terrain, and the slow-sale of housing units within the estate to the private market it is clear that any future redevelopment of the area could well result in an extensive gentrification of the site, threatening the provision of affordable housing to low-income families within the city. Through the scenario of a community land trust an alternative model of housing provision manages, through densification, to deliver an equal number of affordable dwellings onto the site as are currently present. Moreover the Land Trust model embodies mutual benefits between the existing residents and new target groups, which are manifested spatially within the design proposal.","Adaptive transformation; Intensification; Renewal; Densification; Community Land Trust; Dwelling; Gentrification; Brownfield Development; Community Empowerment; Post-Welfare; Participatory Society","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Management in the Built Environment","","Dwelling","",""

(mentor)","2016","A recently recognized application of lattice materials is shape morphing technology, where a structure is expected to take a predefined shape in response to a change in environmental (temperature, pressure, etc.) or loading conditions. In a shape morphing structure that uses a 2D lattice material as the basis, one or more struts in the lattice are replaced by actuators. The shape of the structure is then changed by extending or shortening the lengths of these actuators. The shape morphing structure is stiff against external loads, yet triggering an actuator to morph the structure’s shape results in a minimal amount of internal energy storage. In the last two decades, most of the studies in shape morphing technology have focused on the Kagome lattice materials, which have superior properties such as in-plane isotropy, high specific stiffness and strength, and low energy requirement for actuation of its truss members. The Kagome lattice is a member of a large family of (semi-) regular tessellations of the plane. Two fundamental questions naturally arise: 1) What makes a lattice material suitable for actuation? 2) Are there other tessellations more effective than the Kagome lattice for actuation? This research tackles both questions, by comparing an alternative lattice material, the hexagonal cupola, with the Kagome lattice in terms of mechanical/actuation properties. Finally, a new criterion is formulated that will hopefully further facilitate the future search for lattice materials suitable for actuation.","static/kinematic determinacy; cellular solids; lattice materials; finite element method; actuators","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Precision and Microsystems Engineering","","","",""

It is composed of intrafusal fibers, the mechanical properties of which determine the afferent response of the spindle. Intrafusal fibers are not homogenous: they are composed of many sarcomeres, have localized fusimotor innervation and have varying myosin composition throughout their length. Most models of intrafusal fibers do not take these structural considerations into account and model it as a single sarcomere, that way omitting potential emergent behavior that arises from a population of sarcomeres. The effects of sarcomere length inhomogeneity on the behavior of intrafusal fiber is not known. In this study a multi-sarcomeric model is developed and simulated with a varying activation shape along the intrafusal fiber to see whether an emergent behavior in present and how it manifests. Results show that relative activation of contracting sarcomeres has the largest effect. The fiber model with varied activation showed history dependence arising from non-homogenous initial sarcomere length distribution. The model also demonstrated amplitude-dependent behavior under multisine stretches that did not appear in a non-multi-sarcomeric model. In conclusion, it can be stated that multi-sarcomeric models can be beneficial in exploratory studies as they can demonstrate behavior that cannot be described with simplistic models.","modelling; simulation; muscle; intrafusal fibers; multi-sarcomeric","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Biomechanical Engineering","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

(mentor)","2016","Heerema Marine Contractors (HMC) is, amongst other activities, involved in the installation of subsea pipelines and subsea structures. In order to increase efficiency during production and installation these subsea structures are welded into the pipeline instead of installed separately. The presence of subsea structures in the pipeline increases the stresses in pipelines during installation. The stresses in pipelines during installation are analyzed beforehand. These analyses show that with subsea structures becoming bigger, the workability of in-line subsea structure installation becomes unacceptably low. In order to model the hydrodynamic forces acting on subsea structures simplified models are used. The suspicion is that these simplified models are conservative because of the lack of knowledge on the hydrodynamics around complex shaped structures. A first research on the behavior of in-line structure installation and the effects of alternative hydrodynamic loading models has been performed at HMC. On the basis of this research, questions remain. The most important ones are: • Is Morison’s equation applicable for sharp edged and asymmetric structures? • Can forced motion experiments be used to model the dynamic behavior of subsea structures? • Is the motion of sharp edged and asymmetric structures decoupled? This thesis is performed to investigate the hydrodynamics around subsea structures and answer these questions.. With the use of Dynamic Fluid Body Interaction (DFBI) simulations the dynamic behavior of sharp edged and asymmetric structures and the description of this behavior have been investigated. Subsea structures are simplified as thin flat plates and simulations in one and two degrees of freedom have been performed. Over a range of frequencies the behavior in regular oscillating flow has been investigated. From the research it can be concluded that over the range of Keulegan-Carpenter (KC) numbers associated with in-line subsea structure installation Morison’s equation can be used to describe forces accurately and these forces are decoupled. Further research should be performed on the hydrodynamic coefficients for subsea structures as the DNV GL prescribed coefficients cause large differences with the simulated behavior where KC dependent coefficients perform better. Hydrodynamic moments are observed which are not taken into account during installation analysis. The impact of these moments on the dynamic behavior of subsea structures should be further investigated.","Morison's Equation; CFD; DFBI; Hydrodynamics; Subsea structures","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Offshore & Dredging Engineering","","","",""

The challenges in the design of adaptive automation systems are to decide how and when the automation should provide support. This report describes the results of an investigation into a novel triggering mechanism for adaptive automation, which uses the quality of the controller’s decisions to invoke automation support. Instead of reacting to increased workload as most current system do, it is hypothesized that a decision-based triggerig mechanism can help prevent controller-induced workload. A decision-based adaptive automation has been designed and tested in a human-in-the-loop experiment, using three different triggering thresholds in terms of allowed “bad” decisions. Results indicate that the decision-based adaptive automation is capable of increasing efficiency and safety, as compared to manual control. Lower triggering thresholds increased the frustration of subjects and decreased acceptance of the automation support. So even though the adaptive automation with lower triggering thresholds showed higher efficiency and safety, it did not always result in improved workload ratings.","adaptive automation; triggering threshold; decision-quality; air traffic control","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-06-23","Aerospace Engineering","Control & Operations","","","",""

Recently with the advent of MEMS technology, the sensors are capable of capturing acoustic particle velocity along with acoustic pressure and these sensors are referred to as Acoustic Vector Sensors (AVSs). In order to capture the velocity field information, AVSs contain two (three) vector sensors which are aligned along corresponding coordinate axes in the two (three) dimensional acoustic space. Based on narrow-band processing techniques and for a single far-field source scenario, we discuss the advantages obtained by an AVS array in comparison to a conventional APS array based on their respective beam patterns. Later the discussion is extended to a configuration where each AVS in the array contains only one vector sensor (which measures one component of the vector field), such that it can have a variable orientation, and a pressure sensor, which is referred to as a 1D AVS. We discuss the similarities and differences between 2D AVS arrays and 1D AVS arrays through beam patterns. Also we discuss the bias in the source location estimate obtained by using a 1D AVS array. Further we derive Cramer-Rao bounds for 2D AVS, 1D AVS and APS array configurations.

(mentor)","2016","The 3145km long US-Mexican border is one of the longest and most intense borderlines in the world. The border twin cities, El Paso and Juarez, are unlike any of the US or Mexican cities. The two cities grow interdependently, asymmetrically and share lots of contrast. Particularly, crossing the border to shop is common in the region. Both countries have very rich market culture and the border communities could benefit a bigger market in terms of variety, quality and prices. Because of their contrast, cross-border activities could be daily and intense. However, the ports of entries are limited and they are the bottlenecks where influx of people flow getting congested. In average, people spent 1 to 2 hour every day to queue before entering the border checkpoints. Every year, every border crossers spent in total 480 hours waiting in line at the border checkpoints. This creates huge losses on time and money that the border crossers could have spent alternatively for enriching their lives. Therefore, the project proposes to broaden the neutral zone for a hybrid building that allows border crossers to double use their time, enjoying life on the “LINE”. A third program-a co-operative US-Mexican market would be introduced. It would provide a shared public space where commercial, social and cultural exchanges take place. In the end, the entire building design aims to create an integrated alternative experience of crossing the border.","border crossing; US-Mexican border; border; complex project; market","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","architecture","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","Due to financial and environmental considerations there is a need to reduce the fuel consumption in the inland shipping sector. This can be realised by improving the hull design. This research focusses on the bow shape of inland ships. The bow shape with the lowest resistance is not by definition the best bow shape, since other factors such as load capacity play a role as well. Therefore it is researched what the influence of the bow shape is on the resistance. The designer could use this knowledge for finding an adequate trade-off between the resistance and the load capacity. The main research question is: What is the influence of bow shape parameters on the resistance of an inland ship? The research is limited to the ship type Groot Rijnschip, bulbous bows are not included and a reference stern shape is selected that remains unchanged during the research. First is has been investigated which parameters describe the bow. Eight parameters are defined: the bow length, the ship volume, the waterline entrance angle, the rake, the waterplane coefficient, the slope of the sectional area curve at two points in the bow and the ratio between to waterplane areas in the bow. A set of 133 ships with different bow shapes is generated, in which these parameters are varied in a random way. Subsequently it has been determined which parameters are relevant for sailing in restricted water. The sailing speed and water depth are selected for this. The wave making resistance is expected to be the resistance component that is influenced most by the bow shape. Therefore the wave making resistance is calculated with the potential code RAPID for all 133 bows at eight combinations of Froude numbers and water depths. The values for the wave making resistance that are returned by RAPID are suitable for comparing the different bow shapes, but not for predicting the absolute value of the resistance. Since the calculations are carried out at low Froude numbers, the results are subjected to relative large numerical uncertainties. Linear regression models are fitted to the results to evaluate which bow shape parameters have the largest influence on the wave making resistance. These parameters turn out to be the bow length, the ship volume and the two points that describe the slope of the sectional area curve. The way in which the parameters influence the wave making resistance is described in the models, which answers the main research questions. However, there are several restrictions to the models: they are not able to predict the absolute value of the wave making resistance and the coefficients in the models are strongly influenced by outliers in the data obtained from RAPID. The original assumption that the viscous resistance does not change significantly has been checked with several viscous double body calculations in PARNASSOS. The results support the assumption. For practical applications, the ratio between the wave making resistance and the ship volume should be as low as possible. This results in bows shapes with a steep increase of volume at the front part of the bow and a smooth transition between the bow and the parallel midship. For further research it is recommended to obtain a better estimate of the absolute value of the resistance. In this way it can be quantified what the influence of the bow shape on the wave making resistance means for the total ship resistance. If this more reliable data is obtained, it can be combined with data from the stern shape. In this way a detailed, adequate resistance prediction method for inland ships can be generated.","inland shipping; wavemaking resistance; numerical resistance prediction; linear regression","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Marine and Transport Technology","","","",""

(mentor); Verhagen, H.J. (mentor); Kuiper, C. (mentor); Bouw, R. (mentor)","2016","All over the world rubble mound breakwaters are built to protect harbours, shorelines, and other vulnerable coastal areas against wave action and currents. Most of the designs for these structures use so called deterministic or semi-probabilistic design methods (level I). With these methods insight in the uncertainties, and consequently the actual failure probability and behaviour of the structure, is lacking. Moreover, less is known about the physical and mathematical relation between the variables and design formulas. The uncertainties in the variables and design formulae in a semi-probabilistic method are taken into account by partial safety factors. This could lead to an overly conservative design. By applying a probabilistic calculation (level II and III) insight is obtained in the relations between variables, the failure behaviour and the probability of failure of the structure. This information can explain why certain structures, which are designed with a semi-probabilistic method, fail even though the design conditions are not reached or in most cases survive above the design conditions. Information on the actual failure behaviour and probability is desired to make a more reliability design and economic optimization. Despite these benefits probabilistic design methods offer, it is not often applied in daily engineering practice. Multiple studies show the feasibility of designing a rubble mound breakwaters with a probabilistic design method in theory. However in practice only few rubble mound breakwaters are designed with a probabilistic design method. This research investigates how a probabilistic design of a rubble mound breakwater can be made in practice and provides some guidelines when a probabilistic design can be considered. The project Taman is used as a case and from this project a rubble mound breakwater is selected for the fully probabilistic calculation. Simplifications are made regarding the applied mathematical models1 and only four failure mechanisms related to the Ultimate Limit State (ULS) are examined. The four main failure mechanisms are: seaside and rear-side armour stability, toe stability and macro stability. With these simplifications a clear and thoroughly insight is gained in the probabilistic design process of a rubble mound breakwater without loosing track of the actual objective of this study. The fully probabilistic calculation is made with a level III probabilistic design method by applying a Monte Carlo simulation. The results show that this method is a good way to take into account the occurring statistical and physical correlation. Furthermore the Monte Carlo analysis gives a good insight in the most dominant failure mechanisms and in the governing failure situations for each mechanism. The results of the fully probabilistic calculation show that making a semi-probabilistic design based on the design rules in The Rock Manual [2007] results in a conservative design (Pf ,sys,tL = 0.5%). One optimization step is made for the simplified case in this research by applying lower stone classes for the four considered failure mechanisms. This results in failure probability (Pf ,sys,tL = 11.25%) which is still lower than the in general allowable probability of failure (Pf ,sys,tL = 15%). Although not all failure mechanisms for the ULS are taken into account, this study proves that a fully probabilistic calculation results in a more optimized design compared to a semi-probabilistic design method for the examined case. In conclusion a fully probabilistic calculation for a rubble mound breakwater is possible in practise. The results show that it is certainly beneficial to apply a fully probabilistic calculation (Level III) compared to a semi-probabilistic (level I) calculation. However, not in all cases it is possible to apply a fully probabilistic calculation and a couple of aspects should be checked before starting the calculation: • Statistical and physical correlation of the main variables have to be known • Sufficient reliable data for boundary conditions should be available • Applied mathematical models should be incorporated in the fully probabilistic calculation • Design requirements don’t follow directly from the standards and therefore must be agreed with the client This research shows that neglecting the statistical and part of the physical correlation results in an over dimensioned design for a rubble mound breakwater. A fully probabilistic (level III) design method with a Monte Carlo simulation proves to be a good way to include these correlations in the fully probabilistic design process. Sufficient reliable data for the boundary conditions should be available at the project location to make a fully probabilistic design method feasible. Large uncertainties in the boundary conditions result in a high failure probability of the rubble mound breakwater. To determine for which boundary conditions sufficient reliable data has to be known, a FORM analysis (level II) could be applied. This analysis gives ®-values which indicates the influence of each input variable on the failure probability of the rubble mound breakwater. For example in the examined case the uncertainties in the significant wave height have a large contribution to the variation in the probability of failure. The results show that a fully probabilistic calculation is not feasible in this case when the uncertainties in Hs have a standard deviation (σ) of 25% or more. In the semi-probabilistic design the hydraulic boundary conditions are determined via the models SWAN and Delft3D. Additionally the model D-Geo Stability is used for the semi-probabilistic design to check the geotechnical failure mechanisms. In this research is concluded that all hydraulic, geotechnical and geometric conditions need to be carried out in fully probabilistic way. For the fully probabilistic calculation of the simplified case simplifications are made for the mathematical models. These simplifications give a good approximation of the models in this study. However, the mathematical models have to be (in some way) integrated in the statistical analysis to make a fully probabilistic design.","probabilistic design; correlation; rubble mound breakwater","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","This thesis presents the conceptual design process of a consumer food printer for the year 2020, carried out for the Creative Machines Lab at the faculty of Mechanical Engineering at Columbia University, New York (USA) Food printing is a evident evolution in the field of Additive Manufacturing (AM). However, since the food printing technology is a technology pushed innovation and is still in development, so far the added value of food printing to society remains somewhat unclear and the public remains rather skeptical as well. To increase acceptance and to find the added value of food printing, the Verganti design driven innovation method was used in this project, to identify the real potential of food printing. In order to be able to establish this appliance in 2020, a vision of the future was crafted, using the ‘vision in product methodBesides identifying opportunities for food-printing technology in both the medical and special needs market, this thesis hypothesizes that the food printer can provide the most added value in the consumer market of daily life. Currently, throughout the world our food consumption is converging to diets with an increased intake of meat, fat, processed foods, sugar and salt . This nutrition transition is leading to an increase in dietary related diseases, to social inequality, greenhouse gasses and a loss of biodiversity. The westernization of diets is driven by many different causes, such as urbanization, changes in agricultural practices, intensive food production methods etc., but is also driven by our own consumer behavior and attitudes.These consumer attitudes exist of 4 main checkpoints when it comes to decisions about food: cost, experience, convenience and nutrition and nowadays, it’s nearly impossible to check all 4 points, thus resulting in unhealthy decisions. With the quest to improve health, it is envisioned that biometric data about our health will be available to all of us in the near future for just a few cents/ at very low cost. The health analytics/analyses will result in complex nutritional recommendations, and in this development we hypothesize that a food printer is the “missing link” that could bring the benefits of personalized data-driven health to people’s kitchen tables. Besides offering a healthy and personalized food choice, food printers can meet the consumer‘s main criteria for food selection, hereby democratizing the opportunity for a healthy diet. The final proposed concept design goes by the name of ‘Sanna’. The proposed concept is not meant to replace conventional cooking, but it is envisioned to be one of many appliances in our future kitchen, offering healthy dishes supplementing your daily intake. The printer uses unprocessed raw, frozen food purees as ingredients and, with the help of an integrated infra-red cooking element, these ingredients will be converted into tasty, cooked and texturized food. In a culinary workshop at the “International Culinary Center” in New York City, the potential of the food printer was tested and evaluated.The overall concept design proposal resulted in positive feedback by the media, technicians, food critics and chefs, revealing the potential for the consumer market. Currently, the first steps are taken in order to realize a proof-of-principle prototype.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","Advanced Manufacturing","",""

(mentor)","2016","The primary aim of this project was to explore how design can improve teamwork in the orthopaedic clinic. Literature shows that in the healthcare sector, increasing attention is given to teamwork dynamics. In fact, studies demonstrate that communication and teamwork failures contribute significantly to the amount of adverse events. Moreover, it has been found that the patients’ experience of good team coordination is correlated to their overall satisfaction. Therefore, enabling and supporting good teamwork is a way to foster quality and safety of care. A research in the orthopaedic department of the Reinier de Graaf hospital, in Delft, was carried out to gather insights on the topic in practice. Different professionals, involved in the care of orthopaedic patients, were shadowed for one day each and interviewed. Relations among them were derived. Eventually, six opportunity areas to design for improving teamwork were identified. Two of them were chosen to be taken forward in the process. These were: (1) Improving nurses-doctor communication and (2) adapting to the flexible people model. The direction was further narrowed down through additional observations, interviews and two research prototypes with proposed scenarios. Eventually a design framework was created to guide the design ideation. The design wanted to achieve an effect on different levels. First of all, the actors should feel confident in front of the other professional and of the information they share and receive. On a behavioural level, they should be able to show a proactive and open attitude that fosters the right climate for collaboration. On a task level, the actors should be able to provide processable information to each other and the interaction with the product should be collaborative, effortless and meaningful. The resulting interaction between the actors would be smooth and collaborative. A set of four concepts was developed and an iterative design process was applied to develop the chosen concept from a conceptual to a defined form. A series of prototypes was built to let nurses and doctors test the idea and provide feedback on how to improve the design. The end result is the Patient Portrait, a monitor based application that is meant to provide value for the nurses and the doctor on an individual and team level. Through the means of graphic representations, the concept provides a structure for the exchange of information between nurses and from nurse to doctor in a to-the-point yet narrative fashion. The individual needs are supported by providing specific features for the professionals to accomplish their tasks and, at the same time, providing processable information to the next actor in the chain: night nurse, day nurse and doctor. An interactive prototype of the final design was developed for the evaluation of the product. The concept could be tested in the intended context of usage, where the participants used the prototype for their regular tasks. The results revealed the different practices that emerged through the use of the product. During the visit, the prototype allowed the users to share a common ground for discussion, from which they were able to ask for clarifications and questions to the colleagues based on the visible data they were presented with. The users recognized the benefits of the product in relation to their daily activities, especially pertaining to a lower cognitive effort. Suggestions about the further development and implementation of the design conclude the report.","teamwork; orthopaedic; HiPP; healthcare","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","","",""

(mentor); Nijhuis, S. (mentor); Tummers, L.C. (mentor)","2016","This graduation stems from my personal interest in gender studies and its deep-rooted connection to the construction of space. Born in a country, where gender inequality is evident in all walks of life, the interest gradually transformed to an urge to study the possible ways this burning issue could be tackled. The intention of the project is to question the status quo that has been inherent and now a part of the daily ways of life. Women in India face many socio-economic challenges in the current cultural context. Through this project, the role of space in the path towards gender equality will be explored. The basic foundation of gender arises from the roles, sometimes stereotyped that have been designated to the different genders. Productive and reproductive roles have been assigned to men and women, respectively on the basis of their biological make. In this project, the productive space or paid work and in spatial terms industry is a subject of study in the context of changing gender roles. Since these roles are not as strictly reinforced as before, the relationship between this productive and reproductive space is important. Home and Industry have been gendered spaces in history, and the spatial separation of the two will be the main theme challenged. The need to re examine the way our cities are planned is established and one of the approaches of providing flexibility for both genders is the objective. To understand the realities, the city of Bangalore in India is chosen with two sectorial industries as case studies. The industries chosen are the garment manufacturing and IT Industry, which have been two of the industries that have seen an increase of women workers. Through the case studies, fieldwork and observation, the thesis will intend to highlight the spatial attributes that affect women and their daily patterns. One of the spatial principles that have been challenged is the segregation of land uses in the city. This was one of the main findings on the basis of which gendering in public space was found to take place. The strategy proposed for the two industries tackle this mono-functional land use. Another spatial characteristic is the suburbanisation of jobs, which restricts economic opportunities to a large population, and in this population, women are one of the vulnerable groups. The freedom to move in cities is an important factor, but with the lack of safety in public space and time as a constraint this freedom is controlled. The strategy also looks at how accessibility within the city can improve the everyday life of women. Therefore, the opportunity of women to be able to access jobs and urban services is a primary component in the organisation of the city. The approach taken in this project is to show how space is a factor in defining gender roles by considering their specific needs. In a way, by providing men and women equal spatial accessibility to services and opportunities, in this case economic, gender inequality can be partially addressed.","gender; industry; spatial planning; Bangalore; garment industry; IT industry","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Urbanism","","","",""

(mentor); Peters, R.Y. (mentor)","2016","The Netherlands is characterised by mostly low lying, flat, and engineered agricultural lands, which are sensitive to flooding. To protect against floods, a correct network characterisation is of the utmost importance. A Dutch water resources management company, the HDSR, wishes to have a highly automated method to characterise the water course network. In this thesis, I investigate the possibilities of automatically identifying water courses in flat and engineered landscapes, using the raw points of the AHN3 LiDAR dataset. I found that there are many methods described in literature which identify channel-like features, and some which identify water courses in engineered landscapes, but none of these are suitable for this application. Thus, I designed a new methodology which is based on two concepts; (1) concave hulls, and (2) the MAT. The concave hull approach makes use of the presence of water in the water courses, while the MAT uses the concave profiles of the water courses to identify them. A workflow was implemented which uses the raw AHN3 LiDAR point cloud to identify for every water course the polygons of the water surface, and the geographical position of the water surface's centre lines. The implemented prototype was used for four different areas to test its applicability to different environments; a clay, peat, urban, and sand area. The water course characteristics in terms of water surface width and surface concavity, differ between these areas. The resulting datasets were validated to obtain mapping and positional accuracies. The experiments performed in this thesis show the potential of the designed methodology. The concave hull method is very robust to errors in the identification; there are relatively few errors of commission. However, the method does not perform well for high vegetation coverage or low water surface width. It is particularly suited for use in areas where relative water levels are high, water courses are wide, and vegetation coverage is low. The MAT is able to operate well when water levels are low, or even when water courses are dry, and it is relatively insensitive to vegetation coverage. However, it does not perform well for water courses which show little surface curvature, and is prone to errors of commission caused by local non-watercourse convexities and concavities. The combined prototype provides a strong and promising approach for the automatic identification of water courses in flat and engineered landscapes from the raw AHN3 point cloud. When the methods are combined, they manage to identify 98% of all water courses for the clay area, 97% for the peat area, 95% for the urban area, and 76% for the sand area. Clearly, the identification rates profit from the combination of methods. However, the relatively high error of commission of the MAT also radiates into the combined method. The error of commission is then 8% for the clay and peat area, 47% for the urban area, and 17% for the sand area. A number of possible improvements are identified which could elevate the identification rate for the sand area, but specifically lower the presented commission rates. Although the methods currently require a small amount of calibration when applied to new areas, they can in principle be fully automated.","identification; extraction; water course; water courses; drainage channels; drainage network; AHN3; AHN; LiDAR; point cloud; raw LiDAR; flat; engineered; Netherlands","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Urbanism","","Geomatics","",""

De hoofdvraag luidt: In hoeverre kunnen boomstammen toegepast worden als bodembescherming om erosie en ontgronding te voorkomen? Voor het onderzoek zijn een aantal proefopstellingen samengesteld, waarbij het effect van een bepaalde variabele op de kritieke stroomsnelheid is onderzocht. De volgende variabelen zijn uiteindelijk onderzocht: aantal lagen, oriëntatie, wel of geen verbindingen en soort doorsnede. Bij elke proefopstelling (ook de niet onderzochte) zijn verbanden afgeleid op basis van Izbash en op basis van Shields, waarbij de kritieke stroomsnelheid een functie is van de afmetingen van de boomstam. Bij beide verbanden is er nog één onbekende over, die na het experimenteel onderzoek bepaald kon worden. Het onderzoek is gedaan met behulp van modelboomstammen in een stroomgoot. Er is gebruik gemaakt van een fotocamera en een stroomsnelheidsmeter. Achteraf kon met behulp van de beeldjes bepaald worden bij welke stroomsnelheid de boomstammen instabiel werden. Vervolgens zijn met deze resultaten de onbekende in de verbanden op basis van Izbash en Shields bepaald. Bij het effect van het aantal lagen op de kritieke stroomsnelheid is gebleken dat één laag boomstammen de hoogste kritieke stroomsnelheid heeft (1,547 m/s, geschaald). Verder is bij het effect van oriëntatie op de kritieke stroomsnelheid gebleken dat de constructie die evenwijdig stond aan de stroomrichting de hoogste kritieke stroomsnelheid heeft (1,547 m/s, geschaald). Daarnaast is bij het effect van het toepassen van wel of geen verbindingen gebleken dat de constructie met touw de hoogste kritieke stroomsnelheid heeft (1,596 m/s, geschaald). Tot slot is bij het effect van de soort doorsnede op de kritieke stroomsnelheid gebleken dat de constructie met de doorsnede met takken en ronde hoeken de hoogste kritieke stroomsnelheid heeft (1,666 m/s, geschaald). Om te concluderen of het mogelijk is om een boomstamconstructie als bodembescherming toe te kunnen passen zijn de gevonden kritieke stroomsnelheden vergeleken met de snelheden in een echte rivier. Voor de vergelijking is de rivier de Waal genomen. De stroomsnelheid in de rivier varieert van 1,0 tot 2,0 m/s. Uit de resultaten is gebleken dat de hoogste gevonden kritieke stroomsnelheid gelijk is aan 1,666 m/s. Hieruit is geconcludeerd dat de boomstammen voor een groot gedeelte van de Waal wel als bodembescherming gebruikt kunnen worden. Voor rivieren met een hogere stroomsnelheid is de aanbeveling om in vervolgonderzoeken een constructie te vinden die een hogere kritieke stroomsnelheid heeft.","","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","CTB3000",""

The alteration degree of the regular social housing stock is not high enough to accommodate these large numbers of permitted refugees. In addition, there are no alternatives available for this target group, leading to stagnation in throughput from centralised governmental asylum seeker housing to regular social housing. This is presented as the central question in this graduation thesis. This research has shown that one of the biggest bottlenecks reported by the interviewees is the fact that temporary transformation projects are legally and financially incompatible with each other. In addition, the social and political support is a major bottleneck, referring to the residents of on-going transformation projects for this target group, as well as the societal tendencies. ""Unknown, unloved”; is mentioned in several interviews by different parties in different municipalities as the underlying reason for the opposition to plans for housing for both asylum seekers and PRs. There are also problems mentioned in cooperation, albeit of lower priority. To solve the problem, there should be more money available for the redevelopment of vacant buildings for this target group. This can be done directly, by granting subsidies to transformation projects or indirectly, by changing the rules on temporary transformations, allowing the operating period to be extended. Finally, another possibility is to look at other ways to increase social housing capacity. In order to be able to implement the theorised problem in practice, the Metagame is designed. This game is based on the Metagame analysis, but let the players themselves carry out the analysis instead of the analyst. This leads to more achievable possible solutions, since the goal of the game is to create consensus amongst the players themselves within the constraints that the actors are subject to in real life.","Transformatie; Refugee housing; Statushouders; Vluchtelingen; Huivesting","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Real Estate & Housing","","","",""

Amsterdam is a big city with a large population and a large group of immigrants. There is a shortage of different types of housing, which means that transformation of vacant offices into housing will be a good solution for both problems. A lot of vacant offices are transformed into hotels or student housing while there is also a shortage on liberalized housing for middle incomes. That is because of changes in the regulation, where the households with middle-incomes are not allowed to stay in social rented housing. On the other hand it is difficult for these people to get a mortgage. Former research has shown different stimulants that the municipality of Amsterdam used in order to stimulate the transformation of vacant offices into housing. There are also instruments designed for determining the conversion potential of vacant ofﬁces. The focus of this research is on stimulating tools for the transformation of vacant offices into liberalized rental housing for middle-incomes. Therefore three case studies of transformation of ofﬁce buildings into liberalized housing have been selected and interviews with the actors who are involved in these transformations are conducted in order to find the obstacles why transformation of office into liberalized housing is not taking place on the same level like student housing or a hotel function. The findings of this thesis show that different factors are seen as obstacles, by different actors.

(mentor)","2016","Over the past five years, deep learning techniques have led to astounding breakthroughs in many areas, like speech recognition and computer vision applications. The application of deep learning in the radar domain has however been rather limited. The merit of using deep learning techniques for the purpose of human gait classification in radar is investigated. Several models based on three deep neural network architectures, the multi-layer perceptron, the autoencoder and the convolutional neural network, are used to distinguish human walking and running gaits from non-gait signatures in radar micro-Doppler spectrograms. The effects of model architecture, size and depth are analyzed and convolutional models are proven to be the most effective. A deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) is designed to distinguish the number of human gaits in a multi-target classification scenario. Experimental data includes synthetic data at several radar frequencies and SNR levels, as well as X-band CW radar measurements taken at various ranges. The effects on the performance of the DCNN are investigated by varying with regularization methods, the amount of training data, training algorithms, parameter initialization, and transfer learning. Deep learning techniques, and convolutional neural networks in particular, are proven to be an effective approach for human gait classification in radar.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-06-22","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics","","Microwave Sensing, Signals & Systems","",""

The comparative study leads to two main analyses: six key variables which show the key variations that exist in national spatial strategies in content, process and product; and a matrix which shows location specific innovations. Everything learned in the comparative study is tested in a demonstration in which the characteristics are replicated and applied onto the Dutch context to understand the level of transferability and the dependence on the context. The lessons learned for the research are formulated into a road map for NOVI, offering four recommendations to consider when creating NOVI, alongside a personal design proposal for what NOVI should look like based on the research conducted.","comparative study; spatial planning; strategy making; content; process; product; policy transfer; spatial strategies","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Urbanism","","","",""

Additions are allowed only if they do not detract from the interesting parts of the building, integrate harmoniously, yet are distinguishable to prevent architectural falsification of the monument. Completely transparent additions to historic buildings of structural glass can be an answer to all the above demands. As a research into these possibilities, a refurbishment proposal is made for the Ruin of Teylingen in the Netherlands. Here the original wood roof that is missing, is replaced by a structural glass roof. As a design research, the glass roof design has been elaborated in this graduation. The roof has the same shape and size of the original roof, and closes off the donjon, allowing a new function to be put in the castle. Laminated heat-strengthened glass beams are connected to a slender steel contour frame. To create a fluid curvature, laminated heat-treated cold bend glass panels are used, which are held in place by clamping joints, connected onto the glass beams. Passive climate measures are used to prevent overheating of the glass roof. A glass floor allows the roof to be used as a lookout point over the refurbished area around the castle. The design is checked by structural calculations. The product of the design process is an plausible and elegant solution for covering the historic building with an all glass roof that respects the historical and aesthetical value of the monument. This research has shown that if designed and detailing right, structural glass can be a very appropriate solution for the restoration of monumental buildings.","Transparency; Structural glass; Restoration; Structural Design; Float glass; Cold bend glass","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Architectural Engineering and Technology","","Building Technology","",""

This brings with it a myriad of socio-economic consequences, especially in the vicinity of airports. In order to combat this aircraft noise at its origin, it is important to know where it originates from and determine the prevalent sound sources on an aircraft and their contribution to the noise. The goal of this research is to determine the different aircraft noise sources in fly-over data collected by a microphone array during landing. In addition to locating the prevalent noise sources, also the variability is assessed. Subsequently it is investigated to what extent the engine settings and aircraft velocity affect the sound levels of the noise produced by these sources. The data used to accomplish this goal was collected from 115 fly-overs at Schiphol Airport on two separate measurement days, using an acoustic array with 32 microphones that was developed at the faculty of Aerospace Engineering. Of these measurements, 43 Boeing 737 “Next Generation” fly-over measurements were selected for analysis. Using beamforming, the locations of different sound sources and their corresponding sound pressure levels were determined. After defining different sound signals from the fly-over data, using conventional delay-and-sum beamforming on these signals, various noise sources at the engines and a noise source at the wings were located. The correlation of these noise sources sound pressure level with the engine setting and velocity was also investigated. This helped to further determine the origin of the noise.","aircraft noise; beamforming; noise variability","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Control & Operations","","Aircraft Noise and Climate Effects (ANCE)","",""

(mentor); Rocco de Campos Pereira, R.C. (mentor)","2016","The problems in Paraisópolis are numerous, but these are the main problems concerning water and waste. São Paulo has a climate with a wet and a dry season. During the wet season, floods occur throughout the city, including Paraisópolis. But in the dry season, the entire city suffers from drought. This drought has intensified over the last years, because of climate change: the wet season has shortened and less rain falls each year. Because Paraisópolis is an informal neighbourhood, infrastructure is not regulated as it is in the rest of the city. Most houses are connected to the water grid, but not all connections are legal and safe. Likewise, not all houses are connected to the sewerage. Many connections are home-made and there’s also open sewerage, running through some streets, only covered with a grid. Also, solid waste is not always collected and the open sewerage is getting clogged with this solid waste. These various problems interfere with each other. Because of the open sewerage, during flooding, waste material from lavatories is taken up and washed into the streets. Because of the street pattern and the height differences in the neighbourhood, this can effect a large area. This web of problems leads to this hypothesis: creating new public space with specific qualities will create the space required to address the problems of water and waste in Paraisópolis. These qualities must be found through Urban Metabolism and theory regarding the connectivity to the formal city. Possibilities to create extra improvements for the neighbourhood via the new public spaces should not be ignored. To address both the physical and social situation of Paraisópolis, a plan needs to be made, consisting of a design and a process: a spatial strategy.","urban metabolism; favela; slum upgrading; public space","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Urbanism","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","Right now, everyone is using many different personal computing devices to clench their desire to be informed, where manufactures have tried their hardest to integrate as many features as possible into one device. For most of the tasks executed they are overkill, and for others insufficient. Furthermore, they are quickly outdated and require a full replacement. What if, instead, devices are optimised for what they are best at? And instead of carrying a one size fits all, users are offered the functionality of the omnipresent devices working together. What if a system could adapt to a task, by combining and using only those resources it needs at that time? The Personal Adaptive Informing Platform offers an adaptive modular approach to personal wearable computing. Instead of pre-defined configurations of hardware and software, the Platform aims to provide an Informing Service by composing an assembly, out of the available resources in the local and cloud environment, to fit the task it is asked to perform. The core of the Platform’s architecture consists of the following Native Platform Modules: Orchestration, Architecture Management (AM), Context Management (CM), Resource Management (RM), Plan Management (PM), Informing Management (IM) and Reasoning & Decision Making (RDM). Together with other external resources, they form the Platform Assembly (A). The Platform follows a highly autonomous level of operation to work together with users in information heavy tasks. Constant awareness of the context it is operating in, the habits and desires of the users, knowledge of the available resources, high levels of semantic reasoning, and the ability to plan an approach to requested tasks, allow the Platform to provide assistance in many different situations. This allows the Platform to offer a highly adaptive way for users to interact with the vast amount of connected resources in the local and cloud environment. Providing a personalised experience, adjusted to fit an individual user’s needs.","adaptive; pervasive; ubiquitous; computing; internet of things; cloud; adaptive system; informing system; wearables; modular architecture; design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","","",""

Furthermore, the current products can only augment a small percentage of the user’s field of view. The product described in this thesis uses equipment available on the consumers market to implement augmented reality. By connecting two cameras to an Oculus Rift and some additional hardware, an environment is created in which the users can experience augmented reality with virtual reality equipment. The additional hardware consists of an FPGA and a personal computer taking care of adding content to the virtual image of the real world. Directly connecting the cameras to the FPGA results in a short low latency path. This should allow the user to perceive the world with the least possible amount of introduced lag. The prototype is not finished yet, so whether it’s possible to achieve the low-latency throughput is still not known. However, the modules that are responsible for reading from an HDMI input, writing to an HDMI output, controlling the memory and conversion between color spaces have already been implemented. The details of these implementations are discussed in this document.","","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Intelligent Systems","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","Sand sculptures are an inspiration source for an environmentally friendly building material, consisting only of sand, clay and water. The art of sand sculpting is generally dealt with low technical consideration. There is a need of comprehensive technical look on this topic in order to make standards for sand-sculpting. This study involves literature and experimental investigation to find out the optimal sand-clay mixture for sand sculpting with focus on the best preparation method, optimal water content, highest strength and the development of strength over time. Four sand clay mixes were prepared, 100% sand, 95% sand – 5% clay, 90% sand – 10% clay and 85% sand – 15% clay. Standard Proctor compaction tests were carried out to find the water content, at which the soil achieved the highest dry density for standard compaction energy. It was expected that the highest dry density corresponds with the maximum strength. On this water content, cubes of 3,5 cm on all sides were constructed. These cubes were tested on ultimate unconfined compressive strength (UCS), after oven drying (at 0% water content). Also the strength development over the drying time at room temperature was tested using the UCS. The optimal preparation method was found to be to soak the clay in the water for 24 hours in small cubes to get the clay as liquid as possible. Then the sand can be mixed through without the presence of clay lumps. With the proctor tests it was found that the dry density increases with increasing clay content. The optimum water content decreases with increasing clay content and values ranged between 11% and 17%. Additionally, UCS values were found to be increasing with increasing clay content. The highest value of 1,2 MPa was recorded for 85% sand. 1,0 MPa was recorded for 90% sand and a significantly lower value of 0,4 MPa for 95% sand. The strength after a drying time of 3 days was found to be the same as for oven drying 1,2 MPa for 85% sand, 1,0 MPa for 90% sand and 0,5 MPa for 95% sand. However, these values are lower for a drying time of 8 days. This suggests there might be an optimum water content, that is higher than the equilibrium moisture content. The results of this report indicate that a properly prepared mixture consisting of 15% clay and 85% sand at an optimum water content is suitable for an artist to make a strong sand sculpture on the beach.","","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience and Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","Selective Laser Melting (SLM) is an Additive Manufacturing (AM) technique that uses a laser to selectively melt metallic powder in a layer-wise manner, in order to produce functional metal components. It offers great freedom in design and facilitates fast iterations, with the potential of speeding up development phases throughout a wide range of industries. Despite these opportunities, its application into industry is limited. One of the problems that is a limiting factor, is the high residual stress and large deformations that are introduced to the components during manufacturing. This is detrimental to the fatigue strength of a part and can even lead to cracks. In order to be able to understand, predict and eventually prevent such phenomena, a wide range of numerical models is already available in literature. Each of these models focus at one of more specific aspects of the SLM process. However an accurate prediction of the residual stresses for a complete component, requires detailed knowledge on the thermal history throughout the component. Due to a moving heat source, this problem is transient by nature and due to the local heat input by the laser, steep temperature gradients arise. This requires a fine discretisation, resulting in a computationally expensive model. The goal of this thesis is to contribute to the development of a computationally efficient process model of SLM, by developing a computationally efficient and reasonably accurate model of the thermal evolution of a part manufactured with the SLM process. In this work, two different modelling approaches are investigated, both use the Finite Difference (FD) method to discretise the problem at hand. The first approach uses thermal modes, which is the application of a modal solution to the heat equation. This method aims to use a truncated number of superposed eigensolutions and thereby reduce the computational load. Numerical eigenvalues and eigenvectors (also called thermal modes), were obtained for a SLM-relevant two dimensional example with insulated boundaries and a stationary instantaneous Gaussian heat source. The results are compared to the analytic solution to this problem, and by means of a convergence study settings are found that provide an accurate yet efficient discretisation. Due to the temporal variation of the loading, a relatively large amount of thermal modes needed to be retained to obtain an accurate solution. Introducing also spatial variation of the loading in a moving heat source example causes the thermal modes approach not have a significant advantage over a standard numerical integration method in terms of computation time. The second approach is the multi-scale approach. This method aims at modelling the different length scales, which are present in an SLM process by nature, with different models. The region close to the laser spot is discretised in a fine manner, the remainder of the domain is discretised coarsely. The FD method that is used, can only work on a uniform grid, i.e. it cannot handle a gradual mesh refinement. Instead an abrupt change between the coarse and the fine grids exists, which poses a challenge in coupling the two. For the coupling from the coarse region towards the fine region, the use of coupling nodes is proposed. The temperature values of these coupling nodes are found using interpolation on the temperature values of neighbouring coarse nodes, and serve as input to the calculations in the fine region. For the coupling from the fine towards the coarse region, the use of heat flux over the interface between the fine region and coarse region is proposed. The outward heat flux is calculated for every fine node on the interface, these values are used to heat up the surrounding coarse nodes. Also for this approach a convergence study was used to find settings that provide an accurate yet efficient discretisation. Despite some concerns on the discretisation of the laser movements, satisfactory results are obtained. A comparison of a multi-scale simulation to a simulation using a fine discretisation throughout the whole domain, showed that the multi-scale approach is an order of magnitude faster. By a comparison of two different scan patterns it has been shown that the multi-scale approach is indeed able to track the local thermal history. Thereby it can be concluded that the multi-scale approach has the potential to reduce the computational load of calculating the thermal evolution of a part produced with the SLM process, whilst still being reasonably accurate. This modelling approach is not fully mature yet, therefore recommendations for further research are given.","Selective Laser Melting (SLM); thermal modes; multi-scale","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Precision and Microsystems Engineering","","Engineering Mechanics","",""

(mentor)","2016","This report proposes that the emerging technology of RF energy harvesting is at the right technology readiness level that it can be embedded in low-powered climate sensors for the smart home market. The smart home market is a sub market of the Internet of Things, and the prediction for this market is that in 2022, an average home will have 500 connected devices. The market is stagnating although the awareness of a smart home is getting more traction with the general public. The market is facing a two-faced problem, there is a slim to none interoperability between companies and every company or consortium of companies is pushing their own platform of products and/ or standards, while especially for communication standards; it is key that there will be a universal standard for all layers of communication between devices. The other side of the problem is the power supply of sensors, and that is what the outcome of this report is solving. The outcome of the research of this report is that RF energy harvesting is ready to be embedded in these low-powered sensors that will increase exponentially in numbers in homes. This first wave of sensors that will be in your homes will all power itself with a battery but with the amount of sensors increasing, changing batteries will be an annoying activity and costly for the party that has to constantly change batteries. This problem can be solved by harvesting power out of radio waves that are already all around us in the form of Wi-Fi, 3G, 4G and television signals. The implications are enormous, the lifetime of a sensor can be extended significantly at this level of the technology. But the technical research in this report indicates that when it matures, a sensor could be continuously trickle charged with the electrical charge that radio waves have. What this means is that, if programmed efficiently for longevity, a sensor’s battery can live longer than the product life of a sensor, and thus having a unlimited operational lifetime. This report shows the business case of the on-going partnership between “smart thermostat developer”, one of the biggest smart thermostat providers in Europe, and Nowi, the startup whom will be the first company to commercialise this technology in the smart home market. The co-founder of Nowi, and author of this report, has build a working, proof-of-principle prototype that validates the readiness level of this technology in a low-powered sensor. This solves the power supply of sensors, but this report proposes another product to improve the interoperability between products in a home: The smart switch. This Nowi family of products will help enable the smart home and will facilitate companies to atone to the needs of the next wave of home buyers and first adopters of the smart home: generation Y, the millennials. When this product will be developed until commercialisation, not only will it have an impact on the smart home, but on the entire third wave of the internet, the internet of things. In the near future, technology will become ubiquitous and sensors will play a crucial role in the succession of this data- driven megatrend.","wireless power; smart home","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","Strategic Product Design","",""

This has increased the interest in risk analysis methods since these try to better understand this so-called cyber-risk. However, these methods fall short since they do not sufficiently take into account the behaviour of defender organisations, which can be public or private organisations, and the behaviour of threat agent organisations, those who perform cyber-attacks. These are important determinants of cyber-risk. In this paper, a complex adaptive systems (CAS) perspective is used for cyber-risk analysis. Performing cyber-risk analysis through this perspective creates increased understanding in the relationship between the defender and threat agent behaviour and cyber-risk. In order to generate these insights, an agent-based model (ABM) is constructed. I will show that new insights, regarding the cyber-risk that is carried by a defender organisation, are generated by this novel combination of cyber-risk and CAS. The novelty of these insights must encourage scholars in the field of cyber-risk to embrace the CAS-perspective in cyber-risk analysis so that the understanding of cyber-risk can be further increased.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Multi-actor Systems","","","",""

(mentor); Maat, C. (mentor); Molin, E. (mentor); Van Alphen, L. (mentor)","2016","Ever since the rise of the industrial revolution, one of the greatest challenges for governments relates to the variety of traffic problems that have emerged in urbanized areas (Buchanan, 2015; Headicar, 2015). A vastly growing and promising worldwide spread transport policy is the development of urban bike sharing programmes. These programmes can be found in cities all over the world and have been proven to contribute to: a modal shift towards the use of more sustainable transportation modes, a reduction in externalities of non-sustainable modes, an increase in the accessibility of urban regions and a decrease in bicycle parking and traffic congestion (e.g. DeMaio, 2009; Fishman et al., 2014). These systems provide the public with shared use of a bicycle fleet for a small fee, making cycling a possible mode choice at any location throughout an urban region (Shaheen et al., 2010a). There is currently only one bike sharing system found in the Netherlands: the Public Transport bicycle (PT-bicycle). This system is found at medium to large railway stations where the PT-bicycle can be used for the last leg of the journey (NS, 2015). Although this system is very successful, it does not provide the variety of trip options and flexibility that urban bike sharing systems offer in other countries. Its success does indicate however that there is indeed a demand for bicycles at locations where the privately owned bicycle is not available. This raises the question whether there is a market for destination-based bike sharing systems in the Netherlands which are not limited to train stations, and what such a system should look like. Since commuting and business travel highly contribute to urban traffic congestion and emissions in the Netherlands, it is important to increase the use of sustainable modalities for these travel motives. The objective of this research is therefore to provide recommendations for bike sharing system design in order to introduce the service as an attractive mode option to commuters and business travellers in the Netherlands. This objective corresponds to the main research question: How should an urban bike sharing system be designed in order to attract commuters and business travellers in the Netherlands? The first step in this research is to determine the basic elements of a bike sharing concept aimed towards Dutch commuters and business travellers based on extensive background research and expert interviews. This concept is developed to serve as a basis for testing preferences with regards to bike sharing system design and its use as well as to determine the characteristics of Dutch commuters and business travellers that are interested in using a shared bicycle. Based on this research it was found that several conditions are to be met in order for this bike sharing concept to be a realistic representation of how bike sharing will exist in Dutch cities in the future, so that preferences and user characteristics can be determined. Firstly, the concept should be able to provide a mix of both traditional and electric bicycles so that preferences regarding the type of bicycle can be studied in more detail. Secondly, the bicycles should be able to be picked up at any location thereby creating a hypothetical situation in which all potential users are able to access the system, allowing their preferences to be tested. Thirdly, the system should be flexible with regards to two aspects: the system should allow the bicycles to be able to be locked anywhere and at any time and in addition the drop-off or return location of the bicycles should be flexible. This means that the shared bicycle should be allowed to be returned at any docking station. Lastly, the pricing structure presented in the concept has to allow the potential user to pay for use through a fixed fee per kilometre so that the trip costs reflect the cost structure that is expected to be used in Dutch bike sharing systems. Preferences and the perception with regards to making use of a shared bicycle as well as preferences regarding several system characteristics and the characteristics of potential users are studied using a web survey which consists of a questionnaire as well as a stated choice (SC) experiment. The questionnaire consists of questions that study the characteristics of potential users, the current trip characteristics of the respondents and questions that explore user preferences regarding the use of a shared bicycle, while the SC experiment is used to study preferences regarding several system characteristics. A SC experiment is used here as this method allows us to be able to determine the influence of design attributes upon the choices that are observed, thereby gaining understanding of how different characteristics or attributes are balanced against each other in the bike share mode choice. The SC experiment that is developed in order to study how several system characteristics influence the bike share mode choice consists of a series of choice sets, in which for every choice set three alternatives are presented to the respondent. The first two involve shared bicycle alternatives varying in attribute values, while the third alternative is a no-choice alternative, representing any other transport mode. The attributes that make up the shared bicycle alternatives are the bicycle type (traditional versus electric), access time, egress time and the trip costs. While making their choices, respondents are told to assume that they have to travel a certain distance with the shared bicycle, which varies across the choice sets. This context variable allows for examining how different trip distances influence the preference for certain attribute values and the general preference for a shared bicycle over other transport modes. The web survey is distributed amongst a sample of the population of Dutch commuters and business travellers to gather stated preference data on potential users of a bike sharing system that aims to facilitate commuting and business trips. In order to incorporate commuters and business travellers who vary regarding their preferences towards driving and cycling, the survey was distributed amongst employees from one large and three smaller employers whom all have multiple office locations throughout the country. The 293 respondents were found to be predominantly male, on average aged 47 years old, have different educational backgrounds and professions. A large portion of the respondents uses a (company) car for their commuting trip, while public transportation and the bicycle are chosen by smaller portions of the respondent sample. This sample is therefore believed to be a reasonable representation of the population. From the observed choices made in the SC experiment and a mixed logit (ML) model taking into account panel effects is estimated which includes taste heterogeneity for the bike sharing constant as well as the bicycle type parameter. This ML panel model shows that for this model setup there is a high degree of variation in unobserved preferences for bike sharing over other modalities. However, there is no preference for a shared bicycle compared to other modalities or vice versa when averaged over all respondents. Next to the bike sharing constant, the results show that the trip cost and interaction effects with trip cost are the most important attributes influencing the commuters’ bike share mode choice. The parameter estimates for the random parameters bicycle type and the bike sharing constant are by far the most accurately measured estimates. Other attributes such as the trip distance and education seem secondary attributes in determining the bike share mode choice. In addition there is quite a bit of unobserved variation in the importance of the bicycle type parameter. Furthermore, the interaction effect of trip distance on bicycle type shows that the traditional bicycle is preferred for shorter distances while the electric bicycle is preferred for trip distances of over 4.5 kilometres. The difference in utility between both types of bicycles however is relatively small. With regards to the utility of trip distance itself, it is found that commuters are open towards using a shared bicycle for trips up to 8 kilometres. In addition to determining the influence of design attributes upon the choices that are observed, an SC experiment can be used to predict the choice probabilities of people opting for a shared bicycle based on the estimated bike share mode choice model. Several system design scenarios are tested using this method to determine recommendations for bike sharing system design. The traditional bicycle is found to be preferred for short distances while the electric bicycle is preferred for longer distances. Due to the electric bicycles being much more costly than the traditional bicycles however, it is recommended to only provide electric bicycles in a bike sharing system if the system specifically focuses on facilitating medium to long distance trips and enough funds are available to implement these bicycles while still aiming to limit trip costs. Depending on the target groups and the types of trips the system has to facilitate, one can either opt for a fine-grained network of docking stations, which expands the reach of the system, or for a coarsely distributed network of docking station that minimizes costs. As it is recommended to design a flexible bike sharing system in the Netherlands, meaning that users can return the shared bicycle at any docking station, redistribution of bicycles will be necessary. A method to decrease the cost of redistribution is the implementation of user-based redistribution schemes. As the trip costs have a large effect on the attractiveness of the system, these should be minimized which can be achieved by making choices on the distribution of docking stations and the bicycle type that is provided. In addition, employers should be stimulated to include the use of shared bicycles into the travel allowances that are granted to their employees. Based on the results from the questionnaire and the SC experiment it can be concluded that a significant group of people is interested in using a shared bicycle for their commuting trips, and even more so for business trips if their current trip characteristics allow them to make use of a shared bicycle. From the perspective of the user there are three preferred system design scenarios with regards to commuting trips. The first two scenarios describe a bike sharing system implemented on a citywide scale, with either a coarsely distributed or a fine-grained network of docking stations, which only provides traditional bicycles limits the trip costs. The third option is a system that only focuses on a limited group of commuters and business travellers in a smaller region. Such a system would minimize access and egress time through providing electric bicycles exactly where needed. To implement such a system however, trip costs need to be minimized through providing users with a travel allowance aimed towards using a shared bicycle. It can be concluded that the decision on whether to implement a bike sharing system in Dutch cities is not straightforward. Due to the nature of the Dutch population, it remains unclear whether a shared vehicle system will be found to be attractive by a significant part of the population. In addition, as bicycle usage does not need to be stimulated as much as in foreign countries, and the focus lies more on decreasing traffic congestion and increasing the accessibility of urban regions, it is less likely that these problems can be solved through the implementation of a costly citywide bike sharing system. Systems introduced in smaller regions like industrial areas will however be able to tackle specific problems and thereby achieve the goals that were set with regards to traffic congestion and accessibility. The introduction of bike sharing systems at specific locations is therefore more likely to be effective as well as feasible. The decision on whether citywide bike sharing systems in Dutch cities are to be implemented should therefore not be taken lightly.","bike sharing; bicycle community; choice experiment; mixed logit; mode choice","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Engineering, Systems and Services","","SEPAM","",""

Momenteel heerst er ontevredenheid onder bewoners. Om de geplande groei op een soepele manier te kunnen implementeren is draagvlak in de regio echter essentieel. Doel van deze Bachelor Scriptie is om erachter te komen welke perspectieven omwonenden erop nahouden en welke onderwerpen hen daadwerkelijk interesseren. Op basis van die informatie is het mogelijk om aanbevelingen te doen aan Eindhoven Airport over de manier waarop zij het draagvlak in de regio zou kunnen vergroten. Om de onderzoeksvraag te kunnen beantwoorden is de Q-methodologie gebruikt. Aan de hand van bestaande literatuur en gestructureerd door de Cultural Theory van Thompson et al. (1990) is een set met stellingen ontwikkeld die vervolgens door een aantal geselecteerde respondenten gesorteerd is. Op basis van de resultaten van de Q-studie zijn er vier perspectieven ofwel houdingen aan het licht gekomen: de economische houding, de milieubewuste houding, de onverschillige houding en de idealistische houding. Onderling verschillen de perspectieven sterk. Om het draagvlak te vergroten, zal Eindhoven Airport voldoende aandacht moeten besteden aan enerzijds het milieu en anderzijds aan de geluidsbelasting van de omgeving. Op basis daarvan kunnen drie aanbevelingen gedaan worden. Ten eerste zou de luchthaven er goed aan zou doen om de communicatie naar omwonenden toe transparanter en persoonlijker te maken, om ervoor te zorgen dat de omwonenden weten op welke manieren Eindhoven Airport rekening met hen houdt. Een tweede aanbeveling is om met de overheid in gesprek te gaan over waar er verbeteringen mogelijk zijn om het vertrouwen in zowel Eindhoven Airport als overheidsinstanties te vergroten. Een belangrijk onderwerp hierin zou wederom de communicatie moeten zijn. De derde aanbeveling heeft betrekking op het doen van onderzoek naar milieueffecten en geluidsoverlast: de luchthaven moet met een onafhankelijke derde partij in zee gaan om onderzoek uit te laten voeren. Op deze manier is het mogelijk om vertrouwen te winnen van omwonenden, waardoor het draagvlak vergroot zou kunnen worden.","SPSS; Q-methodology; Airport growth; PQmethod; perspectives; Cultural Theory","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Transport and Logistics","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","Several topics related to lifting gantries have been studied. These are the modelling of the structure, the structural behaviour of the gantry, the input parameters of the model and the standards used for the design. A hand calculation model, based on the analysis of built-up compression members in EN 1993-1-1, has been developed that describes the behaviour of a portal like gantry structure. The model executes geometrically non-linear calculations, that take into account the second order effects from the deformation of the gantry, and determines the resistance of the gantry based on the axial forces in its chords and on stability checks. Three different mast sections, out of which the gantry columns are made, have been investigated: MSG, DS and NYW. The latter is currently under developed by Mammoet and is called a New York Wheel mast section. The focus is on the application of this section type. The gantry in the model is subject to a vertical load from the self-weight of the mast sections, a vertical load from the weight of the payload and a horizontal point load at the top of the gantry. The latter accounts for operational loads and wind loads on both the structure and the payload. In the model the horizontal load is expressed as a percentage of the weight of the payload. The resistances obtained from the hand calculation model are within 5% of the resistances obtained from a numerical benchmark model, for the gantry configurations considered. Therefore, the model is considered accurate enough for a preliminary design. It is able to represent a rigid and a flexible foundations, as well as a hinged and a rigid connection between the columns and beam(s) of the gantry. From the calculations with the hand calculation model several conclusions were drawn. The horizontal load is of large influence for the maximum payload, much larger than the influence of the global imperfection. The difference can easily be between 10-to-30% for the NYW mast sections, between 2% and 4% horizontal load. Also, the influence is larger for a gantry with a rigid beam-column connection than for a hinged connection. Calculating with a different imperfection, for example no imperfection instead of 1/250 of the gantry height, result in a 6-to-10% resistance difference. The resistance of a gantry with a rigid connection at the top is considerably larger than for a hinged connection, for an asymmetric section like the NYW mast sections. A rigid connection yields a 1.5 to 4 times higher resistance than a hinged connection, when NYW sections are used on a rigid foundation. The resistance for the three mast section types under consideration has been compared for a rigid foundation. It turns out that for both a hinged and a rigid beam-column connection the NYW sections can bear the highest payload, by far. The resistance to tensile forces, mostly governed by the strength of the connections, is much lower for the MSG sections than for the DS sections. Also, a rigid connection significantly improves the asymmetrical DS sections. For relevant gantry heights the MSG sections can bear a payload that is roughly 50% of the payload that the DS sections can carry, for a hinged top connection. For a rigid connection it is around 30%. The DS sections can carry 15-to-25% of the load the NYW sections can carry, for a hinged connection. For a rigid connection it is 25-to-35%. The stiffness of the foundation has been modelled with the method of Pais and Kausel (1988). It appeared that the stiffness of the foundation can have a significant influence on the resistance of the gantry. The MSG sections are more susceptible to a flexible foundation, because of their relatively small base frame. This results in a much smaller rotational stiffness at the bottom of the gantry columns. A foundation on dense sand leads to a resistance decrease around 5% for the NYW sections and around 35% for the MSG sections. One of the goals of this thesis was to incorporate the use of guy lines into the model and to investigate their influence on stability, stiffness and ultimately resistance. A preliminary study showed great potential for the use of guy lines. The buckling length can be reduced by around 50%, almost to the point where a column with a fixed end at the top is resembled. Also, the first order deflection can be reduced significantly, as over 75% of the horizontal load is taken by the guy lines. This means that the second order effects are drastically reduced. The reduction also has a positive effect on the first order bending moments in the column. A guy line that is installed under a 60 degree angle with the foundation turns out to be effective in both supporting the column and minimizing the gantry footprint. The behaviour of guy lines is highly non-linear. Therefore, it was found challenging to incorporate them in the final hand calculation model accurately. However, the evidence from the preliminary design leads to the recommendation to further investigate the application of guy lines. Several standards have been studied for the design of the gantry. It was concluded that the European crane standard EN 13001-1 is best suited to take into account the loads on the structure and that the structural behaviour of the gantry is best described using the European building standard EN 1993-1-1. The global imperfection of the gantry is a parameter of interest. Mammoet wants to calculate with an imperfection that equals one thousandth of the height of the gantry, since they believe their gantries can be erected with such high precision. The standards under consideration prescribe a larger imperfection, typically 1/500. The fabrication and erection tolerances are however much tighter for the mast sections than provided by the standards. Therefore, a smaller imperfection (1/1000) can be justified, except for very tall gantries and gantries in storm conditions. The horizontal load on the gantry varies between 2.5% and 4% of the weight of the payload, depending on the direction, the weight of the payload and whether or not skidding of the load is involved. A larger portion of the horizontal load comes from wind loads, of which the load on the object to be lifted is a substantial part. It is therefore recommended to further investigate the wind load.","lifting gantries; second order calculations","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural and Building Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Tromp, N. (mentor)","2016","The European ‘refugee crisis’, which started during the summer of 2015, has challenged European countries and their societies on many levels. This graduation project focuses on the impact on the Dutch society and zooms in on the concerns of its policymakers, citizens and asylum seekers; refugees that have applied for asylum in the Netherlands. Through desk research and interviews with stakeholders insights are gained in the Dutch asylum system. The current Dutch asylum system is slow, sluggish, and unclear. During the application, applicants are put on hold in overcrowded asylum centres in sparsely populated regions of the country, and thus are isolated from the Dutch society. This leads to postponed developments, identity issues and gaining a residence permit becomes a goal on its own. The system neglects the long term concerns of asylum seekers: activation, contact with Dutch, allowed to be part of society, participation, and acknowledgement of existence. On the other side Dutch citizens fear that they will lose their for instance their culture, jobs and houses to the immigrants. Their responses are based on feelings of losing control on ownership and safety in their own surroundings. This adds up to their long-term concern of keeping grip on the Dutch identity and keeping the Netherlands as it is. When viewed on a collective scale, there is a need for a stable, socially and culturally inclusive society without segregation. A smooth asylum relief should be matched with keeping Dutch prosperity. It becomes clear that it is not just a matter of smoothing out the asylum process. The real problem to be solved is found on a societal level. Therefore, the focus in this report/design process will be on the integration of immigrants in Dutch society. Current Dutch integration policies mostly focus on the ‘hard-side’ of integration: obtaining (social) housing, learning Dutch, taking care of required registrations and entering the labour market or suitable education. However, interventions that would help consolidate asylum seekers’ relationships in the neighbourhoods and cities where they live, the ‘soft-side’ of integration, leading to their inclusion in national society as a whole, are equally important. This so-called ‘bridging social capital’ provides a sense of rootedness and wider social inclusion. Therefore the Dutch neighbourhoods are actually facing the biggest social challenge as they play a crucial role in integration. To match this challenge, a new vision on/of integration is necessary. Using the Social Implication Design (SID) method developed by Tromp (2013) a new vision on integration in the Netherlands for 2030 is formulated. This vision implies a change of behaviour in relating to migrants in the country. The Local Citizenship design proposes a way to effectuate this change. The concept that is developed contributes to social inclusion in Dutch neighbourhoods by letting neighbours - independent of their social, cultural or asylum status - contribute to the desired identity of their neighbourhood on an equal basis. The concept provides a platform to create synergy between both Dutch neighbours and asylum seekers through experiencing contribution to a new whole. Experts found the Local Citizenship concept refreshing, innovative and insightful. The concepts puts users instead of the system central and translates Neighbourhood Values into doable practices that can easily be executed in the neighbourhood. Intended users also acknowledged the understandability of the values and the concept as a whole. Moreover, they, asylum seekers and Dutch neighbours alike, were quickly enthusiastic and inspired by the concept. On a policy-making level, however, there were some concerns about the aim of the design to focus on the soft side of integration. This expert/intended user voiced a preference for explicit interventions like organizing discussion evenings with neighbours. In short, the Local Citizenship Concept can stimulate integration in the Netherlands in an accessible, easy-to-understand way. This is necessary to elicit behavioural change on a large scale. The main goals of the Local Citizenship Concept are to create synergy, to consider each ‘neighbour’ as being of equal value and recognizing and empowering every one of them.","design; social design; integration; transformation of concerns; behavior; asylum seeker; citizenship","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","","",""

(mentor); Cabrall, C.D.D. (mentor)","2016","Automated driving is becoming increasingly popular and is often proposed as a solution to commonly known human errors in driving. However, fully autonomous driving has not yet reached the point where it can be implemented in real world driving. Current automated driving systems are often designed in such a way that the role of the human operator is changed to that of a supervisor. This shift in operator role towards that of a supervisor has brought about issues with automation such as loss of vigilance, unbalanced workload, loss of situation awareness, and misplaced trust. As a solution to such issues encountered with automation, and to issues encountered without automation, an intermediate step between manual driving and full automated driving is proposed herein. Accordingly, an adaptive automation system was designed with the goal of increasing road and driving safety. This meant that function allocation occurred based on pre-determined factors. Based on a performed concept study, this study focused on adaptively allocating steering control either to the driver or to the automated pilot. The pre-determined factor used for adaptive function allocation within this experiment is visual distraction based on gaze direction measurements performed using an eye tracker. Participants were asked to use a steering wheel to control a simulated vehicle. At specific periods during each condition, the participants were required to perform a secondary task (i.e. changing a CD), which imposed a visual, physical and cognitive distraction upon the driver. Three different conditions were tested: (1) The manual drive (Manual) condition consisted of manual driving. (2) The automated back-up (Back-up) condition consisted of manual driving except during moments of visual distraction, where the driver was backed up by an automated pilot that was automatically initiated. (3) The forced manual drive (Forced) condition consisted of automated driving except during moments of visual distraction, where the driver was forced back into the loop because manual drive was automatically forced upon them. The Back-up condition showed a significant decrease in lane deviations and both max and mean absolute lateral errors when compared to the control condition. The Back-up condition also showed the lowest selfreported workload ratings and acceptance scale ratings, whereas the Forced condition showed the highest workload rating. Finally, 22 out of 31 drivers indicated that they preferred the Back-up condition to the other two conditions. The Forced condition did appear to increase attention to the road when compared to the Backup condition during secondary tasks. The Forced condition also showed a significant decrease in performance when compared to the Manual condition during the secondary task periods. In conclusion, the Back-up condition appeared to significantly increase performance, and as a result also safety, when compared to the Manual condition, which was the main hypothesis of this study. The Back-up was also well accepted by the drivers. It would appear that the Back-up condition shows real promise for increasing driving safety. However, more research is required before it can be implemented in real cars. Fidelity of the simulation, as well as the quality of eye tracking, should be increased for future studies. The Forced condition shows the possibility of decreasing misuse and increasing awareness to the road but more extensive research is required to investigate the effectiveness in real-life applications.","adaptive automation; eye tracking; gaze measurement; distraction; automated driving; physiological measurement","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); van der Spek, S.C. (mentor)","2016","Location is a key element of many processes and activities, and the understanding of human movement behaviour is becoming increasingly important. Knowledge of people’s locations and related mobility patterns are important for numerous activities, such as urban planning, transport planning and facility management. How to efficiently use the available space, is a common problem in many fields. In the educational sector, universities are struggling to meet the higher expectations of facilities for education and research by students and academic staff. Managing the campus of a university has become a complex and challenging task, including the involvement ofmany stakeholders. Campus managers are in need for evidence-based information to support their decision making (Heijer den 2012). This includes better location data to detect activities, occupancy and usage of the infrastructure. To understand the human motion behaviour many studies are conducted based on data collection of GPS receivers. The Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) is commonly used to track people in large scale environments. Spek 2008 studied the movement of pedestrians in city centres, where potential participants were asked to carry a GPS receiver. However, the distribution of GPS devices to participants limits the possibilities to collect location data at a large scale. Furthermore, due to poor quality of received signals from satellites in indoor environments, GPS receivers are not suitable in these conditions. Technological developments in the acquisition of location data by smart phones and the use of Wi-Fi networks, enables new opportunities to track users. Wireless Local Area Networks (WLAN) are widely used for indoor positioning of mobile devices within this network. The use of theWi-Fi network to estimate the location of people is an attractive approach, sinceWi- Fi access points (AP) are often available in indoor environments. Furthermore, smart phones are becoming essential in daily life, making it convincing to track mobile devices. This provides a platform to track people by using WLAN as a sensor network, and study the mobility of users inside buildings or groups of buildings. At Delft University of Technology (TU Delft) a large scale Wi-Fi network is deployed across all facilities covering the indoor space of the campus. The network is known as an international roaming service for users in educational environments and is called the eduroam network. It allows students and staff members from the university to use the infrastructure throughout the campus for free. This enables the possibility to collectWi- Fi logs, including individual scans of mobile devices, at a large scale. A continuous collection of re-locations of devices to access points for a long duration will return detailed records of people’s movement. This ubiquitous and individual georeferenced data derived from smart phones will present valuable knowledge about the movement on the campus. Several work has been made for studying human mobility patterns in a University’s campus. Meneses and Moreira 2012 used the eduroam network to study connectivity between two places, by computing the number ofmovements between two places within a given observation time period. Previous work has also been made at TU Delft (Kalogianni et al. 2015), where several Wi-Fi monitors were placed to detect occupation and movement between different faculties. In this paper, we attempt to identify people’s movement patterns from the eduroam network of TU Delft. Other than previous studies, this research-driven project analysed data from more than 30.000 users, and tries to detect movement patterns between buildings, and between large indoor regions. The project is carried out in request of the university’s department of Facility Management and Real Estate (FMRE). With this project, we try to illustrate to what extend movement patterns in and between buildings can be identified from anonymised Wi-Fi logs. Firstly, individual states are extracted from the Wi-Fi logs, where users stay for a longer time period. Secondly, movements are detected between a sequence of states. Thirdly, movement patterns can be identified by counting the amount of movement from, to or between certain locations at different time intervals. The aim of this paper is not to improve a Wi-Fi based positioning technique, but to use the location data to conduct a mobility analysis producing knowledge about the University’s campus. Based on the three steps mentioned above, the aim of this project is to provide a method to detect movement patterns from anonymised Wi-Fi logs. This includes the separation of mobile devices (i.e. smart phones) and static devices (e.g. laptops) from the Wi-Fi logs, and detecting movement to and from beyond the spatial extent of the eduroam network by introducing the concept of a ‘world’ state. Hereby, this paper attempts to contribute with a method to automatically mine people’s movement patterns at two spatial levels. First, movement at building level is analysed. Subsequently, indoor movement at building-part level is studied, by constructing a network graph of the underlying building floorplan. The structure of this paper is as follows. Section 2.1.1, describes the case study of TU Delft, the tracking technique and the acquired data that is used in the study. In section 2.2 we present our methodology. Section 2.3 discusses the obtained results. Finally, in section 2.4, we present our concluding remarks and recommendations.","Wi-Fi networks; TU Delft campus","en","student report","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Geo-information Technology","","Geomatics for the Built Environment","",""

Tensile creep tests are performed using a custom test apparatus which includes the use of a climate chamber. Tests are performed on coupon sized specimens loaded in the fiber direction and perpendicular to the fiber direction. The material investigated consists of continuous E-glass fibers and a polyester matrix. Creep tests are performed for periods in the order of two days. Besides this, long-term tests spanning more than 1 month were performed on a single unidirectional laminate and two laminates consisting of alternating layers with fibers in and perpendicular to the load direction. To characterize the creep, a general power law is used and modified to accurately describe the creep response of the material. A long-term prediction is obtained by performing extrapolations and using the time-temperature-stress superposition principle (TTSSP). The obtained results are compared to the long-term test results and to the creep prediction formula in the CUR96+ Recommendation [1]. Results show that the relation found may predict the creep response for longer times with reasonable accuracy. Uncertainty is present in the results due to the limited number of creep tests performed.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","","",""

The company Fenêtre develops complex web solutions with their in-house developed framework, called the Silicon Framework. The code generator generates basic functionality and a user interface for database maintenance screens, like view-, create-, edit-, list- and list-edit screens. This saves a lot of time for the developers of Fenêtre, because these screens are always required for new web applications. These screens, however, were not enough and that iswhy the generator needs to be extended. Sometimes, database changes are made after a web application has already been generated. Manual appending of new code is required at many different places in the application which is a very time-consuming and error-prone process. Automatically generating this new code at the right places in an existing project is a challenge, but favours the developer enormously. Additionally, in many cases representing the relations data alone, is not enough to get a good overview of the data in the interface of a database maintenance application. For example, a category table could have a relationship with the products table in a database. It would make a lot of sense that in a database maintenance screen, a category can be viewed with all of its products on the same screen and maybe edit products immediately. The challenge here is that automatic generation of code for this kind of relationships requires a lot of information to correctly represent this information in the user interface. The final product is a fully functional code generator that is able to generate screens which represent relations and its relationships data in an intuitive way. In addition, the generator also automatically appends screens, relationships screens and database changes to an existing project. Along theway, other compatibility issues were fixed with the always improving Silicon framework. Remaining possibilities and wishes are listed in the recommendation chapter. Finally, the code generator will be extended even more in the future while the advantages are becoming clearer.","","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Software Technology","","","TI3806",""

Fortunately, there are multiple drivers indicating that it is now time to integrate our physical and digital lives in a more mutually beneficial way. This report is a research and development project which is meant to explore these technological and societal drivers and formulate a 2025 future vision where borders between digital and physical become virtually invisible. The report will continue to show how a simple product, the Crescent Alpha, could mark the first step towards a healthier future. One where we have a healthier relationship with our digital devices and solve the need for connection in our fast paced and asynchronous world. The vision behind Crescent is to develop an omnipresent personal interface that enables us to interact with our digital space in a natural way. This vision is then embodied through rapid prototyping and several interactions with users. This iterative process made it possible to go from a solution on paper to a physical well founded basic concept. The result is a social wearable camera that can truly capture and share immersive moments called The Crescent Alpha.","Future Vision; Smartphones; Wearables","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","","",""

The company provides a service that connects homeowners with local installers of energy saving products. Their problem was that a lot of time is lost in managing the communication between these two stakeholders. Currently they are still growing and the problem is manageable, but when the amount of customers increases in the near future it will become a big problem. This report documents the development process of E-Captain, the system which was developed to tackle this problem. Our system automatically categorizes messages from customers. These categories are used to prioritize certain conversations and to assign them to the person that is most suited to answer them. One of the greater difficulties of this project was the lack of data for training a classifier that uses machine learning. Therefore, the data used to train the classifier is collected by scraping the content of websites found by searching the web with manually entered queries in an administrative panel. In addition, our system learns continuously by adding messages from customers to the data set of categories they belong to. Our system differs from existing solutions in a few aspects. Our system is designed to easily modify and create new categories through automatic data collection to train the classifier. Furthermore, many similar products are optimized for English, but all communication of De Energiebespaarders is done in Dutch.","","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Intelligent Systems","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) applications are increasing and there is a need for safe operations in terms of avoidance. The Velocity Obstacle (VO) method uses position and velocity vectors to determine if a collision is going to happen; an adaptation of the VO- method is called the Selective Velocity Obstacle (SVO) method and adds navigation modes and right of way rules for cooperative flights. The characteristics of the SVO-method have been evaluated before in a simulated environment, but the contribution of this paper is an experimental validation of the SVO-method by including the factors that are neglected in simulation such as noise, delay and unmodeled dynamics. Additionally, it is shown how adaptations need to be made when actual drones are used for avoidance. Multiple situations are tested where two UAVs are flown on trajectories to create colliding situations. For the experimental setup, the SVO-method is implemented on a Parrot® AR.Drone 2.0 while an OptiTrack system provides position and velocity data. The Paparazzi autopilot system uses this data for its flight plans to fly autonomously between waypoints. The results of the experiment show that the SVO-method is a safe cooperative avoidance method.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Control & Simulation","","Control & Operations: ATM, Airports and Safety","AE5310",""

PPG signals measured from the wrist are often subjected to distortion and noise. Signal processing techniques that tackle these issues were investigated and implemented. The algo- rithm of choice was JOSS. JOSS consists of sparse signal reconstruction, spectral subtraction and spectral peak tracking. The combination of these techniques is what results in a robust heart rate tracking algorithm. An improvement, in terms of computing power, was made by analyzing general properties of PPG signals. The outcome is a new framework named SMART, which combines the HR tracking power of a robust HR monitor- ing system, like JOSS, with the speed of faster HR monitoring methods. The overall result is a fast algorithm that computes the heart rate with an average absolute error of 1.42.

(mentor)","2016","This report contains a study about the possible benefits of changing the way large airliners are controlled in flight. The goal is to save fuel by decreasing the structural weight of the aircraft. Over the last decades the conventional primary control surfaces in civil aviation have not deviated from elevators, ailerons/spoilers and rudder. Eliminating one of these by compensating with others could hold revolutionary advantages. The research started out by finding alternative ways to control the aircraft around its different axes. This performance analysis was done with a Boeing 747-200 model in the RECOVER Benchmark tool with slight modifications. It was found that yaw control offered no decent alternatives besides the rudder. Pitch control can surprisingly be done with outboard ailerons, although it barely meets the requirements. This finding is attributed to the large sweep angle of the Boeing 747. Roll control offered the most alternatives due to many redundant control surfaces on the wings. Further analysis of unconventional roll control was split into four cases. The first case, flying without any ailerons, was determined to be unable to meet the legal requirements. However, the second case in which two spoiler surfaces were added to the existing six, was found to be satisfactory in all phases of flight. The efficiency of controlling the aircraft with spoilers instead of ailerons was addressed and a considerable difference was found but in the overall flight, this is not an issue. The third case was more moderate as it only removes the inboard ailerons. This case had no issues to meet requirements. The final case is entirely different: flying without spoilers. All roll requirements were met, but only after the outboard aileron was enlarged to within structural bounds. The larger issue with this case was the lack of airbraking features. The second phase of the project focused on evaluating the snowball effect in aircraft design caused by the small changes in the roll control mechanisms. First the weight of the removed components was estimated through a hydraulics model. This showed results ranging from 7% to 20% in subsystem weight decrease, depending on the case. The next step was to run these updated weights through a preliminary design phase. To facilitate the process the Aircraft Design Initiator was used. Two aircraft were reproduced and modified to assess the impact on different scales as well: the Boeing 747-200 and the Boeing 767-200, which is approximately half the size. It was found that the fuel percentage that could be saved for each case are 0.50%, 0.36%, 0.18% and 0.45% in respective order for the Boeing 747. Interestingly, these percentages are nearly identical to those of the Boeing 767. The impact on the operating empty weights does differ slightly, where the Boeing 747 loses more weight than the 767, percentage-wise. Being that the fuel saving on a standard harmonicmission profile is less than 0.50% for any of the cases of alternative roll control, the results are not revolutionary as they are now. The profitability of switching to these new control methods is debatable.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Flight Performance and Propulsion","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","Dit verslag beschrijft het ontwerp van een TMS systeem voor toepassing bij muizen. Hierdoor kan fundamenteel onderzoek gedaan worden naar de principes van TMS en de stimulatie van neuronen in de hersenen. Dit verslag beperkt zich tot het ontwerp voor de hardware van het systeem. Het ontwerp van de stimulatie spoel en de software wordt beschreven in [12] en [7]. De hardware voor dit systeem is in staat om zowel een mono-fasische als bi-fasische puls te genereren. Ook is de mogelijkheid aanwezig om naast een enkele puls, gepaarde pulsen en pulstreinen (rTMS) te genereren. De puls heeft een rijstijd van rond de 50 &s met een maximale stroompiek van 3000 A. De hardware wordt geïmplementeerd in twee delen: de pulshardware en de aansturingshardware. De pulshardware bevat alle componenten om een stroompuls te genereren voor de stimulatie spoel. Verschillende concepten voor topologiën worden behandeld. De uiteindelijk gekozen topologie is die met een condensatorbank en twee thyristoren. Deze topologie is in staat zowel een mono-fasische als bi-fasische puls te genereren waarbij de maximale amplitude gevarieerd kan worden door de spanning op de condensatorbank aan te passen. De condensatorbank wordt in tweevoud uitgevoerd om het systeem geschikt te maken voor gepaarde pulsen. Dit zijn twee pulsen achter elkaar met een interval van 1.5 &s tot 6 &s. De condensatorbanken kunnen binnen 1 s opgelaten worden, waardoor rTMS met eenmaximale frequentie van 1 Hz mogelijk is. De condensatorbanken worden geladen via een vermogensweerstand geschakeld door een ‘normally open’ type relais. De condersatorbanken kunnen ook ontladen worden in het geval van een foutmelding of bij het uitschakelen van het systeem. Ook dit gebeurt met een vermogensweerstand en een ‘normally closed’ type relais. De aansturingshardware bestaat uit een PCB met een aantal sensoren en andere randapparatuur. Deze hardware zorgt voor de aansturing van de thyristoren en de relais als ook de communicatie met een externe computer om instellingen te laden en de status van het systeem terug te koppelen naar de gebruiker. Daarnaast bevat het PCB een aantal veiligheidssystemen die het systeem beschermen tegen te hoge spanningen en temperaturen. Indien een veiligheidssysteem actief wordt, worden de condensatorbanken ontladen. De thyristors worden aangestuurd door middel van pulstransformatoren. Alle verbindingen met de puls hardware zijn galvanisch gescheiden van de laagspannings aanstuurelektronica. Communicatiemet een externe computer vindt plaats via USB en ook is er een speciale puls trigger aanwezig die aangeeft wanneer een puls gestuurd mag worden. Allereerst zullen de principes van TMS en de bestaande technologiën behandeld worden in hoofdstuk 1. Vervolgens wordt in hoofdstuk 2 een programma van eisen opgesteld om richtlijnen te geven aan het ontwerp van een TMS systeem voor toepassing op muizen. Daarna wordt in hoofdstuk 3 een systeemoverzicht gegeven welke een basis vormt voor het ontwerp van de pulshardware en de aanstuurhardware, uiteengezet in hoofdstuk 4 en 5. In hoofdstuk 6 zal dit ontwerp ontwikkeld worden tot een fysiek ontwerp voor het TMS systeem, gevolgd door een testplan voor het systeem in hoofdstuk 7. Ten slotte worden de conclusie en aanbevelingen behandeld met als afsluiting het procesverslag.","","nl","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","As a part of the development of a device for skin cancer tissue detection, this report is about the development of a new calibration procedure for measuring complex permittivity with an open-ended coaxial probe. The developed method is based on comparing the measured reflection coefficient to an array of reference coefficients for different complex permittivities. The implementation consists of the following parts: - Correct Vector Network Analyser setup and readout from 0.5 to 20 GHz; - Simulations to generate the reference data for relative real permittivities from 1 to 41 and relative imaginary permittivities from 0 to 15; - Calibration using a 3-term error model; - The permittivity lookup algorithm, which matches a given load reflection coefficient ΓL to the corresponding complex permittivity. The program works well but the quality of the results depends on the accuracy of the 3-D EM simulation model which generates the lookup table data. This is visible in the relative errors that are decreasing with higher frequencies. The set of materials under test consisted of three liquids: butanol, methanol and propanol, and two skin depicting phantoms: with 30 % and 50 % oil. The estimation errors of the liquid permittivities are often below 1, but have peaks up to 5 at lower frequencies. The skin depicting phantom with 30 % oil turned out to have a non-uniform structure and gave the most variation in permittivity results. The permittivity results could be improved to be smoother by implementing better interpolation methods for complex numbers. The execution time of the program has been found to be 1058 ms, which is deemed fast enough for the targeted application, but could still be improved by making a better trade-off between speed and accuracy.","skin cancer; tissue; calibration; open-ended coaxial probe; reflection coefficient; complex permittivity; lookup; 3-term error model; de-embedding","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics","","Electrical Engineering","",""

The displacement of the MPU9250 was determined by using the trapezoidal integrating method to integrate the acceleration measured with the accelerometers. This displacement was combined with the orientation to determine the position of the MPU9250. With the knowledge of the relative orientation and distance between the MPU9250 and the probe-tip, the orientation and the position of the probe-tip was determined with use of quaternions. Pitch and Roll angles were determined with an accuracy of 2 degrees. The yaw angle determination was incorrect due to the inaccuracy of the magnetometers.

Ship sections which contain a superstructure section, a double bottom section and a bow section are chosen to make three scenarios. The structure optimization process and evaluation methods are applied in these scenarios. Conclusions for ship section structure improvements based on robotic welding and recommendations for future work are given at last.","ship production; structure details; robotic welding; process design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Marine Technology, Track Design, Production and Operation (MT-DPO)","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","The main goal of this research is to understand the behaviour of particles in a capillary. This knowledge is used to provide guidelines which will improve the focussing capabilities of an aerosol direct-write technique, namely the Aerosol Jet. In this study the particle radius ranges from 1 μm to 10 μm and the capillary radius varies from 50 μm to 400 μm. The first step to achieve this, is to develop an analytical model which describes the particle’s path. This model takes inertia, the Stokes and the Saffman forces into account. It is assumed that the carrier gas is incompressible. Particle-particle and mechanical particle-wall interactions are neglected. Secondly, the analytical model is used to gain understanding of the particle’s behaviour in a straight and converging capillary. This is done by case studies, to identify relationships between design parameters and focussing performance. Afterwards, the model is adjusted to study the integrated converging-diverging-converging (CDC) capillary, which is used in the Aerosol Jet. The effects of varying the particle density and radius, volumetric flow rate of the carrier, capillary radius and length are researched. Besides that, the influence of the particle’s initial radial position and velocity is also studied. It is found that the initial horizontal and vertical velocities in a converging capillary do not influence the particle’s path significantly, when the particle lags. However, the initial radial position does: when particles are released closer to the wall their focus is poorer. The range of volumetric flow rate that has been investigated has a minor influence on the focus. In addition, particles with a high radius and density have less tendency to follow the direction of the flow lines. This effect becomes larger when the particles are released far away from the capillary’s centre. Thirdly, the analytical model shows that the CDC capillary is not able to focus particles with a relatively high density and radius adequately. A new capillary with a converging-straight-converging (CSC) design has been studied. This CSC capillary has a much better focussing performance than the conventional CDC capillary. Still some small adaptations of the capillary radii may be required for different particle densities for the best focussing performance. It is also found that changing the lengths of the CDC parts while keeping the capillary radii constant does not result in significantly better focussing performance. By keeping the length of the first part the same and shortening the second and third part the focussing performance increases marginally. The lengths of the second and third sections need to be decreased as the particle density increases to improve the focusing performance","aerosol; focusing; direct write; Saffman force; micro capillary","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Precision and Microsystems Engineering","","Micor and Nano Engineering","",""

Recent technologies however have now created sufficient boundary conditions to provide this safety in a design. Two glass columns have therefore been designed to replace the concrete pillars which are now present in the Berlage Zaal in the faculty of architecture at the TU in Delft. The column consists of 54 stacked cast bricks with a maximum of 10 kg each. A flowing interlocking mechanism generates a strong behavior of the corresponding cross sections and more important, it makes the columns demountable rather than glued permanently. Over the height of the column, the cross section varies from wide hollow to narrow solid parts, based on several design criteria. Instead of a permanent glue, a Vivak interlayer is chosen to transfer the loads from one glass surface into the other. Special end connections are detailed to provide a good distribution of forces throughout the column. From this design, nine bricks have been fabricated in order to conduct a compressive test. The entire fabrication process is thoroughly addressed and shows a hands-on approach to learn how to design with glass. From the MDF mold until the glass specimens, all steps are discussed. Seven of these nine bricks are used for a compression test set-up in order to analyze the failure behavior of this design. The broken shards of glass are analyzed and documented in order to draw conclusions and to evaluate the design. The results of this research show that there is a lot of potential for free standing glass columns to perform well, but a lot of further research has to be done before safe implementation in the built environment can be guaranteed.","glass columns; transparency; structural glass; cast glass; stacked column","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Architectural Engineering and Technology","","Building Technology","",""

(mentor)","2016","A new method for capturing solar energy is proposed for a Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) plant with supercritical CO2 (s-CO2) as a working fluid. The idea is to disperse a low volume fraction of nanoparticles in s-CO2, that functions as a heat transfer fluid in a volumetric solar receiver and as a working fluid in a power cycle. The advantage of this new proposed method is that it incorporates two technological applications that are complementary: s-CO2 Brayton power cycles for CSP provide the possibility for high receiver temperatures, and the volumetric solar receiver with nanofluids, are expected to have high efficiencies at high receiver temperatures. To quantify the benefits of this method, simulations have been performed where a traditional surface receiver with s-CO2 as heat transfer fluid is compared with the proposed method, where nanoparticles are dispersed in s-CO2 and heated volumetrically. The radiative properties of s-CO2 are simulated to overcome the unavailability of experimental data. The HITRAN database is used to obtain absorption line parameters at standard pressure and temperature and the absorption lines are consequently broadened by means of a modified version of open-source software. Furthermore, an empirically fitted model is included to account for high pressure effects. The broadening model is validated for reduced pressures by means of experimental results available in literature. The optical properties of the supercritical nanofluid are determined for a broad wavelength spectrum by means of the simplified medium theory. Rayleigh scattering theory is used to calculate the absorption coefficient for a cloud of particles, where the complex index of refraction of the particle material is taken from literature. The receiver simulations are done using an in-house developed CFD-code coupled with a radiative heat transfer solver that is capable of incorporating non-gray radiative properties by means of theWeighted-Sum-of-Gray-Gasses (WSGG) model. The constants of the WSGGmodel are calculated by transforming the absorption spectrum of the heat transfer fluid into Kdistributions and consequently fitting these by means of a Genetic-Algorithm (GA) algorithm. Both of the receivers are modelled as a 2-D turbulent channel flow (using Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) and a k-? model) with different boundary conditions as to account for the different receiver methods. The comparison between the volumetric- and the surface receiver shows that the former one has the potential to be more efficient at a high solar concentration factor because of the relatively low surface temperature caused by the change of heating mechanism. Radiative losses for the volumetric receiver with an optimized volume fraction of nanoparticles are contained in a thin layer close to the transparent surface due to the high mean Planck absorption coefficient of s-CO2. Furthermore, it is shown that the radiative heat transfer for a surface receiver with s-CO2 is not negligible for a relatively long length of the channel. Further optimization of the receivers should be done for higher concentration factors and larger Reynolds numbers as this receiver method proofs to be more optimal for these conditions. Furthermore, engineering questions related to the construction of a volumetric receiver (operating at high pressure and -temperature conditions), and stability of the supercritical nanofluid should be investigated, so that the idea can realized in practice.","supercritical CO2; nanoparticles; nanofluids; volumetric receiver; solar receiver; surface receiver; radiative heat transfer","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Process and Energy","","","",""

(mentor); Tanghe, J. (mentor)","2016","Employee engagement and stakeholder integration have become critical factors in today’s businesses due to more and more complex products. The IT Innovation management team at Volkswagen Financial Services AG strives to inform and engage stakeholders in their process. What is the best way to do so? How do we inform and engage the Business Key Users (BKU) and Technical Experts (TE) in the IT Innovation management process? The aim of this thesis is to create several services which inform and engage BKU and TE in the IT Innovation management process. The idea is that stakeholder inform and engagement in the IT Innovation management process improves the final performance. Moreover, it will tackle ‘Not invented here’ (NIH) among the various types of stakeholders. I used a design thinking approach throughout the entire thesis to understand, generate ideas and test prototypes with various stakeholders. First, I interviewed nine stakeholders to get some insight into their opinions on how they would like to be informed and engaged in the IT Innovation management process. Parallel to this phase, I conducted literature research on co-design, collaboration and employee engagement. In my analysis I found a gap in inform and engagement in the scout, rate and elaboration stages of the IT Innovation management process. Additionally, I discovered variations in the needs of how BKU and TE want to be informed or engaged. BKU are an active type of stakeholder who would like to collaborate and work together. TE, on the other hand, are a passive type of stakeholder who would like to be informed. TE would like to be engaged whenever they have a need. This thesis leads to two services on how to inform or engage BKU and TE in the IT Innovation management process. For the BKU, I designed ‘Innovation as a Service’ which consists of a ‘Conference Survival Kit’, ‘Co-rating Kit’ and a ‘Storyboarding Kit’. These services give BKU the opportunity to become engaged and actively involved in the scouting, rating and elaboration stages of the IT Innovation management process. InnoTube is an online community in GroupConnect which is built for the TE. InnoTube gives TE the possibility to become informed on new technical innovations by innovation posts and video podcasts. InnoTube makes the IT Innovation management process more transparent and gives TE the opportunity to express their opinion. Additionally, InnoTube can be used to promote events and give an overview of the highlights of each year.","inform; engagement; innovation; services","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","","52.3009435, 10.5127883"

(mentor); De Lille, C.S.H. (mentor)","2016","In June 2015, Amsterdam Airport Schiphol (AAS) changed its security check at the gate to centralized security for the entire airport. New security lanes were developed by Scarabee Aviation Group for those centralized areas to increase security, efficiency, passenger flow and experience. Lots of customer research about passenger experience is done at AAS, but the experience of the agents is relatively unknown. From the research, it can be concluded that agents have lots of feelings about the SSL and the centralized security, both positive and negative. They do feel proud, but they perceive their procedures as repetitive, like factory work. Besides that, they experience their work as very tough and feel a lot of pressure because of AAS’s guidelines. They feel limited and do not develop themselves. This bad experience has important effects on several stakeholders: security companies (decrease of alertness, absenteeism), AAS (security threat because of decreased alertness, decreased of passenger flow and experience), Scarabee (no optimal performance SSL) and for passengers (bad experience, decrease of mood, unhappy). Therefore, the design challenge for this project is: Design an interactive tool to support agents in learning and working with the SSL. During the design process, two important elements were defined: self-development and positive thinking. Besides that, the tool has to decrease the factory work feeling. As a result, three activities were chosen for an app: x-ray feedback, giving compliments and performance tracking. The app has potential for future developments. From the user test, it can be concluded that agents are enthusiastic about tracking their performance, getting opportunities to learn and giving and receiving compliments. A next step, doing a pilot study, would be recommended.","aviation; security; experience; motivation; feedback","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2018-06-14","Industrial Design Engineering","Strategic Product Design","","","",""

I started this research when an opportunity presented itself for a case study in Mauritius. It was not the trip abroad what interested me but the case to lift a team to a higher level of software quality. During my research I got more interested in software quality assurance. Especially because I noticed that on many of the developer’s priority lists, it has a low priority. Software quality assurance is often observed as an obligation instead of a handy tool. My true motivation for this research was to see if I could change this. In this research the challenge was to develop a newapproach for quality assurance within agile distributed development environments. The research was started as follow-up of several interviews performed with experts in the area of software development in which the opportunities in the field were observed. The research presented in this report can be of value for all software development engineers, with orwithout expertise in quality engineering. The research might particularly be relevant if searching for structured approaches for improving software processes or products. Next to these specific groups, anyone who is interested in software quality (assurance), agile (distributed) approaches or the challenges in these, can obtain relevant and interesting information from this report. For the guidance I experienced during my thesis I would like to thank Rini van Solingen, my mentor at the University and Toine Hurkmans, who acted as mentor at Exact Software. I would further like to thank Exact Software for the opportunity of conducting a case study and in special the Titan, Research and System team for their cooperation.

(mentor)","2016","In this thesis, focus lays on converting a MATLAB model to Python. Models are used a lot by students and researchers at universities and they provide an unique way of calculating and reviewing data and results. However, at the Delft University of Technology, a lot of these models are written in MATLAB. MATLAB is a programming language which requires a expensive license. Many researchers in- and outside universities can’t afford this licensewhich means that models are not available for everyone although lots of people would like to work hands on with these type of models. By making the first step in solving this problem, the WAM2-model originally created by R.J. van der Ent, is converted from MATLAB to Python. This conversion is done due to the fact that Python is open-source software which makes the model free to use for everyone. Also, MATLAB and Python syntax is generally the same which makes conversion even easier. Ultimately, theWAM2-model is converted to Python and ready to use by everyone. There are two versions in Python available, namely 1.0 and 2.0. 1.0 is the version with the same structure as the model in MATLAB. However, itwas found that the overall running time for version 1.0was much larger than the original model in MATLAB. This is due to Python executing notebooks inside of one masterscript notebook, which is not very fast with Python’s data structure. To solve this problem, Python WAM2-model 2.0 is created. Version 2.0 makes more effective use of Python’s data structure and this has led to running times almost twice as fast as the original model inMATLAB. Another benefit of conversion is that both model versions in Python are more user-friendly. Headers are possible in Python and by defining the data paths in the beginning of every masterscript, users don’t have to go through every script to change directories. In the tracking of moisture, sometimes the first day requires data which is not available. To make the calculation possible, empty arrays are needed which are now automatically created in Python whereas inMATLAB, the user has to do this at his own expense. Ultimately, the plots created in Python are the same as inMATLAB.However, one additional plot is added, called the contourplot. With agreeing statements from the supervisors, these contourplots are more pleasing to the human eye and therefore they are included in the Python model. Next to converting the model, a readme has been made which can be found in Appendix B. This readme is a step by step guide, helping users by explaining lots of the Python syntax. This guide is therefore also included with the Python model. Using this converted model a precipitation shed is created for North Australia since previous research has shown an increasing rainfall pattern in this region. Different studies have tried to find the cause of this phenomenon. Most important seems to be the rise in sea surface temperature causing stronger monsoons, however also an increasing evaporation trend in Asia is mentioned. On the other hand different research has also shown some interesting effects caused by El Niño. To find answers to link these different studies an analysis is done covering two different periods. First the period 1980 – 1985 has been observed and afterwards this result is compared with the period 2010 – 2015. The sheds are created by tracking the atmospheric moisture backward from North Australia to its original source for both periods. The precipitation sheds provide answers for the increasing precipitation showing an increase in evaporation in the different source areas in the last decades. Also, an increasing precipitation trend in January is observed, which is in line with the stronger monsoons which might have been caused by the increase in sea surface temperature. Therefore fromthis research it can be stated that both local sea surface temperature and the atmospheric changes in Asia have a positive correlation with the increasing rainfall pattern in North Australia as was stated in earlier research. Also, it is found that El Niño is negatively correlated with the increase in precipitation. To conclude, North Australia is indeed dependent on both the atmospheric changes above the Asian continent and the changes of the temperature of the surrounding water bodies. This dependency seems definitely important, since research shows a correlation between rising sea surface temperature and precipitation in Australia of almost one. Also the increase in evaporation in Asia follows an almost linear trend which is in line with the increasing precipitation in North Australia. Therefore it can be stated that following this research it is believed that this might be the cause of the increasing rainfall trend above Northern Australia.","","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Water Management","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","The subject of this master thesis is introduced by the lack of regulations for the design of flexible dolphins. Currently, the design of flexible dolphins is based on the Eurocode, which does not cover all aspects which are of importance in dolphin design. Consequently, different countries and associations developed their own guidelines, which often do not coincide and are used interchangeably by different advisers. Nowadays, there is no uniform design approach for the design of flexible dolphins. The partial safety factors used in dolphin design are therefore not consistent and often subject of debate. This master thesis starts with a literature review on the available design models which are nowadays most often used in flexible dolphin design. The oldest model which is still frequently used in the preliminary design stage, is the empirical method of Blum. The simplicity of this model also introduces several limitations. Some more advanced models are D-Sheet Piling and D-Pile Group, which approach the behaviour of the soil by bi-linear and non-linear springs along the pile. However, research reveals that the Finite Element Method approaches the behaviour of laterally loaded piles best. With Plaxis 3D it is possible to assign a different soil model to the each individual layer of soil, resulting in a relatively accurate approximation of the soil behaviour. However, because of the complexity of Plaxis 3D and the lack of probabilistic tools, this model is not considered to be the most appropriate for this master thesis. In order to determine which of the two springs models, D-Sheet Piling or D-Pile Group, is most appropriate for the derivation of the partial safety factors, a comparison between the models was made based on the results obtained from performed tests. It was demonstrated that both models tend to overestimate the bending moments which develop in laterally loaded piles, whereas D-Pile Group seems to give a better approximation of the deformations. However, it was found that under some conditions, D-Pile Group overestimates the reliability of the structure. Therefore, D-Sheet Piling was considered to be most suited for the determination of partial factors for dolphin design. To determine the partial safety factors for flexible dolphins, a reliability analysis was carried out with the probabilistic toolbox Prob2B. With this toolbox a FORM-analysis was performed on a flexible mooring dolphin from practice. The evaluations were performed with respect to three different limit states, namely structural failure of the cross-section of the pile, excessive deformations and soil mechanical failure. After the evaluation of the initial mooring dolphin design, modifications were introduced to the soil structure in order to examine the sensitivity of the influence factors and partial safety factors to changes. From the probabilistic evaluations with respect to structural failure, it was concluded that the reliability of the structure is mainly defined by the exerted mooring load and the structural parameters of the pile. The soil hardly has any influence on the reliability of the structure. Only the most upper soil layer prevents the development of the bending moment in the structure, and an increasing strength of this layer therefore introduces a higher reliability. With respect to the deformations of the structure, it was concluded that again the mooring load strongly contributes to the reliability of the dolphin. Furthermore, the strength of the upper soil layers is of importance. The influence of the soil on the reliability of the structure appears to decrease with increasing depth. Moreover, it was concluded that the influence of the different variables is most sensitive to changes in strength and layer thickness. The final limit state which was evaluated, was soil mechanical failure. As a result of the lateral load exerted on the pile, a passive wedge develops at the rear side of the structure. At a certain point, this wedge is fully developed and soil mechanical failure of the structure is induced. From the probabilistic analysis it was found that the mooring load also has a large, but smaller, influence on the reliability of flexible dolphins with respect to this limit state. Furthermore, it could be concluded that the soil parameters which have most influence on the reliability are the weight of the soil and the angle of internal friction. Finally, a recommendation has been made for a set of partial safety factors for flexible mooring dolphin design. It was proposed to apply partial factors equal to 1.30 on the characteristic mooring load and the stiffness of the soil. Furthermore, it was recommended to apply a partial safety factor equal to 1.15 on the characteristic value of the friction angle of the soil and to apply a factor equal to 1.05 on the mean wall thickness of the pile. For the other parameters, a partial safety factor equal to 1.00 was recommended.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); De Rijk, T.R.A. (mentor)","2016","Preserving and protecting art for the enjoyment of future generations is part of a museum’s mission. But what if the objects on display are not that costly or rare, were in fact mass produced once? This may sound unlikely, though it is exactly the case in a museum devoted to contemporary design: The Design Museum in London. This is a museum with the peculiar nature of displaying ‘almost unique design objects’, things that could be found everywhere around us. This master thesis provides an interesting and unconventional view on the notions of ownership of museum objects and design expertise. It describes a project for The Design Museum London that facilitates a change in the relation between people and design objects of (almost) everyday use by amateur self-documentation of practices related to borrowed museum objects. Current visitors of The Design Museum can be roughly divided into two types of people: experts (professionals) and novices (amateurs). Novice visitors have relatively low expectations about their visit, assuming design is “just not for them”. Based on the results of the research, this master thesis argues that in order to engage novice visitors with The Design Museum, they should tackle the perceived exclusiveness of design, broaden the amateur’s view on what design can be and create a lasting experience outside of the traditional museum visit. This alternative approach results in the proposal for a design intervention in the form of a ‘Design Library’. This service consists of lending out a part of the design collection to visitors and facilitating self-documentation of user experience through a mobile application. Moments, thoughts and emotions are captured through film, pictures and text, using the application. These memory practices are used to reflect on visitors’ personal opinions and values around the topic of design. The Design Library takes design of its pedestal and lets people take iconic design objects home, outside of the museum’s walls and into their own lives. This provides them with a pair of glasses to look at the object in a critical manner. In the long term, amateurs become an expert in judging the value of design, feeling more secure and confident of their ability to say something valuable about design related topics. Eventually, this can generate new insights and knowledge on how people use and value objects, to the benefit of users, designers, academics and The Design Museum.","visitor engagement; museum objects; ownership; expertise; expectations","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design for Interaction","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","This study shows how historical topographic maps of the Zuid-Limburg mining area can be used to estimate the effects of mining activities on vertical ground surface motion. Coal has been the most important energy supplier for the Netherlands from the 19th century until the discovery of the large Slochteren gas field. After 1960, mining of coal was rapidly reduced until the last mine finally shut down in 1974. In the study Na-ijlende gevolgen steenkolenwinning Zuid-Limburg it became clear that the full extent of vertical ground surface subsidence, which happened during the active mining period, was not fully known. Since the available data on ground motion only covers a part of the mining area or is in handwritten of which digitizing would be a gigantic undertaking, the question arose: ""is it possible to infer vertical ground motion from historical maps?"". The available historical maps, historical measurement techniques, georeferencing, data extraction methods, spatio-temporal modelling, integration of multiple datasets, and the accuracy (uncertainty) of all processing steps were all investigated. The study shows that sampling contourlines from maps is best practiced by sampling along specifically chosen transects. 2D profiles and 3D maps are created from the datasets showing the estimated ground surface motion over the period 1918-1955 and 1955-1977. Overall, subsidence occurred mainly between 1918 – 1955, and much less between 1955 – 1977, which is also what we expected. However, at some locations large variations in estimated height changes occurred as a result of errors made in field measurements and interpolation, as well as changes in the landscape. The profile method showed to have great potential and worked well, but results should be interpreted with great care for these reasons.","mining; historical maps; ground motion; GIS; modelling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2016-06-13","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience and Remote Sensing","","","","52.381364, 4.635946"

(mentor); Van Leijen, F. (mentor); Vizcaino, M. (mentor); Ditmar, P.G. (mentor)","2016","Observations show that the Greenland ice sheet is losing mass with accelerating pace. Ice discharge trough outlet glaciers contributes approximately for half of the mass loss. However, the role of marine-terminating outlet glaciers on the response of the Greenland ice sheet to climate change is relatively unknown. In recent years, observations have shown dramatic changes in the velocity and front position in a number of marine-terminating outlet glaciers, but a questions remains why some outlet glaciers are stable and others are not. Consequently, predictions on the evolution of the Greenland ice sheet are uncertain until a realistic representation of marine-terminating outlet glaciers is possible. More specifically, significant uncertainty exists on the link between climate forcing and marine-terminating outlet glacier behaviour. This link has been associated to glaciers-specific factors, such as bedrock topography and fjord width, but more glaciers need to be studied. Here we present a study that focussed on the response of different glaciers to a similar climate forcing, thereby taking into account their topographic situation. SAR observations of seven marine-terminating glaciers in the Uummannaq-bay (West-Greenland) are used to estimate terminus positions and glacier flow velocity. The observations are acquired between 1991 - 2014 using ERS, Envisat and TerraSAR-X, thereby extending the length of the state-of-the-art records. Terminus positions are manually digitized and an equivalent position is determined on the glacier flowline, a significant improvement with respect to the box-method. Glacier flow velocities are obtained using ICC offset tracking. The estimated offsets of ERS and Envisat image pairs were noisy, but have been filtered using the along-track velocity profile that was accurately estimated with TerraSAR-X image pairs. The results showed that the outlet glaciers in this region have been stable during the 1990's, and that the warm winter of 2003 initiated retreat. Three glaciers (Lille Gletscher, Umiammakku Isbræ and Inngia Isbræ) have found to show terminus retreat, of which Lille Gletscher and Inngia Isbræ show long-term speed-up. All other glaciers have a stable terminus position, and show no long-term acceleration. Surface air temperature and sea surface temperature show an increasing trend since 1980, whereas the duration of high ice concentrations (sea-ice melange) becomes shorter each year. The retreat of Umiammakku Isbræ and Inngia Isbræ starts after the winter of 2003, in which surface air temperatures were exceptionally high and the period of sea ice was short. The years after, this retreat continued even under normal climatic conditions. Inngia Isbræ showed an ongoing retreat of approximately 6 km between 2003 and 2013, and its flow velocity is estimated to tripled from 500 m/yr to 1500 m/yr. On the contrary, Umiammakku Isbræ ceased its 4 km retreat in 2010, and did not show an increase in flow velocity. Next to long-term patterns, seasonal patterns are identified to differ from glacier to glacier. The terminus position of Rink Isbræ shows a seasonal variation of 1 km, whereas the terminus position of Støre Gletscher only fluctuates around 200 m. The three retreating glaciers are located in a shallow fjord (< 300 m depth) with a reversed bedrock slope. Their retreat into deeper waters initiated a positive feedback-loop leading to multi-year retreat. Glaciers located in a deep fjord (Rink Isbræ and Støre Gletscher) are exposed to warm Atlantic waters, and consequently subject to submarine-melting, but our results show that their front position remained stable and their flow velocity did not increase. The fact that the retreating glaciers are located in a shallow fjord, and exposed to cold Polar water, could indicate that submarine-melting is not a major factor controlling glacier retreat. This also indicates that the bedrock topography is important for a glaciers sensitivity to climate forcing. It is recommended that more effort is put into observations of the submarine-melting process and high resolution bedrock topography and bathymetry, as the relative importance of submarine-melting with respect to the surface mass balance and calving is still obscure. Nevertheless, our results suggest that there is an important link between the fjord depth at the terminus location and the sensitivity to climate forcing.","glaciers; Greenland; terminus position; climate change; ice sheet; marine-terminating outlet glaciers; outlet glaciers; SAR; amplitude tracing; speckle tracking","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience and Remote Sensing","","","",""

This framework is tested in a case study at KLM E&M. The main research question that is answered in this research is: What flow improvement measures can be used to lower the turnaround time of components in aircraft component MRO processes such that the average turnaround time can be lowered from 21 to 10 days at KLM E&M? To create this framework, case studies of aircraft component MRO processes were analyzed. Four quantifiable characteristics were found, being: flow type, amount of repair paths, equipment criticality and the moment of work-scope determination. Afterwards applicable improvement theories were studied on these characteristics and a framework was created for aircraft component MRO process flow improvement. Hereafter, a case study process was researched using the DMAIC cycle. First of all, it is advised to introduce two new KPI's; the 'TAT-waiting time' and the 'On time start', to monitor the waiting time. Furthermore, it was found that the shop has a single piece flow, the process follows a single path, the equipment is not critical and that the work-scope is determined during the process. When these characteristics are put in the flow improvement framework, it can be seen that lean, lean in MRO and quick response manufacturing fit best for the case process. However, in the case process the work-scope determination should be moved forward to be able to plan the work better and create a pull process. The selected improvement theories were researched in more detail on flow improvement measures. By using a simulation model it was found that with a supermarket system with a capacity constraint, an increase in technician capacity, lower disruption times and amounts, it is possible to lower the total TAT of the case process to 10 days on average. It can therefore be concluded that the improvement framework works for this case. For further research it is recommended to investigate the use of other simulation software and expand the simulation model to the total component MRO supply chain. Furthermore, it is advised to test the framework on other processes within KLM E&M and at other aircraft component MRO companies.","flow improvement; lean; MRO; aircraft component; turnaround time; simulation; DES; simio; maintenance","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Transport Engineering and Logistics","","Transport, Infrastructure and Logistics","",""

(mentor)","2016","Forums on the Web have become a highly popular platform for malicious activities as recent technologies allow to preserve anonymity. Forensic investigators are more and more interested to use these forums on the so-called Dark Web as their source of intelligence. Exploring the forums one by one is too time-consuming and it requires much effort of the investigator to create an overview. Topic Modeling (TM) has shown to be able to give insights on discussions on forums, this way improving the exploration of this unknown data, as an alternative to a traditional search engine. Interactive Topic Modeling (ITM) moreover has been introduced as a technique to incorporate the domain knowledge of the user into the generated topic model. As the investigators have much domain knowledge, incorporating their knowledge into the topic models should increase the quality of the model and align it the goal of the investigator. In lab studies in related work, ITM has shown to outscore both TM and traditional search. In this thesis, we evaluate the effectiveness, efficiency and preference of using ITM in a more realistic setup with stakeholders (forensic investigators) in a domain of their expertise (the Dark Web) in a user study setup. For this, based on stakeholder interviews and earlier research, we designed and built an ITM framework to explore forums on the Dark Web. We found that TM was more effective than ITM for forensic investigators to complete their tasks. Furthermore, traditional search was found most efficient and preferred. It was observed that participants incorrectly interacted with the topic model. Additionally, we found that the difficulty of a task influenced the use of ITM versus search. Users were found to fall back on using traditional search to complete their task more often for tasks with a low or high difficulty. We state that as ITM is introduced as a promising technique in lab studies; more effort is needed in explaining its use to the end user.","Interactive Topic Modeling; Text Mining; Dark Web; Forensics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Software Technology","","Web Information Systems","",""

(mentor); Ramirez Elizondo, L.M. (mentor); Cvetkovic, M. (mentor); Chandra Mouli, G.R. (mentor)","2016","Arguably the most important challenge of our time is climate change. In The Netherlands in 2014, 30% and 21.5% of total CO2 emissions were emitted by the electricity producing and transportation sector, respectively. Electric vehicles (EVs) have therefore gained interest as they do not emit carbon dioxide whilst driving and therefore do not pollute, at least directly. Nevertheless, when EVs are charged with electricity produced by a fossil-fuel power plant there are indirect emissions. Additionally, high penetration of EVs will inevitably lead to increased stress on the grid and consequently capital expenditure. A viable solution to mitigate both these disadvantages is by charging EVs at the workplace with locally produced PV power. The high level of coincidence between parking time and solar power paves way to charge EVs in a sustainable and cost-efficient manner. The thesis work presents the design of an energy management system (EMS) capable of forecasting PV power production and optimizing power flows between PV system, grid and EVs at the workplace. The aim is to reduce energy demand on the grid by increasing PV self-consumption while minimizing charging costs and consequently increasing sustainability of the EV fleet. The developed EMS consists of two components: an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model to predict PV power production and a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) framework that optimally allocates power to minimize charging costs. The EMS is designed such that it can be implemented in practice and moreover, is versatile, implying that it can be utilized for alternative purposes as well. Additionally, the predictive quality of the system enables it to anticipate and act accordingly, rather than solely react. In order to perform sensitivity analyses, case studies will be formulated in which the effectiveness of the system can be ascertained. The results show that the developed EMS is able to reduce charging costs significantly, while simultaneously increasing PV self-consumption and reducing energy demand from the grid. Furthermore, during a case study analogous to one repeatedly considered in literature, i.e. dynamic grid tariff and dynamic feed-in tariff (FIT), the EMS reduces charging costs by 118.44% and 427.45% in case of one and two charging points, respectively. Moreover, stress on the grid is alleviated through both load shifting and power injection during peak demand. In addition, the EMS proves that vehicle-to-grid (V2G) leads to optimality only in extraordinary cases. The optimization problem is modeled in GAMS, whereas the ARIMA process is modeled in Matlab and subsequently, the EMS is simulated in Matlab.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Electrical Sustainable Energy","","DC Systems, Energy Conversion & Storage","SET3901",""

Firstly, the available historical data of both cities were studied. Of these datasets Intensity Duration Frequency (IDF) curves, which give an overview of the return periods of rain events, have been made. In addition, variations in monthly and annual rain amounts were investigated. This is very useful information, but the current number of stations is not enough to capture the spatial variation of precipitation. The amount of monitoring stations in Myanmar would thus have to be increased, whereby the desired ratio of measurements points will be 24 rain gauges per 1000 km2.

The new generation of small satellites experiences very large thermal fluctuations, due to their high performance payload and low mass. Contemporary thermal control systems, applicable to small satellites, are mostly characterised by having either an insulative or a radiative function. Therefore, these systems can only compensate at one end of the thermal hysteresis. This thesis provides a solution to these large fluctuations, by generating a variable emissivity surface. This is a thermal control system that has a radiative or insulative function, depending on the temperature of the satellite. The thermal management system, developed in conjunction with TU Delft and Airbus Defence and Space Netherlands, is the HiPeR radiator with the following characteristics: lightweight, flexible, passive, simple and cheap. The radiator is based on the behaviour of penguins, and is comparable to bulky Venetian louvers, used on larger satellites. In cold condition a low emissive foil is exposed to space, to act as an insulator. In hot condition, a high emissive foil can radiate heat to space. A transition between these two functions is achieved via a deployment mechanism. The smart passive deployment system, made with shape memory alloy, in combination with the HiPeR (High Performance Radiator) technology, which is a very flexible and low mass radiator, allows to make a passive miniaturised louver mechanism. The developed louver mechanism had an initial technological readiness level of 1, which has been raised up till 3 - 4 with this project. The performance is as high as the current state of the art for passive variable emissivity surfaces applicable to small satellites. The emissivity modulation ∆ϵ, between radiation and insulation mode, is 0.45. With this performance, the louver is able to stabilise heavy thermal fluctuations. The current design can narrow the thermal fluctuations (which sometimes have variations larger than 40 or 50°C) with 10 to 15°C.","small satellites; spacecraft thermal control; shape memory alloy; mechanical two way shape memory effect; louver mechanism; variable emissivity surface","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-05-24","Aerospace Engineering","Space Systems Engineering","","Space Flight","",""

(mentor); Kolen, B. (mentor)","2016","Floods are an increasing problem all over the world. Due to climate changes and socio-economic developments multiple areas are at risk. Flood risk is nowadays expressed as the global economic losses due to floods and these losses are raising. HKV and Deltares recognized this problem and started to develop a method to calculate flood risks. A Flood Risk Assessment Tool (FIAT) is used to calculate monetary values of flood risk. This is done by the apparent simple multiplication of exposure, vulnerability and hazard. This risk assessment is one of the steps of gaining knowledge about global flood risk and contributes to prevention of major disasters. In this Bachelor Thesis an extensive explanation about the procedure of a flood risk assessment for North America is included. The assessment can be performed in multiple ways. One can perform it by using the single land use method, but a multiple land use method as well. The explanation is mainly about the multiple land use method. Problems and difficulties are highlighted for future studies. Secondly a literature study is performed on elements that are also of importance in flood risk assessment. This study is performed for five cities: New Orleans, Los Angeles, Miami, New York City and Philadelphia. These studies have been investigated on multiple aspects to figure out which of those elements is most sensitive for the monetary value of the flood risk. Aspect taken in to account are: Risk, Population Density, Socio-Economic Development, Flash Flood Fatalities, Urban Planning, Flood Experience, Protection Standards by Scussolini et al. (2016) and “Real” Protection Standards. Protection levels seemed to be the most important input data for the Flood Impact Assessment Tool used in this flood risk assessment. It decreases the yearly expected damage with a factor ten. Data used by previous studies looked doubtful because of the equal character of all protection levels in the states of America and the source was vague. Some digging however showed that the protection standards aren’t equal at all. A further investigation on this element is suggested. Flood experience shouldn’t be underestimated, because governments in different cities show a trend. Most of the time governments go in to action when something happens. New Orleans and New York for example developed a plan after a hurricane came by. This wait-and-see attitude is a common habit in North America.","","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering / Flood Risk","","","",""

(mentor); Van Dorsser, J.C.M. (mentor)","2016","Door klimaatveranderingen ontstaan grotere verschillen in de afvoeren van de rivieren. Als deze afvoeren groter worden geeft dit hogere waterstanden in de rivieren waardoor de afstand tussen het water en de bruggen over de rivieren kleiner wordt. In combinatie met de steeds meer gebruikte hogere high-cube containers door de binnenvaart kan dit in de toekomst problemen geven. Om er voor te zorgen dat binnenvaart in Nederland mogelijk blijft moet er gecontroleerd worden of de bruggen in Nederland na een verhoging van de waterstand hoog genoeg zijn voor de containerschepen. Het doel van dit onderzoek is om te achterhalen welke rivieren in Nederland in de toekomst minder bevaarbaar worden voor containerschepen ten gevolge van klimaatveranderingen. Hiervoor is een onderzoeksvraag opgesteld: Van welke rivieren in Nederland zullen de bruggen de komende jaren te laag worden ten gevolge van de combinatie van de vernieuwde scheepscontainers en de hogere waterstanden die veroorzaakt worden door klimaatveranderingen? Om de onderzoeksvraag te beantwoorden is informatie over de wateren en bruggen in Nederland, de containerafmetingen, de reglementen m.b.t. brughoogtes en de gevolgen van klimaatveranderingen gezocht. Tijdens het onderzoek is het onderzoeksgebied beperkt van het controleren van alle overbrugde wateren in Nederland tot de maatgevende (laagste) bruggen over de rivieren waar de waterstand alleen beïnvloed wordt door de afvoer van de rivier. De rivieren die aan het eind van het onderzoek gecontroleerd zijn, zijn de Waal, de Lek, de Neder-Rijn en de IJssel. Deze rivieren worden volgens hun CEMT-klasse aanduiding bevaren door containerschepen met vier lagen containers. Er is gecontroleerd of dit in de toekomst nog steeds mogelijk is. Uit het onderzoek naar de maatgevende bruggen per rivier is gebleken dat de waterstanden in de wintermaanden hoger worden en dat de waterstanden tijdens de zomermaanden zullen dalen ten opzichte van de referentieperiode. Hieruit blijkt in het onderzoek dat er in 2050 en 2085 nog steeds met vier lagen containers over de Lek en de Neder-Rijn gevaren kan worden. Voor de IJssel is dit alleen mogelijk in de lente tot de herfst, tijdens de wintermaanden kan er slechts met drie lagen containers gevaren worden. Het is voor de Waal in 2050 en 2085 alleen nog mogelijk om met vier lagen containers te varen in de zomermaanden. De rest van het jaar kan er met slechts drie lagen containers gevaren worden en in de wintermaanden zelfs met maar twee lagen. Op basis van deze bevindingen wordt aanbevolen om de bruggen die te laag zijn te vervangen of aan te passen. Mogelijke aanpassingen zijn het verhogen van de bruggen, het ombouwen van (een gedeelte van) de bruggen tot een te openen brug of het verlagen van de waterstand waardoor de doorvaarthoogte groter wordt. Mochten aanpassingen te duur zijn in vergelijking tot de winst die dit geeft dan is het omleggen van de containervaartroutes ook een mogelijkheid. Daarnaast wordt het aangeraden om vervolgonderzoek uit te voeren alvorens de eventueel bruggen worden vervangen/aangepast. Eventueel vervolgonderzoek zou het controleren van de overige bruggen over de Waal kunnen zijn. Ook is het mogelijk om het huidige onderzoek uit te breiden naar de rivieren waar de waterstand o.a. door het zeewaterniveau beïnvloed wordt. Daarnaast zou een kostenanalyse uitgevoerd kunnen worden waarin de kosten van verschillende goederentransporten vergeleken worden om te kijken hoeveel lagen containers een schip moet vervoeren om te voorkomen dat andere transportmiddelen goedkoper worden.","Lobith; klimaatveranderingen; brughoogte","nl","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Water Management","","","",""

This causes that users can only engage with technologies by consuming the functionalities related to them. This is what Borgmann has been defined as the ‘device paradigm’. The goal of this project was to disrupt the device paradigm and help people understand and change their energy consumption practices to stimulate energy conservation. METHOD:To achieve behavioural change, a practice as a unit of analysis approach has been applied during this project, with the goal to examine how current behaviours are situated in practices. This approach was supplemented by taking traces of use as a design strategy. Traces of use are able to visualise people’s engagement and performance with, in this case, energy technologies. DESIGN: AILA is a lamp that engages people in the generation and consumption of energy. AILA invites people to co-perform with technology: the user’s human power is transformed into electrical energy by means of a mechanical gear-system. AILA helps in understanding and changing people’s energy consumption behaviour by making energy visible and tangible. the lamp causes the user to become a co-performer of the practice, which stimulates the use of energy in a conscious way and thereby contributes to energy conservation. The energy is not instantaneous, the user is involved in sustaining the light. AILA provides the user with both immediate and instantaneous feedback. Brass layers, positioned on the interactive elements, will manifest traces of use. They represent, capture and communicate the user’s engagement with the technology are away of residual feedback.","traces of use; co-performing; behaviour change; energy conservation; social practice theory","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design for Interaction","","","",""

(mentor); Bachynski, E. (mentor)","2016","There is an increasing interest in using offshore wind turbines in deeper waters. The tension leg platform wind turbine (TLPWT) is seen as a promising concept for this. Low production costs and limited motions give the TLPWT concept both economic and dynamic advantages. Previous studies regarding dynamic analysis of offshore floating wind turbines have focused on global dynamic analysis with a rigid hull. Novel methods are needed to include both flexibility and correct hydrodynamic loads in the global dynamic analysis. This study presents a basic scantling design and a new method for including the large-volume hydrodynamic loads. A 3-D panel model was generated for the hull, and radiation and diffraction pressures from first-order potential theory were computed for each panel using WAMIT. A Matlab script was written in which an algorithm integrates the panel pressures and generates frequency-dependent added mass, damping and excitation input for sections of the hull. The method gave exact translational load component magnitudes and slightly underestimated rotational load component magnitudes with respect to WAMIT’s output for the hull as a whole. In order to examine the effects of hull flexibility, a basic scantling design was made for the hull of an existing 5-MW TLPWT design by following industry guidelines. FE software was used to estimate the stiffness and an equivalent beam element model was created for the hull. Implementing the equivalent beam model in a global model of the whole TLPWT makes it possible to investigate the hull elasticity’s influence on the system’s global dynamic properties and internal loads. As expected, the hull elasticity had more significant effects on vertical motions: Simulated decay tests indicated an increase of the heave and pitch natural periods of 43 % and 18 %, respectively. Time-domain simulations with the flexible model and the novel hydro-loading approach in combined wind-wave environments indicated dynamic amplification of the nacelle motions, tower base bending moment and the tendon tension. An attempt was also made to investigate the dynamic amplification of internal loads in the hull. The results indicated unexpectedly large amplification for certain frequencies, and more research is needed to draw substantiated conclusions.","structural design; offshore wind energy; tension leg platform; dynamic analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Peters, H.J. (mentor)","2016","Tiny flying platforms with a wingspan of up to 20 centimetres are build to mimic flying insects: Flapping Wing Micro Air Vehicles (FWMAVs). Flying insects have the required size and also their flying capabilities are highly interesting. In order to maximize the energy efficiency of a FWMAV, the vehicle is usually driven in one of the resonance frequencies of the total system. The aerodynamic damping, due to the flapping of the wings, has influence on the resonance response. To control the dynamic behaviour of the system, local structural changes can be used. The influence of local structural changes on the dynamic behaviour of FWMAVs is studied in this project using a numerical model. The model consists out of a structural dynamics and an aerodynamics part. A co-rotational formulation is used to model the structural dynamics. The scope of this project is limited to two-dimensionally moving structures, which greatly reduces the complexity of the structural dynamics. The structural model shows excellent accuracy compared to an analytical expression: a difference of less than a half percent is found for a sufficient number of element to model the structure. The aerodynamics are modelled using a purely analytical model, which allows the use of arbitrary wingshapes. The aerodynamic loads are applied as external forces on the system. The time-integration is done using an elegant adaptation of the popular Newmark method, which introduces numerical damping while accuracy is maintained. The numerical model is applied on a simple example consisting out a ring structure where wings are attached to using compliant hinges. The influence of thickness changes of the compliant hinges on the performance is studied. It is found that a thickness increase of the compliant hinge of 4.6% results in a mean lift force increase of 24%. Also the stiffness of the spring which influences the pitching angle of the wing, is found to have a large influence on the mean lift force: differences up to 83% are found. Both findings indicate that local structural changes can be used to change the lift of the wings and thereby be used to control the dynamic behaviour. Furthermore, it shows that the tuning of the components of a FWMAV is a delicate matter and a small structural change can have a significant influence on the performance of such vehicle.","FWMAV; resonating structure; flapping wings","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Precision and Microsystems Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","In recent years, the desire to use manipulators in close collaboration with human workers has been a driving force behind a lot of robotics research. As part of a research project, Technolution BV has built a robotic pick and place system using the Universal Robots UR5, a 6 DoF manipulator. It was recognized that to realize the full potential of a robotic manipulator, it would have to be able to respond to unforeseen changes in the environment like dynamic obstacles or a moving target. Following these observations, the project was continued and aimed at researching methods that can be used to formulate a controller that is capable of adapting to a changing environment. A thorough analysis of the technical issues and theoretical background related to dynamic motion execution is presented in Part 1. Based on an examination of state of the art pick and place methods, a pick (or a place) motion is chosen to be dissected in two distinct parts: a global motion, which is used to move the end-effector to a pose close to the target object, and a Cartesian approach, to move towards the target object in a straight line and perform the actual grasp. For the global motion, a fast geometric path planner is a vital component. Several state of the art path planning algorithms are discussed and benchmarked with the specified scenario in mind. In order to ensure that a well performing configuration of each path planner is used, a novel tuning method based on automatic algorithm configuration tools was developed. An analysis of the performance of optimal planners was found to offer too few benefits for use in a system that requires fast reactions. To allow the Cartesian approach to be used when the target object is in motion, two different trajectory execution methods are tested. The first attempts to conform to existing infrastructure and uses cubic interpolation for determining a setpoint. This was found to offer accurate path execution and decent tracking performance. The 2nd method uses an on-line trajectory generation algorithm and was found to improve the tracking performance but did so using jerkier motions. For collision avoidance during the global motions, a time-scaling method has been combined with a replanning approach. Combining the global execution method with pose tracking, a system is proposed that is capable of responding to any changes in the environment","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-06-10","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Delft Centre for Systems and Control","","","",""

Wind farm control aims to minimize this cost by operating turbines at their optimal control settings. Most state-of-the-art control algorithms are open-loop and rely on a low fidelity, static flow model. Closed-loop control relying on a dynamic model and state observer has real potential to further decrease wind's LCOE, but is often too computationally expensive for practical use. In this work two time-efficient Kalman filter (KF) variants are outlined incorporating the medium fidelity, dynamic flow model ""WindFarmSimulator"" (WFSim). This model relies on a discretized set of Navier-Stokes equations in 2D to predict the flow in wind farms in a horizontal plane at hub height at low computational cost. The filters implemented are an Ensemble KF and an Approximate KF. Simulations in which a high fidelity simulation model represents the true wind farm show that these filters are typically several orders of magnitude faster than a regular KF with comparable or better performance, correcting for wake dynamics that are not modeled in WFSim (noticeably, wake meandering and turbine hub effects). This is a first big step towards real-time closed-loop control in wind farms.","wind; turbine; farm; park; control; model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Delft Centre for Systems and Control","","","",""

Put differently, this “raise-up” bridges the valley of death and enables the corporate to exploit radical innovations. “Raise-ups” are created to exploit a unique market opportunity that the corporate faces and consists of a team of entrepreneurs and corporate specialists. Accenture supports these immature, high potential teams in their development by offering support on all risk factors to more easily bridge the “valley of death”. Building “raise-ups” is a unique model that is executed by Accenture between corporate clients and start-ups. It combines start-up and corporate characteristics to jointly create new radical value. “Raise-ups” provide competitive advantage, low financial and implementation risk, improved corporate alignment, and a proposition platform that is ready for scale up. The knowledge that is generated through this research from a theoretical perspective is translated into a practical solution for Accenture. To structure this approach from theory to practice, a process is defined that consists of the phases that a “raise-up” goes through: scout, develop and deploy. This process is supported through the creation of a Joint Innovation Foundry, where the “raise-up” tackles problems such as overcoming the corporate hug of death, creating a corporate landing zone, and the transition from open to closed innovation. Afterwards, an implementation model is designed to support the integration of knowledge by identifying building blocks that should be developed and capabilities that should be adopted. This thesis report aims to provide Accenture with a new perspective on value creation by advising the organisation on capability development towards the front end of new product development.","entrepreneurs; innovation; transition; exploitation; consulting; exploration; open innovation; start-ups","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Strategic Product Design","","","",""

ORC technology is applied to waste heat, biomass and natural heat sources, there is currently over 2000 MW installed capacity worldwide. Triogen is a Dutch company producing standardized ORC modules for the application with gaseous (waste) heat sources with at least 1 MW heat available, at a temperature of ca. 450°C. In this work the application of ORC technology for efficiency enhancement of modern diesel generators (flue gas: 350°C, 5 kg/s) is studied. It is pursued to identify all relevant phenomena possibly influencing the system performance and cost and to assess the significance of their influence on system performance. This is done in order to decide whether or not a phenomenon should be taken into account when selecting a fluid. A steady state off design model is developed for the optimization of a sub-critical ORC system for minimal specific cost. Turbine isentropic efficiency is estimated based on in and outflow conditions using efficiency charts by Astolfi and Macchi. Pressure drop, effectivity and cost of evaporator, recuperator and condenser are evaluated using the Triogen evaporator design model and a shell and tube heat exchanger recuperator and condenser model respectively. The influence of ambient temperature, water temperature and water mass flow on the cooling system cost and power consumption is estimated based on supplier figures. In addition limitations on the diesel engine back-pressure and limitations related to flue-gas condensation are taken into account. A genetic algorithm is applied to optimize the process parameters and heat exchanger geometry for minimum specific costs. From the simulations acetone appears to be the optimal working fluid, which can be explained by its good thermodynamic behaviour and good heat transfer properties in recuperator and condenser due to the relatively high condensation pressure. Turbine inlet pressure appears to be relatively low due to the negative effect of high pressure ratios on turbine efficiency. Ambient temperature as well as evaporator wall- and flue-gas temperature limitations appear to have a diverging influence on the specific cost per working fluid, proving the necessity to evaluate these phenomena properly when selecting a working fluid for a specific application.","Working fluid; ORC; heat exchanger; genetic algorithm; Diesel engine; waste heat","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-05-31","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Process & Energy","","Engineering Thermodynamics","",""

For the purpose of deriving quantifiable results the paradigm of a platform supply vessel is utilized. In order to conduct this analysis there were four steps that were distinguished and pursued consecutively. Thus, the present study is divided into four parts. The first part entails the specification of the power generation system’s desired characteristics and constraints which can be derived by analyzing the following: 1) Design criteria 2) Class Restrictions 3) Operational Profile 4) Avalable ESD Technologies and possible applications From the analysis of each of these subcategories a preliminary strategy is presented of how to use the available data for redesigning the vessel’s power configuration. Certain ESD technologies can already be discarded in a preliminary stage with respect to the goal and physical restrictions of the vessel. Within the second part of this study alternative power system configurations are proposed including ESDs based on static design criteria and Class restrictions. A baseline configuration including ESDs is proposed for the vessel. This configuration is then modeled for dynamic evaluation within the third part. The benchmark configuration is modeled as well for reference. The modeling approach implemented is using the principle of modularity for each component. This approach enables the designer to model each component separately and afterwards figure the interconnections of components for each configuration. In that manner, components of the same type (i.e. generators) are represented by an identical module, in terms of structure, in every configuration altering solely some parameters. Final ESD sizing is derived by investigating dynamic applications within these models such as peak shaving. A clear ESD selection method is then developed within the fourth part and the configuration is provided with the best fit ESD according to application and complying with the vessel’s design restrictions. Finally, a new power system including ESDs is presented and evaluated on a cost basis. From the overall process of defining such an alternative configuration a method is then derived followed by concluding remarks and recommendations on the results and the method itself.","energy storage devices; dynamic positioning; spinning reserve; peak shaving","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-06-09","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Maritime and Transport Technology (M&TT)","","","",""

In this paper it is shown that for the single DoF mechanisms these mechanisms can be balanced using a single spring. The multiple DoF mechanisms can be balanced by balancing each link with respect to the previous link. These balancing strategies are mathematically shown to be valid.

(mentor)","2016","Nowadays, large-scale networks of computing units, often characterized by the absence of central control, have become more commonplace in many applications. To facilitate data processing in these large-scale networks distributed signal processing is required. The iterative behaviour of distributed processing algorithms combined with the limited energy, computational power, and bandwidth, limitations imposed by such networks, place tight constraints on the transmission capacities of the individual nodes. For this reason quantization in distributed algorithms has become an interesting and popular topic. Already considerable research has been performed into quantization effects for various distributed algorithms, such as alternating-direction method of multipliers (ADMM). However, for the primal-dual method of multipliers (PDMM), a recently proposed promising distributed algorithm, no research into the effects of quantization exists. In this thesis the effects of subtractively dithered uniform quantization in PDMM are investigated for the synchronous distributed averaging problem. This specific averaging problem, which is often considered as the canonical distributed problem, was selected to start the research from a natural point. As such, the theory developed in this thesis can form a foundation for further research into quantization effects in PDMM in general. The quantization effects are discussed by considering the convergence rate of the algorithm. This is done by deriving expressions for the mean squared error (MSE) that include quantization noise. Also the required bitrate for quantized PDMM is considered. It was concluded that for practical applications quantization in PDMM can be applied with a near-fixed-rate quantizer, such that significant bitrate reduction can be achieved, without compromising the rate of convergence.","PDMM; synchronous; distributed averaging; quantization; subtractive dithering","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics","","Circuits and Systems","",""

(mentor); Van der Pol, R. (mentor)","2016","With the increase in data-intensive research in recent years, the Ethernet circuit, which is a high speed point-to-point connection, can be used for transmitting large amounts of data between sites. Customers use the trunk port to connect to the operator network. It allows multiple Ethernet circuits to share the same trunk port by using the trunk and results in the efficient utilization of the bandwidth of the port. It distinguishes each (VLAN) service on the basis of VLAN identifiers. When redundancy needs to be offered in the network using two trunk ports, detecting an individual Ethernet-circuit failure over the trunk and load balancing per-flow traffic between active trunks is not possible because the existing technique, namely link aggregation, has limitations. Link aggregation does not support per-VLAN failure detection and must only be setup between directly connected network elements. Hence, it cannot be used for end-to-end failure detection when intermediate network elements are involved. In this thesis, alternative Layer 2 technologies are identified for detecting per-Ethernet circuit failure over trunk and per-flow traffic load balancing. Both traditional networking-based as well as software-defined networking (SDN)-based approaches are investigated to solve the aforementioned problems, and the findings are summarized. An SDN-based design to solve both failure detection and load balancing problems is proposed. Furthermore, the proposed solution is validated using proof of concept (POC) implementation. Finally, the performance of the POC implementation is evaluated and the findings are summarized along with recommendations for future work. Our findings reveal that existing Layer 2 technologies lack support in successfully detecting per-Ethernet circuit failure over trunk and per-flow traffic load balancing between active trunks. However, an SDN-based approach can successfully be deployed to solve both the problems.","ethernet circuit; software-defined networking; link aggregation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Telecommunications","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","An arch dam is a curved surface structure that is designed to resist water pressure at the convex side. An arch dam is usually constructed in a narrow V-shape valley with strong rock foundations. Through the arched shape the water pressure is distributed from the upstream face of the dam to the abutment edges of the dam which are embedded in the rock-foundation. An arch dam is designed to be under compressive stresses when it is submitted to the dominant dead-weight and hydrostatic loadings. In comparison with other dam-types, such as an embankment dam, an arch dam is considerably thinner and requires less construction material, which can make this type of dam the most economical. Due to the thin shell structure, an arch dam cannot resist concentrated loadings resulting from strong variations of strength of the foundations or impact from e.g. falling rocks. Hence, a proper assessment of design conditions is essential and this also applies for other dam-types. To design an arch dam an initial dam layout is used, usually obtained from empirical methods, and it is reshaped until the essential constraints are satisfied within the design objectives. The application of finite element analysis during this iterative process is elaborative and therefore often postponed to the stage of design when the basic design parameters such as location, height and orientation of the dam have been defined. The aim of this master project is to develop a procedure that allows to define in an automatic way the generation of a finite element model of double-curved arch dams. In this way, the model can be efficiently used from the beginning of the design process taking into account the dam and excavation volume, the stresses and deformations in the dam body and the foundation for a variation of loading conditions for different basic design parameters of the dam. In this thesis guidelines applied in practice are the reference for the design of the shape of the dam. The general workflow consists of a preliminary and a final design stage. Through the first stage the best location of the dam and height must be defined such that geometric constraints as defined in the guidelines are satisfied. For this purpose, different potential locations for the dam are chosen by the designer. For each location an assessment must be made, considering many factors, such as state of the foundation, environmental and social conditions and also costs, which are predominantly defined by the volume of rock excavation and volume of the dam-body. When this information is collected for the chosen locations the best alternative can be defined. In the second stage, the dam of the best alternative is reshaped by modifying the entire geometry of the dam until stress constraints are satisfied. An important condition is to check and minimize the effect of design-changes on the costs under the condition that the shape of the dam remains smooth. This master project was done at TNO DIANA BV, this company develops the DIANA Finite Element software that is used by dam-engineering consultants and dam-owners to design new and assess existing dams. Based on Python scripting a procedure is defined for automatic generation of a finite element model of double-curved arch dam with rock foundation. The script starts with a topological surface. From the basic design parameters (location, orientation, height) a preliminary shape of the dam with abutments is defined following the US Army corps guidelines. With this model, the design engineer can perform efficiently different analyses, such as calculation of volume of dam-body and excavated rock, but also predict deformations and stresses and eigen-modes more accurately in the preliminary design stage. In the subsequent final design phase the same model can be optimized by including joints between different columns in the dam and define thickening at the edges of the dam to reduce stresses in the abutments. In the final design phase all kind of loadings and analysis types can be considered, such as thermal loadings during young-hardening phase of concrete or damage development during earthquake loadings. In this thesis first general information regarding double-curvature arch dams is given and their geometry is divided into four main parts from which the dam geometry is derived. Then the general workflow is introduced which describes the entire design process and is based on empirical methods used in practice. Each step in the geometry definition leads to mathematical expressions, which can be translated into Python commands. The entire process is inserted into the Finite Element software DIANA as a script and the dam is analyzed. The developed script is applied on a topographic surface which is based on real data. Three different locations are used and the most economical one is assessed. This design was reshaped based on the designer’s judgement. Finally, the analysis results are used to investigate the dependency of the theoretical with numerical volume and how basic design parameters influence the stresses and deformations of the structure. The conclusion of the thesis is that the developed procedure can sufficiently describe the design of double-curvature arch dams using any location, whereas the modelling effort is drastically reduced. It is recommended that further research is needed to further improve the code towards needs from dam-engineers in practice. When the developed procedure will be more integrated in the DIANA software it can be a very efficient tool to help dam-engineers around the world to make use of advanced finite element analysis already in the early preliminary design stage of curved arched dams.","double-curvature arch dam","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","","",""

Therefore, we were tasked with rehabilitating the city of Holwerd by establishing the connection with the sea and making the goal (Holwerd aan Zee) of the inhabitants come into a reality. In order to prioritize the different actions required to achieve the objective, a survey was conducted. Hence, a clearer view of what people are attracted to when choosing a destination is obtained. It was found that the most attractive option is the one that includes recreational elements (proximity to the sea restaurants and bars, hotels...), natural elements (parks, open spaces...) as well as cultural elements (museums, architecture…). Due to the high cost of this alternative, the project is divided into phases. In addition, an environmental impact assessment was conducted to ensure a well-balanced project implementation. In this multidisciplinary project, the focus is mainly on the construction of the navigational channel through the dike connecting to a buffer lake. Together with the channel, the implementation of a sluice in the opening of the dike is also analysed. Through a multi-criteria evaluation each alternative of channel alignment and gates is assessed. These multi-criteria analyses determined that the optimal solution is to connect the navigational channel to a fresh water source where a canal and a small marina were already present. Regarding the type of gate, it resulted that the folding gate made of timber was the most suitable to be installed both in the dike side and in the inner side blocking the salt water flowing further into the fresh water. The design of the channel was developed in such a way that an ebb-dominance tendency is present. The exporting of sediment was checked by using a one-dimensional model with a sinusoidal symmetric tide. The gate prototype was also modelled to ensure the structure can resist the different water levels. Regarding the dredged material of the channel, two proposals are evaluated in order to find a beneficial use of the remaining volume. A nourishment and development of salt marshes in Visbuurt (adjacent town of Holwerd) as well as the creation of the silt islands and development of salt marshes in Holwerd are studied. The dredging operation is also described. Finally, additional research and data collection are recommended prior to further action.","","en","student report","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","Masterproject CiTG CEG 4061 - 09","53.38111, 5.89500"

(mentor)","2016","This report has been written to serve as an introduction to the basics of GPU computing for mechanical engineers working in the field of structural optimization. In this work, the ability of GPUs to reduce the computation time of topology optimization problems is investigated. The programming paradigm of data parallel computing is introduced. GPU programming particulars are discussed and architectural differences between CPU and GPU processors are highlighted. It is shown how linear algebra operations can be judged on their suitability towards a massively parallelmode of execution. Algorithms with a high computational intensity and regular memory access patternswill benefit the most from a parallel implementation on a GPU. The flexibility of the Python programming language may alleviate much of the difficulties of GPU programing. It is investigated if a hybrid Python/GPU framework is a feasible way of GPU computing in the context of structural optimization. Several ways to interface the GPU from Python are discussed. It is shown that it is possible to execute linear algebra operations on the GPU from a Python context and good performance is possible. However, it is observed that interprocessor communication deteriorates the overall speedup if just one operation is to be accelerated. As a guidance problem, a topology optimization compliance minimization study is introduced. The theoretical framework is given and broken down into a chain of compute steps. By profiling a conventional implementation of topology optimization, it is shown that the solver dominates the computation time entirely. Iterative solvers for linear systems are discussed in the context of topology optimization. By preconditioning the system of equations, the required amount of iterations to solve the system can be reduced. Some GPU compatible preconditioning techniques are discussed. For a topology optimization problem, a Sparse Approximate Inverse preconditioner is found to perform best. Two available conjugate gradient solver implementations have been put to the test. It is shown that, on commodity hardware, an off the shelf conjugate gradient solver for the GPU can yield a speedup compared to a competitive off the shelf conjugate gradient solver for the CPU. For a topology optimization problem, a speedup of two has been observed.","GPU computing; CUDA; topology optimization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Precision & Microsystems Engineering (PME)","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","Following the EU-28 targets, in 2050 a reduction in total energy consumption of 70% compared to the 2008 consumption is required driven by weight reduction in the road transportation industry. Because of the high specific strength and stiffness of composite materials, introduction of advanced composites in the vehicle design is observed. However the introduction of composites leads to new design challenges. Failure of composites is challenging to predict because of the absence of plasticity, the many possible failure modes and manufacturing imperfections. This leads in industry to the necessity of extensive testing and including safety factors, increasing the development costs and limiting the weight-reducing potential. This research is therefore focussed on predicting the response and failure behaviour of composites subjected to an out-of-plane impact load. An experimental characterization is performed through testing, following the ASTM D7316 standard. Carbon-epoxy and glass-polyamide-6 specimens in quasi-isotropic and cross-ply lay-ups have been impacted using a drop tower with impact energies ranging from 7.6 to 90.9 Joules. In these tests, a modification on the standard is done in which the impactor's displacement, velocity and acceleration are determined during the entire impact using an optical pattern tracking technique with high-speed cameras. This test programme is extended with static tests, in which the same boundary conditions are used and the impactor is pushed in the specimen to the same deflection as encountered during dynamic testing. From this test programme, insights on the failure loads, failure modes and energy absorbed are gathered during the event and post-mortem through ultrasonic scanning and optical microscopy. These observations improve the understanding of the material response and indicate differences between the tested materials and the significance of strain rate effects on the results. The dynamic and non-linear impact on carbon-epoxy is simulated with analytical and numerical models. Numerical simulations are performed in ABAQUS/Explicit, predicting delamination with cohesive behaviour between the plies and ply failure with three different user material subroutines. These material models are based on the Hashin, Puck and Catalanotti failure criteria and are mainly differentiated by the incorporated stiffness reduction after failure, resulting in a significant differences in model complexity. The analytical model, as developed by Fardin Esrail, is based on the energy balance to define stresses and uses an averaging approach, equivalent to Whitney-Nuismer, to predict damage. Comparison of the different models and validation through comparison with the test results is performed, from which the main advantages and limitations of the models are assessed. By combining experimental observations with numerical and analytical solutions, the parameters affecting damage creation and residual strength have been captured and a predictive impact modelling approach is developed. This approach can be very useful in the future when designing and analysing efficient composite structures with increased residual strength in the presence of damage.","aerospace; automotive; carbon-epoxy; glass-polyamide-6; impact; experimental characterization; numerical characterization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2028-03-01","Aerospace Engineering","Aerospace structures and computational mechanics","","","",""

(mentor); Cowan, K. (mentor)","2016","For the past 20 years, the small bodies of the solar system, such as asteroids and comets, have been increasingly gathering the interest of scientists and space agencies. The latter have been multiplying the number of space missions to study them. Brazil does not want to be left out and has been working on its own mission, ASTER, which has the particularity of having as a target a triple asteroid system. Although adding great scientific interest to the mission, this characteristic considerably complicates the mission design, by making the space probe move in a complex gravitational field and submitting it to very strong perturbations forces. Following the past researches on the ASTER mission, which mostly dealt with the characterisation of the 2001 SN263 asteroid system, this work focuses on the preliminary design of mission orbits suitable for the exploration of the asteroids. Two phases of the mission are considered: the arrival in the system, which requires a parking orbit; and the exploration phase. For the latter, two scenarios are studied: a parallel and a sequential observations of the system. To find the optimal orbits for each of these cases, a computer tool has been designed, which comprises an orbit integrator able to propagate the trajectory of a spacecraft within the asteroid system, and an optimiser which uses evolutionary algorithms to find optima from a 5-dimensional search space in a single- or multi-dimensional objective space, according to objective functions that can be chosen and adapted to match the case considered. The computer tool performs well for all cases, and allows to draw general conclusions on which kind of orbits to consider for the ASTER mission. The results show that the solar radiation pressure is by far the most problematic perturbation and is hence driving the properties of the solutions. Among all cases, many optima are terminator orbits, which are by nature strong against solar radiation perturbations. Moreover, orbits closer to the bodies are more stable, and any trajectory too distant from the bodies will be blown away. This work concludes on the suitability of the optimisation methods selected to the orbit design for this mission, although it is advised to still improve the software to model the dynamics of the system in a more detailed manner, and on recommendations for the ASTER mission. No satisfying parking orbit has been found and the relative strength of the solar radiation pressure implies that there does not exist orbits sufficiently remote from the bodies to serve as parking orbits. It is recommended to investigate other solutions with active orbit maintenance. As for the exploration phase, the sequential observation scheme shows its superiority. Satisfying observation orbits can be found about all three bodies, which is not the case for the parallel observation because of the zones of instability present in-between the bodies.","orbit; optimization; asteroids; triple asteroid; perturbations; four body problem; ASTER","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Astrodynamics and Space Missions","","","",""

(mentor); De Winter, J.C.F. (mentor)","2016","An important issue in road traffic safety is that drivers show adverse behavioral adaptation (BA) to driver assistance systems. Haptic steering guidance is an upcoming assistance system which facilitates lane-keeping performance while keeping drivers in the loop, and which may be particularly prone to BA. Thus far, most experiments on haptic steering guidance have measured driver performance while the vehicle speed was kept constant, and so the degree of BA could not be established. The aim of the present driving simulator study was to examine whether haptic steering guidance causes BA in the form of speeding, and to evaluate two types of haptic steering guidance designed not to suffer from BA. Twenty-four participants drove a 1.8 m wide car for 13.9 km on a curved road, with cones demarcating a single 2.2 m narrow lane. Participants completed four conditions in a counterbalanced design: no guidance (Manual), continuous haptic guidance (Cont), continuous guidance that linearly reduced feedback gains from full guidance at 125 km/h towards manual control at 130 km/h and above (ContRF), and haptic guidance provided only when the predicted lateral position was outside a bandwidth (Band). Participants were familiarized with each condition prior to the experimental runs and were instructed to drive as they normally would do while minimizing the number of cone hits. Compared to Manual, the Cont condition yielded a significantly higher driving speed (on average by 7 km/h), whereas ContRF and Band did not. All three guidance conditions yielded better lane-keeping performance than Manual, whereas Cont and ContRF yielded lower self-reported workload than Manual. In conclusion, continuous steering guidance entices drivers to increase their speed, thereby diminishing its potential safety benefits. It is possible to prevent BA while retaining safety benefits by making a design adjustment either in lateral (Band) or in longitudinal (ContRF) direction.","behavioral adaptation; haptic steering guidance; human-automation interaction; driving simulator","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Design","","","",""

(mentor); Rossi, L.C.G. (mentor)","2016","Circular polarisation is commonly induced through the multiple scattering of light by aerosols in a planetary atmosphere and the multiple reflection of light by a rough surface. More interestingly, light reflected by organisms displays unique spectral circular polarisation behaviour, presenting the possibility of circular polarimetry for the detection of life. It has previously been neglected due its relatively small signal and the need for advanced instrumentation in its measurement. The purpose of this thesis is to investigate the circular polarisation that can be induced by the atmosphere of an exoplanet and the impact it would have on the measurement of surface features. This was done through the modelling of the multiple scattering of light by aerosols for varying aerosol and atmospheric conditions. The influence of partial cloud cover was also modelled. A degree of circular polarisation between 10-3 or 10-5 was typically observed. The maximum values were found at phase angles of 30° to 70°, with an additional peak at 110° to 140° and near-zero values around 90°. The particle size, real refractive index and cloud and gas optical thickness values were the most significant parameters. The introduction of partial cloud cover increased the variability of circular polarisation values and high cloud symmetry with respect to the equator led to a decrease in the circular polarisation. The modelled circular polarisation may be measurable for some cases but not all. The best phase angles for observation are around 40° and 140°, where the circular polarisation is near peak value and the linear polarisation is relatively small. The symmetry of the clouds is advantageous for the observation of surface features, as circular polarisation values cancel out due to having opposite sign. However, a fully cloudy planet would make surface observations very challenging. This work can be built upon with the modelling of surface and biological circular polarisation. Most importantly, observations of organism-dense areas are required to determine the potential of circular polarimetry for the detection of life.","polarisation; exoplanet; planet; homochirality; aerosol; Mie; Rayleigh; atmosphere; multiple scattering; clouds; circular polarisation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Planetary Sciences","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","Currently the joining of cured thermoset composite materials for aerospace applications occurs in a suboptimal manner. The structure is joined by mechanical fastening, optionally in conjunction with an adhesive. The joining is sub-optimal because the fasteners require holes in the thin fibrous structure. These holes are stress concentrations, therefore the number of plies and thus the weight of the structure is increased to accommodate them. Adhesive joints do not require holes but these joints still have challenges in the field of non-destructive testing (NDT), which precludes their use for the joining of structural parts in aerospace. Consolidated thermoplastic materials have an additional joining technique that can be used, namely fusion bonding. This technique uses the property that distinguishes thermoplastics from thermosets, they have the ability to melt or soften under increased temperature. In this molten or softened state themolecular chains of the thermoplastic resin possesses increased mobility. If the thermoplastic is in intimate contact with another miscible thermoplastic while it is in this heated state the molecular chains can diffuse into each other and intermingle, creating a bond. This bond does not possess the stress concentrations associated with mechanical fastening, or the phenomenon of kissing bonds which inhibits certification in adhesive bonds. In industry fusion bonding is solely applied to unreinforced thermoplastic materials, fusion bonding of thermoplastic composites is only applied in research. To enable fusion bonding of cured thermoset composites a thermoplastic interlayer can be co-cured, which is a thin thermoplastic film that provides a fusible surface to the thermoset structure, it can thus be used to fuse the thermoset structure to another fusible part. The interlayer can be surface treated before cure so that they can form an interfacial adhesive bond with the thermoset laminate. This approach makes the joint susceptible to the same challenges faced by adhesive bonding. Therefore this research investigates the use of a material combination that is initially miscible, so that they can form an interphase during cure instead of an adhesive interface, the interphase is a gradual transition from onematerial to the next . The fusion bonding process itself also poses some challenges. Fusion bonding of aerospace grade thermoplastics typically require temperatures far above the maximum temperature allowed by the co-cured thermoset laminate. A solution to this problem is the use of a fast and concentrated method of heat generation that can keep the elevated temperature experienced by the thermoset material limited and short in time, preventing thermal degradation. Ultrasonic welding is a fusion bonding technique that is capable of creating fusion bonds with heating times in the order of 500ms, proven to be short enough to prevent thermal degradation for the materials used in this research. Another important issue foreseen and addressed in this research is the question if the interphase between the interlayer and the thermoset material can withstand the aggresive welding process. Previous experience with surface treated interlayers showed that some interlayer/ surface treatment/thermoset material combinations can detach at the interlayer/thermoset interface after welding. This research shows that the interphase is affected in some locations, but the fusion bond is nonetheless maintained through the entire weld overlap. The apparent lap shear strength of the joints created with an interphase forming interlayer is comparable to the joints created with adhesive interface forming interlayer. Both joint types retain their strength when exposed to prolonged exposure to moisture, simulating a worstcase scenario in amanufacturing setting. Exposure to a cleaning solvent significantly affected the interphase forming joint type, attributed to the amorphous structure of the thermoplastic used. This research shows that when selecting the right material as interlayer for creating a fusion bonding capable thermoset laminate, a joint can be created that could avoid the certification challenge experienced by adhesive bonding, while simultaneously using aerospace grade materials without thermally degrading the joint during fusion.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Aerospace Engineering, Materials Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","The heat pipe assisted annealing project is a collaboration between TU Delft, Tata Steel and Drever International. It is aimed at developing a continuous annealing line where the implementation of rotating heat pipes leads to a 70% reduction in energy consumption by reusing heat recovered at the cooling step. Rotating heat pipes are closed cylindrical containers, containing merely a working medium operating at its vapor-liquid equilibrium. They are highly effective heat transfer devices, due to evaporation of the medium on one end of the pipe, and condensation on the other. Rotation about the longitudinal (horizontal) axis allows for return of the condensate to the evaporation side and maintaining of the cycle. For further development of the project, an experimental setup is to be designed that can operate at 423 to 873 K (150 to 600C°) without exceeding an internal pressure limit of 0.5MPa. The setup has to facilitate measurements that provide insight about heat and mass transfer phenomena inside the heat pipe while operating conditions are similar to those in a continuous annealing line. Working fluids capable of operating at the specified temperatures have been identified in view of their vapor pressure, chemical stability and safety aspects. Rotational velocity and dimensions of the heat pipe are based on resemblance of flow regimes expected in the continuous annealing line and comparison of experimental data with other studies. Heating and cooling loads provided by the setup are equal to those caused by steel strips in the annealing process. The equipment required to do so is selected with respect to the uniformity of the heating/cooling profile and ease of implementation in the setup. Essential measurements have been identified to provide temperature (internal and external) and pressure profiles, heat fluxes through the pipe shell and insight about internal flow regimes, velocities and phase change rates. Steady and safe operation is ensured by procedures concerning filling, safety and control and by selection of auxiliary equipment. To combine all the required equipment and instrumentation and arrange for manufacture of the setup, preliminary CAD drawings have been made that illustrate the intended design concepts. Biphenyl, phenanthrene and cesium, in combination with a 316 stainless steel shell, have been selected to cover the temperature range up to 607 K, 717 K and 873 K respectively, while complying with the specified criteria. Nevertheless, the TU Delft test setup is restricted to 717 K because cesium requires an inert external environment for safe operation. The working fluid study has also revealed how critical purity and cleanliness of the heat pipe is. Accordingly, each fluid will have its own heat pipe and thus the setup should support modularity. The dimensions are established at 500 mm length, 50 mm inner diameter and a 5 mm shell thickness. A maximum rotational velocity of 1000 rpm covers all possible internal flow patterns when the heat pipe is loaded up to 10% of its volume. A maximum heat input of 2.27 kW supplied at the evaporator ensures heat fluxes up to 30kW/m2 at the condenser. Trace heating and mist cooling can supply the necessary heat flows uniformly without compromising safety nor impeding the replacement of heat pipes. Six pairs of thermocouples in the heat pipe shell, distributed over the length, enable both heat flux and temperature profile measurements. Five thermocouples located inside the heat pipe, and distributed over the length as well, provide an inner temperature profile and indirect pressure measurements. Ultrasonic technology is selected for the measurement of the liquid layer thickness, but requires further investigation. Arrangements have been made for manufacture of the heat pipe embedded with the thermocouples. Additional equipment with the appropriate specifications and its suppliers have been identified. The design concepts will be finalized for manufacture and thus the high temperature rotating heat pipe setup will be realized.","rotating heat pipe; experimental setup; working fluid, design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-06-02","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Process and Energy","","","",""

(mentor); Kramer, H.J.M. (mentor); Mulder, F.M. (mentor)","2016","Direct Air Capture processes capture carbon dioxide directly from the air and aim to utilize the captured carbon dioxide; this would allow CO2 capture independent of source and location and can therefore address all CO2 emissions. Although already quite some processes and materials exist that are capable of this, it is still not yet widely applied in industry. The aim of this thesis is to first select a suitable material and then provide the tools to start designing such a process. The present work focuses on a solid (primary) amine-based sorbent and models the CO2 capture process on both a molecular scale, using quantum chemical calculations, as well as on a macroscopic scale, using a numerical representation of a fixed bed adsorption column. The quantum chemical calculations in the present work show that in order for this specific sorbent to capture CO2 the reaction needs a catalyst. It was found that functional amine groups are close enough to each other to catalyze CO2 capture. Besides that it was found that H2O can also catalyze the CO2 capture. The CO2 reacts with these molecules to either form a carbamic acid complex or a bicarbonate complex with the other (protonated) amine. The H2O catalyzed CO2 capture, where it reacts to form carbamic acid, was somewhat unexpected; no reports of this mechanism were encountered in literature during the study. The results of the quantum chemical calculations were successfully implemented in the numerical model and were able to describe the sorbent’s CO2 capacity as a function of temperature. The numerical model can be used as a design tool to estimate parameters such as speed of adsorption and can serve as an input for design calculations. Processes using solid sorbents seem to be highly scalable. They can be applied everywhere and can be designed as a modular system. Once a single DAC unit has been designed that captures 1 kg of CO2 a day it can used in a modular system of several units, eventually scaling up to tonnes of CO2 per day. The sorbent in this study regenerates the CO2 at a temperature of approximately 80 ⁰C which could be supplied in the form of waste heat. Using this technology, CO2 becomes available everywhere, makes further use of waste heat and is able to address CO2 emissions from every source (vehicles, industry, residential).","Direct Air Capture; molecular modeling; adsorption","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Process and Energy","","","",""

Bi-directional charging enables electric vehicles (EVs) to charge and to give energy back to the electricity grid. The goal of this technology is to balance the electricity grid and avoid peak usage times. The technical side of Vehicle2Grid is in development, but the system lacks a user centered solution which meets the demands of the EV drivers and enables them to use the system. The goal of this master thesis was to discover wishes, needs and fears of EV drivers concerning Vehicle2Grid as well as difficulties which might come along with the use of this technology. The gained insights were used to develop a service concept which addresses these needs, fears and wishes, fits in the daily practices of EV drivers. This master thesis is partly framed within a pilot project which aims to test Vehicle2Grid in Amsterdam. The project is called V2X and is a cooperation of the Hoogschool van Amsterdam, Alliander, Cofely, Amsterdam Smart City and Mitsubishi. Previous user research performed within this pilot project was analyzed, literature research was done and stakeholder interviews were conducted to comprehend the full scope of the project. In order to understand the target group and to find out what their needs and fears concerning Vehicle2Grid are, a co-creation session with six EV drivers was conducted. The results were translated into necessary features for a service concept. The first part of the Master thesis was performed in collaboration with the MediaLAB Amsterdam and targeted the development of a working mobile application which will be used by 10 participants within the V2X pilot in Amsterdam. The app enables EV drivers to use Vehicle2Grid. A mobile application called Greengrid 2.0 was designed and developed. The second part of the thesis was done individually and concentrated on the development of a full service concept aimed to enable the use of Vehicle2Grid on a bigger scale. Research showed that a large part of the Dutch EV drivers are also energy producers and have a strong interest in direct energy trade. Therefore Vehicle2Grid and a platform allowing direct energy trade were combined within one service concept. A prototype of a mobile application and a website were designed. These digital products are the means which facilitate the service. The final concept was tested and evaluated with seven EV drivers, E- mobility experts and the pilot project stakeholders. This evaluation led to requirements for further development and research areas.","energy; sharing; electric mobility; emobility; sustainability; renewable energy; Vehicle2Grid","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design for Interaction","","","",""

(mentor); Riemslag, A.C. (mentor); Hu, B. (mentor)","2016","The Circumferentially Notched Tension (CNT) specimen is a potential candidate for determining the fracture toughness of highly constrained cracks, theoretically approaching plane strain conditions, even for small test specimen dimensions. This research aims to experimentally evaluate the use of the CNT test specimen geometry to fracture toughness test ductile steels. The process involves development of a fatigue precracking method designed to minimize eccentricity values, experimentally verifying a number of claims made in literature regarding the behaviour of the CNT specimen and investigating specimen dimensioning. All with the purpose to move toward implementing the CNT specimen as an established fracture toughness test geometry. Initiating a fatigue precrack by compressive fatiguing followed by tensile fatiguing to the required fatigue crack length proved to lead to ligament eccentricity values larger than those encountered in literature created using rotating bending. The prefatiguing method also proved sensitive to the material type. The resulting eccentricity values had no significant effect on the result of fracture toughness tests on S690QT steel. It is believed that the uncracked ligament realigns with the loading line without causing excessive damage on this ductile steel type. The bending distortion is thereby effectively cancelled. SEM photography on a specimen with a commonly encountered eccentricity magnitude of 0.2 mm showed that fracture is still initiated at the position of the longest fatigue crack length despite the relatively low eccentricity value. Comparing the results of fracture toughness tests on CNT specimen under two stress intensification rates of 3 MPa√m/s and 571 MPa√m/s showed an insensitivity of the CNT specimen to varying crosshead speeds. The conclusion is that the combined machine and specimen stiffness increase the displacement of the crack area during crack growth beyond the speed at which the crosshead moves. It is suggested that larger CNT specimens are required to approximate plane strain conditions for the S690QT steel tested. Experimental results of fracture toughness tests and critical stretch zone widths using SEM on 10 mm major diameter CNT specimens were comparable to SENB specimens with a width of 10 mm. These SENB specimen are known to be undersized and do not provide a plane strain fracture toughness. It is thought that areas of increased stress emerge at the crack tips and converge at the centreline of the CNT specimen. Literature source identified the linking up of these so called stress bands decreased crack tip constraint. The linking up of stress bands at experimental loads was confirmed to take place by 2-dimensional FEM simulations. An addition to the decrease in crack tip constraint may be the presence of a bending load. Further research is required to quantify the effect of bending on crack tip constraint levels. Critical stress intensity values obtained experimentally at the point of 2% crack extension proved to be consistent with little spread. This proves the potential of the CNT geometry to provide consistent fracture toughness values despite the presence of eccentric ligaments. More research is recommended in order to introduce the CNT specimen as a robust and efficient fracture toughness specimen.","circumferentially; notched; tension; CNT; fracture; toughness; steel; fatiguing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2017-06-01","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Materials Science and Engineering (MSE)","","","",""

(mentor); Keuning, J.A. (mentor); Visser, K. (mentor); Nienhuis, B. (mentor)","2016","This thesis investigates the roll damping of surfaced submarines. Modern diesel-electric submarines can spend a significant time sailing in surfaced condition. When sailing in this condition, the submarine will roll due to the excitation by waves. The (very) large rolling angles that occur are bothersome to the crew and possibly dangerous to the submarine and its systems. The large angles occur, because the roll damping of a submarine is low when compared to ordinary surface ships. The rudders contribute the most to the roll damping of a submarine. Hardly any research into the roll damping of submarines is found in the open literature. For these reasons, the following research question is formulated: Which rudder configuration provides the most roll damping for a surfaced submarine at speed? Six different rudder configurations are compared over a range of roll amplitudes, roll frequencies and forward speeds. The comparison is made using a newly developed mathematical model. The mathematical model calculates the lift and drag forces generated by the rudders using thin airfoil theory, whilst taking the effects of very high angles of attack and the vicinity of the free surface into account. The model is validated against an extensive series of experiments on a model submarine. The model submarine had a scale of 1:24. Forced oscillation tests were performed at the towing tank of Delft University of Technology. Forces normal to the rudders and the torque acting on the hull were measured. The results of the experiments showed that the mathematical model could be used to predict the qualitative trends in the roll damping of surfaced submarines. For every combination of roll amplitude, roll frequency and forward speed that was studied, the trend was similar: the large X-rudders with bowplanes generate the most roll damping. Adding bowplanes to a given aft rudder configuration always increases the roll damping.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Marine and Transport Technology","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","Floating offshore wind turbines are taking on more and more prominence, as the industry moves towards larger turbines, farther offshore, in deeper water. The increase in turbine size can reduce the costs of offshore wind energy, but requires larger support structures. Rather than redesigning the structure completely, a rational methodology for upscaling an existing floating substructure can improve the efficiency of the design process. This work presents a guideline for the optimization and upscaling of a semi-submersible oating platform, addressing also special challenges related to changes in turbine technology, as well as design criteria for oating platforms. The OC4 semi-submersible platform is used as starting point of this study. Based on analysis results of an initial elementary upscaling procedure, the main criteria, when dealing with a semi-submersible oating platform, are specified. Optimization is then carried out, focusing on stability and eigenfrequencies. Reducing the upper column diameter and changing the ballast position within the columns, yields longer natural periods in heave and pitch, a lighter and cheaper platform, and a less over-conservative, but still stable and safe system. Based on this optimized design, a guideline for an upscaling procedure for any other turbine is given. The main scaling factor is determined from the mass ratio of the top structures, rather than the turbine rating. The main column is scaled, so that it fits the new tower base diameter. The scaling factor for the upper columns is computed, based on the ratio of the overturning moments, and considers the contribution of the different columns to the stiffness component in pitch. The mooring line length is scaled, such that it can yield a predefined stiffness. Finally, the controller gains are recalculated, based on the expected natural frequency in pitch. The optimization and upscaling process is carried out for Fraunhofer's offshore wind turbine IWT-7.5-164 and the DTU 10 MW reference wind turbine. The oating wind turbines are analyzed, modelled and simulated by means of simplified spreadsheet methods, linear frequencydomain calculations (in DNV's software HydroD), and detailed equation-based models (in Fraunhofer's software Modelica). The systems are evaluated regarding their eigenfrequencies, nominal pitch, stability and global performance in selected sea states, taking variable buoyancy and center of buoyancy into account, and adjusting the blade-pitch controller gains. The results, obtained from both computer programs and the initial hand calculations, are comparable and satisfying. The structural integrity is proved by a simplified approach, using tank pressure and sea pressure for computing the equivalent stress. More detailed strength checks for fatigue and ultimate limit states, as well as optimization of the mooring system, are left for future work.","offshore wind energy; semi-submersible floating platform; upscaling; wind turbine","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","","European Wind Energy Master - EWEM","",""

(mentor); Verweij, M.D. (mentor)","2016","In this report, we will try to model a silicon chip with elements, as used in current experiments, with the aim to find a suitable and fast model for the transducer used. The specific question we will try to address is: How well can we model the effects of induced oscillation on other elements on a silicon chip? Induced oscillations can create problems when miniaturizing heart imaging technology for example, as the incoming signal cannot be properly converted to an image. The biharmonic equation dictates the displacement of the elements with respect to a force acting on the chip. Hence, using assumptions and numerical methods, the biharmonic equation can only be split into two coupled equations. We will look at two different boundary conditions for both of these equations; either the glue used to attach the transducer to the substrate is simply supporting the transducer, or clamping the transducer in place. We will model the biharmonic equation using Peisker's method, as well as the simply supported boundary problem. Both of these will require us to reformulate the biharmonic equation in the frequency domain, and linearize the impedance for a range between 1MHz and 9:5MHz. The results from this will then be compared to the Newmark-Beta method solution, by looking at the stability, efficiency, and accuracy. From this we can also answer the second question we will try to address: How well can Peisker's method be used to solve a fourth order differential equation? We expect that the solution to the simply supported boundary conditions look similar to the Newmark-Beta method, as they both have the same boundary conditions. Furthermore, the solution from the Peisker method should not look very different either, as they are all describing the same biharmonic equation. We found that both the Peisker method and the solution to the simply supported boundary problem look very similar, and both look like the Newmark-Beta method solution. Both methods and the non-iterative solution from the simply supported boundary problem show induced oscillations on the transducer. From this we can conclude that the simply supported boundary problem is preferred over the Newmark-Beta method due to its computation time and preferred over the Peisker method due to its computation time and smaller truncation error. The simply supported boundary problem can be more efficiently implemented than the Peisker model, as there is no need for iterations. Hence, it can be relatively quickly simulated. From this report we have seen that we can effectively model the effects of induced oscillation on other elements on a silicon chip, through the Peisker method, the Newmark-Beta method and the simply supported boundary problem. To answer our second question, Peisker's method is an effective and accurate method to model the biharmonic equation, a fourth order differential equation. However, the simply supported boundary problem is preferred.","","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Delft Institute of Applied Mathematics","","","",""
