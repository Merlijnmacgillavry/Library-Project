The distancing of the architect from the actual construction site coincides with the emergence of digital design environments that provide seemingly abundant design choices yet draw the attention away from the fabricability of them. Often, matter is considered as a homogeneous element that “receives” the form. However, in case of structures such as the woven ones, the material nature of which constitutes their most unique characteristic and dictates their form up to a large extent, the integration of materiality as an active agent in the design process is imperative.<br/><br/>This study explores this new relationship between form, materiality and structural performance through the proposal of a theoretical framework and an original digital tool, SpaceWeave, developed in Grasshopper for Rhino in collaboration with the Karamba plug-in for structural analysis. SpaceWeave aims to facilitate the generation, modelling and preliminary structural analysis of woven structures during the early design phase. The role of material properties in a design workflow, the advantages and limitations of designing and structurally analysing in a parametric setting, as well as the correlation between weave parameters and structural behaviour of the resulting structures are discussed.<br","Woven structures; Structural analysis; Computational Design; Grasshopper; Karamba; Modelling; Materiality; Form; Building technology","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The cybercrime economy has grown to acquire $600 billion in profits every year, nearly one percent of the global GDP according to a study made by The Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), in collaboration with McAfee. This is likely to increase in the upcoming years especially with the growing IoT and smart devices market, mainly because security is often (partially) ignored during the design phase due to its additional costs. As a result, devices become vulnerable to attacks. In 2017, Accenture, a consulting services company, analyzed the security of 30 mobile banking applications and found out that all apps contained at least one known security vulnerability.<br/><br/>For many years there have been advances in software security. It gets harder and harder to attack software, due to many countermeasures developed over the years. As a result, attackers have shifted their focus to hardware attacks. Exploitable vulnerabilities found in hardware most often require hardware revisions. In contrast to software which can be updated easily. There are many forms of hardware attacks; examples are IP piracy, hardware Trojan, side-channel analysis and fault injection (FI). Recent advances in these attacks made some of them accessible to the public, which worsens the problem. One of the popular hardware attacks is FI, which is able to temporarily alter the functionality of the hardware during run time.<br/><br/>This thesis will focus on analyzing the resilience of smartphones against FI attacks, to further improve the security of smartphones, by researching the possibility of using FI to brute force the lock screen of an Android phone. The attack target is a high frequency package on package chip that has not been attacked before in the literature as far as we know. Based on the target design ad properties of the available FI techniques, electromagnetic fault injection (EMFI) was chosen. Using this technique, a characterization of the target chip was performed to verify its vulnerability to EMFI. To be able to use the acquired knowledge from the characterization a FI model was made, i.e., this model is based on the activity during a glitch and the glitch location. The FI model describes that faults can be injected during the transfer of instructions from the DRAM to the cache. A second characterization was performed using the FI model while running the Android OS, which showed that Android doesn't have any defenses against FI. Before attacking the lock screen, a simulation of the attack was performed, which proved the possibility of successfully performing this attack. Unfortunately, the right time to successfully glitch the lock screen was not found due to the large search space, unreliable trigger and possibly the usage of a non-optimal probe position on top of the chip. Nevertheless, it was demonstrated that the lock screen can be attacked by simulating the effect of glitching certain specific instructions and it was proven that PoP chips with a high clock frequency are vulnerable to EMFI.","FI; Fault Injection; Android; Lock Screen; Smarpthones; Hacking; EMFI; Electro Magnetic Fault Injection; glitching; glitch; Package on Package","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

NGOs and the government are trying to tackle the plastic problem, with an increasing effort in the last few years. This research project has been set up to determine which regions and rivers in Bali discharge the most plastic and therefore pollute the ocean the most, and to design a river structure to mitigate plastic emissions to the ocean.<br/><br/>For this study, 31 rivers in eight different regions were measured and analysed. All rivers were measured by visual observation, a trawl or a combination of the two. The flow velocity and the width were measured for each river. By means of the average weight of one piece of plastic, the plastic flux could be obtained. The river embankments were systematically assessed for each river. In addition, the wind speed was also measured for each river.<br/><br/>The three most polluting rivers of the island are all in different regions. These three rivers will be the most effective to tackle in order to reduce the plastic discharge to the ocean. The study shows that when a river flows through a densely populated area, the river is more polluted, as is the case with the three most polluted rivers.<br/><br/>Through a MCA, two effective waste catchment structures were eventually found for the two types of rivers on the island, which are rivers with and without navigation.

The Greater Bay Area (GBA), as the site of interest, is undergoing rapid metropolization, with a risk of resulting in the formation of indistinguishable, generic urban structures. The fast development and the migration process have defined a region with multiple identities and diverse groups of people living in it. The social and spatial implications of the metropolization process reflect a segregation between the actual planning system and the diverse people that live in this region. The proposal aims to transform the megablock, a traditional, structural form of planning that is a form of de-contextualized, top down planning based around an economic, private-driven market, into a planning tool that enables the cohabitation of multiple lifestyles that creates social networks of interaction, activates spaces of the existing context and relates them with new developments. Therefore, the redefining of the megablock intends to find how rapid urbanization and the enhancement of distinct local and external identities can go hand-in-hand in a multiplicity of urban contexts, creating a balance between quantity and quality and creating a process of place making that allows the enhancement and strengthening of the notion of identity in a local, urban and regional scale. The Megablock becomes a sustainable prototype for future urbanization and a morphological spatial structure that re-establish a spatial order and framework for the transitions and relations between diverse places and people.","Identity; metropolization process; Cohabitation; place making; Public space; megablock; spatial planning","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","Globalization: Research on the Urban Impact","22.3193, 114.1694"

This not only causes unpleasantness for passengers and crew of ships but also it limits the accessibility to the offshore platforms. Bosch Rexroth with their partner Barge Master have developed the so-called Motion Compensated Gangway that provides a safe passage for cargo and personnel to offshore structures.<br/>In order to maintain a motionless connection with the offshore structure, once the tip of the gangway is pushed against the offshore structure. The gangway system actively compensates for the sea-induced motion that acts on the vessel.<br/>However, the docking procedure is still manually attained, where accidents may occur due to human error (i.e. insufficient training, loss of concentration). One way to improve the current control scheme is to enable an automated docking scheme.<br/>Accordingly, the main of this project focuses on eliminating the human factor from the control loop, so the overall process is accomplished automatically and more efficiently in terms of safety and performance.<br/>Inspired by how the operator estimates the relative motion between the Gangway and the target (i.e. the offshore platform). In this thesis, a measurement system is proposed to measure this relative motion. This measurement system comprises a vision sensor, force tip measurements, and Motion Reference Unit (MRU). In this thesis, the proposed automated docking scheme is developed around a nonlinear MPC scheme. For the simulation environment and for the MPC scheme employs, a nonlinear model of the gangway system is derived. This model embeds an approximation of the joint-level control loop of the Gangway system. Also, this model comprises the open-chain kinematic model of the Gangway system and the proposed measurement system including a perspective projection model of the vision sensor. Due to modelling the vision sensor as such and the MPC’s capability in handling various constraints, the proposed control scheme enjoys a singularity-free solution.<br/>The proposed control scheme detects and tracks the target in the 2D image plane. To safeguard against visual measurements discontinuity (i.e. cluttering, target outside the field of view), a linear Kalman filter is designed to predict the target position in the image plane.<br/>To gain higher performance, the disturbance anticipatory property in MPC is enabled by forecasting the sea-induced motion. Where a neural network with the NARX topology was designed and trained to acquire a multi-step-ahead prediction model of the induced motion.<br/>Several numerical experiments were carried to evaluate the performance of the proposed control scheme for automated docking. Where for the nominal case scenarios all the control requirements are fulfilled. Also, more extreme scenarios are performed to evaluates the overall performance under plant model mismatch and against various sea-induced motion conditions. Evidently, the proposed control scheme is prone to camera calibrations error. <br/>In terms of the efficiency, the proposed automated docking scheme performs the docking in 4 to 10 seconds (based on the initial conditions and sea state). Whereas the time it takes the operator to perform the docking is up to 3 minutes which depends on his/her experience.","Model Predictive Control; Visual Servoing; Vision-based Control; Motion Compensated Gangway","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-06-29","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

The purpose of this study was to develop a methodology to estimate the muscle strain and muscle elongation velocity of the biceps femoris (BF), semimembranosus (SM) and the semitendinosus (ST) muscle in professional and recreational football athletes with the use of IMUs during different football specific movements and during different intensities. When comparing different movements and intensities, the greatest peak muscle strain was found in the BF and the lowest peak muscle strain was found in the SM during the majority of the movements. The biomechanical load was different for each hamstring muscle and was different for the running based movements and other football specific movements. The BF experienced the greatest peak muscle strain (12.12 ± 0.88%) during a maximal intensity kick in the supporting leg, while the greatest peak muscle elongation velocity was observed in the ST (3.97 ± 0.47 s-1) in the kicking leg during the maximal intensity kick. The greatest biomechanical loading was during a maximal intensity kick. Finally, it was observed that the moment of peak muscle strain was different from the time period of peak muscle elongation velocity for running based movements. It is concluded that IMUs together with the developed methodology could be used in the assessment of hamstring strain injuries in professional and recreational football by analyzing and monitoring muscle strain and muscle elongation velocity.","Injury prevention; Inertial Measurement Unit; biomechanics; football; muscle strain injury","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Biomedical Engineering | Sports Engineering","",""

The convectionless Nersnt-Planck equation is combined with the continuity equation to obtain a partial dierential equation in time and space. The boundary conditions at the edges of the cell for this equationare a constant bulk concentration. Furthermore, in presence of an applied potential, the potential gradient is assumed to be linear with dierent values for the gradient inside and outside the membrane. This dierent value inside the membrane is due to Donnan potentials that arise at the membrane/electrolyteinterfaces. On top of this, because of the Donnan exclusion, the concentrationsare not continuous on the interface. To account for this, the cell is splitinto three regions: the membrane and two electrolyte regions on either side of the membrane. The boundary conditions to tie these regions together, is that the ux should be continuous across the interface. The problem has the form of an initial value problem. The partial differential equation is discretized using a finite difference method and is integrated using the forward Euler method.The results show an accumulation of ions at the membrane interface closest to the positive electrode, while ions are depleted at the other interface. This accumulation of ions is too big however, with the Na+ concentration at one point reaching 12M after only 0.10 seconds, while the concentration was 1M atthe start. This is clearly not what one would expect to happen physically. Therewere, however, no errors found in the numerical method as it was possible tocorrectly deduce and predict concentration changes, based on the concentrations and ux in a certain time step. Therefore it appears that there is an error in the assumptions that were made when developing the model. It is believed that this error lies in the assumption that the potential gradients only has two different values. This assumption ignores the diffusion boundary layers on the outside of the membrane. In this diffusion boundary layer, the potential gradient has another, different value. Therefore, to obtain more accurate results, the cell should actually be split into five different regions: the membrane, two diffusion boundary layers and two electrolyte solutions.","Ion Exchange; Numerical modelling; Partial Differential Equations","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

More recently they have been used to obtain slip critical shear connections in new structures such as new bridges, large roofs, storm barriers and other structures exposed to cyclic loading. In addition, they are tested as a feasible alternative to traditional shear connectors in steel-concrete composite flooring systems, in combination with oversized holes in the flange of steel girder to allow reusability. On the grounds of this research a novel injection material was developed at T.U Delft, namely steel reinforced resin as an alternative to conventional resin allowed in the Netherlands for structural applications without compromising stiffness of connection. Due to limited research on fatigue of resins used in structural applications, in this study an initial attempt to investigate the cyclic behaviour of conventional and steel reinforced resin subjected to uniaxial compressive cyclic bearing stress, in confined conditions is performed. First, for this objective an experimental program using a tailor-made test setup was carried out, and the fatigue response in terms of slip over number of cycles for resin and steel reinforced resin in oversized holes of 6mm and 10mm was obtained. With this specimen configuration, is intended to reproduce as possible the stress state of double lap shear connection without endanger the fatigue cracking of steel parts. Frequency, stress ratio and other testing parameters that can influence the results have been chosen based on relative literature and assembly of setup. Three stress ranges used, with the maximum related to the recommended long term bearing stress for conventional resin, while the failure criterion was set at 0.3mm slip which is related to this long term bearing strength at the end of working life. Secondly, a numerical model of test set-up to investigate the static and quasi-static behaviour of specimens was developed and validated by the quasi static experimental results of initial stiffness of connection. Finally, through statistical treatment of test results fitted curves obtained, and characteristic curves with 95% probability of survival are proposed for both resin types and hole clearances based on probabilistic model of ASTM standard and probabilistic model proposed by Schneider and Maddox, using Student’s t distribution. On the basis of experimental results, large scattering was observed for both type of resins, and more prominent for the larger hole clearance and higher stress range. The reasons for this scatter are discussed and recommendations for future improvement of set-up are proposed. Due to scatter the results could not fully support the expectations that fatigue behaviour of steel reinforced resin is superior to that of conventional, as it is the case in static and creep behaviour. From a selection of specimens with limited scatter in 6mm oversized holes, a trend that connections with steel reinforced resin lead to less slip due to cyclic loads after 500.000 cycles was observed. From the numerical research on static models of specimens it was verified that the bearing stress state of resin layer is almost identical to that of the double lap shear connection of EN 1090-2 indicating a similar stress transfer mechanism. From the statistical evaluation of test data with ASTM probabilistic model the use of steel reinforced resin leads to higher fatigue endurance related to conventional resin in 10mm oversized hole, while the fatigue life of specimens with conventional resin decreased with larger hole clearance namely from 6 to 10mm.","fatigue test; Injection bolts; Epoxy Resin; oversized holes","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

The problem is that this system does not correspond with the experienced load of players because leg movements are excluded. Therefore, this study introduces a new local concept of gathering local three-dimensional leg acceleration data by inertial measurement units.<br/>This pilot study aims to use a big data analysis approach to translate leg acceleration data into a measure to indicate local muscle load and compare this new local and the current global method to the players’ experienced load. Five participants performed specific football drills with an intensity increase from jogging to sprinting and by adding a pass and shot. Measures are developed, based on the pelvis, upper leg, and lower leg accelerations, by a peak and cumulative data analysis approach. By evaluating trend percentages of the intensity increase, it is obtained that a local acceleration measure is comparable to the players’ experienced load if it considers the sum of normal or peak data points weighted per zone and per travelled distance. Furthermore, a similar result is obtained when only the upper leg or lower leg accelerations are considered.<br/>It can be concluded that local three-dimensional acceleration of the lower extremities, processed with a big data analysis approach, represent the football players’ experienced muscular load more accurate than the current global method. Further research, including a higher number of participants, should prove the significance.","Football; Muscle load; Muscle prevention; Local accelerations; Big data analysis approach","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | BioMechanical Design | Sports Engineering","",""

TheNewMakers (TNM) want to radically change how buildings are being constructed in order to speed up the building process. TNM is applying their LEGO inspired building system that consists out of a database with building blocks. One of these building blocks is a wall component, which is applied in the façade of a tiny house. The aim of this research is to apply a robot to assemble CNC cut elements into this wall component. To achieve this goal, the wall component will be redesigned with the main focus on reducing the automatic assembly time.<br/><br/>Literature research was conducted and a robotic assembly process hypothesis was made. This robotic process hypothesis provided input for: a robotic assembly experiment and a robotic simulation. For the experiment only a small robot was available and, therefore, only a section of the wall component was considered. The experiment was conducted in collaboration with HBO mechatronic students. This experiment helped to physically test the suggested improvements of the wall component. The robotic simulation helped to measure how long it would take when a large robot would assemble the whole wall component. This allowed a time comparison between the simulated robotic and manual assembly process of the whole wall component.<br/><br/>The literature research helped to choose a robot for the robotic assembly process hypothesis, which was the industrial robot Smart5 NJ 110-3.0 from Comau. Redesigning the elements of the wall component allowed for an easier assembly sequence. Besides that, extra geometry tolerances ensured certain steps of the robotic assembly process could be performed faster and were less prone to failure.<br/><br/>The robotic simulation showed that the robot is at least 1,17 times faster than a human, which would mean the annual production of the robot is about 5,5 times higher. The CNC milling process takes about 8 times more than the robotic assembly process.","robot; robotics; robotic simulation; RoboDK; cnc; cnc milling; assemblage; assembly; DFA2; Design For Automatic Assembly","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Surveying is done using a variety of surveying techniques, many of which require surveyors to walk on or near the tracks, which could cause injuries. An alternative surveying technique would be photogrammetry using images acquired with a camera mounted on a drone. In this technique a 3D point cloud is constructed out of images, which is georeferenced using GPS measurements on the drone and Ground Control Points (GCP). The positions of the rail rods can then be found by modelling the rail rod using the point cloud. The quality of the point cloud, defined here as a combination of accuracy, precision, point density, completeness, and the rail rod feature detectability, is an important factor in deciding if photogrammetry is a sufficient surveying technique for this project.<br/><br/>In this research the influence of the distance between the camera and the track, the baseline, and the number and spread of GCPs on the quality of the resulting point cloud. The distance to the track was set to 25, 30 and35m and the baseline was varied between 2 and 10m. The requirement set for the accuracy is 15mm, while the precision has to be below 10mm. For the point density an K-nearest neighbors (K-nn) of at least 10 is required, the completeness requires less than 10% missing cells and finally the feature detectability requires that at least once every 2m the location of the rail can be determined. The features are detected using a 2D model of the rail that is fitted in a flattened slice of the point cloud using a modified version of the iterative closest point algorithm.<br/><br/>It is shown that the accuracy and precision are influenced by the distance and baseline, but no clear relation was found, while the accuracy improves when using GCPs. For the point density it is shown that increasing the distance between the camera and the track linearly decreases the point density, while the baseline has no impact and for the completeness a decreasing trend was found when increasing the baseline, while no relation could be found between the completeness and the distance between the camera and the track. For the rail rod feature detectability it was shown that the percentage of accurately found rail rod positions goes down when increasing the distance to the track and the baseline. Overall it is proven that when using a 100MP camera, 5 GCPs, a distance of 25m, and a baseline of 2.17m the rail rods could be surveyed so that the requirements set for this research were met.","Photogrammetry; Drones; Rail; ProRail; CGI; Point clouds","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

The market is susceptible to quick changes, causing seemingly random fluctuations in the Bitcoin price. Due to the chaotic and highly volatile nature of Bitcoin behavior, investments come with high risk. To minimize the risk involved, knowledge of the Bitcoin price movement in the future is desirable. Different studies have shown that Machine Learning algorithms can predict, to varying degrees, the price fluctuations of Bitcoin. However, most researches do not explore the relationship between the price and other features outside the transaction network, such as market capitalization, Bitcoin mining speed, or entity behavior. Also, most of the features are extracted from the network level, which means obtaining the number of transactions, users, Bitcoins mined, etc. In this research, we focus on additional features, such as features outside the transaction network and node-based features inside the transaction network, which could improve the price prediction of Bitcoin. The investigated features are the “fairness and goodness” measure and the “1-ARW-betweenness cen- trality” measure. Fairness and goodness are entity behavior measures. The goodness of a Bitcoin address captures how much this address is liked/trusted by other addresses, while the fairness of a Bitcoin address captures how fair the address is in rating other addresses’ likeability or trust level. The 1-ARW-betweenness centrality is a feature based on absorbing random walks. The feature captures the extent to which a Bitcoin address has control over the money flow between different addresses. A benchmark, based on the machine learning algorithm Random Forest with commonly used features, is used to test the impact of the additional features. The Random Forest tries to predict the sign (up-down movement) of the price per day, using data from the two previous days. Comparing this benchmark with a similar model, but then including the additional features, will gain more information about how these additional features influence the Bitcoin price.","Machine Learning; Random Forest; Bitcoin; random walk; graph analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics | Financial Engineering","",""

However, the scarcity of this precious resource is not just due to changing natural patterns but a highly man made disaster. ‘Water use has been growing globally at more than twice the rate of population increase in the last century, and an increasing number of regions are reaching the limit at which water services can be sustainably delivered, especially in arid regions’(UN Water).<br/><br/>Similar to this condition, the water system in Jaipur has central instabilities. With high level of dependence on a single source at the moment, high transmission loss, increasing water pollution and degradation of the ecosystems, the resilience to such loss is low. This condition has further worsened due to the changing precipitation patterns leading to less rainfall in the last decade and intensive heat which causes high evaporation. But, in order to meet the rising demand of the population and industries, changing land use both in urban and peri urban areas, has resulted in over exploitation of ground and surface water, the city is now facing a severe water crisis. Nearby water reserves have run dry and the seasonal river (Dhravyawati) which passes through the city is now used as a sewage drain, catering to all domestic and industrial waste due to lack of efficient governance and inadequacy in providing effective infrastructure for supply and treatment. The existing traditional water systems which has been the only practice of rainwater harvesting in the region are non-operational and insufficient to meet the demand of the growing population and industries. All these trends are interrelated and create a cause effect scenario, ultimately leading to conflicts and drought conditions. Therefore, the research addresses issues of both ‘water scarcity’ and ‘water security’ for the city. <br/><br/>In order to become resilient, there is a stronger need for communities to effectively manage water resources through conservation and reuse. Therefore, the project proposes a sustainable integrated multi scaler and multi-generational planning approach to water management strategy for the city of Jaipur, India, which has constantly been a victim of drought conditions. The aim of this graduation project can be categorized into two parts: the first half looks at the general goal to devise a sustainable strategy for integrated urban water management and urban planning for semi-arid zones, created by a hybrid system of centralized and de-centralized water management practices. Based on this knowledge, the main strategy proposes a toolbox of interventions in built form and landscape on different scales which can be applied across all cities. The second half is context specific, focusing on the region on Jaipur, India and how water sensitive spatial planning and design by using the toolbox can help to ensure a resilient urban environment. The research develops design proposals on multiples scales in a multi user setting, namely the regional, city and local, thus giving recommendations to regional and local authorities on developing a water sensitive city. As part of a long-term effort to this increasing shortage of water, it encourages greater conservation and management through spatial guidelines on the regional, urban and local scale where indigenous practices and green infrastructure become part of the contemporary system and solutions.","Water management; Climate adaptation; Traditional system; Metropolitan Structure; Resilience; Infrastructural ecology; water sensitive urban planning and design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","26.9124° N"

By using only one system for both cold start and high efficiency harvesting, the required silicon area is heavily reduced. The most fitting energy transducer is determined to be a photovoltaic cell, based on aspects of voltage, power and size. Both indoor and outdoor lighting conditions are suitable. The literature on fully integrated voltage boosting with special attention to cold start shows that the capacitive charge pump is the best solution for high efficiency, low power and small size voltage boosting. For cold start applications, a Dickson charge pump with dynamic charge transfer switches is the best solution. For achieving high efficiency conversion, theMakowski charge pump is the best.<br/>The proposed design combines the advantages of the Dickson charge pump for cold start and the high efficiency aspects of aMakowski charge pump for normal operation in one system with minimal silicon area. Using capacitor splitting, the conversion ratio of the cold start charge pump can be orthogonally chosen from<br/>the conversion ratio of normal operation. Dynamic charge transfer switches are used for the cold start charge pump to increase the performance. An implementation of the proposed design is made in Cadence Virtuoso and is tested for cold start capability and efficiency across five process corners and three temperatures. The results prove that the proposed design can achieve high efficiency energy harvesting that is on average 5% below the efficiency of a normal Makowski charge pump. Cold start was achieved from 100mV that is boosted to a battery voltage of 1.8 V within the micro-watt power range. With these results, the proposed charge pump is suitable for photovoltaic energy harvesting in small devices. The required silicon area is reduced by 50%, compared to systems where cold start and high efficiency harvesting are provided by separate systems.<br/>The proposed design is made into a lay-out, which is currently being tested and will be manufactured in the coming months.","charge pump; Energy Harvesting; integrated circuits; analog circuit design; Photovoltaic; Makowski charge pump; Dickson charge pump; Low power; low voltage; Cold start","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-07-01","","","","","",""

An accurate prediction model could not only be used for optimising the PV system design, but is also expected to realise the yield potential of innovative PV technologies. In the next generation of PV technologies, one of the most promising concepts is the tandem solar cells. In recent years, these cells have impressed the solar industry by their rapid growth of the maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE). Since tandem solar cells are still at the lab phase, their yield potential under realistic conditions are an interesting field of study as well. However, the existing yield prediction models are not yet available for these tandem cells. In order to fill this gap, a prediction model developed in the Photovoltaic Materials and Devices (PVMD) group of TU Delft, called the PVMD Toolbox, has been adapted to be compatible with the tandem solar cells. In this thesis project, the version 3 of the Toolbox was developed. First the PVMD Toolbox was improved. Except monofacial c-Si cells and bifacial c-Si cell, it is now also available for tandem cells. One of the most promising tandem concepts, the perovskite/c-Si tandem, was taken as a reference tandem configuration integrated in the Toolbox. The Toolbox was also modified to take the influence of solar spectra into consideration and analyses cell performances individually. Secondly, the accuracy of the Toolbox was validated. A new figure of merit called 'relative total deviation' is put forward in this report, which calculates the ratio between the sum of deviations that each simulation introduces, and the total measured energy yield. When the electrical parameters were taken from the own measurements, the relative total deviation of simulation results was only 8.6%. Finally, the Toolbox was applied to two case studies. In the first study, it was found that the annual energy yield (AEY) of perovskite tandems can be increased up to 0.4% by optimising perovskite thickness for a certain location. The second case study compared the AEY of the tandem module and conventional c-Si module. Perovskite tandem module showed a high AEY, around 36% higher than that of the c-Si module. However, perovskite tandem had a lower specific yield as they are more sensitive to the spectral variation","PV systems; Tandem solar cells; System modelling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-07-01","","","","","",""

The findings of this analysis seek to answer the primary hypothesis: The unique application of Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCOE), entailing the manipulation of CAPEX and CO2 variables, reveals the points in time and the exact LCOE values where it becomes cost competitiveness to switch from a coal asset to a renewable asset within the context of the German electricity market. The results illustrate that cost competitiveness between new renewables (solar PV, onshore wind, and offshore wind) and coal in the German electricity market does cross at certain points. The research seeks to determine the precise scenarios under which new renewable plants are more cost competitive than existing coal plants. The LCOE calculation has been chosen as the methodology to estimate the relative cost competitiveness of these differing power generation methods, under predefined scenarios for both CAPEX-reduction for renewables and CO2-price increase for coal. New assets are compared to existing assets; therefore, LCOE has been chosen in order to compare operational costs (OPEX) plus the capital cost (CAPEX) of new assets, with only the operational cost (OPEX) for existing assets. i.e. the investment cost for coal-fired assets is denoted as a sunk cost.

Sequential Monte Carlo can be particularly useful in problems in which the data is sequential, noisy and non-stationary. We compare this algorithm against a gradient-based method known as stochastic gradient descent (SGD), a commonly used method for training neural networks. The performance of SGD on forecasting non-stationary, noisy time series can be poor due to the possibility of overfitting on the data. The sequential Monte Carlo method may offer a solution for the problems that arise in forecasting non-stationary time series with SGD neural networks. At the same time, neural networks trained with SGD give deterministic predictions, and there is a need for quantification of the uncertainty in the prediction. Sequential Monte Carlo sequentially samples the weights of the neural network, providing a posterior distribution on the weights and thus the outcome. In this work, the sequential Monte Carlo algorithm is tested and analyzed, with different parameter settings, on four time series to give an overview of the behavior. Furthermore, we apply the SMC algorithm on a convolutional neural network known as WaveNet. We show that the SMC algorithm is very well-suited for forecasting non-stationary time series, and can significantly outperform the gradient-based SGD method. Additionally, we show that for specific time series the SMC algorithm on a convolutional neural network outperforms the SMC algorithm on a fully-connected neural network.","sequential Monte Carlo; Neural Networks; Time Series Forecasting; Convolutional Neural Network","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics | Financial Engineering","",""

PSSs enable “sale-of-use” instead of “sale-of-product” so these systems satisfy consumers through the delivery of functions instead of products. Unfortunately, the adoption of PSSs is still limited. Because PSSs are often radical innovations, they challenge existing consumers’ habits (cultural barriers), companies’ organizations (corporate barriers) and regulative frameworks (regulative barriers) (UNEP, 2002; Mont, 2002; Tukker and Tischner, 2006). In combination with that in literature little attention is committed to understand how the process of diffusion takes place (Tukker and Tischner, 2006; Baines et al., 2007). Additionally, there is a shortage of empirical studies focusing on the consumers’ perspective (Mont and Plepys, 2003). Therefore, the purpose of this thesis is to find consumer’s motivational factors, by studying three PSS cases. The PSS cases are bike-sharing systems (BSSs): OV-fiets, Swapfiets and Mobike. The findings support a deeper understanding and stimulation of PSS adoption. <br/>The research is carried out in a qualitative manner, eight semi-structured interviews with experts (who work at the analysed BSSs) and consumers (who uses two or more of the analysed BSSs) are conducted. The gathered data is analysed with the grounded theory (Charmaz, 2007) and diffusion of innovation (DOI) theory (Rogers, 2003). This resulted in twenty-four motivational factors categorized by Rogers (2003) five innovation attributes: relative advantage, compatibility, complexity, trialability, and observability. An overview can be found in Table 7 on page 51. The research results indicate motivational drivers for consumers which can potentially increase the rate of adoption of BSSs. A new concept is created to illustrate possible design solutions to strengthen a selection of the consumer’s motivational factors. Additionally, the new concept demonstrates a promising future-oriented scenario for electrical BSSs. The new concept: Breeze aims to postpone or replace car ownership. To conclude, the findings raised in this thesis provide a deeper understanding of the consumers’ perspective on BSSs. The findings suggest what factors are more important to stimulate the rate of adoption. For future research, it is a useful base for a quantitative study to validate consumer’s motivational drivers to use a BSS in the Netherlands. The research findings are also a useful source for a more in-depth research about mobility PSSs in general.","Product-Service System; Bike-Sharing System; Sustainable consumption pattern; Diffusion of innovation theory; Motivational drivers","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","Graduation project",""

(mentor); Eigenraam, P. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","Quadrangular Grid shells have generated interest in recent years for their application in rationalizing free form geometry in the built environment. Shell structure are efficient because their form is governed by flow of internal forces. But while discretizing shells into grid shells, instead of using flow of forces, current method follows patterns and tessellation techniques. Quadrangular grids are easier to manufacture but they are not stiff inherently compared to triangulated meshed grid, which doesn’t allow them to be used as frequently. There is a scope to improve stiffness by discretization informed by flow of forces. <br/>A workflow was developed for designing quadrangular static-responsive grid shells which are structurally efficient, homogenous and has near planar cladding, including preferences of the designer. The workflow is set up in a parametric environment in grasshopper, a plugin for Rhino 3d modelling software. It uses particle spring method for form finding a shell which has membrane like load bearing behaviour. The solid shell is discretized into a grid shell by a custom stress line generator which uses principal stress vector field derived by Finite element analysis of the shell. The grid shell is homogenised and optimized for planarity by dynamic relaxation. Multiple design alternatives are generated and stored. Design space is explored by using data analytics and visualization techniques which helps user to make informed design decisions. The workflow is applied to create a grid shell over delft bus station as a case study to protect travellers from varying weather conditions. The results are quite satisfactory in terms of structural performance when compared to methods used in state of the art in practice. Stiffness of a structure can be measure by total strain energy. The grid shell for delft bus station generated using this workflow was 32% and 49% lower in terms of total strain energy(compliance) than regular quad grid shell and diagrid quad shell respectively. The results are promising for real life application. Meaning that the workflow can be used to find a homogenised quadrangular grid shell which are stiffer than their predecessors. Grid shells are used for approximating free form geometry for various projects around the globe. Using this method can save time, money and material which was required to make a grid shells stiff by thicker beams or extra stiffening members.","Gridshell; planar Quadrilateral; p-quad; principal stress; principal stresslines; surface discretization; Parametric Design; static; finite element analysis; stiffness; Structural Optimization; Design Exploration","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Building Technology","",""

Within the agriculture sector, drying of food and flowering products is a necessary step in production. A lot of companies make use of hot air dryers where the heat is gained by burning natural gas. A novel method is to use a heat pump assisted drying systems instead. Heat pump assisted drying realises a better product quality due to the ability of humidity and climate control of the drying medium: air. Additionally, there are possibilities for energy savings up to 50%. This thesis project is mentioned as the first step for an initiative to introduce heat pump drying into the horticulture sector. The project started almost 1 year ago and is still far from finished. Main goal was to get a good understanding of the product drying behaviour, drying capacities and the system requirements and footprints. Conclusions should determine whether there is a possibil-ity for market implementation or not. The results in this report are promising. Heat pump drying is a trending research topic in science, where new developments on predicting the dynamic drying behaviour of agricultural products show up every month. This study involves a computational model, where the dynamic process of drying flower bulbs is simulated. This model is validated by measurements on existing drying in-stallations. Building this model resulted in a good understanding about the flower bulb characteris-tics and the necessary drying capacities. Additionally, Heat pump drying systems are evaluated and a dynamically modelled. When both models are the drying process of FB’s can be optimized. The first protype of the HP drying system that will be used in further research will be shortly discussed. Conclusion of this report is that heat pump drying is a promising technique for drying of FB’s. The combination of technical advantages with energy savings, could lead to better product quality and lower production costs. The business case is strengthened by future perspectives where energy efficiency and reduction of CO2 emissions will more and more important due to climate change.","Drying; Agriculture; Heat pump; Modelling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-06-28","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Process and Energy Technology","",""

In this overlap area, the flow computed by the traditional CFD model was used by the deep learning model as an input. It was demonstrated that since traditional CFD model continuously feeds in reliable information into the deep learning domain, the error remains bounded.

This has led us to believe that organisational theory and practice from the last decades just does not hold up anymore. They have created organisations that made sense then, but do not necessarily now. Organisations themselves need to change in order to keep up with this sped up world. To achieve better success, many organisations are (constantly) entrenched in large-scale change efforts. However, these do not guarantee improvement, with various studies suggesting only about 25 to 50% of these efforts succeed, and numbers are declining. Given the shortcomings to current organisation design theory and change management practices, a new approach could better link theory and practice to increase practical validity. <br/>Therefore, strategic design is used as a new approach to describe organisations, their design and change processes. The research question following this idea is:<br/> How can strategic design be of value in the understanding of and quest for progressive organisations, their design and the design and realisation of accompanying change efforts, to survive and thrive in the context of 21st century challenges? The research focuses on progressive organisations: those that are as ready for the present and future as possible and that (aim to) achieve three distinct abilities: engagement amongst employees, organisational agility and organisational ambidexterity. The focus on design leads to a new view on organisations as a set of organisational blocks and their connections. The approach, based on literature on progressive organisations, insights into design and prototyping and learnings from practice, is specifically human-centred. Organisations are defined from the viewpoint of the employee. The goal of this approach is to understand the organisation in a different way and make it possible to build a new organisation together with the employees in an iterative manner. The various organisational blocks are: raison d’être, environments, culture, grounding and action agenda. In order to achieve a progressive organisation, built on the aforementioned blocks, lessons from design and practice are combined to argue that the only way to deal with complexity is through iteration and repeated learnings. Based on this understanding, (semi-) controlled revolutions become the new approach to change efforts. The end-goal should not be to design or deduce static organisational plans, but to (constantly) adapt to the changing conditions, with the realisation that not all things can be predicted or controlled. This iteration is depicted in the figure to the left. Given this understanding, a revolution is guided by three principles: going from planned to hacked, not forcing, but inviting people to join the effort and to stop managing the effort, but going viral. <br/>In order to increase the probability of successful change, and to increase the usefulness of this research, a revolution checklist is presented. Together, they encompass all aspects of the revolution that should be actively pursued and monitored. The checklist consists of six categories (depicted above), with various additional elements each. These categories are: be broad about it, approach from all angles, talk about the future, change by changing, take one step at a time and build on 21st century technology.","Strategic Design; Organisation Design; Progressive Organisations; Revolution; Organisational Revolution; Revolution Checklist; Organisational Blocks; Ambidexterity; Employee Engagement; Agility; Iteration","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

Aim: The goal of this study is to see whether two layered feed forward neural networks outperform the statistical ARIMA model in motorway traffic forecasting. In specific, whether or not the usage of upstream and multivariate data decreases the forecasting errors of the neural network, how this relates to the amount of samples used as input, and how this relates to the amount of time steps that is forecasted ahead. Results and conclusions: Two different traffic networks are used to train and test the models. The testing results show that, when doing predictions using time steps covering 10 minutes of traffic data and forecasting one time step ahead, the optimal amount of samples used as input is 4. Increasing the input length after this does not result in better predictions, it even slightly increases the prediction errors. Moreover, it became clear that up to 3 or 4 time steps forecasting in the future, the neural networks using upstream data outperform the ARIMA model. After this an ARIMA model that uses deseasonalized data or a neural network that uses deseasonalized data is a better option. There is always a two layered neural network that outperforms the ARIMA models. Furthermore, the usage of upstream data almost always decreases the prediction errors.

From the fixation-to-AOI mapped results we<br/>can learn what developers look at when developing unit tests.<br/>Results: Developers spend the majority of their fixation time,<br/>focusing on test cases (tc), followed by the production code (ic),<br/>which encompasses the method under testing, the auxiliary code<br/>and the code comments. Little time is spent fixating on the test<br/>results, but this could be explained by the test results being only<br/>the indication of feedback to a developer. When delving deeper in<br/>understanding on why written test cases might fail, a developer<br/>will look into the ic and tc areas again, as they provide the source<br/>to find that understanding. Conclusions: We investigated where<br/>developers spent their time while unit testing. From the results<br/>we can conclude that on average developers spent slightly more<br/>time fixating on the test code than on the production code. This<br/>could imply that writing test cases requires active understanding<br/>of the test case being written. The method used did not allow for<br/>reliably identification of AOI sequences.","testing; eye tracking","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science and Engineering","CSE3000 Research Project",""

Helwig, B.P. developed a new omnidirectional steerableneedle for this purpose. However, this needle is not yet ready forimplementation in the operation room (OR) because no clinical testing isperformed in vivo.

In order to examine the visibility of the steerable needle,an experimental study has been conducted. The steerable needle has a promisingvisibility in Polyvinyl alcohol and is expected to be well visible duringultrasound guided interventions. The developed needle guide tool is calledUShift and provides both the benefits of needle guided puncturing and free-handpuncturing. Which are for free-hand puncturing: freedom of movement of boththe probe and needle during puncturing and for needle guided puncturing:  a shorter procedure time, reduced needle manipulation and improvedneedle visualisation. A user test is performed to verify how the needle guide isperforming compared to the currently used needle guide while hypothetical usingthe Omnidirectional steerable needle. The difference between the two puncturetechniques is 0,9 seconds, the UShift is 23% faster. In conclusion, thisproject resulted in a novel needle guide tool that can be used in combinationwith the omnidirectional steerable needle during percutaneous interventions.The UShift has great benefits compared to currently used needle guides and istherefore stated as innovative.

Although, this does not match to the contemporary and constantly changing way of living and working. Moreover, it does not match with the evolving technology, economy and culture. Thus, buildings that cannot respond to the changing demand can easily get obsolete by being outdated, inefficient, unable to be reformed accordingly. Buildings’ obsolescence and vacancy is a quite common problem globally, that creates a lot of externalities in the built environment and in the quality of the daily life. A way to phase it, is be transforming the existing obsolete building stock to dynamic real estate objects that can adjust to the current and future demand. Thus, to enhance their future-proofness. This can happen by enabling design strategies which have the capacity to create adaptable transformation project. The aim of this research is to generate a framework that can be used in order to support the decision making and designing process of adaptability in real estate transformation projects.<br/><br/>Problem Statement: The main problem to be confronted is the real estate obsolescence as a result of buildings’ inefficiency. Usually the functional life-cycle of an asset is smaller that the structural and/or technical. Thus, when the building is not able to adjust to the changing demand it becomes obsolete, a situation that can create a variety of other problems. The research is focused on transformation projects. <br/>Methodology: The research aims at defining a solution for the problem and provide a practical tool to support this decision.

As a consequence, new and unknown challenges within the field of the built environment arise. Moreover, there are uncertainties within the behavioral responses of an ageing population and, among other things, the willingness and benefits to invest in a WELL certificate by an institutional investor and developer. There is a lack of extensive knowledge about the contribution of a WELL certificate to healthcare housing development. In this study, the relative preferences for a WELL certificate in healthcare housing were compared to an ageing population in Delft and The Hague. To establish this, a face-to-face interview in combination with a structured questionnaire was held. Based on the response of 23 respondents, the demographical, social (healthcare housing requirements and preferences) and economical dissimilarities are evaluated. Moreover, the preference for a WELL certificate is also estimated by the institutional investors. To establish this, also a face-to-face interview in combination with a questionnaire was held. Based on the response of 4 respondents, the interest to invest in healthcare housing, the healthcare housing requirements, the financial components and the interest in a WELL certificate are evaluated. At this moment it can be argued that the WELL v2 certificate creates more advantages than disadvantages for the different stakeholders during both the development and exploration phase in healthcare housing. On the other hand, based on the estimated results, it can be concluded that more recognition must arise about a WELL certificate by both the ageing population and institutional investor. The results show that there are differences regarding the preference for a WELL certificate between the ageing population and institutional investors. The ageing population with a higher education level, who exercise more than three times a week, who have a healthy eating pattern and who are more satisfied with the quality of their appartement, apartment complex and neighborhood are found to receive less utility for a WELL certificate. This effect is strong for both men and women. The higher educated ageing population living in social rental housing share this idea compared to the lower educated ageing population in social rental housing. The majority of the ageing population prefer a few WELL concepts, in particular the lower educated ageing population. Moreover, institutional investors claims that investing in healthcare housing is less risky compared to offices and regular housing developments. Nevertheless, not enough healthcare homes have been realized yet. Besides this, the institutional investors argue that a WELL certificate in healthcare housing does not improve the GRESB score. This argument is strong for all institutional investors: no distinction regarding professional position. Furthermore, institutional investors show a higher preference to implement all WELL concepts in contrast to the ageing population. The result shows more preference for a certificate: investors are eager when a certificate can be obtained. The estimation of the results increases the understanding of stated preferences of a few WELL concepts in healthcare housing development. To conclude, from a scientific perspective, this research contribute to the understanding of institutional investor and an ageing population choice behavior regarding WELL certificate in healthcare housing. In addition, it contribute to a potential ex-post study of an ageing population living in healthcare housing. Besides the scientific perspective, this research also contribute to the practical relevance were the behavior of two different social groups within the ageing population will be investigated regarding the social rental, free rental and owner-occupant sector. Additionally, this research contribute to the understanding of the current preferences for a WELL certificate complementing healthcare housing without a WELL certificate.","WELL certificate; healthcare housing development; ageing population; institutional investor; real estate developer","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(mentor); Remøy, Hilde (graduation committee); Kleinhans, R.J. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","Urbanisation is a global trend that continues to occur as the percentage will rise up for 55% to 68% in 2050 (United Nations, 2018). This movement of society towards the urban environment is clearly evident in the Netherlands too, particularly in the country’s four major cities: Amsterdam, Rotterdam, Utrecht and The Hague. Due to its increasing growth, one-thirds of the total Dutch population is expected to be living in these four major cities in 2030 (CBS &amp; PBL, 2016). Research, however, shows that the market currently takes up solely a quarter of the Dutch residential demands within the city centres (Verheul &amp; Daamen, 2017). This generates the need for cities to further develop their urban areas and therefore large transformation areas must be addressed (Brink, 2017). Taking into account the potential of brownfield sites in the Netherlands, these areas deserve attention and priority in the short and medium-long term. However, there is not enough knowledge available on operational level to stimulate their redevelopments. Iconic projects are often deliberately proposed by municipalities for their catalytic function, as they can generate economic and socio-cultural spillovers and could stimulate area redevelpoments (Doucet 2010; Verheul, 2013). Research into the influence of iconic projects has been done for years already, however insights into the particular conditions that have these catalysing spillover effects on surrounding developments are lacking. As a result, this research aims to gain better understanding about what conditions of iconic projects could incentivise developers to (re)develop in brownfield areas. The conditions of iconic projects that could generate these incentivising spillovers have been explored by doing three in-depth holistic case studies. Therefore, both retrospective and prospective case studies have been conducted on brownfield areas in Rotterdam. A ‘one of best practice’ case study has been selected for the retrospective case study (Case I: Wilhelminaper) to better understand the catalysing effects of iconic projects by initially reflecting on an already successfully redeveloped brownfield area. As sources of error due to confounding bias are common in retrospective case studies, the findings have been compared with case study findings from a current brownfield redevelopment (Case II: Katendrecht). As no successes have yet been achieved, the prospective case study (Case III: Merwe-Vierhavens) declares possible confounding or biases of the retrospective case study and has in particularly been used to draw an advice for future and contemporary brownfield redevelopments. After conducting document studies on the brownfields redevelopments and semi-structured interviews with project developers and managers active in the case study areas, incentivising conditions could be identified. All pre-defined conditions of iconic projects have incentivised real estate developers and thus all pre-defined conditions contribute to catalysing surrounding developments. However, all to a certain degree. The functional and sociocultural characteristics of iconic projects are most important incentivising conditions for surrounding (re)developments. These are followed by the location and image of the iconic projects, that to a certain degree have incentivised (re)developments too. Least incentivising conditions of iconic projects are the development process, scale, fame of the architect and the physical characteristics of the iconic project. As the uniqueness and innovativeness of the iconic projects in the case studies have derived from the other conditions, these are not explicitly appointed an incentivising condition, which nevertheless does not mean that they could not incentivise (re)developments. The conclusions must however be nuanced. One should consider the fact that each brownfield has different interests as well as other concerns. As a consequence, the aforementioned conclusions can not be provided through a concrete list of preconditions necessary for iconic projects to successfully catalyse brownfield redevelopments.Regarding the renewal of Katendrecht, a note must be made with regard to the extent to which single iconic projects have catalysed surrounding (re)developments. Prior to the iconic developments, the municipality of Rotterdam, Woonstad Rotterdam and Proper Stok/Heijmans actually laid the foundation for these developments. Even in difficult and uncertain economic times, these parties have continued to the commitment to revitalise Katendrecht. This consequently enabled the development of iconic projects, which again catalysed further developments.Regarding the redevelopment of the Wilhelminapier, it must be noted that many government investments preceded and only later, private investments followed. As a consequence, it is clear that certain conditions of iconic projects indeed catalysed surrounding developments, however it is unsure it these projects would have been developed and thus functioned as catalysers too without the preceded public investments. These public investments, however, have been a very strategic move as they have started mutual reinforcement.In other words, the one project development functioned as a catalyst again for the next one. Actually all projects thus have had a catalysing effect on the surrounding developments in their own way. Insights in the conditions that contribute to incentivising real estate developers to develop, offer municipalities better perspective on design principles and governance models that could be strategically deployed when tackling brownfield redevelopments. Through finding the conditions that could incentivise developers, the first preliminary steps in the direction of meeting the short to medium-long term residential demand in urbanised areas can be set in stone.","Iconic projects; Brownfield redevelopment; Spillover effects; Real estate developers; Development incentives; Catalysing developments; Flagship projects","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Management in the Built Environment","",""

Obsolescence of buildings causes financial, social and environmental problems for owners, users, municipalities and society. As most office buildings are located in monofunctional urban areas, the problem of obsolescence becomes a structural one on an area level and solutions on a building level are insufficient. This requires a generic solution by transforming the area into a mixed-use location which is more liveable, self-sufficient and future-proof. Urban area transformation is a highly complex process that involves multiple actors, multiple projects and specific risks. This research aims to identify and analyse inherent risks in addition with factors that promote success. The research design is qualitative, based on case studies, semi-structured expert interviews and a questionnaire. The first outcome is an extended risk register that is combined with a success factor register, which increases awareness and can be used as a checklist to manage risks and achieve success factors. Secondly, a framework is designed that can be applied as a tool to manage risks and success factors within the process of transforming urban areas. Finally, general advice is given in form of developers and policy recommendations. Those outcomes help professionals in the field to reduce uncertainty and to successfully transform urban areas, and thus fight obsolescence.","monofunctional office area; obsolescence; structural office vacancy; urban area development; area transformation process; mixed-use area","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The scarcity of resources and constantly growing demand, makes it important to have a well thought of and sustainable method. Circular economy being proposed globally implied indefinite cycles of material usage. This translates in the construction sector as maximum reuse of material in different forms to reduce resource wastage. Objective- The research aims to validate whether circular transformation of existing built stock could address the growing housing needs of the Dutch real estate market. The research extends to develop a roadmap which would help the investors validate the feasibility of moving in this direction. Research Question- How would it be feasible for to invest in circular transformation for a future proof-built environment &amp; what would be the roadmap for it? Methodology- This research will be conducted using a hybrid method. Adopting both the empirical and operational method to understand, evaluate existing data and create a new structure for the construction sector. The process consists of an empirical literature study on the existing ways of working and the concept of circular economy and its implications in the built environment. An explorative study on the aspirations and extent of application and other related to the topic with different investment advisors was conducted. The gap in literature and the practical knowledge would be bridged through this research. Understanding the existing barriers in making this sustainable transformation and aim at finding solutions by revising the role of the stakeholders involved. Operationalize their expectations in a model to achieve the maximum return by investing within this new organizational framework. Analyse the cost of investment and the added value through environmental, socio-economics and financial returns in investment.

Validate the working of the model in the pilot project of the MOR team. Results- The circular transformation of underperforming office buildings is made by considering strategies such as Resource Recovery, Product Life Extension, Sharing Platform, Product as a service, Circular Supplies (Accenture, Lacy, 2014). The proposed organisation structure demonstrates a process and fully functioning business model the building owner would have to follow in order to conduct a circular transformation. Assumptions regarding the required infrastructure to support the transition have been made. The roles and relationships shared by different stakeholders have also been developed. The result demonstrates the financial, environmental and social viability in making this transition. Showcasing a feasible outcome specifically for building owners in moving towards circular transformation. Conclusions- Moving towards circularity will not only have environmental but also social and financial benefits. Using existing under performing building stock strengthens the outcome with an overall better performance. Making it the most sustainable way to address the needs of the future. The implementation of circular business strategies helps make the investment feasible for all the stakeholders by maximizing transparency and profit sharing. In this study it has been demonstrated to be feasible for building owners. Scenarios demonstating the feasibility in different situations helps develop a possible roadmap towards circularity through transformation of existing built stock.

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","The built environment consumes almost 40% of the overall energy consumption. Energy is often produced from the conversion of fossil fuels, which result in CO2 emissions, which in turn cause global warming. Therefore, adaptation of buildings towards less energy use is required to mitigate the effects of global warming. Since the adaptation of existing buildings could play a large role in achieving the climate goals, policies are made in order to stimulate these adaptations. The ‘Energy Performance of Building Directive’ promotes the adaptation of all existing buildings towards nearly zero-energy buildings (NZEB). Currently, offices need to have at least an energy label C by 2023. It is expected that this will increase to label A in 2030 and finally NZEB in 2050. However, the current adaptation rates are too low to achieve NZEB buildings in 2050. Besides, the step-by-step approach from label C to A to NZEB leads to even more pressure to the adaptation sector. If these multiple steps could be skipped, adaptations could be executed more efficient, which reduces costs and time. It could be questioned whether the current policy approach is sufficient to achieve nearly zero-energy offices on time. Therefore, this research will test an alternative policy of going directly towards NZEB, starting from existing offices with a current energy label G. The research question is as follows: What are the technical, financial, environmental and social implications of the proposed policy requirement of NZEB adaptation of office buildings with a current energy label G? <br/>To answer the main research question, the following four themes are explored: office stock, energy policies, building adaptation and office owners. To explore the four themes, different methods and techniques are used. The different methods and techniques are framed within an experimental research design. <br/>The results suggest that technically, the adaptation from label G to NZEB is possible. Financially, the adaptation results in the need for big investment ranging from €353/m2 to €414/m2 and payback period of more than 20 years. Environmentally, the NZEB adaptation results in 3.1 PJ energy savings and 0.6 - 0.7 CO2 emission reductions. Socially, the adaptation results in nuisance for the office owners, since they have to demolish, sell or leave their building vacant. <br/>It can be concluded that the proposed adaptation policy will not lead to the desired effect of nearly zero-energy office buildings because the office owners do not choose to adapt their building but prefer to leave the building vacant or even demolish it. The direct NZEB adaptation requires temporary accommodation and major investments. A large part of the offices will become vacant or demolished, since the adaptation costs are too high compared to the rent values. However, for offices located on locations with high rent levels, the direct NZEB adaptation is more likely to be feasible. Especially, when technical opportunities arise, such as a nearby data center, which can be used for heat waste. Nevertheless, these findings suggest that lots of office owners will not be able to adapt their offices directly towards NZEB. Therefore, it is not possible to generalize such a regulative policy for all offices. However, some recommendations for policy makers are made. First of all, involve stakeholders when evaluating policies. Also, focus on the continuation of rent income during policy evaluations. Moreover, municipalities can already start creating visions for the future of office locations and to achieve NZEB office buildings it is recommended to make use of other policy tools at a differentiated approach. <br","NZEB; Offices; Ofice adaptation; Ofice policies; Energy labels; Building policies","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The goal of the research is to study developer behavior regarding height premiums in residential tall buildings. Literature offers little knowledge on developers’ behavior when it comes to height premiums in the residential sector. Previous findings on the demand side of height premiums indicate that willingness to pay for height benefits depends user preferences, but all signal that higher floors offer characteristics that can be priced by developers. Contextually relevant height benefits in the residential sector are categorized as views and perception of social power. This research employs data from fifteen residential tall buildings in Rotterdam and analyzes the relation between developer unit prices, floor levels and height benefits. Results display a 0.5% increase in developer unit prices per floor level, ceteris paribus. However, a deeper analysis shows that height premiums display inter-building and intra-building differences, which is interpreted as evidence for heterogenous vertical price premium behavior amongst developers. The floor level premiums were found to be substantially impacted by height-induced view effects. The results further show that developers place a price on status aspects related to height.

(mentor); de Jong, P. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","This research aims to investigate the height pattern and height determinant factors of Chinese skyscrapers. A skyscraper is a habitable structure that is taller than 150 meters, with more than 50 percent of the space occupiable (CTBUH, 2019). It is a widely used building typology around the world, especially in countries and areas with rapid economic growth. This is due to the ability of skyscrapers to accommodate a large amount of the population and activities in a single location, where it is also an efficient building design for areas with high demand in land, and locations with high land prices. Building tall is one of the characteristics of a skyscraper, and Height could be used as a tool to allocate city population and improve city efficiency. Thus Skyscraper distribution and height pattern is important to understand for city development.<br/><br/>In general, from the results, one infers that building height does not have a significant relationship with city-level height determinants. Looking into the height distribution around the country, skyscrapers in China mostly cluster around 200 meters, this, on one hand, shows that “building higher” is not the main focus regarding most of the construction in China. On the other hand, it also shows that lands in the urban area are not used efficiently. This is also proven by a wide range of height and the expansion of cities in China. According to the theory stated in the literature review, skyscrapers are first designed to provide more space in a location due to high land prices and a limited amount of land, but China has large amounts of empty land around. This may be the reason why there are more skyscraper development projects that stay around 200 meters. <br/><br/>Some of the results in this research show similarity to previous research, including the connection between skyscraper development and economic situation; there are also results that contradict the previous research results, including height competition and location-specific factors. This shows that skyscraper development in each country could be different due to many reasons. Some Specific characteristic could largely influence the construction pattern. Also, skyscraper development connects with height and also the number of buildings. This research focuses on height, the results derived also from the perspective of height, so more studies could be done on the connection between the amount of skyscraper and height.","Skyscraper; Height; Height Pattern; Determinant of Height; China","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","",""

Moreover, current renewable technologies such as wind or solar energy only cover the electricity market. A big part of the global energy market is still based on fossil fuels and difficult to electrify. Hence, there is an urgent need to produce renewable liquid hydrocarbons to replace fossil fuels. Zero Emission Fuels (ZEF) is a start-up that aims to develop a small-scale chemical plant to convert carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O) from the air into methanol (MeOH) using photovoltaic energy. In this work, the absorption of CO2 using bulk polyamines was characterized experimentally, as well as through numerical modelling. In addition to this, guidelines for the design of the absorber, part of the Direct Air Capture (DAC) unit of ZEF’s micro-plant, are given. The focus of the study is placed on the kinetics and loading of CO2. To be able to model the absorption process an experimental approach has been developed regarding the uptake of CO2 and H2O. Firstly, pure H2O absorption experiments were performed in a climate chamber in order to obtain the H2O loadings using polyamines for different H2O content in the air. Secondly, air capture experiments were performed at lab conditions in order to obtain both H2O and CO2 loadings for different process conditions. Thirdly, constants relevant for the modelling part (reaction rate constant and Henry constant) were obtained experimentally. An absorption model, developed in MATLAB, was used to estimate the diffusion coefficient of both H2O and CO2 using the experimental H2O and CO2 loadings.<br/> Two main conclusions are obtained from the absorption model of CO2: the absorption of CO2 on polyamines is diffusion-limited and the diffusion coefficient of CO2 is two orders of magnitude lower than the diffusion coefficient of H2O. Based on the fact that the CO2 absorption process is diffusion-limited the mixing patterns should be introduced in the design of the continuous absorber. However, due to the fact that viscosity could influence the flowing behaviour of polyamines, more research is needed.","Direct air capture; CO2 capture; Amine","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-12-31","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","Signal transduction is a rudimentary and specific way of communication in cells, in which a signal triggers a specific response. However, mimicking these processes in organic materials has been a major challenge. Although, some organocatalysts have been shown to be responsive to specific signals, only limited research has been done using organocatalysis in biological systems. A potentially bio-compatible organocatalytic reaction is the DABCO catalysed nucleophilic substitution reaction of a vinylphosphonate with N- and S- terminal nucleophiles. To evaluate the bio-compatibility of the catalytic reaction, this study focused on the preparation of a catalytic active profluorophore. Hereby, the profluorophore becomes active (fluorescent) upon catalysis in the presence of cells. To do so, 7-amino-4-methyl-3-coumarinylacetic acid and 7-amino-1-methylquinolin-1-ium will be synthetically quenched by acetyl amide formation and are thereafter linked to the catalytic active component (3-hydroxyprop-1-en-2-ylphosphonate). Signals, such as amides and thiols can be used to trigger the reaction and hence releasing the quenched fluorophore. <br/><br/>7-amino-4-methyl-3-coumarinylacetic acid was successfully quenched using ethyl chloroformate, however transesterification of the catalytic active compound could not be achieved at various conditions. 7-amino-1-methylquinolin-1-ium was synthesised according to literature and compared to a reference, confirming the compound. Many attempts have been undertaken to further modify the fluorophore with the catalytic compound. Unfortunately, non of the proposed synthetic pathways, such as quenching with ethyl chloroformate, resulted in the envisioned product. Based on the obtained results, it is recommended to explore other synthetic strategies such as the usage of disuccinimidyl carbonate to quench the fluorophores.","","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Physics","",""

(mentor); de Wit, L.M.M. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","Slum population has increased continuously in global south. It expands onto precarious land such as floodplains, lagoon areas and so on leading to deficiency of basic facilities. Bandung is the third most populous city in Indonesia with around 26,000 slum dwellings. Kampung Tamansari in Bandung is the densest informal settlement located along the Cikapundung river. During the Dutch colonial era, this area was meant to be a part of the green corridor under the Garden city scheme. However, the concrete mass now uprooted the green. However, since the area is located at lower level than planned area, it is hard to expand existing infrastructure into the area. Lack of infrastructure in informal settlements and densification have led to the environmental degradation and have disconnected people from nature. Treating the river as an open sewage, people directly discharge their waste into it. Clogged ditches with garbage as well as cemented pavements which restrains water from going into the soil results in flash floods. Therefore, nature and human activities enter a vicious cycle which requires the redefinition of this relationship. This research aims to reconnect people and nature by improving their living quality through ecosystem service. It is based on two main research fields. First, Ecopolis gives a structure to create self-governing ecologically sustainable city. Tjallingi’s Ecopolis strategy helps to look into the site based on three different perspectives: area, flow and participation. Kampung Naga is used as a case study to understand how Indonesian cultural landscape creates a circular water system. Next, Kampung Tamansari is used as a showcase to explore how the ecopolis strategy can be applied into the context of a developing country. It shows how people can change their recognition of the potential of nature and how can their activities positively influence in nature in a long-term. The design strategy starts from place making for green spaces. Relocation is considered in this stage. Relocating houses are arranged in North Kampung as creating three types of enclosures (enclosure, semi-enclosure, expanded semi-enclosure). Each enclosures are transformed into different green patches to serve different ecosystem service and make people responsible to maintain the spaces. Green patches consist of kitchen garden, pit-forest and riverfront park. Kitchen garden is built in enclosure space which offers basic facilities using dry-toilet module which can recycle human faeces, generate electricity and store rain water. It lets people create their own kitchen garden to overcome food insecurity. Pit-forest is permaculture system using plant-based ecosystem service combined with organic waste management. River front park is the most open space which connects people to the river. Furthermore, it shows users visible circular water system. On the other hand, these three green patches work together as one stormwater management system. It links each other and create complementary network. Moreover, it transforms current highly linear water flow into circular water flow. This green patch strategy can be applied to other informal settlements in the similar contexts. When it is replicated, it will not only build rich ecosystem service in the informal settlement but also create mosaic garden city, Bandung in a city scale.","Ecosystem Services; Informal Settlement; sustainability; Urban metabolism; Ecopolis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Landscape Architecture","Flowscapes Studio","-6.898526, 107.605486"

The analysis showed that wave directional spread influences the wave runup by affecting the wave setup and low frequency runup. So, for the most accurate runup predictions it is advised to include directional spreading in the analysis. Furthermore, the complete exclusion of directional spreading in the runup analysis will lead to an over prediction of the runup, so current 1D models give conservative estimations of the runup. Lastly, it was found that the exact wave directional spread is not that important but it is advised to obtain information about the wave field that is dealt with and take that into account in the runup analysis.","Coral reef coastlines; Wave runup; Wave directional spread; XBeach; Wave modeling; Non Hydrostatic; Reef hydrodynamics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The current linear take-make-dispose economy results in waste, exhaustion of finite natural resources and environmental degradation. A circular economy is one way to cope with these trends. This type of economy is based on closed material cycles, renewable energy and system thinking. For the building industry, recycling of materials and reuse of products are most relevant. Reuse of products is preferred because it requires less material and energy than recycling. Reuse is facilitated by flexibility. Forms of flexibility are versatility, changeability and expandability. For building foundations, versatility and changeability are distinguished. Expandability should be incorporated in both. Within the circular economy, many design methods have been developed. The tools Design for Disassembly and Design for Adaptability help to design buildings for changeability and versatility, respectively. Corresponding assessment methods have been developed. An easy-to-use method suitable for the assessment of building foundations was sought and found: Alba Concept. <br/><br/>Four foundation variants were defined by combining deep and shallow foundations with versatility and changeability. Based on the soil condition, loads, future scenario, function and desired level of flexibility, the foundation type can be determined. Hereafter, a design guideline can be followed, considering material, dimension, load bearing capacity, connection and transportation. One should strive for longevity, standardization and uniformity at the material, element and system levels, respectively. Because the assessment method of Alba Concepts focuses on changeability and buildings in general, it was modified. This method focuses on circular foundations in particular and values changeable and versatile designs. <br/><br/>To determine whether the theoretical concept of circular foundations leads to foundations that are more circular than the traditional ones, two case studies were conducted. The considered buildings required a deep and shallow foundation. For both projects, a changeable and versatile foundation was designed. All foundations were assessed by the Alba Concepts’ method and the alternative method. Independent of the assessment method, the traditional foundations have a low level of circularity. Because Alba Concepts focuses on changeability, the versatile and changeable foundations obtained a low and high score, respectively. Based on the alternative method, all circular foundations obtained a high level of circularity. <br/><br/>Finally, the structural similarities, differences, challenges, preconditions and feasibility are discussed. A versatile foundation appeared to be similar to a traditional one. Differences and challenges arise in case of changeable foundations. For example, the standards of dimensions and connections must be determined. Despite the disassembly, the strength, stiffness and stability must be maintained. Also, the reusability of foundation piles can be improved. More generally, finding a balance between uniformity and freedom of form is both important and challenging. Circular foundations require precise documentation of characteristics and availability. <br/><br/>Altogether, the traditional foundation can be more circular with some achievable changes. Regardless of the building, adding a certain degree of circular value to the foundation is always possible but requires willingness and innovative thinking. This cultural change is not simple, but it will be beneficial.<br","Circulair economy; Building; Foundation; Versatility; Changeability; Design tool; Assessment method","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Building Engineering","",""

Although a breakwater armour layer with Xbloc<sup>Plus</sup> combines material saving and easy placement with increased stability, the transition between the armour layer and the crest is not adequately stable. The Xbloc<sup>Plus</sup> units of the top armour row (crest units) become easily displaced. In this research, several solutions to this problem are investigated through physical modelling, in order to determine the best one. Firstly, tests are performed on a breakwater with single, Xbloc<sup>Plus</sup> crest elements without rear support, in order to determine the most important parameters and mechanisms contributing to failure. The criterion for initiation of failure for the top armour row is 10%, so when 1 of the 10 crest units fails. Failure of a unit is defined as the condition where contact with the units of the row underneath is lost under at least one of the two wings. During wave run-up, under the forces resulting from the wave velocities, the Xbloc<sup>Plus</sup> crest units initially rotate and, subsequently, make a combined motion consisting of rotation, vertical and horizontal translation. The main parameters of influence to this movement are the crest freeboard (R<sub>c</sub>/D<sub>n</sub>) and wave steepness (sop): for R<sub>c</sub>/D<sub>n</sub>≥1.7, stability increases for increasing R<sub>c</sub>/D<sub>n</sub> and for increasing sop (from 2% to 4%). For zero freeboard, wave impact forces at breaking proved to be an important mechanism in the case of s<sub>op</sub>=4%, where collapsing breakers occurred. Failure and partial displacement were initiated at stability numbers (N<sub>s</sub>=H<sub>s</sub>/(ΔD<sub>n</sub>)) of 1.39 and 0.74, respectively, for R<sub>c</sub>/D<sub>n</sub>≤1.7, which are much lower than the stability number for displacement of the armour layer (N<sub>s</sub>&gt;3.88). A second set of tests was conducted, in order to investigate a way of optimising the stability of the transition area between the armour layer and the crest. Under the most critical conditions of the first tests, 7 crest configurations, based on their potential ability to resist the failure mechanisms, were investigated: 2 orientations of the Xbloc+ crest units (with the tail or nose tilted upwards), 2 different ways of placement of Xbloc at the crest, placement of Xbloc with a concrete crown wall element, underlayer rock material at the crest and underlayer rock material with a concrete crown wall element. From the above “trial and error” approach, it was concluded that the most effective way of increasing stability (optimised configuration) is the provision of a backwards support, which fulfils the criteria of no erosion and no uplift and resists rotation by bringing the rotation point of the Xbloc+ crest elements further to the back. The form of this concept tested was the placement of underlayer material between the Xbloc+ crest units and under their tails and a concrete element behind, which functions as backwards support to prevent erosion of the rock fill. No displacement of the Xbloc+ crest elements occurred for R<sub>c</sub>/D<sub>n</sub>≤1.7, 2%≤s<sub>op</sub>≤4% and no failure happened for R<sub>c</sub>/D<sub>n</sub>=0, s<sub>op</sub>=4% for a stability number up to 3.55. Rocking was decreased to zero. Failure and rocking of 10% happened only at the case of R<sub>c</sub>/D<sub>n</sub>=1.7, s<sub>op</sub>=2% for N<sub>s</sub>≥2.78, due to the erosion of the fill, resulting from the uplift of the supporting crest element, with the final damage (at N<sub>s</sub>=3.49) being repairable and limited at the 4 upper rows of the breakwater.","Breakwater; Xbloc+; XblocPlus; Crest; Armour Unit; Stability; Physical modelling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

People are moving as fast as possible to get from one place to the other. We often forget to really look and be aware of our surroundings. I believe that some parts of the city should be dedicated to a more slower, more enjoyable, experimental way of moving through and being in the city. Within this thesis, the decision is made to intervene in an extremely sensitive and politically charged point in the urban context of Bogota. Not by traditionally transforming it by giving it back its original function, or by simply demolishing it, but by introducing an alternative way of transformation; namely transformation by ruination. This is inspired by Guillaume Apollinaire who says: ​“To prepare for ivy and passing time, a ruin more beautiful than any other.” Ruinating one part of the building creates opportunities for a biotope and gives the importance of time and imagination a place in the city. Besides that, I am also introducing basic and minimal architectonic elements to create a public space which connects the ruin to the river on the site. I have decided to only introduce platforms, plazas, and plateaus. By these 4 interventions, the area becomes an articulator of public and natural resources of the city. By being guided by genuine curiosity and evolved through multiple instances of trial and error, I have created a project that is elegant and provides clarity. Besides that, this project reflects upon the collective nature of architecture (e.g., architects layering their work on top of their predecessors), the acknowledgment of decay and destruction as necessary complements to creation and construction, and the possibility of developing serious, rigorous work with simplicity and happiness. This project is inspired by and operates at the work of Rogelio Salmona. The inspiration and underlaying guiding theme can be perfectly explained by an excerpt of a speech he gave at the Alvaro Alto Award: ""…between the “elephant” and the “butterfly”; between the permanent and the ephemeral, there is a relationship that we cannot ignore, for it would mean sacrificing the enormous importance of diversity. ....

Some of these investigations are focused on the heat flux to the chamber walls, changes in which can cause a significant shift in chamber wall strength and even melting, and can thus lead to structural failures. As a continuation of research regarding this phenomenon, the DLR combustion chamber version D (BKD) is used to investigate changes in heat flux, and its test data have been made available for this research. Using the test data, finding a relation between measured steady state heat flux and controlled chamber conditions became feasible, and changes in heat flux related to combustion instabilities can be identified. However, although these changes in heat flux are often observed and are described in literature as a known effect of combustion instabilities, there are currently no validated explanations as to why these effects take place. In an effort to provide this explanation, the results of a previously completed investigation regarding the DLR combustion chamber version H (BKH) are evaluated, as they allowed determination of a relation between combustion length and magnitudes of acoustic pressure oscillations. In this research, the results obtained for combustion length are converted to a model regarding varying heat flux profiles and modified as to implement them for BKD. Finally, the model predicted increases in heat flux during time periods when increases are observed experimentally, showing agreement with the experimental data. Besides this, a conversion in the model allowed reconstruction of a localised heat flux profile, which showed an increase in local heat flux near the injector face plate. This matches effects described in literature and observed in the experimental set-up after a test run with combustion instabilities. With this validation of the model, the theory developed and tested in this thesis work could prove a significant advancement in the understanding of effects of combustion chamber instabilities and their impact on the engine integrity and performance.","Rocket propulsion; Combustion Instability; Heat Transfer; DLR; Space","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

The result is a platform that supports digitals in giving direction to their learning practices, resulting in purposeful development.The world is moving fast. Technologies are disrupting and customer needs are continuously changing. Companies must adapt to these developments and so do their employees. To gain competitive advantage, companies aim to establish a strong learning culture. However, building a learning culture is a complex undertaking. Theories on organizational learning and the learning organization contribute to solve the puzzle from an organizational perspective. In this study a different approach is taken by focusing on the individual employee.The employees that are targeted in this study are the digitals at KLM. These digitals experience a need for growth in their professional role and their personal competence. However, currently their learning is reactive and driven by incidental opportunities. A structural and purposeful approach to learning is lacking. Based on extensive literature review and practical research, a structural and purposeful approach to learning is proposed. The emphasis in this approach is on the development of learning ambitions to give direction to a purposeful and self-driven learning process. These learning ambitions are developed through a human-centered process. In this process digitals draw from their individual interests and competences and relate those to the work environment to shape learning ambitions. In this way the development of employees is driven by their strengths to exploit their full potential for company value. A platform has been designed to support digitals to guide and support digitals throughout this process. The platform entails three applications: a personal library, an ambition tool and a learner network. The personal library is a tool for storing and retrieving all your interesting content and evaluations. From the overview of contents and evaluations, digitals can derive their interests and competences.In the ambition tool these interests and competences are related to developments in the work environment to shape learning ambitions. For each learning ambition personal user stories are defined that can be integrated in a personal sprint planning to achieve integration in the work routine. The tool guides employees through the process and supports them along the way.A learner network connects digitals to inspire and sharpen each other’s thinking and collaborate to realize their ambitions. In this way the knowledge and diversity of perspectives that are already present in the company are leveraged.Through the designed platform digitals are empowered to be in the driving seat of their own development. They are provided with a solution that helps giving direction to their development. This results in purposeful learning. Moreover, through integration of learning in the work routine it becomes part of the job. For the L&amp;D department, the platform shows a new approach on how development can be supported. Through focusing on the process rather than the content employees can be supported in their informal learning. Moreover, the focus is shifted from the actualization of learning ambitions to the development of learning ambtions. This shift in perspective generates a spectrum of new opportunities for solutions the L&amp;D department can provide.Also, the platform contributes to an aspired mindset change. This mindset change implies that learners are not passive recipients of learning provided by the L&amp;D department, but are active owners of their own learning.In conclusion, this study shows a new direction on how learning can be supported by the Learning &amp; Development department of KLM. Within this new direction a platform is designed that supports digitals in self-driven and purposeful personal development.","Purposeful; Informal Learning; Learning Ambitions; Learning Process; Learning Culture","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

One of the ways to acquire such models derives from the combination of massive point clouds with reconstruction techniques, such as Ball Pivoting and Poisson Reconstruction. The result of these techniques is the representation of individual buildings or entire urban scenes in the form of surface meshes — data structures consisting of vertices, edges and faces. Despite their usefulness for visualization purposes, the high complexity of these meshes, along with various geometric and topological flaws, stands as an obstacle to their usage in further applications, such as simulations and urban planning. To address the issue of complexity, the production of lightweight building meshes can be achieved through mesh simplification, which reduces the amount of faces used in the original representations. Moreover, simplification methods focus on conforming the resulting mesh to the original one, in order to minimize the differences between the two of them. As a consequence, simple and accurate building models are possible to be acquired, whose geometric and topological validity is yet questionable. In this thesis, we introduce a novel approach for the simplification of building models, which results into a more compact representation, free of topological defects. The main characteristic of our method is structure awareness — namely, the recovery and preservation, for the input mesh, of both its primitives and the interrelationships between them (their configuration in 3D space). This awareness asserts that the resulting mesh closely follows the original and at the same time, dictates the geometric operations needed for its construction in the first place — thus providing accuracy, along with computational efficiency. Our proposed methodology is divided into three main stages: (a) primitive detection via mesh segmentation, (b) storage of primitive interrelationships in a structure graph and (c) simplification. In particular, simplification is accomplished here by approximating the primitive borders with a building scaffold, out of which a set of candidate faces is defined. The selection of faces from the candidate set to form the simplified mesh is achieved through the formulation of a linear binary programming problem, along with certain hard constraints to ensure that this mesh is both manifold and watertight. Experimentation reveals that our simplification method is able to produce simpler representations for both closed and open building meshes, which highly conform to the initial structure and are ready to be used for spatial analysis. Additionally, a fairly good approximation of a given mesh is possible to be obtained within reasonable execution times, regardless of the initial noise level or topological invalidity. Finally, a comparative analysis shows that the accuracy of our method stands in parallel with that of other available simplification techniques.","MVS meshes; Structure Awareness; Simplification; Topological Validity","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geomatics","",""

One common requirement for these various applications is the geometrical and topological validity of these models. However, many models available online contain deficiencies in various forms, such as duplicated geometry, gaps in the surface, etc.. To cope with those deficiencies, a standard solution is the clean extraction of the model’s boundary, and simultaneously the model’s reconstruction in a way that its structure is valid. This thesis tackles a more generalized problem, the inside-outside classification for these models. Where many approaches might have requirements for running analysis, the methodology presented strives to robustly handle all cases. <br/>These last decades, there have been various approaches in solving the ”inside -<br/>outside classification problem”. A major attempt utilizes the winding number<br/>algorithm, in order to assign values to elements whose position is relevant to the<br/>input model. By assessing that value, a decision on whether the element in question is interior or exterior is taken. Other approaches work with casting rays, or other geometric analysis to also identify the borders of a model and segment the interior from the exterior. Also, since deficiencies inhibit the kick-starting of the necessary analysis, there are methods that try to restructure said models in order to clear any existing deficiencies. The methodology within this thesis will attempt a different approach from those that have been presented until now, which is transferring the problem from three into two dimensions. The first step is introducing a planar cross section on the area of interest. From there, through some graph reconstruction, geometric and optimization applications, a valid 1-manifold boundary of the cross-section is created. On that, the application of inside-outside classification through ray casting is possible. Assessing the results of the pipeline proves that the automated process can produce valid results, for a particular point of interest, related to an input model. The pipeline has been proven to function regardless of the cutting plane’s orientation, and can handle robustly a multitude of geometrically and topologically defective models. The results from this thesis can inspire further applications, and improvements on the pipeline can further evolve the quality of its outcome.","Inside; Outside; Classification; 3D; Model; 2D; Planes; Ray Casting","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geomatics","",""

Models of trees can be widely applied in various fields, for instance, landscape design, geo-simulation, environment modelling, and forestry inventories.

Existing studies on tree modelling from laser scanning data are vast. Nevertheless, some works don’t ensure sufficient modelling accuracy, while some other works are mainly rule-based and therefore highly depend on user interactions. In this thesis, we propose a novel method to accurately and automatically reconstruct tree branches from laser scanned points. We first employ the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) algorithm to extract an initial tree skeleton over the single tree point cloud, then simplify the skeleton through iterative removal of redundant components. A global-optimization approach is performed to fit a sequence of cylinders to approximate the geometry of the tree branches. The results show that our approach is adaptable to various trees with different data qualities. We also demonstrate both the topological fidelity and geometrical accuracy of our approach without significant user interactions. The resulted tree models can be further applied in the precise estimation of tree attributes, urban landscape visualization, etc.","laser scanning; point cloud; individual tree modelling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geomatics","",""

Leveraging data science and IT systems, Scenwise delivers products to institutions to facilitate efficient traffic management. In order to manage the highly complex network of infrastructure on the road network, traffic managers need to use and analyze data that is collected all across the network in order to support decision makers in management of this network. However, there is often a mismatch in expertise between traffic management experts and decision makers. Traffic management experts use highly technical visualization techniques that require significant background knowledge in the traffic management domain. In addition, the visualization techniques are spread out over a multitude of systems that do not work together. In order to bridge the knowledge gap, a product needs to be created that allows experts to extract and visualize relevant data using their traffic domain knowledge while providing intuitive and clear visualizations which are clear to both experts and non-experts. The ultimate goal of this product would be to facilitate efficient traffic management in order to improve the lives of commuters by contributing to a better organized infrastructure. Our project group has designed and implemented a product for Scenwise that offers this solution. A web-based application has been created that retrieves and stores traffic data. The product is able to traverse the road network and provide helpful insights into the traffic network’s state at either the present moment, or moments in history. The application is able to provide dynamic traffic contour plots, draw fundamental diagrams, show live traffic intensity over the entire Dutch road network and provide information related to traffic events like accidents and matrix sign states.

Said that, is it possible to pinpoint a frame of preconditions that are essential to any urban area development in order to be considered just? Is it just a Utopia or is it an ideal worth to strive for? In order to answer those questions, an ethical definition of such concepts needs to be researched and stated. The role of management in the built environment, urban planning, and design need to be defined as well, particularly with a transdisciplair approach. How does urban planning development affect the different actors that are going to use the area? What does it mean, considering the shaping of the urban in the future? <br/>The filer of the gap created by urban planning theory and reality becomes even more direct when talking about such a concrete base concept as justice (Young, 1990). Therefore, aim of this research is not to look-analyse but to listen-understand the specific Urban Area Development Project in order to understand the reasons behind the decisions making process, to unpack the aspirations of both policy makers and designers.

Municipal policymakers, housing associations and social professionals have expressed their concerns about increasing concentrations of vulnerable target groups and the negative impact on liveability (Uyterlinde &amp; van der Velden, 2017). Housing stock diversification is considered to be the most appropriate long-term strategy for coping with liveability problems that arise in vulnerable neighbourhoods, since diversification can dilute the problems and strengthens the mutual self-reliance and neighbourhood cohesion (Leidelmeijer et al., 2018). In practice, however, certain barriers to diversifying the housing stock in vulnerable neighbourhoods are identified. These barriers largely relate to the recognition that the force field has fundamentally changed over the past years.

Methods for regular file comparison are not straightforwardly applicable to spreadsheet files, because they are fundamentally different. Spreadsheets are binary files, the structure of spreadsheets is two-dimensional, they contain both data and calculations, and the content exists on different abstraction levels. Fundamental challenges in the spreadsheet comparison problem include: change propagation, performance, 2D alignment, the grouping of data, and movement detection. One simple modification can change the whole structure and model of the spreadsheet. The aim of a good file comparison method is to show the actual changes made by an end-user, not the propagated changes. In this thesis, a new pipeline-based approach for comparing two spreadsheet files is proposed. The spreadsheet comparison is solved in three phases: (1) structure analysis, (2) change detection, and (3) change aggregation. The essential element in this approach is passing on information from the structure analysis to the change detection. In addition, the detected changes are forwarded to the aggregation such that changes are converted into clear, understandable differences. The final comparison result, therefore, provides information at different levels of abstraction. New solutions like cell hashing, an optimized 2D alignment using longest common subsequences, and different algorithms for comparing worksheets, defined names, rows, columns and cells have resulted in a state-of-the-art spreadsheet comparison approach. In addition, this thesis presents a prototype demonstrating the proposed concepts in practice. This tool, called CompareXL, is a stand-alone application that can compare two spreadsheet files. The user interface is built with a multi-level interaction design, showing the comparison results intuitively to the end-user. Spreadsheets are commonly used and many problems arise from spreadsheet versioning issues. Spreadsheet users have user needs related to overview, validation, completeness, error resolving, visualization, and evolution. A spreadsheet comparison program is helpful to address these user needs. This research shows that it is beneficial to involve users in the exploration of solutions, because comparing spreadsheets is not only a technical problem but also a user problem. The outcome of this research offers multiple directions for future work, with the ultimate goal that all spreadsheet version problems will soon belong to the past.","spreadsheet comparison; spreadsheet versioning; spreadsheets; excel; file comparison; structure analysis; change detection; change aggregation; cell hashing; 2D alignment; longest common subsequence; multi-level interaction design; compare tool; CompareXL; Infotron","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-12-24","","","","Computer Science","",""

Its main population growth, at various points throughout its history, occurred primarily through migration. It was a popular place for people fleeing poverty, war and religious prosecution, as well as an attractive place for work and aspiration. ‘Floating populations’ or seasonal migrants existed as early as the 19th century. Rural families throughout India are struggling to make ends meet with agriculture alone, especially with the rising costs of seeds as well as the need for home upgrading and schooling for their children. In order to manage these added costs and gain some economic stability, these families diversify their economic activities by sending members to work in the city. Young men and women travel to the city, in search of temporary work, only to go back 6-10 months later for the harvesting season. They continue this circular migration pattern for years on end, sending money back to the village each month. Eventually, some will choose to join the 100,000 people who settle in the city, buying into the promises of freedom and prosperity. The challenges faced by seasonal migrants moving to the big city are many; low-paying, hazardous work, poor access to health care, lack of education &amp; formal skills, no protection of the law and inadequate housing. At the root of these challenges are the three key factors: lack of education, lack of citizenship, and lack of home (ownership). The home is one crucial element of emancipation for these migrants. This leads to the question: How can a development that integrates flexible accommodation into the existing lower-middle class fabric accommodate the needs and aspirations of seasonal migrants while helping them transition to life in the city? The exploration of this question was instrumental in understanding the plight that seasonal migrants face and helped shape the resulting design project. The project succeeds in housing over a thousand migrants in Nalasopara West. In addition to providing housing, it aims at maintaining affordability for the groups involved and proposes a new, society-led scheme that no longer suffers from developer greed and market trends. The proposed solution is one that can be implemented across India, and one that should serve as a solid stepping stone in starting the discussion around housing temporary migrants and the benefits that this could bring.","Affordable Housing; migration; India; Mumbai; Mixed-Use; Global South","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","",""

The continuous struggle between cities and nature, forces human settlements to look for stability and safety, trying to control the dynamics and flows of underlying landscapes. In Chile, this tension is present in many urban settlements trying to deal with the natural dynamics. Chile, as a territory, is exposed to multiple dynamic natural forces such as the Pacific. With a coast line of 6.435 km, that is defined by the collision of two tectonic plates in constant movement, this regularly triggers a series of natural disasters that affect cities in different ways and degrees in the country. Concepción has been affected severely during the last two decades. Concepción is a coastal urban area that has grown into the flood plain of two river mouths and an ecological important tidal coastal wetland landscape. Although Concepción is built in a wet soil, city and water never meet; there is a dissociation where one is superimposed on the other. Furthermore, the whole system is increasingly at risk due to the urban pressure of the expanding city, resulting in degradation of ecosystems and natural infrastructure and with that exposing the coastal city to even more frequent and severe natural hazards. The key opportunity to face the existing challenges does not lie in the primacy of one system upon the other. Both, city and landscape need to interact in a more redefined way, looking for multifunctional structures and a new awareness of the importance of the presently disrupted landscape. What is a new resilient urban landscape backbone? The following research resulted in a void adaptive network based on design principles: 1.Value the natural system as the base infrastructure for the future city. 2. Use of voids (unplanned spaces) as an emergent, autonomous and self-organized network to create redundancy and multifunctional spaces for risk management. 3. Reformulate the city as a provider of nature: larger green spaces, landscape connectivity and protection of the ecological values of the existing nature. Applying these steps lead to a resilient spatial framework for the city of Concepción that can provide more stability and safety against natural disasters. The designed backbone was consequently tested in a few natural disaster scenarios and adapted where necessary. This approach can be applied in other cities with similar challenges.","Resilience; Adaptation; Appropriation; Flexibility; Wetlands; Natural disasters; Natural dynamics; Biodiversity; Flooding; Ecological integrity","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Landscape Architecture","",""

This means the hydrodynamic response will also contain energy at these higher frequencies. Conventional linear diffraction solvers are not able to solve the combined response of the wave frequency and its higher harmonics, which then result in a non-physical solution for the wave loads, motions and internal loads. This research aims to obtain a better insight into the hydrodynamic response at the inconvenient draft and ultimately on the internal loads of the semi-submersible. In the first part of this research, model test solutions, linear potential solutions obtained with WAMIT and CFD solutions obtained with ComFLOW are compared. the comparison shows that ComFLOW is able to provide more accurate wave loads compared to the linear potential solver. The higher harmon- ics observed in the measured wave loads during model tests are correctly predicted by ComFLOW, although maximum deviations of 30% are still observed between measured and predicted wave-load amplitudes.<br/>However, ComFLOW is not able to solve the motions of a free-floating semi-submersible correctly. Due to pressure peaks in the wave-exciting forces, solving the equation of motion results in an incorrect motion response and ultimately results in incorrect internal loads. Although a significant effort was made - in close collaboration with the ComFLOW developer - to improve this functionality, the results remained unsatisfactory. Even so, in order to obtain an insight into the higher harmonic response contributions to the internal loads, a parameter study has been conducted, using tests in which the semi-submersible was held captive. This parameter study was conducted by systematically varying wave amplitudes and draft, and resulted in situational limits at which the higher harmonic response contribution becomes significant and the linear relation between the incoming wave and the hydrodynamic response is lost. This limit is shown to be dependent on the Ursell number. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the significance of the higher harmonic response contribution increases from 10% to 40% throughout the inconvenient draft, while the most severe situations resulted in a higher harmonic response contribution of 50% of the total response amplitude. In the final part of this study, an attempt is made to couple the wave loads from ComFLOW to internal loads. A quantitative analysis is made on the effect of the higher harmonic responses of the wave loads on the internal loads. The time domain simulator aNySim is used combined with the wave- exciting forces on a captive semi-submersible calculated with ComFLOW. A multi-body analysis is used to obtain the internal loads on the aft and front part of the semi-submersible. This did not provide the correct answers because the stiffness of the spring damping between the two sections affects the higher harmonic response contribution. This method overestimated the higher harmonic response contribution. A better understanding of the joint and the joint stiffness/damping of a dual-body simulation may solve the encountered problems.","Internal loads; Semi-submersible; CFD; ComFLOW; non-linear","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Marine Technology","",""

However, to capture free-stream air, ramjet engines require large supersonic air intakes, which can be an operational nuisance. A possible alternative is to make the supersonic intakes flush with the vehicle body by “submerging” them into the side of the fuselage: a Submerged Supersonic Intake (SSI). Due to supersonic expansion, submerging will incur some aerodynamic losses, which will lead to reduced ramjet engine performance. To assess the feasibility of SSI's, finding the magnitude of SSI performance losses compared to regular supersonic intakes is necessary. The performance losses involved with submerging a supersonic intake can be found by finding the upper limit of the SSI operational domain, which this report aims to do in two ways. The first is to investigate performance losses by an inviscid study into SSI performance characteristics and the thrust coefficients of ramjets equipped with SSI’s, to find the theoretical maximum to SSI performance. The second way is to carry out an experimental campaign to validate an existing viscous analytical model: the Submerged Ramjet Intake Model (SRIM), which may later be used in optimizing SSI’s, to include viscosity into the analysis. The experimental campaign focused on measuring the total- and static pressure, mass flow and Mach number, as well as visualizing the flow in the SSI models. Two different SSI geometries were produced to conduct experiments in the ST-15 wind tunnel at Delft University of Technology. Measurements of static pressure and schlieren visualization were successfully performed. Partical Image Velocimetry (PIV) was planned, but turned out to be impossible due to hardware limitations. To compensate for the lack of velocity measurements from the canceled PIV measurements, a method was devised to derive the Mach number in the SSI model internal channel from the schlieren images, from which mass flow and total pressure could be computed. <br/>The experimental results were used to validate the SRIM. Overall, the SRIM showed good agreement with the experimental results, with differences of $5\%$ at the highest for the most important intake characteristics of mass flow and total pressure recovery. Although some discrepancies and uncertainties remained, which were studied and used suggest future experiments and improvements to the SRIM. An inviscid study was also performed. Using a routine to compute optimal inviscid intake performance, the maximum attainable total pressure ratios of regular and submerged intakes were computed. It was found that with increasing Mach number and expansion angle, SSI performance quickly deteriorates. More important, however, is the effect of submergence on the ramjet engine thrust capabilities. An inviscid thrust coefficient analysis was conducted which showed that the reduced total pressure ratio of submerged supersonic intakes has limited effects on thrust coefficient. However, it became apparent that reduced capture area due to the supersonic expansion has a much larger influence on the thrust coefficient when comparing submerged and regular intakes of similar size. This report provides two methods of computing the consequences of submerging a supersonic intake in terms of performance. An inviscid method was presented to use in early stages of missile design, and an existing quick analytical model with viscous capabilities was validated so that it may be used in optimization schemes for more detailed analysis. Using these tools missile designers can assess whether the operational gains of submerging a supersonic intake outweigh its losses.","Submerged; Supersonic; Intake; Inlet; Flush; Ramjet; Propulsion; Missile; Airbreathing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-06-26","","","","Aerospace Engineering | Flight Performance and Propulsion","",""

Using this method current densities for gradient fields in the three spatial directions are derived. Subsequently, using stream functions, wire patterns for the three gradient coils are determined. These are verified using a commercial magneto-static solver. Furthermore, one of the gradients is constructed to validate the performance of the method. The measured fields are in good agreement with the simulations and their prescribed target fields. This confirms that the proposed method provides a reliable way to design and manufacture gradient coils for various requirements.

However, the values and opportunities of cultural heritage are increasingly overlooked in urban developments, due to the misconception that it might not fit in the mold or vision that developers are creating with trends of “smart, high-tech, innovative cities”. This strongly applies to countries in the Middle-East as they attempt to replicate existing successful developments, while disregarding the context of the area, culture, and identity that distinguishes them and makes them unique, as a result; this has led to failed schemes and unavoidable lack of identity in these projects. Integrating certain aspects of cultural heritage in urban developments could be of high value to a city, creating several opportunities that cultivate the success of future developments. In order to accomplish a successfully integrated project that combines the area “Port” and city, old with the new, past and future, it is important for stakeholders; from both public and private sectors are involved in the decision making process, taking cultural heritage into consideration. Subsequently, the notion of integrating cultural heritage in sustainable developments arises, and by using the contributions of cultural heritage towards influencing the stakeholder’s decision making process; taking into account the necessity of incorporating cultural heritage into their visions. However, with upcoming future developments in Oman, it becomes clear that there are certain challenges that come with forming strategies, and implementing them from both private and public sectors perspectives that remains challenging due to poor collaboration. This research aims to fill in the gap in literature on a specific part of culture integration; which is cultural heritage and its value in sustainable waterfront regenerations. Through identifying the contributions that cultural heritage provide for sustainable waterfront developments, and what opportunities it could create for the society, economy and tourism development of the city, the process of implementation and integration can then be steered by integrating the right management tools in regards to conservation of heritage.","Cultural Heritage; Waterfront Regeneration; urban area development; Port Area; Port City; Decision making process; public sector; private sector; historic urban landscape","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Management in the Built Environment","",""

For example, the ultrasonic scalpel enables tissue coagulation and -cutting by transferring a mechanical vibration to the tissue. Additionally, real-time sensing is implemented to improve the surgical procedures. Intraoperative ultrasonography is one of those real-time sensing techniques that allows the surgeon to visualize the anatomical surroundings of the surgical site. Previous literature research has shown that integration of ultrasonography into the ultrasonic scalpel would be a promising direction for the development of a ‘smart surgical instrument’. This research focusses on the integration of intraoperative ultrasonography into the ultrasonic scalpel. Based on detailed analyses of the currently existing technology, several integration directions are developed. The integration of an existing ultrasound probe into the ultrasonic scalpel is tested in a series of experiments. A functional prototype is designed and manufactured in which the Philips Eagle Eye Platinum ultrasound catheter is integrated into a LOTUS Torsion ultrasonic scalpel. The performance of the separate ultrasound catheter is assessed using tissue phantom with inserted silicone distortions. This is followed by experiments to test the performance of the integrated catheter. Based on the experiment results, an improved prototype design is proposed. The first proposed prototype design facilitates integration of the ultrasound catheter and the integrated Eagle Eye Platinum catheter covers the areas of interest in its field of view. It is shown that the tissue phantom that is grasped by the ultrasonic scalpel prototype can be assessed. Distortions in the tissue can be detected. Also sideward imaging, relevant during tumour-free margin measurements, is possible using the developed prototype. Several problems were encountered during the experiments. The underlying causes are analysed and multiple solutions are recommended, leading to the proposal of an improved prototype design. It can be concluded that the integration of ultrasound imaging into the ultrasonic scalpel is a feasible direction for the development of a ‘smart surgical instrument’.","surgical instrument; ultrasonic scalpel; ultrasonography; smart instrument; sensing integration","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-06-26","","","","Mechanical Engineering | BioMechanical Design","",""

Preserving this unique quality for the public and making it experience-able as well as using it as a source of revenue are my main focuses. I pose the question:”How can the historic layers of the site be preserved and made experience-able?” To answer this question I introduced the 3 following approaches:<br/><br/>Offer additional programme <br/>Preserve the original building fabric<br/>Establish new connections<br/><br/>Each approach is reflected in a concrete intervention on site.<br/>The site is mainly transformed into a boutique hotel. To attract more visitors and therefore create more revenue as well as to make the site sustainable, I introduce a restaurant and market hall in combination with a greenhouse. Located in the former functional post war stables it also functions as a new public entrance to the site. A big part of the atmosphere on site is characterized by the war damages in the main house. The core idea is to maintain the original atmosphere of the rooms with only a few “images” of the historic rooms while providing modern living standards. All serious damages to the brickwork are maintained and similar to a showcase, in a museum exhibited through a window pane. This is contrasted by the new plaster wall finish around the frames which is painted in a way that it matches the original colour scheme of the room. <br/>Introducing a walkway which connects all buildings on site serves two functions. Firstly it makes the navigation for visitors much easier and leads them from one function to the other. More importantly, however, it serves as a tool to tell the history of Reuversweerd. Leading from one time cluster to the other it shows the visitor the different time layers and atmospheres. By making a connection that was never there before It also creates an entirely new context for the buildings which enables a focus shift towards their history and spatial qualities rather than their beauty.<br","Hheritage & Architecture; Revitalising heritage; Reuversweerd; Transformation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","KaDEr research project","52.108114, 6.194513"

In many situations pregnant women need to use a medicine during pregnancy, especially when they are under medical supervision at VUmc due to their (history of a) complex pregnancy. For instance to treat an underlying chronic disease or pregnancy related conditions. In every decision about medication use, the necessity needs to be weighed against the potential risks of the medicine, as well as the risks when not taking the medicine for both mother and child. Literature research has shown that pregnant women often overestimate the risks associated with medicines and therefore do not take their medicines as prescribed. Current information sources, such as patient leaflets and online websites, usually stress the risks and show reluctance towards the use of medicines during pregnancy, while they lack the benefits of medicines. User research has shown that pregnant women are very afraid of the potential risks and only want to take a medicine when there is a clear benefit for their child. Usually they have a lot of trust in their gynaecologist and follow their advice to use a particular medicine. However, women easily start to doubt whether their medicine is really safe due to negative information from others or in the media, or because they do not clearly remember the benefits of the medicine. As a result, they seek confirmation and reassurance by searching information via Google or in the patient leaflet, where they often only find unnerving information that increases their concerns. Based on these research insights, the goal was to design a product-service system, including a digital application that informs pregnant women about the use of medicines during pregnancy and allows them to make an informed decision and feel confident to use a medicine during pregnancy. The final design, ‘Mijn Medicijn – Zwangerschap’ is an application that pregnant women can consult at any time when they are in doubt of the safety of their medicine. It provides balanced and transparent information about both the potential risks and the benefits of medicines for the mother and unborn child. This allows pregnant women to understand why a medicine may be important for their situation, which is expected to make them feel more confident to use the medicine during pregnancy. Additionally, the app shows what medicines can or should not be used during pregnancy for a certain complaint or condition. The gynaecologist plays an important role in the design as well, by providing an information flyer and stimulating the patient to use the app. Furthermore, when advising a medicine, the gynaecologist explains the relevance of the medicine by using the same benefit-risk information in a desktop version of the app. An evaluation study with an interactive prototype showed that pregnant women highly value the product service system in general as well as the patient-friendly information, which would support them in making decisions about medication use.","Medication; Pregnancy; Healthcare; Application; Hospital","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

In order to do so, Jan Bredenoord, Paul Van Lindert and Peer Smets state, within their book ‘Affordable Housing in the Global Urban South: Seeking Sustainable Solutions’, that new communities being developed for the future must foster resilience. Resilience is a systems ability to adapt to change. Cities and urban spaces make up, as Charles Correa once said, “a whole system of spaces that people need (Correa, 1989).” “Urban living involves... a whole system of spaces that people need.” Charles Correa In nature, Bredenoord and his colleagues explain, “ecosystems have survived over time by adjusting to changing circumstances resulting in a search for equilibrium between two opposing poles, of efficiency and resilience. The healthiest systems have an optimum balance between the two extremes, which may be described by the term sustainability (Bredenoord et.al, 2014).” Furthermore, cities and urban spaces can be seen as patchworks of “green space, biodiversity (including people), non-biological structures (buildings), biophysical processes and energy flows, and are in that way comparable to natural ecosystems (Maddox, 2012).” The balance between the two extremes, sustainability, can be defined as a trade-off between efficiency and resilience. On the one hand, too much efficiency will lead to little diversity and stagnation in the system, while too much resilience will lead to too much diversity and a lack of coherence and purpose to grow. The goal for future housing developments should therefore be at aiming for an optimum balance between the two. It is upon this background that the graduation project’s topic of ‘Resilience’ and the research question of the project was defined.","Global Housing; Mumbai; Resilience; Efficiency","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Global Housing","Mixing Mumbai: Affordable Housing for Inclusive Development",""

During each cycle the normal strain is increased until the normal stress equals a specific cyclic stress σcycle. The loading is continued until the network is broken into two pieces, with a number of N completed cycles. For a range of cyclic stresses the number of cycles before failure N is calculated and fitted with an exponential relation.

The highly valued war damages in the interior are being preserved and displayed in a way that adds extra quality to the spaces.

However they are all adjacent to each other and in different ways interrelated. <br/>The new program function and target group for the ensemble erupted from the social necessity to give home to fast growing group of elderly people with a physical care demand. This differs from the original function of the ensemble: industrial production place. The housing of elderly is a hot topic in the current societal discussion. New developments need to give an answer to the current demand of the rapidly double aging society.<br/>Designing for elderly with a physical care demand, in general, means that everything is integral accessible, that there are no thresholds and that everything is wheelchair accessible. But there should also be some facilities nearby, like a hairdresser and a supermarket. On top of that, there is also a wish to make the entire Hembrug terrain social inclusive. In the design the readability of the complex is enhanced by adding an internal light street and by adding a new volume that strengthens the symmetry of the complex. Depending on the need of the elderly, there is a transition from private space to meeting space of which a resident can choose from, according to their own needs. A comfortable living environment for elderly with a physical care demand is created, while keeping the characteristic atmosphere of the ensemble. In the ensemble one area is created in which everything comes together, which is the heart of my ensemble and of Hembrug, the Cathedral.

In this zone a special exchange emerged in the density of the buildings. When production started growing, buildings that were seen as unfunctional were demolished and often the new created open spaces were filled with buildings again. This interaction of dilution and compaction resulted in the ensemble we see nowadays what is named after this development of buildings. The ensemble of the Changing zone is literally and figuratively interrelated. Through this, the buildings and elements of the ensemble cannot be seen on its own. This is why the ensemble can only work as a whole. This coherence can be used for the future development of the Changing zone of Hembrug.<br/><br/>Next to the coherence in the Changing zone, another problem is stated: the current food systems. The growing population all over the world has led to a current food system that has lost its connection with the origin of food: where food comes from. Food is taken for granted by its consumers and producers. More food is wasted and production is not done locally anymore. The prospects of a population that will continue to grow (by 2050, we probably have around ten billion mouths to feed) and the need to produce even more food asks for a change in the food systems. <br/><br/>The food zone of Hembrug will be a place where people are reconnected with their food and it will be a place to create, invent, test and solve the problems that are arising in the future of food. To stimulate and to help people to contribute to a healthy, tasteful and sustainable future. This food zone is designed to order the ensemble of the Changing Zone. Its new inner street is used as the main axis to connect every building of the ensemble.

(mentor); Kuzniecow Bacchin, T. (graduation committee); Viganò, Paola (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","The ‘resource curse’, a term coined by Richard Auty in 1993, refers to the paradox that the abundance of natural resources tends to have adverse effects in a country’s economic, social and political well-being (Ross, 2015). This correlation has also led many to refer to this phenomenon as the ‘paradox of plenty’. When a country depends exclusively on the extraction of non-renewable resources it faces a wide range of risks that can be extremely difficult to manage, since they are created by powerful external factors. And Venezuela, a nation that has mainly depended on oil and mineral extraction since the 1920s, has not been the exception. The astronomical rise in the prices of various metals over the past two decades has put great pressures on resource-rich countries all over the world, especially in the global south. In recent years, and pushed by the drop of oil prices, the Venezuelan government decided to shift its attention from the oil fields of the country to the tropical forests of the Venezuelan Guayana, where large deposits of iron, bauxite, gold, diamonds, coltan, and many other rare minerals can be found.<br/><br/>But the ongoing economic crisis and the subsequent lack of opportunities throughout the country, have also promoted the escalation of illegal small-scale gold mining operations in this part of the Amazonia. Thousands of people, especially in neglected and peripheral areas, have found a way to survive the crisis by working in the gold mines. However, this dependency on resource extraction is having far-reaching consequences that will be felt by many generations to come, from an environmental, social and economic point of view. And from a larger perspective, the idea of maintaining a model based on the exploitation of non-renewable resources hinders the possibility of a sustainable future for the region. But is there a way out of the resource curse? What kind of<br/>regional and local development should be promoted to overcome this dependency, and for whom? These are difficult questions that nevertheless must be addressed, especially in the Amazonian context. Therefore, this work seeks to explore the spatial dimension of this problem in the Venezuelan Guayana, to understand if the restructuring of the territory can create the conditions for the generation of alternative economies from the bottom-up and reduce the current dependence of the region on resource extraction.","Venezuela; Amazonia; Resource Extraction; Endogenous Development; Peripheral Regions; Local Sustainable Development; Regional Planning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","European Master in Urbanism (EMU)","","7.34629, -61.8271"

The major drawback of electricity production from renewable sources is that they are intermittent and therefore lead to amismatch between the supply and the demand of energy. Energy storage in the form of hydrogen production is a potential candidate to overcome this problem. However, due to its lowvolumetric energy density, hydrogen must be compressed to use it for storage or transportation purposes. HYET BV has developed an Electrochemical Hydrogen Compressor (EHC) that is capable of compressing hydrogen up to P = 1000 bar, and have the potential of bringing compression costs down to 3 kWh/kg. As the compressed hydrogen is saturated with water, it must be dehydrated before it is used for refuelling Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles (FCEV), as the ISO 14687-2:2012 standard has limited the water concentration to 5 ¹mol water per mol gas mixture. In this work, a landscaping studywas performed to search for potential drying methods, includingmembrane separation, adsorption, absorption and cooling. To select the best method for hydrogen dehydration, it is essential to have a good understanding of the thermodynamics at the given pressure conditions, beginningwith the saturated water content in compressed hydrogen. To the best of our knowledge, the only experimental data describing the water content in the H2-H2O mixture for pressures exceeding 300 bar are from 1927 and are limited to T = 323.15K [J. Am. Chem. Soc., 1927, 49, pp 65-78]. In this thesis, it was concluded that conventional Equations of State (EoS) failed to predict the equilibrium coexistence compositions of the liquid and gas phase. Therefore, molecular simulations were used, which adequately predicted the water content in compressed hydrogen. The second part of this thesis was to select the best drying method for hydrogen dehydration. Previous work showed that absorption using Ionic Liquids (IL) could be an interesting alternative to traditional dryingmethods. Therefore, absorption experiments were performed on the ILs 1-Ethyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate [EMIM][Acetate], 1-Butyl-3-methylimidazoliumchloride [BMIM][Chloride], and 1-Butyl-3-methylimidazolium octyl sulfate [BMIM][Octyl Sulfate] to test the feasibility of ILs for hydrogen dehydration. The ILs were selected on stability, safety, and on the activity coefficient of water in the given IL. The experiments showed that ILs can be used as an absorbent to dry hydrogen gas. A part from the initial selection criteria, the experiments showed that surface tension is an important criterion for future IL selection, as it is strongly related to foam production. Finally, the very hygroscopic ILs tested turned out to be capable of absorbing large amounts of water, but a lot of energy was required to regenerate the ILs, making them less attractive as a potential absorbent.","Hydrogen; Vapor-liquid phase equilibrium; equations of state; molecular simulations; water content; absorption","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-06-26","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Energy and Process Technology","",""

Thus, the consumption of food is no longer related to fulfilling the need of hunger, but also as a way to deal with human emotions, facilitate social bondings, celebrate cultural events and etc. Improper way of consuming food can result in negative consequences in people’s health condition, such as getting overweight and obese, as well as many other types of diseases. To help people manage their own eating behavior, food-tracking tools were designed to keep a record of people’s food intake, as a reference to access their eating and for themselves to make changes accordingly. How do we design a food tracking tool that can support people to collect meaningful data around their eating behavior and reflect on them in an engaging way? From the literature research and user research great insights were drawn on the current experience of using food-tracking tools. Based on that, through iterative developing, an mobile application design was detailed and evaluated. The project aims to provide a new perspective on how people can manage their eating behavior by self-tracking food they eat and the related influencing factors. The idea behind it is to empower them in discovering how the implicit reasons are repeatedly affecting the way they eat, environmentally and psychologically, rather than to regulate people to follow specific diet rules.","food Informatics system; self-tracking; engagement","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

However, these pigments usually show a higher sensitivity to weathering factors like UV light and water in polymer formulations than other pigments. In the particular case of Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC), this is even more evident for pigments containing iron based compounds (the typical red and orange brilliant colors) because they can initiate a degradation processes or catalyze oxidation of the polymer or other components. Thus, an improvement of such formulations for a better long term stability of the final products is needed.The present study was carried out in the Avery Dennison R&amp;D laboratories. It was designed in order to carry out a preliminary test to address the issue of low durability of certain colored PVC based-films containing metallic pigments. Several sensitive pigments were selected as a case study for this project. In particular, the project aims to focus on understanding the effect of water on the surface of colored PVC cast films. Water retention on the surface of the films tends to cause accelerated and localized degradation of the PVC matrix enhanced by the effect of the metal oxides.What was observed for the pigmented PVC films is that as the pigment loading increases, the weathering durability improves. The degradation spots were mostly observed on the sides of the tested films but in some cases degradation spots were observed on the surface as well. The localized degradation on the sides is attributed to the damaged flake/particles of pigments which causes the initiation and propagation of PVC degradation in combination with water retention. After the SEM analysis, the degradation on the surface can be attributed to pigment flakes/particles really close to the films surface or even protruding from it where they can easily come in contact with water.Among all five selected additives (water scavenger, dispersants 1 and 2, fluorinated MICA and anticorrosive pigment), the ones with the best overall performance were the water scavenger and the anti-corrosive pigment. The water scavenger reacts with water avoiding its involvement in the PVC degradation process. Since water is not involved, less free radicals are formed and as a result, the propagation of PVC degradation is delayed. The anti-corrosive pigment increases the overall weathering durability of the system by protecting the sensitive metallic pigments with the Zn content of the anti-corrosive pigment surface treatment conferring sacrificial cathodic protection","PVC; Pigments; Water; Films; Additives; Degradation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-06-26","","","","Materials Science and Engineering","",""

Design/methodology/approach – Semi-structured interviews with different safety professionals from Dutch universities are used to identify their role during a fire incident, an acceptable level of fire cause, necessary information items and, their viewpoint on the use of smart emergency applications. The results are translated to a multi-criteria analysis in which different smart emergency applications are evaluated according to a variety of information items. Main finding – This study reveals that not all required information is integrated into the current smart emergency apps. In fact, each smart emergency apps have a unique information provision which can be useful during a specific phase of a building fire emergency operation. In addition, the findings show that the use of smart emergency apps is partially supported by the participants of the interviews. Research limitations/implications – This study was confined to universities in The Netherlands and the semi-structured interviews have limited population size. A larger population with the focus on international universities would have allowed for more important data, but the findings do provide valuable and essential insight into the contribution of smart emergency apps to the facility managers. Practical implications – The empirical results provide guidance to the emergency and facility managers to opt for the smart emergency app(s) according to their required information and, give valuable insight to app developers and researchers for further improvement and development of the emergency apps. Originality/value – Most studies focus on the benefits and technical aspects of the smart emergency app. This research provides readers with more insight into the extent of the required information on current smart emergency apps in favor of the facility manager who needs to perform during a building fire emergency operation","Facility manager; Information; Situational awareness; Smart tools; Building fire emergency response operations; Bowtie method; University","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Management in the Built Environment","",""

(mentor); Kornet, J. (graduation committee); Kuipers, F.A. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","It is predicted that in about 100 years most of the earth's fossil fuels will have been depleted. Currently, fossil fuels still make up 80% of the Dutch energy production. Thus, to handle this depletion, the research on renewable energy production and its usage is being stimulated by governments. With the use of fossil fuel energy production, it is easy to increase production to meet the unexpected peaks in energy demand by burning more fuels. However, with renewable sources this is not possible. Thus, the way that the produced energy is being used needs to be altered. Furthermore, the amount of renewable energy that is privately generated has increased over the last couple of years. The energy that has been generated for private use and is not needed at that time, can either be sent back into the grid for other users or charged to a battery for later personal use. The electricity network that will regulate the buying and selling of energy is called a smart grid. When using a battery to store privately generated energy, the decisions that are made for the (dis)charging of the battery are of great influence on the total energy cost at the end of the month. When implementing a battery in a household or company that privately generates energy, these decisions need to be made within a fixed time limit of 15 minutes. In this thesis, four mathematical optimisation methods are compared to each other on result and run time. These methods are dynamic programming, local search, tabu search, and simulated annealing. Dynamic programming gives the solution with the lowest possible cost, but does not always have the lowest average run time. The total cost of the solution resulting from local search does not come close enough to the lowest possible cost generated by dynamic programming to be a viable alternative to dynamic programming. Tabu search is an extension of local search, it could result in a solution with a total cost close enough to the lowest possible cost if it runs more iterations than local search. However, due to this the average run time will exceed the run time of dynamic programming. Therefore, it is also not a viable alternative for dynamic programming. Simulated annealing has a shorter run time than dynamic programming when using a forecast time of 1 day or less. The total cost of the solutions come very close to those of dynamic programming. Therefore, while the run time of dynamic programming still fits within the available time limit, it is advisable to use this method to determine the charging decisions for a private battery in a smart grid. However, the simulations that were run in for this thesis do not encompass the entire real-life case. If after the expansion of the problem to be implemented in real-life the run time of dynamic programming were to exceed the available time period, then simulated annealing would be a good alternative for implementation.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics","",""

Its population went from 600 thousand people in 1940 to nearly 9.5 million people nowadays. Former agriculture fields between the coast and the beginning of the Andes mountains were quickly filled with urban developments. Neither the public sector nor the private housing market provided decent living conditions in the city for all these newcomers. 34% of the city’s land was developed informally (Municipality of Lima, 2013a) and 70% of the houses were to some degree self-built. The process of urban development and, specifically, the control of the space through land ownership, generated a segregated city. The urban poor usually accessed low-cost land or housing in areas exposed to high levels of risk, with accessibility problems or lack of basic infrastructure.<br/><br/>The current process of urban development, along with a quantitative understanding of housing in policy, continues reproducing socio-spatial segregation today. Buying a plot to land traffickers on the steep slopes of the periphery is the primary way for the low-income population to access a place to live in the city.<br/><br/>This graduation project has two main goals. On the one hand, it tries to understand the relations between housing, urban development and socio-spatial segregation in Lima.

This development is also driven by customer demands. They face increasingly strict legislation on \ce{CO2} emissions. Separation in distillation columns is one of the major energy intensive unit operations in an ethylene plant, and increasing their efficiency directly improves the overall plant efficiency. This work is commissioned by TechnipFMC, which is part of the HEADLINES consortium for heat integrated distillation column development. The plate-packed heat-integrated distillation column (pp-HIDiC) is a promising new distillation column design that could replace current ethane/ethylene fractionators (\splitter{}). A numeric model and calculation tool is needed to aid the design of a pp-HIDiC for the \splitter{} as proposed in the work by \textcite{bruinsma2012}. A numeric modelling procedure for this type of column was developed in this work. This modelling procedure was then implemented in Python. A rate-based modelling methodology was applied to describe the continuous heat- and mass transfer on the internal column structures. The aim of the model is to find column dimensioning and duties, which followed from the model's balance equations. A designer should be able to input the column dimensions and flow rates, and run the model to retrieve mole fractions, heat transfer and temperatures along the column. Heat- and mass transfer correlations were needed, despite there being no special correlations for the proposed setup. Generic structured packing correlations were used from literature as a modelling approximation. The performance of different available thermodynamic packages for Python was compared. Diffusivity and viscosity correlations were implemented to aid in mass transfer calculations. A Python Newton solver was chosen to solve the model equations, using CoolProp to perform thermodynamic calculations. Due to the choice of model variables, convergence of the equations remained an issue. In the system of equations, column temperatures cannot follow from the equilibrium relation on the vapour-liquid interface, as they do not depend on each other strongly enough. It is not possible to find condenser and reboiler duties as an output of this model while specifying boil-up and reflux ratios. The model needs to be changed so that these variables are fixed by the user, and the reflux ratios are a model result instead. A model's thermodynamic calculation packages should be robust. Additionally, a well-documented interface with the used programming language and validated data is needed. This could require the use of commercial thermodynamic software, or validated process simulators. The model designer is then less hindered by programming environment related issues. A model that is purely based on theory and inapplicable correlations cannot be the only basis of design decisions. The used heat and mass transfer correlations are not made for the studied geometry, so their usage introduces inaccuracies in the model results. Applicable correlations from experiment are recommended to characterise pressure drop, heat transfer between HIDiC compartments, heat transfer coefficients, and vapour and liquid mass transfer coefficients on the packing surface. Further experiments can also aid in better understanding of the wetting, flooding and liquid distribution of various pp-HIDiC geometries. Beside characterising one packing geometry, it will be beneficial to experiment on different viable geometries that are specifically suitable for a pp-HIDiC. Too few alternative designs have been tested so far. Investigating more geometries can help to find the most promising designs more quickly. After that, models and experiments can then complement each other to develop the most promising geometries and accelerate the column development.","Distillation; HIDiC; Mass transfer; Heat Transfer; Modelling; Python; Structured packing; Design Tool; Heat integration; Energy efficiency; Cost saving; Innovation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-06-25","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Process and Energy Technology","",""

Recently, a valid alternative to road-bounded vehicles that is has gained attention is the adoption of drones in the delivery fleet. Drone applications range from military training, surveillance, path recognition and shipment of perishable products in emergency situations. Research on drones as delivery vehicles is still on its early stages, with some practical trials carried out by leader companies such as Google and Amazon. However, the application of drones in the pharmaceutical sector, and specifically for home deliveries of medical products, has not been investigated yet. To gain new insights into the feasibility of introducing drones in the delivery fleet composition, drone applications were studied for the delivery operations of the pharmacy BENU t Slag, in Rotterdam. Two scenario alternatives were tested using the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) formulation and a Large- scale Neighbourhood Search (LNS) algorithm was implemented to estimate the performance indicators associated with each scenario. Performances were then analysed through a comparative analysis. Conclusively, indicators were found to improve the delivery performance when drones are included in the fleet composition, with gains in environmental aspects, service time and delivery costs. Results provide important information for further research on the implications of using drones in the pharmaceutical sector. Moreover, results are also useful for BENU t Slag, providing a valid feasibility assessment of using drones for their home delivery operations.","Drones; Large-scale Neighbourhood Search algorithmlast-mile delivery, medical products, network optimisation, pharmaceutical sector, Vehicle Routing Problem; Last-mile delivery; Medical products; Network optimisation; Pharmaceutical sector; Vehicle Routing Problem","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Transport, Infrastructure and Logistics","",""

In this research, I have studied how modelling can assist ADM in Argentina through action research by applying various participatory methods like workshops, group model building and interviews. In the exploratory phase, I could make several observations regarding the application of ADM in Argentina. I discovered something unexpected: Multiple co-existing ontologies of the Paraná Delta were shaped in practice, influencing the ADM process. The Paraná Delta seemed to be continually changing per actor, time and space in the Delta. In order to introduce the reader to this multiplicity, I offer an approach to formulate these ontologies and provide several examples of ontologies in the Delta. Next, I propose a structured approach to connect ontologies to modelling. The added value of using ontologies for the modelling of the Paraná Delta was discussed with experts. The results indicate that by connecting ontologies and modelling, the ADM process (in the Paraná Delta) will be strengthened, since ontologies (1) illustrate modellers assumptions, (2) improve stakeholders and politicians understanding of the Delta, (3) guide research and data collection to verify assumptions on the Delta, and (4) strengthen the understanding of one's own ontology. Therefore, the results show that incorporating ontologies in ADM research is a valuable approach. Future research should focus on formulating models to support the claims made in this article. Further, a theoretical investigation is needed to incorporate the use of ontologies in the ADM process. In order to guide future researchers to incorporate ontologies in their modelling, a framework is constructed based on my research experience: ‘the Kite framework’.","Adaptive Delta management,; Ontological policies; ontological politics; ontologies in Delta,; Decision making; Water management; modelling of ontologies; Paraná Delta; Wicked problems","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Water Management","Paraná Delta","-34.1687393, -58.9591408"

Because of this, creating a low cost schedule that does not have to be changed is impossible in most cases. When changes are made during the execution, focussing solely on the performance of the schedule may result in very large differences between the original schedule and the realised schedule. These differences are undesirable particularly if tasks or resources are human. In order to quantify them, several stability metrics are considered, as well as the performance objective makespan. The complexity of computing these metrics when a single disruption to the duration of one of the tasks occurred is considered. For single machine scheduling problems and constraint programming the complexity of several stability metrics is known. For parallel processor scheduling, very little has been investigated. Optimizing just the stability metrics turns out to be possible in polynomial time. We further show that many of the multi objective optimizations problems that consider both a stability metric and the makespan are strongly NP-complete. For the instances that are not, an algorithm is given. In order to reduce the complexity, reducing the search space to a partial order schedule is investigated. This is a promising method as optimizing the makespan in this reduced search space can be done in polynomial time.

The main aim of the legislative proposal is to improve the quality of construction by privatising the way of assessing quality on the basis of the Building Decree. The problem is that the contractor gets more responsibility in this process through the new law. Since the change in the way of quality assurance asks for a new way of working from contractors the contractors have to adapt their organisations towards this change in responsibility. The changes can be distinguished on a legal implementation and organisational implementation level. This research focuses on the social scientific perspective of this law; being the organisational implementation. Within this organisational implementation, the focus of this research is the organisational culture and structure. The research question is therefore: How can a contractor change its culture and organisational structure, to adopt a pro-active attitude in quality assurance? The research strategy is to perform qualitative research. For this research, the method to be used is doing literature research. The literature research reviews the change based on a why-how-what structure. This literature research results in multiple findings on different subjects. Findings which form the basis of an advice on how to approach an organisational culture and organisational structure change. To validate these findings and the advice, both are submitted to a validation process. The deliverable at the end of the research is the advice for the contractors on how to adapt their organisational culture and organisational structure, which will be reflected in an advice brochure. The conclusions of this research start by describing that current organisations of contractors miss a branch or layer on quality management. To change this, a power strategy or planned strategy should be chosen with unilateral implementation instruments. The change process should, regardless the chosen strategy, be implemented on different levels, which was found to reduce resistance for change. The process of change should be started within a project in which the client is interested in improving quality assessment as well. It is concluded that a manager who stands behind the changes and is committed to those change, should be made in the lead of implementing the strategy within that project.","Quality Assurance; ‘Wet Kwaliteitsborging voor het bouwen’; Building Decree; Contractors; Organisational Culture; Organisational Structure; Change","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Management in the Built Environment","",""

This graduation project targets on adoption of passive air remediation techniques that can be widely applied into urban areas. Within the passive technical measures available, integrating greeneries on the infrastructure and photocatalytic materials prove promising to be incorporated in a broader perspective. Photocatalytic materials one-time installation, easy to maintain and self-cleaning properties has led to the selection of this material to quantify its air purifying capability.<br/>TiO2 coating has been used in building materials for its self-cleaning property. However, its capability to break down NOx compounds has broadened its scope for pollution abatement. Though it can be applied as a coating, the performance of the photocatalyst in urban scenarios is affected by contact wind speeds and incident UV irradiation. Also, increased surface area provides more area of photo catalytically active sites. These factors are governed by the geometrical form of the panel. Hence, the main objective of this research is to design a façade panel with enlarged surface area and surface roughness to manipulate the environmental factors to favor photocatalysis. Also, its air purification effect is quantified to understand the effectiveness of this passive strategy and the design. <br/>The façade concept has been designed following a series of strategies to respond to wind and irradiation. The concept with optimum surface enlargement and irradiation is developed into modular panels which are materialized by choosing the material with least environmental impact. The final part of this graduation project is about applying these panels in the street canyons, a controlled urban environment and evaluating the pollution abatement. The results indicate a pollution abatement of 3.5% - 8.9% in winter and 18% - 37.5% in percentage in summer for London.","Urban facades; Urban air purification; photocatalytic building materials; TiO2","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Building Technology | Sustainable Design","",""

This thesis aims to study the microstructural developments during isothermal treatments below the Ms temperature by in-situ SXRD measurements in a model alloy of composition Fe–0.2C–3.51Mn–1.52Si–0.25Mo (wt.%). Results from this study show that during the isothermal treatment below Ms, bainite was formed right after the isothermal treatment started, which supports previous dilatometry experiments. During the isothermal treatment below Ms, four processes are suggested to occur simultaneously: (i) carbon redistribution processes from martensite, (ii) formation of bainite at the martensite/austenite interface, (iii) formation of bainite at the austenite/austenite interface, and (iv) carbon redistribution processes associated with bainite formation.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This way, the structural design can be optimized to the in-situ conditions which is beneficial from both safety and economic point of view. In the application of building pits in the soft-soil conditions of the Netherlands the method has the additional value to verify SLS criteria and timely detect unforeseen events. So far limited building pits have been executed via this design strategy. The main reasons for this are the lack of a design procedure and the problematic quantification of safety of the flexible retaining wall design. A strategy for the execution of the Observational Method Ab Initio approach to retaining wall design is described by the CIRIA guideline C760. In this study, the suitability of this 5 step-strategy has been investigated by means of a benchmark. This investigation indicated that, although the CIRIA guideline C760 contains a valuable design strategy, only a qualitative description of safety is provided. Therefore, this study introduces a methodology for real-time measurement-processing with the use of a Bayesian update. The Bayesian update combines the information of the predictive computer model with the information obtained from measurement sets during construction. By describing this information via probability density functions different uncertainties in both the design and construction phase can be weighted in the outcome of the Bayesian update. Consequently, the retaining wall behavior can be re-assessed throughout construction. This methodology is applied to measurement sets gathered at the construction of two different building pits in the Netherlands. Both case studies showed that with the Bayesian update and consequential calibration new parametric distributions can be found. Those parametric distributions describe the retaining wall behavior from which safety definitions in term of a reliability index can be derived. The performance of this methodology for measurement-processing depends on the accuracy of the calculation model and the measurement interpretation. Especially in the case of unexpectedly high and/or fast progressing retaining wall displacements, measurement interpretation is necessary to select the best strategy to redirect the structure. Although this measurement interpretation is a challenge, it is believed that the Observational Method Ab Initio approach complemented with the Bayesian update is a promising design strategy. Its application to the construction of building pits definitely has economic potential and would be favorable for risk management.","Observational Method; Retaining wall design; Bayesian Inference; Statistical Analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geo-Engineering","",""

Currently, this energy is yielded through the use of natural gas. In order to meet Dutch Climate Agreement goals, which were agreed upon December 2018, Low Temperature District Heating (LTDH) is expected as being the most promising sustainable heat energy system solution for dense populated districts. To produce sustainable heat, Visser &amp; Smit Hanab (V&amp;SH) have developed a geothermal source which extracts heat from shallow surfaces, between 500 and 1250 meters. Currently, this system is only used to provide heat for greenhouses. Greenhouses are in need of heat supply for more than 5000 hours per year. This thesis presents which other technologies are required to make LTDH with Low Temperature Geothermal Heat (LTGH) as main source a success for heating in district areas. For the case, there are 5 LTDH concepts designed to supply heat to the livings with LTGH. The designed LTDH varies in storage methods, supply temperature in the network, and peak heat supply technologies. The used storage methods are Aquifer Thermal Energy Storage (ATES) and a water tank of 250 liters for each living. The used peak heat supply technologies are decentralized heat pumps, electrical heaters, and a biomass boiler. The following LTDH concepts are designed.1a. Collective peak supply 70 ⁰C2a. Decentral peak supply 70 ⁰C1b. Collective peak supply 50 ⁰C2b. Decentral peak supply 50 ⁰C3. Decentralized heat pumps using 30 ⁰C supply temperatureBased on Key Performance Indicators, these LTDH concepts are compared with each other. Throughout a thermodynamic and economic analysis, it appeard that LTDH concept 3, where decentralized heat pumps are used, scores the best on all the KPIs. concept. That is because the central heat pump, of the other concepts, consumes the most electricity of all the technologies in the system and is always on throughout the entire year. The average efficiency, over a year, of an air heat pump is higher than that of the central heat pump at the LTGH. This is because the air heat pump is switched off when there is no heat demand and with an LTDH, there are losses in the network and the ATES.Future research must be done on the electricity consumption of the central heat pump from the LTGH. If the heat pump can consume less electricity, the load on the electricity during cold hours can be reduced and throughout a year CO2 emissions can be reduced. Also, future research must be done on optimizing the LTDH concepts, so that the savings in CO2 emissions and LCOE will improve. In addition, an NPV analysis should be done to determine how the costs are distributed over the stakeholders.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-07-31","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

Elderly will now have to live longer on their own, while they're physically not able to.

This thesis will propose a unique living environment, both through an urban master-plan as in building level, while being projected onto existing structures situated in the former military production base of Hembrug. <br/> The Kangaroo Housing concept should allow elderly to live longer on their own, by utilizing specific architectural instruments that break the physical barriers between neighboring residences. Visual relationships between the residences, created through strategic window openings, voids, level differents and other specific interventions, allow younger generations to gain a sense of private control over the elder, noticing when he or she has fallen down or had any accident. The more privacy that is sacrificed, the more security over the elder is gained. <br/><br/>Especially elderly, suffer from loneliness, fear or depression. These problems demand another solution from the transformation on a larger urban scale, in order to deal with the mental well-being of the individual. Therefore, the master-plan encourages the community to host communal activities and gatherings, both for the elderly as the younger generations. Together they will form a community, where people will focus on participation, hosting communal activities and help their elder neighbors. Whether it be small chores such as groceries or assistance with particular tasks, the younger generation will agree on participating in the community, having a slight responsibility for the elderly.

The project begins with an analysis of the mechanisms that capture the relationship between art and the human being. And establishes assumptions about the place for 'creativity' to the new age. Based on these assumptions, this proposal will release space for the unique relationship between art and people, and incorporate them into the city to enhance the connection of Bauhaus and the new Bauhaus museum with the expansion of the experience of art. Here 'the expansion of experience in art and creation' is the principle of this project. The extended relationship between art and human means that by improving technologies, the production and distribution of art can be implemented easily. This means that the boundaries between the viewer and the artist gradually disappear, and the space for art has the direction for ordinary life besides the conventional museums. So, what is the space for 'arts' that is so close to everyday life? To find out the answer of this question, this project analyzes the architectural typology of Dessau in Germany and adopts and changes it, hoping that the space of new art is not a just object but a 'space' that can 'encounter' in the city all the time. Understanding and application of 'city' and 'type' is the core methodology of the research. Here' understanding' refers to research and 'application' refers to the domain of design. When accumulated knowledge needs to accept the new possibility, it needs reasons. The project is being carried out in the Robotic Building of the Architectural Engineering Department. This project has a premise, the foundation of the fourth industrial revolution, that is, the development of robotic technology, based on the question of what changes can be made based on the changed background. The irresistible desire for change based on new technologies will rewrite the relationship between architecture and human beings, which will gradually be accepted to the 'context' of the city. Through these aspects, this project has reflected the chance to bridge between technology and design, history and philosophy, context and diversity.

However, the calculated energy savings for all energy labels do not correspond with the actual energy savings, which is partly due to user behavior. The occupants, not buildings, are the primary energy consumers because they behave proactively and to perform energy related tasks in order to seek comfortable personal conditions. The general aim of this research is to advance the knowledge base on ways of saving energy and increase indoor air quality by addressing user behavior characteristic with an automated building product.

By providing knowledge on thermal loss due to user behavior, occupants can implement such strategies to create more comfort while reducing their energy consumption. <br/><br/>This concept focuses on reducing the thermal loss due to the increase of the air change rate resulting from window operation. The additional energy consumption due to window operation during heating season can be significant, but is difficult to quantify.

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","Organ-on-chip (OoC) devices are increasingly used for biomedical research and to speed up the process of bringing a medicinal drug from the lab to the market. The technology also addresses ethical issues linked to animal testing as it offers a reduction in animal experiments through its possibility to mimic the environment in the human body. Hence, it produces more relevant results than plain cell-culture experiments, while still sharing the possibility of high-throughput testing by simultaneously operating many devices in parallel. The main components of an OoC device are microfluidic channels and porous membranes. Current chips are often assembled from several parts. In the development phase a small change in design will cause a delay in the research because a new prototype has to be built again step-by-step. This research addresses this problem by targeting the fabrication of a microfluidic device in a single lithography and development step. A device consisting of two crossed channels at different heights separated by a membrane was chosen. The manufacturing method used was two-photon lithography (TPL) on positive photoresist AZ 4562. TPL exploits the fact that two-photon absorption non-linearly depends on the light intensity. The required intensity is only achieved in a small volume around the focal point, called the voxel. By positioning and moving this voxel inside the resist, 3D manufacturing is possible. Therefore the technique can be used for the single step fabrication of a closed channel. By vertically moving the voxel through the resist, pores can be manufactured. In literature an ellipsoidal voxel shape is assumed, leading to the assumption that the maximum voxel, and therefore pore diameter is found at the focal plane, i.e. at z = 0. However, this research shows that the voxel may also have an hourglass-shape for a high enough laser intensity. In this case the maximum voxel diameter is found at a distance z from the focal plane. For the production of pores, therefore the maximum voxel diameter instead of the diameter at the focal plane has to be taken into account. The smallest pores produced measured 250 nm - 290 nm.

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","This project seeks to investigate the multiple materialisation approaches of timber as a construction material for a residential/mixed use building sited in Berlin, Germany. Seeing as there is a major housing crisis Europe wide with the added concern of the growing environmental concern, this proposal aims to be the embodiment of applied research in timber construction, combining both techniques of mass customisation as well as standardisation. The ethos is that while some aspects of the project must utilise innovative construction technologies such as robotics, other facets still rely on standardised components. This philosophy is rooted in that a complete overnight transition from one industrial construction methodology (standardisation) to a new era of mass customisation is too abrupt for the construction industry. Therefore a hybrid adaptation of both system within project, would be the methodology to tackle this issue and further advocate for how innovation in the construction industry can be hybridised rather than completely revamped. Furthermore, this research and development endeavour tackles the topic of housing which intuitively is a logical testing ground for this proof of concept. <br/><br/>The two main avenues of research in this project are the following: <br/>1: Discretised timber joinery system (mass standardisation)<br/>2: Large timber compression shells (mass customisation)<br/><br/>The goal being to utilise both methodologies only where appropriate. For example, areas of the building that are under large amounts of compression forces such as the timber shell anchors are fabricated though a method of robotic subtraction given a wooden bounding box. Other areas such as partition walls, flooring, and facade, utilise a more standard approach combining material strategies such as CLT, particle board and simple timber structural beams/girders that aggregate in an additive fashion.<br/><br/>Conclusively this project attempts to showcase the multiple use of timber as a construction material and how different treatments of this diverse and living material can encompass larger portions of the construction of a building then we originally thought. The idea being to reduce the amount of materials being used in a building as much as possible and advocating for timber being the construction material of the future especially when integrated with robotic building operations.<br","Timber; Computational Design; Architecture; Sustainable; Algorithm Design; Machine Learning; Python; C#; Houdini; Reciprocal; Wood Construction; Hyperbody","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Robotic Building","Robotic Building | Hyperbody","52.502143, 13.398826"

The rise of autonomous technology will allow us to get from a to b while being able to do other activities on the go. Challenges in change Although autonomous mobility will go hand in hand with many benefits, we still have challenges to overcome if we want to implement autonomous vehicles to their fullest potential. If we want to get rid of all the mobility problems we have today, such as congestion, traffic accidents, air pollution and parking limitations, autonomous vehicle rides should be shared. Ride-sharing will allow a larger part of our population to join the autonomous revolution, contributing to Ford’s goal to democratize mobility and increase the ease and speed of implementation in society. Ride-sharing For this to succeed, it is essential to understand peoples motivations to share (or not share) rides. Today’s mobility landscape in San Francisco allowed me to research current ride-sharing concepts. Here I experienced ride-sharing myself and interviewed relevant actors in the servicescape, to find that interpersonal contact is a substantial differentiator in the ride experience. Another main finding revolves around the drivers, whom we are trying to eliminate as we are moving towards an autonomous future. The roles the drivers take on besides enabling transport, bring essential values to the user experience. Scope After gathering extensive user insights during field research in San Francisco and learning about the potential positive effects of AV ride-sharing, I scoped the project to the daily commute in the Netherlands. This use case holds excellent potential for business, but more importantly, has the duration and frequency to make it worth to invest in the interpersonal relations amongst users. As well as diminishing the negative effects of human-driven vehciles (HDVs) on the daily commute in society. Acting-out By co-creating and acting-out shared concepts for the daily commute, I further explored the values and desires of future users. This has led to many insights, design qualities and a lot of funny moments. The raw insights are assembled in the additional deliverable: Session Booklet. The central findings are taken to the synthesis phase. Synthesis To bring all these insights together and make them communicable to Ford, this thesis holds multiple deliverables. Starting with the following vision statement: Autonomous Vehicle rides should be shared to maximally utilise the potential AVs have to offer to society. To successfully design shared AV rides for the daily commute, the service provider should gain individual insights to facilitate a common understanding amongst co-riders &amp; provide a sense of control for each user. This vision is visualized in a communicative drawing, showing a little bit, about a lot information. Since the user insights go much deeper than what can be shown in the drawing, a set of criteria for designing shared AV rides for the daily commute, is created too, showing a lot about a little bit. The criteria are accompanied with a user narrative. This narrative shows how users will experience their daily commute in an AV ride-sharing service, that is designed accordingly.","Autonomous Vehicles; Ride-Sharing; Service Design; Relational Design; Mobility","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-06-25","","","","Strategic Product Design","University Research Project Ford",""

Research has been conducted into the field of circularity and specifically on design for disassembly as a way to minimize building waste and on improving implementation of circularity by studying the building process and the actors that are involved or should be involved. By relying on case study research including interviews, conclusions were made that circularity is befitted by separability of layers, homogeneity of materials, standardization of dimensions, and fit to different life times. In general, circularity should be aimed at reducing, reusing and recycling building components and materials at both the start and end of a building’s life time. Regarding the improvement of circularity in practice, the following was concluded. Implementation of circularity is benefitted by early on involvement of the following circular-related actors: transformation agent, circularity expert, reclamation expert, dismantler, and legal officer. In order to increase their influence on decision-making these actors should become part of the project team, or at least be taken seriously and offered room to influence decision-making. Especially, if traditional actors lack knowledge and resources for implementing circularity. Moreover, contribution of their resources regarding circularity is facilitated, if these actors are involved early on. Thus, involvement of circular-related actors and traditional actors with circular-related resources early on and subsequent ability to influence and contribute to decision-making, facilitates implementation of circularity in the building process. This is especially of concern nowadays, since circularity has not yet become part of common knowledge of (all) involved actors. Based on findings from these theses a design has been made which concerns a transformation of an existing office building in Buitenveldert, Amsterdam into dwellings. The design demonstrates how circularity principles – such as demountable connections, standardization, prefab, separability of layers, etc. – could provide freedom to generate multiple types of apartments in which residents has the freedom to adjust or personalize the apartment by introducing freedom to change certain layers of the building.","circularity; sustainability; transformation; demountable; architecture; renovation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A system with a particle with spin 1/2, which represents a qubit, and detector is considered. The detector is modeled by a coordinate q, which has a Gaussian distribution with dispersion σ. There is the free evolution of the qubit and the interaction with the detector. Moreover, there are calculated algebraic expressions for the probabilities of the qubit to be in one of its states at certain moments in time by considering the wave function and density matrix at that time and consequently tracing out the detector coordinate q. Furthermore, there is done an analysis using plots of the evolution of these probabilities in time for different situations. In the situation with one continuous measurement and no free evolution, the qubit remains in its initial state, as expected.In the situation where periods of only free evolution and only measurements alternate, the probabilities keep the same value during the measurement, so then the evolution of the system freezes, and the probabilities evolve in a sine form during the free evolution, in line with the expectation.To neglect free evolution during the measurement, tm &lt;&lt; tev is assumed, so there are no series of fast subsequent measurements or a continuous measurement. In this case, the quantum Zeno effect does not occur.Furthermore, we consider the situation where periods of only free evolution and periods with a measurement during free evolution alternate. Now the oscillations continue in time, due to the ongoing free evolution. The larger the influence of the interaction between the qubit and detector during the measurement and the smaller the influence of the magnetic field of the free evolution, the higher the equilibirium position of the oscillations of the probability for the qubit to remain in its initial state is in time. Moreover, the amplitude of these oscillations is smaller. However, due to the free evolution the qubit always has a probability to undergo a transition to its other state. The continuous measurement does not freeze the evolution of the system totally. The quantum Zeno effect does not occur.In the situation where the dispersion σ of the detector coordinate q goes to 0, there is a perfect measurement. The larger σ, the larger the measurement error in the detector resulting in dissipation of the system. The oscillations of the probabilities damp in time.Recommendations for further research include plotting the evolution of the probabilities for a longer period in time with another integration tool. Also, it would be interesting to work out the assumptions done in this analysis to more realistic conditions. Furthermore, another distribution of the detector coordinate q and other qubit states might be interesting to work out in follow-up research.","Quantum Zeno; qubit; measurement; free evolution","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics | Applied Physics","",""

Since the awareness of climate change, planning departments are focusing on sustainable development in which the social, economic and environmental dimensions are combined. In the Netherlands, the naturally polluting building industry is designated as one of the critical sectors that need to change to a more circular way of working. In 2050 the Dutch government wants to be 100% circular. Circular urban area development can contribute to the achievement of these goals. Objective: This research aims to define the concept of circular urban area development by identifying and explaining the factors of circular urban area development and the management tools that can be used to apply them in Dutch practice. The research question that is answered: “What are the factors that contribute to the development of a circular urban area and how can these factors be managed in practice?”. These findings are summarized in a circular urban area development guideline. Methods: This research is divided in two parts. First, a literature review is done providing an overview of the physical components of a circular urban area development. Second, the circular urban area development factors and their management tools are investigated by conducting explorative interviews, case study analysis and an expert panel. Results: To define the concept of circular urban area development the concept of ‘adaptable buildings’ by Brand (1994) can be combined with the ecosystem approach of van Bueren (2012) creating an overview of the physical components of a circular urban area: (1) adaptable buildings (2) public space and (3) industrial flows: energy, water and materials. Further findings state that sustainable urban area development is closely related to circular urban area development. In the Randstad area, urban areas are being redeveloped because of the housing shortage. In these developments the concept of circularity is used as a condition for sustainable development. When special focus is set on implementing circularity, the development can be called a circular urban area development. Conclusions: Out of this theoretical and empirical research, six factors of circular urban area development can be distinguished that can be divided into two different cycles: building -and use-cycle. In the building-cycle the focus is on the lifecycles of building components and materials that are log and have long lifecycles. In the use-cycle the focus is on resources and products used on a daily-basis by the inhabitants of the urban area. These resources are characterized as volatile and have short life-cycles. The factors that are part of building-cycle are: (1) circular building material cycle and (2) spatially adaptive urban area. The factors that are part of the use-cycle are: (3) efficient energy system, (4) closed water-system (5) re-use, collection and logistics of waste and (6) stimulating the local economy. Applying these six factors in Dutch practice can be organized by the use of different management instruments. For every factor several possible management instruments found that make it possible to apply these factor in Dutch practice. These management instruments can be divided into four different groups: (1) legal instruments, (2) organizational instruments, (3) financial incentives and (4) design tools.","Circular economy; Circularity; Sustainable development; Sustainable urban area development; Circular urban area development","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","",""

Concurrent with these trends is the increase in computing power and near ubiquity of the smartphone. These technological developments create new opportunities to measure real-time space use. The service or product that can measure (real-time) space use is called a ‘smart tool’. There are some studies about smart tools, but these are not focussing on the integration in stadiums. This resulted in the following research question that will be addressed in this research: which smart tools can be identified in stadiums, and how can the use of these smart tools be optimized? Due to this nascent character of the research topic qualitative research is conducted, whereby literature is reviewed in combination with an exploratory case study. The case that is studied is the Johan Cruijff Arena in Amsterdam, the stadium has the ambition to be the most innovative stadium by 2020. Based on the case study, nine different smart tools are identified, whereby the main goals of the tools are to reduce costs and to support user activities. Based on the outcomes of this research it can be concluded that the integration of smart tools in stadiums are in their ‘infancy’. From these nine smart tool projects, only five were in use at the moment of the research, the other four were still under development. As a result, concrete numbers of the effects of integrating of smart tools are missing. However, the current experience of integrating smart tools in stadiums did generate some valuable insights on how the use of the tools can be optimized by linking the findings to innovations from practice. Recommendations are provided to guide stadium managers in the effective management of smart tools.

The present study aimed to clarify the effects of space holder particle size and volume fraction, on the pore structure, resultant mechanical properties and absorbability of iron scaffolds. <br/>Spherical iron particles were used as the matrix powder and mixed with coarse and fine rectangular urea space holding particles in volume fractions of 20, 40 and 60%, to create six different scaffolds with the space holder method. Scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy were used to observe the scaffolds surface. Thereafter x-ray microtomography and Archimedes’ tests were used to characterize the scaffolds topology. The absorbability of scaffolds was characterized by potentiodynamic polarization measurements and weight loss measurements after 3 and 11 of days immersion in modified simulated body fluid (m-SBF). Mechanical properties were determined by performing diametral compression of the scaffolds, both before and after immersion in m-SBF. SEM images showed that morphology of the final pores was similar to that of space holder particles. Pores at lower porosities are isolated and become more connective or fully connected at higher porosities. Archimedes’ data showed that space holder fraction was directly related to porosity. Pore connectivity, measured by 휇CT, is higher for fine space holding particles. Until at 60% space holder volume fraction, the high amount of space holder particles agglomerated. Furthermore, it was observed that space holding particles had a large preference to move in a plane perpendicular to the applied compaction pressure. Diametral compression showed that increasing porosity resulted in lower yield strength and elastic modulus of scaffolds. The effects of space holder particle size and immersion time on mechanical properties were less pronounced. PDP measurements showed that the corrosion mechanism of scaffolds did not change due to change in space holder particle size or volume fraction. Weight loss measurements after 3 and 11 day immersion in m-SBF showed that increasing porosity resulted in higher weight loss of scaffolds. Weight loss was marginally affected by space holder particle size. Space holder particle size affected the created pore size and surface area yet also changed the pore connectivity. Similarly, the space holder volume fraction affected the created porosity and pore connectivity yet also changed the pore size and shape. This means that the pore structure not independently changes due to space holder particle size or fraction, but rather as a combination of both. Furthermore, in this study it was mainly the created porosity that influenced the mechanical properties and absorption rate of the scaffold. Space holder particle size did not show the same differentiating results, although this might be caused by agglomerating space holder particles and its dependency on volume fraction. Differentiating the created pore structure more and using a longer immersion time should be the next objectives in the determination of the effect of space holder particles on the performance of absorbable iron scaffolds for orthopedic applications.","space holder; iron; scaffold; absorbable; biodegradable","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | BioMechanical Design","",""

This pushed the city to a Day Zero situation in 2018 implementing water restrictions on all residents of the city. But the scenario in the townships are different, these service and infrastructure deficit spaces are always and constantly in ‘drought’ like environment with limited water usage and informal areas within them with no access to water. In many ways, it can be defined as two parallel worlds. The spatial development of the city much dictated by its past apartheid mechanism has led to development of townships on the periphery and on vulnerable landscapes. These landscapes fall under the biodiversity hotspots of the city which are inaccessible, abused or undervalued. The lack of addressing socio-ecological systems in the city’s water management has further increased the inequality in townships, therefore, requiring an integrated engagement of social, hydrological and landscape processes in disaster risk reduction and in building resilience for the city, townships and biota. The research question of the project investigates on how landscape-based strategies and design principles can be applied to mitigate the drought and social inequity in townships by reinforcing inter-scalar spatial planning toward water resilience &amp; ecosystems restoration in Cape town. Three main lenses of landscape, water and townships are used in project elaboration with theoretical underpinnings that account for resilience, socio-ecological systems, operationalizing landscapes and considering townships as ethnic enclaves. Key conclusions to frame a vision for the city through in-depth spatial analysis of the natural &amp; social systems of the city, followed by narrowing of micro scale locations – Kuils river and Khayelitsha township. Systems interaction between the river and township are explored to design a landscape infrastructure to increase water resilience and local adaptation measures to capture, purify and reuse, to attain circularity by involving the community. The project further explains ways to spatialize and implement such ideas at neighbourhood level through two zones at Khayelitsha wetlands and Dunes at Enkanini informal settlement to create new socio-ecological possibilities and water security. Therefore, through multi-scalar and systems approach the landscape infrastructure design addresses the questions of social inequity, drought and environmental degradation to create an inclusive and resilient city.","Landscape infrastructure; informality; water equity; cape town","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Landscape Architecture","","-33.918861, 18.423300"

Because of the rapid development of technology, many systems are being automated or even becoming autonomous. Autonomous means that the system is able to perform each task automatically without any human intervention. Much research has been conducted to find answers to the way autonomous vehicles might impact cities. However, the results of this research are limited in practical application, because the integration of autonomous systems is still in an early stage and there have not been many integration projects in the world yet. In the Netherlands, more and more pilot projects are being established to explore the impact and applicability of driverless vehicles. As such, this exploratory study analyses how autonomous vehicles have been integrated during the autonomous vehicle transition in the Netherlands. Alongside qualitative research methods including desk research and semi-structured interviews, an analysis framework is designed and used as a means to measure the technical, social, environmental, and regulatory challenges represented in five case studies. The results show that the main challenges are, among others, road obstacles, intersections, weather implications, communication between the shuttle and other traffic flows, communication between the project team and the inhabitants of the area, and restrictions from the Dutch Vehicle Authority. Challenges such as weather implications, road obstacles, and intersections occur in each project. Looking at the current technological developments, there are autonomous vehicles that can pass intersections and obstacles already. The inability to deal with these challenges could be explained by the high costs of the technology.<br","Autonomous cars; Artificial Intelligence; Connected Vehicles; Intelligent Transport Systems","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Management in the Built Environment","",""

Both scenarios lead to improvements in health, tourism and employment. The primary school enrolment rates remained the same over time for both scenarios. Road safety increases for both scenarios due to upgrades to bitumen, but the extent to which it increases depends on the extra measures that are taken with regards to road safety. It can be increased more by campaigns or more controls. Emissions go up in both scenarios, because emissions are a direct result of constructing and upgrading roads.

Energy demand in a non-residential existing building is rising due to higher comfort conditions, population growth and the enhancement of the building services. On the other hand, renewable energy technologies are every time more accessible for the built environment, especially the ones that use the sun as their primary energy source. The difference between that energy demand and that production of energy in existing buildings is causing a mismatch of energy that needs to be solved if problems such as an increase in the electricity bills, an oversized energy grid or the dependence on fossil fuels want to be avoided. Currently there is not research on how to reduce the mismatch in non-residential existing buildings; therefore, this research aims to be the beginning of the exploration of this topic. By matching the energy demand and the energy produced at any point of time within the building boundary, the building will be energy flat. During this research, the renovation of a case study building towards energy flatness was proposed. A three steps strategy was proposed to reduce energy demand, produce renewable energy and integrate a complementary energy system in existing buildings that want to be renovated towards a full energy balance and a renovation proposal of a case study building towards energy flatness. As a result, energy flatness in the renovation of non-residential existing buildings is limited to the extent of their physical and functional parameters which restrains the energy demand, production and distribution. Furthermore, the three steps strategy helped to reduce the energy mismatch and is relevant because the energy mismatch problem is going to be every time more visible in the built environment.","Energy demand; Energy supply; Renewable Energy Integration; energy storage system; energy flatness; energy mismatch; energy balance; solar energy intermittency; Sustainable Energy; Energy Efficiency; energy flow; Energy Reduction; Energy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Building Technology | Sustainable Design","",""

We introduce an adapted version of the Wasserstein Distance (Earth-Movers distance) and use this along with the Inception score to evaluate the performance of the Generator. We evaluate different network types for the GAN, parameter spaces and GAN attributes (such as the number of input nodes and input distributions) on lower-dimensional samples (sine curves and Gaussian curves). To investigate the capabilities of a GAN to learn samples with low probability (extreme scenarios), we evaluate the capabilities of a Conditional GAN to generate in-sample data and out-of-sample data, since extreme scenarios are likely to be non-present in the training data. The results were that a GAN is able to interpolate learned concepts but performs badly in extrapolating.

A current practice to do so, which we consider the baseline, is a combination of a displaced log-transform, bootstrapping and Principal Component Analysis.

This process not only provides the possibility of regenerating potential of the post-mining area, but also increases resilience of the water system.

This new growth is dynamic. It continuously changes the light, smells, sight-lines and experiences throughout the seasons. Together with the diversity of open and enclosed spaces and the sense of “untidiness”, the forest possesses countless surprising sight-lines and secrets. The silent, decaying buildings are the memory of the forest, revealing its age by time-layers of buildings like the annual rings of a tree. They are testaments to its former function with their interiors yet secluded from the outside world, harbouring the spirits of the place and has one wonder about the stories the walls would tell if they could.. This unique forest stirs the imagination, sense of discovery and invites to explore. Therefore it seems natural that the first pioneers of the creative industry have settled in this area because much like the forest, they prosper best in a regulation-free area. By colonising and organically changing the place into a beautiful new layer of time, comparable to NDSM-Werf in Amsterdam or the more extreme anarchistic example of Christiania in Copenhagen.

Within this frame the main question that the master plan of the Plofbos deals with is: How can the master plan amplify these newly emerged natural qualities and reinforce and stimulate further this process of growth?

(graduation committee); Isabella, O. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","The need for research of PV system performance in urban areas is increasing as more and more PV systems are installed each year. To facilitate this research, a PV monitoring station is constructed on the campus of the TU Delft in a complex urban geometry. Unfortunately, the diffuse horizontal irradiance (DHI) measurements that are measured using a pyranometer are corrupted due to a non-free horizon and reflections from the environment. To correct the pyranometer measurements for this reflected irradiance, an accurate reflected irradiance model is required. The research described in this report proposes a reflected irradiance model that includes both the first and the second order of reflections. The model is worked out analytically and it was found that de-coupling of the contributions of direct and diffuse irradiance is possible. Due to this de-coupling, the correction of pyranometer measurements can be done using an analytical formula instead of an iterative process. Methods are developed to obtain all the required inputs for this reflected irradiance model. The first of these methods shows that a horicatcher picture taken in diffuse conditions can be used to obtain both the view factors and the reflectivities of all surfaces contributing to the reflected irradiance on any surface that is visible in the horicatcher picture. The second developed method shows that the amount of irradiance received by each surface at any time can be determined by constructing raised horizon profiles for each of the surfaces that contribute to the reflected irradiance using LiDAR data. Both developed methods are proven<br/>to be reliable for studies that aim to determine the amount or reflected irradiance. All required inputs to the reflected irradiance model are obtained for two receiving surfaces on the PVMD monitoring station, located at the campus of TU Delft. These two receiving surfaces correspond to the locations of two pyranometers. This way, the reflected irradiance as captured by a pyranometer can be modeled. For both of these receiving surfaces, the model gives two outputs. A diffuse reflectivity factor, a fixed factor that determines the amount of diffuse irradiance that is reflected to the receiving surface, and a direct reflectivity factor that determines the amount direct irradiance that is reflected onto the receiving surface. This direct reflectivity factor depends on the location of the sun and can be presented in a reflectance sensitivity image (RS-image), a new developed representation that shows how the environment contributes to the reflected direct irradiance, depending on the location of the sun. The diffuse and<br/>direct reflectivity factors can be used together with the measured irradiances to compute the reflected irradiance at any given time. The model was validated using KNMI DHI measurements. It was found that the proposed method for correcting pyranometer measurements results in 4 times more accurate results than the original measured data, reducing the %RMSE from 25.0% to 6.3% for a clear day in May. The reflected irradiance model was validated by comparing measured reflected irradiance to the modeled reflected irradiance. It was found that for a clear day, the second order reflected irradiance model can predict the reflected irradiance with a %RMSE of 4.39%, whereas a fixed albedo model and<br/>the first order reflected irradiance model both resulted in worse predictions with a %RMSE of 32.57% and 23.16%, respectively. It is thus concluded that introducing a second order of reflections in the reflected irradiance model reduces the %RMSE with a factor of 5 for a clear day. During the process it was found that designing a validation for the reflected irradiance model and for the pyranometer correction<br/>method was a difficult and complex problem on itself. Both the validations that were performed were found to be valid only under certain conditions. The isotropic sky assumption proved to be insufficiently accurate for predicting the irradiance on a vertical surface for overcast conditions or when there is a direct component on the vertical surface. This resulted in insufficiently accurate calculations of the reflected irradiance for these conditions. Validations was performed only for clear sky conditions. A validation method that works also for cloudy and overcast conditions should be designed for further validation of the reflected irradiance model and the pyranometer correction model. Besides that, also a uncertainty analysis should be performed for more insights in the obtained results.","reflected; irradiance; albedo; pyranometer; corrections; complex; urban; geometry; reflections","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-06-24","","","","","",""

We found permissioned and permissionless consensus algorithms that offer solutions that consume significantly less energy than Proof of Work.","Blockchain; Bitcoin; Byzantine fault tolerant; Consensus algorithms; Cryptocurrency; Energy cost; permissionless; Proof of Work; Proof of Stake","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science and Engineering","CSE3000 Research Project",""

This project aims to find out how to create the desired experience for KLM passengers during undesired disruptions. This problem has been tackled with the use of the Double Diamond approach enriched with the ViP approach. KLM Royal Dutch Airlines is the flag carrier airline of the Netherlands with the ambition to become Europe’s most customer-centric, innovative and efficient network carrier. To achieve this ambition, they have to make significant steps forward. KLM decided to do this by striving for operational excellence, creating a long term sustainable growth with products that both stimulate efficiency and provide customer intimacy. At their new department, Operation Decision Support, they embraced this by becoming more data-driven by creating tools to optimize the operation of KLM.<br/>While the airline industry is progressively optimizing and KLM is facing strong competition, there is one area that remains relatively uncharted. What happens to the passengers when disruptions occur? There are many types of disruptions, varying from individual level to operational level. Unexpected mass disruptions, often caused by bad weather, are challenging to solve and result in disastrous customer experience results. During these unexpected disruptions, the Net Promoter Score, which measures the passengers’ satisfaction and thus the loyalty for the firm drops drastically. To increase passenger satisfaction, KLM should improve their service recovery when operational disruptions occur. This can be done by giving the passenger their ‘perceived justice’ which depends on the offer they get, the procedure and the interaction. Pinpointing the needs of the passenger is unfortunately very difficult since every passenger is different: they have different mindsets and travel for different occasions. With the use of a qualitative research method; adaptive storytelling, the passenger needs are found and translated to the perceived justice framework. The presented solution offering the perceived justice to the passenger is called ’Emma’, an automated, digital, ground attendant integrated into the KLM application. She enables passengers to solve their disrupted journey by pro-actively sharing information, offering solutions and giving recommendations. This application is equipped with cognitive abilities; natural language processing, machine learning and intelligent automation to create a personal and tailor-made experience via a mobile device. The application ‘Emma’ shows the potential to increase the NPS score and therefore, the passengers’ satisfaction during operational disruptions. ‘Emma’ includes many features that enable the passenger to be in control, gives them the feeling of being taken care of and shows the responsibility of KLM by giving detailed and transparent information, giving personalised rebooking options and showing tips to spend their waiting time better. Creating an application requires the involvement and resources of third parties. This takes time, and therefore, the implementation plan is separated in two years. The first year is focussed on aligning the different teams within KLM and building the features with the available internal resources. The second year, the application will be extended and further optimised with the use of third-party resources. This will enable KLM to launch a service that will be relevant in the future and give the passengers a satisfying service recovery during unexpected operational disruptions.","Design; ServiceDesign; ExperienceDesign; Operation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

Firstly, to understand the overall situation of current flying experience, data were gathered from three co-creation sessions and a survey of 128 participants with experience of long-haul flights. Negative observations related mainly to physical discomfort and feelings of boredom. While social interaction was important for some passengers, it was generally superseded by the need for privacy. Relaxation was seen as important as well by the passengers. In-flight entertainment was frequently dissatisfactory, and eating was something passengers looked forward to and viewed as a type of entertainment. Some suggestions are made as to how these findings could be integrated into future aircraft design. Hygiene, a small part of the trip can also influence the experience of the entire trip. Co-creation sessions and online surveys were conducted again with a focus of hygiene/refreshing experience. The main complaints for current situation were: long queue, small space, low and small basin, nowhere to put personal belongings, unfriendly door, lighting condition and etc. Base on people's preference studied in the research, different conditions on seat, light, basin, storage,facility were build with VR technology for a experiments. 28 participants were involved and their contribution inspired the final design of a new hygiene space which is separated from toilet was created.

By increasing the bathymetry locally, an increase of local accumulation is expected and a decrease deeper in the harbour basin. This thesis describes the functioning of sediment traps in a stratified tidally energetic estuary, where sediment is supplied by the river and sea. A numerical 2DV representation is set up for the Botlek Harbour with the hydrostatic Delft3D software. A calculated salinity time-series by Operationeel Stromingsmodel Rotterdam (OSR) is combined with a measured water level time series for the same time period to describe the hydrodynamic boundary conditions. Simulations are done with a variable and constant Suspended Particulate Matter (SPM) time series boundary conditions, that were generated based on the measurements of De Nijs (2012). Flow expansion caused by the sediment trap reduces the flow velocity, but increases the turbulent kinetic energy locally. A reduction of bed shear stress is observed in the trap, except near the edges where an increase is observed. Density currents caused by salinity differences govern the vertical flow velocity distributions, while tidal filling causes the net exchange. The depth of the trap plays a significant role in the internal flow characteristics. The sediment trap changes the properties of the internal flow, which may change the hydraulic state of the flow, i.e. from supercritical to subcritical, resulting in large instabilities and even an internal hydraulic jump. Shallow sediment traps result in less frequent internal hydraulic jump and weaker jumps compared to deeper sediment traps. To investigate the dominant mechanism for the trapping of sediment in the sediment trap, a distinction is made between an erosion and a fluid mud scenario. The erosion scenario shows the largest agreement with the survey data, i.e. maintenance dredging data and Echosounder multibeam surveys, but contribute only marginally to the trapping of sediment. The fluid mud scenario yields the largest contribution to the trapping of sediment. The decreased amounts of accumulated sediment in the basin for substantial to lots of fluid mud behaviour may vary between 10% and 14%, depending on how this fluid mud behaviour is modelled. Various shapes have been tested on erosion and fluid mud scenarios. Both for erosion and fluid mud a more extreme choice of parameters might yield also more extreme results, this is however not considered realistic. The creation of an overdepth has shown to result in a marginal improvement in the capturing of sediment in an environment where erosion is important. A regular sediment trap decreases accumulation in the harbour basins by 2%. A trap twice as shallow increases this amount to 4%, but deepening the trap further may even enhance accumulation in the basins. A shorter or longer trap did not improve the situation. Installation of a sill did however result in a decrease of 6% compared to the situation without trap. It is concluded that this effect can be largely contributed to the internal flow properties and the presence of internal hydraulic jumps. The presence of an overdepth results in a significant improvement in the capturing of fluid mud flow. For the trapping of fluid mud flow, an overdepth results in 6% less sediment in the harbour basins no matter the depth or shape of the trap. The length of the trap did influence the accumulation in the basins. A trap twice as short shows an increase of 4 % of accumulation in the basins compared to a regular trap. A trap twice as long or installation of a sill results in similar accumulation in the harbour basins as a regular trap. For fluid mud flows, any type of overdepth decreases accumulation of sediment considerably. The amount of overdepth or the shape does not influence this. The length of the trap should be sufficient. A trap that is too short results in an increase of accumulation in the basins. For environments where erosion is important, only shallow sediment traps have proven to reduce accumulation in the basins. Traps that are too deep actually increase accumulation in the basins. A sill has proven to be the best measure for both mechanisms. If overdepth is desirable for navigation a shallow sediment trap is advised. This leads to a reduction of accumulation in the harbour basins for both erosion and fluid mud scenarios.","Sediment traps; Siltation traps; Supercritical; Stratification; Stratified; Harbour siltation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","",""

Such a location is the small Mediterranean island of Cyprus. Designing an ideal radiative cooler is a challenging task and so it is to design an appropriate system that exploits the benefits of DRC. In such a design, a stratified thermal storage water tank can have a detrimental role. To identify whether it is possible to apply such a system in Cyprus, this project exploits the use of Matlab Simulink which has been used to run more than 6000 simulations, for a sensitivity and a varied analysis, taking into consideration different parameters with particular emphasis on the physical properties of the radiative cooling apparatus According to the data obtained, for the efficiency of a daytime radiative system to be maximized, the longwave transmission and emissivity coefficients of the cooler should be maximal while the shortwave transmission coefficient and the effective heat transfer coefficient to the environment should be minimal.

It proves to be highly variable in both time and space. In this thesis the impact of the schematisation of time-dependent discharge series on morphodynamic change is studied. The impact is governed by several factors such as the long-term discharge statistics, and both short- and long-term sequences of discharge stages. A variable river discharge itself does not necessarily result in morphodynamic change. Changes in conveyance area and roughness are dominant sources of bed fluctuations and bed waves. Moreover, backwater dominated segments are subject to mild fluctuations in the river bed. The combination of natural variation of hydrological processes in the upstream river catchment and the absence of a significant correlation among statistical characteristics of subsequent years makes it hard for river engineers to construct discharge time series for river models that simulate morphodynamic development. The limited predictability of future discharge time series is an important source of uncertainty in model predictions. A way to estimate this uncertainty is by means of a time-consuming Monte Carlo approach, resulting in a mean long-term morphodynamic trend and the associated uncertainty. An alternative method is the application of a deterministic series for which the long-term discharge statistics are translated into a cycled annual hydrograph (CAH). It is expected to yield similar morphodynamic changes with respect to the mean trend from the Monte Carlo approach without the need for a large number of computations. However, as is demonstrated in this study, the CAH-method lacks in performance in simulating average long-term development and the amplitude of fluctuations in the river bed, especially at locations where strong sediment transport gradients are experienced. Using a simplified two-dimensional model that represents a locally widened floodplain, the impact of the included bandwidth, short-term and long-term sequences on morphodynamic change is investigated. The aim is to improve the deterministic hydrograph schematisation and to find a more convenient way to get insight into uncertainty in simulated morphodynamics. These findings result in a set of recommendations for future schematisations of discharge time series in morphodynamic river models. An improved deterministic approach is proposed. Using historical measurements of daily discharge data, years with a similar statistical maximum, mean and standard deviation can be classified. The classified years are translated into multiple cycled annual hydrographs (MCAH). By using these hydrographs, synthetic time series are constructed. Compared to the CAH-approach, the proposed MCAH-method yields a significant reduction of the root mean square error with respect to the long-term average morphodynamic trend from the Monte Carlo simulations. Moreover, the MCAH-series result in amplitudes of bed fluctuations that are closer to the response to natural discharge time series. Finally, the MCAH-series can be used to give a rough indication of the uncertainty in future morphodynamics.","River morphodynamics; Variable discharge; Morphodynamic model; Long-term time series; Hydrograph","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","",""

The approximate model gave a relatively quick approximation of the optimal solution when we do not consider skills, and when we do consider skills and vary the weight for the first part of the objective function.

One Planet is the main exhibition of the Museon and is based on the seventeen sustainable development goals of the United Nations. The project focused on families with children between 8-12, the main target group of Museon. Research on the current visitor experience showed that there is a lack of opportunity for families to reflect the content on their own daily lives, and to talk about the subjects. Besides, the exhibition did not sufficiently encouraged visitors to take actions to contribute to sustainable development. Literature research was done on two main themes: how to facilitate dialogue and reflection in a museum environment and how to promote sustainable attitudes and behavior. This resulted in a set of design principles that were used as guidelines during the design process. Dialogic participation was placed central to the development of the final concept. The final concept, Expedition One Planet, consists of thematic journeys through the exhibition and the surrounding exhibition rooms. A thematical focus enhances the learning experience as it provides guidance and introduces a goal for the visit. It gives visitors the opportunity to engage with, and discuss a subject for a longer time. An outline for the expeditions was created demonstrating the elements that are part of each expedition: a booklet, exploration boards, question boards and the end point where visitors can write down and share a sustainable challenge. The elements are the same, but the content differs per theme. One theme was elaborated to illustrate and test the concept. Eight families tested the design. The concept proved promising in providing a meaningful learning experience for both adults and children. Due to the thematical focus parents felt more motivated to explain information to their children and the activity stimulated the family members to explore the exhibition together instead of separately. The elements that included dialogic participation, the question board with a multiple choice question and writing a challenge, did stimulate visitors to reflect on their own behavior and to discuss the subjects with their family members. The sharing of challenges was seen as a potential source of information for sustainable behavior. Equally important, the elements of the expedition were perceived as enjoyable and interesting by the families. Further development is required, but the concept is feasible and has the ability to make visitors feel more involved in the global issues presented in One Planet.","Families; Museon; Museum learning; Sustainable development; Design for dialogue","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

The thesis conducted interviews with high-ranked managers of both the clients and contractors of the three cases to gain insights from both sides. The results of the subsequent qualitative content analysis showed that contact moments can be optimized to create more value in three different ways. The first is by introducing so called 'collaboration programs'. This program contains deep and frequent meetings between both the public and private organization where discussions on personal matters and soft factors take place, as well as workshops on these topics. The second optimization is to improve the contact moment structure of DBFM projects. This can be done by: having daily informal contact moments and bi-weekly or monthly formal contact moments, have easy access to informal contact moments by being in the same or adjacent buildings, have frequent BOT-meetings, Project Start-Ups and Project Follow-Ups. The third optimization is to improve single contact moments.

(graduation committee); Prumpeler, Maurice (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","Lately structural safety is an often discussed subject in The Netherlands. Recent collapses have made people question if our buildings are actually safe enough. Research shows that the individual probability of death due to structural failure is below the limit of 10-5 per year. However, it is unknown if every single building is safe enough as well. The main cause of structural failures are human errors (90% of the collapses). However, the Dutch Building Decree does not mention the unidentified accidental actions (the type the human errors belong to) as those an engineer has to take into account when designing the building structure. The Eurocode does mention unidentified accidental actions and states that for consequence class 3 buildings a risk assessment has to be done to check which accidental actions are hazardous and if the total risk to a building is acceptable. However, the Eurocode does not give a maximum value of an acceptable risk in their risk assessment method. So currently when engineers perform a risk assessment, they cannot verify whether the risks of accidental actions on their designed structure are acceptable according to the regulations. This thesis conducts research for a new method for performing a risk assessment in a quantitative way. First it investigates what the advantages and disadvantages of existing methods for performing a risk assessment are. It appears that the main step missing in existing methods is the verification, based on a quantified limit, whether the risks of accidental actions are acceptable. Based on the known methods, a new protocol for performing a risk assessment is proposed. This protocol includes a determined limit for the probability an accidental action occurs and causes a certain failure mechanism and consequence. This limit is based on the maximum probability the Eurocode gives for failures with a consequence indicated as consequence class 1, 2 and 3 (CC1, CC2 and CC3). By dividing the accidental actions that can occur and their failure mechanisms into the same consequence classes, the estimated probability and the limit of the Eurocode can be compared. In this way the known consequence classes from the Eurocode are used in another way than engineers are used to. Furthermore research on past structural failures has been investigated to establish whether it can be used to predict the probability a certain accidental action causes a CC1, CC2 or CC3 consequence. Not enough research is done to fully trust on these outcomes; in the protocol proposed in this thesis the engineer will have to estimate a part of the probabilities himself, with the help of a classification table. The principal advantage of performing a risk assessment on accidental actions in a quantitative way with a prescribed maximum probability per consequence class, is that it is made clear whether a building fulfills the requirements or not. This can be helpful for communication with other involved parties. However, it will never be 100% clear what the limit should be, because estimating the risks is based on the engineer’s estimations and outcomes may differ as they depend on the person performing the risk assessment. This means a hard line, below which the risks are acceptable and above the risks are considered too high, cannot be drawn. An area in between is needed in which it is up to the engineer and client to decide whether or not they find the risks acceptable.","Risk assessment; Accidental actions; Quantitative analysis; Structural safety; Risk Management","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Building Engineering","",""

The mechanisms consist of flexural and rigid parts, where the flexural components can serve as flexible joints between rigid bodies in the device (e.g., finger and finger segments). This configuration is feasible to be fabricated using a type of additive manufacturing called Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM) process, without the need of further assembly and extensive post-processing. Knowledge of the mechanical characteristics of such mechanisms, however, is still limited. Therefore, this study presents the strength and fatigue characteristics of bi-material compliant mechanisms to determine the feasibility of applying the mechanisms in the upper-limb prosthesis for long-term use. The basis of the mechanisms was a configuration of two rigid clamps and a flexible beam that were automatically assembled during manufacturing. Two materials selections (PLA-TPU and Tough PLA-TPU) and three geometries (rectangular, cylindrical, and tapered-shaped interface) were used to create six groups of samples. These groups were subjected to tensile testing and fatigue testing to assess their strength and fatigue behavior. The results of mechanical testing were also verified with the results of finite element simulation. It was found that four groups fulfilled the strength requirement, which were mechanisms in both material configurations with cylindrical and tapered-shaped interface. These groups, however, failed to demonstrate their durability during fatigue testing. Finally, the proposed method of fabrication and mechanical testing as well as the obtained mechanical characteristics of the mechanisms were analyzed to give insights for future development.","Additive Manufacturing; Compliant Mechanisms; Mechanical Testing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

However, more than 90% of traffic accidents are due to human errors, of which approximately half appear to be due to perceptual errors. Especially at busy and complex intersections that have a high density of visual stimuli. This poses a high demand for accurate measurement of the driver's situation awareness, for real-world driver monitoring. Eye tracking seems to be an ideal method to determine what the driver has or has not seen, since people tend to look at what they inquire information from. The main objective of this thesis assignment was therefore to develop a platform that combines the driver's gaze behaviour in combination with the vehicle's road scene perception, to set up a real-world driving experiment to gather such data on the road, and to come up with a proof of concept that gaze behaviour combined with situational knowledge can be predictive of SA. The platform developed consisted of an eye-tracker with four cameras constructed in the available Toyota Prius of the department of Intelligent Vehicles, which is equipped for self-driving. The driver's gaze was layered over the object identification data from the vehicle, to see which objects are looked at or fixated upon and which are not. A real-world driving experiment was then conducted in which participants (N = 14) performed a driving task and a recall task. The driving task consisted of 8 intersection crossings in which mostly left turns were made to manoeuvre the vehicle off a main priority road. After each crossing, the participants performed a recall task in which they had to select images of the object they encountered during the driving task. The results showed that 88.1% of all relevant objects they encountered were seen with central vision, of which 41.8% were recalled. The remainder 11.9% of all relevant objects that were not seen, have only been in peripheral view, of which 18.2% were recalled. These preliminary results indicate that at least 2.2% (18.2% of 11.9%) of relevant objects are perceived by the driver using peripheral vision. The variables seen, first saccade angle and first saccade moment contributed significantly to a prediction model that predicted whether a relevant object would be recalled by the driver. The variables fixation count, total glance duration and saccade count were not significant predictor variables. The conclusion was drawn that the results of this exploratory research confirmed that gaze behaviour combined with situational knowledge can be predictive of driver SA. However, a crucial recommendation for future research is an improved recall task procedure to obtain higher recall rates and therefore more accurate prediction of SA. This outcome could be of great value for future research and development of applications that assist or steer the driver's attention to possible threats or objects the driver is missing or not focusing on.","Eye Tracking; Autonomous driving; Situation Awareness; Real-world driving","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although several studies on AVs have been conducted, most of these studies focus on the AV technology or on the driver, while there is less emphasis on how these AVs could interact and communicate with other road users. The interactions of vulnerable road users with AVs versus Conventional Vehicles (CVs) or the amount of trust in AVs versus in CVs, can be different. Due to the high fatality and injury rates and the large number of cyclists in the Netherlands, this research will focus on cyclists. Currently, there is little knowledge about cyclists’ behaviour, interacting with these AVs. The main goal of this study is to investigate whether the crossing behaviour of cyclists differs when interacting with an AV compared to a CV. An experiment in Virtual Reality has been performed to study crossing decisions of participants when interacting with both AVs and CVs. Multiple scenarios were shown to the participants, who could either choose to: ‘continue cycling’, ‘cycle faster’ or ‘slow down’. A mixed model with repeated measures was estimated to identify which variables influence participants’ crossing decisions. The included variables were: vehicle type, gap distance, crossing priority, risk taking, stated trust and the interaction between the vehicle type and stated trust. The results show that there is no significant difference in the crossing decision between the two types of vehicles when the total group of participants is considered. However, when participants are divided into groups based on their stated trust in AVs, significant statistical differences were observed in the crossing behaviour between the two types of vehicles. Participants who have more trust in AVs compared to CVs, crossed more often in front of AVs. The ones who trusted AVs less, choose to slow down more often in front of the AVs. The awareness of the type of vehicle increased their preference based on their stated trust even more and made the differences in the crossing behaviour between the groups bigger. This study shows that cyclists adapt their behaviour when interacting with AVs, based on their amount of trust in AV technology. These findings are important to reminisce for the continuous developing of AV technology. Furthermore, additional research can build upon this study to formulate a policy on AVs. To see how the behaviour of cyclists will evolve in the future, more research about the learning effects of interacting with AVs is necessary.","Automated vehicles; cyclists; crossing behaviour; Interactions; Virtual Reality","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Transport and Planning","",""

To deal with intermittent energy production, different energy technologies and solutions are in development. Hydrogen is a main candidate for this goal. Using Fuel Cell or Battery Electric Vehicles as flexible power plants is a second potential solution. This thesis explores how these two concepts can be combined in an office environment. The goal was to design an effective, integrated energy and mobility system making use of renewable energy only. A simulation model was written to carry out techno-economic analyses on a set of concept system designs. These systems were designed in accordance with three scenarios that were analysed for two future years, 2025 and 2050. The scenarios were: hydrogen-based systems, electricity-based systems and combined systems. The model was applied to a case study of the Shell Technology Center Amsterdam, an office building in the Netherlands. In addition, the same analysis was done for a hypothetical case study featuring an average office building in the Netherlands. The results of each simulation are compared mainly by their System Levelized Cost of Energy, for which electricity, gas and thermal demands are taken into account. In the 2050 scenario, the system levelized cost for a hydrogenbased system is 0.056 €/kWh, for an electricity-based system it is 0.077 €/kWh, and for a combined system it is 0.049 €/kWh. The findings of this thesis implicate that hydrogen is a viable alternative to use as an energy carrier in office buildings and for seasonal storage of renewable energy. It can be used in combination with cars as power plants, which are mainly suitable for hourly energy balancing.","Hydrogen; Intermittency; Renewable Energy; Techno-economic analysis; Car as Power Plant","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

A custom made bicycle mock-up equipped with a system of sensors has been developed, capable of measuring the linear accelerations, angular velocity and the rider’s force responses in all translational axes of all bicycle interfaces. The bicycle mock-up is driven by a hexapod that generates coloured noise perturbations in the range 0–10 Hz. Twenty four healthy male adults participated in this study and gave informed consent according to the guidelines of the ethical committee of Delft University of Technology. The responses of all subjects are represented in the frequency domain by means of frequency response functions. More specific, the interaction of the rider’s body at the seat, foot pegs and handlebars are expressed in terms of apparent mass and as seat-to-sternum transmissibility functions (STS). The apparent mass and STS transfer functions for the surge and heave motion suggest a simple underlying passive response system. For surge, a clear resonance peak was found at 2 Hz for nearly all interfaces and directions, whereas, for the heave motion a clear resonance peak at 5 Hz was found for the seat and handlebars and a resonance peak at 6 Hz for the foot pegs. The apparent mass of the pitch and yaw motion also suggest, to a certain extend, simple passive dynamics after 1 Hz characterised by resonance peaks at 1.8 and 2.3 Hz, respectively. Only the corresponding yaw STS transfer function showed a resonance peak around 2.3 Hz, as well. The sway and roll motion do not suggest simple passive dynamics showing similar trends in apparent mass characterised by an ever-decreasing gain and no resonance peaks. Finally, the surge, heave, pitch and yaw apparent mass transfer functions suggest that higher body mass in general yields higher peak magnitude and lower resonance frequency. This effect was most apparent for the surge motion.","bicycle dynamics; apparent mass; transmissibility; whole-body vibration; rider identification","en","master thesis","","","","","","The thesis will be defended on June 20, 2019.","","","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

A set of fluvial meandering models has been generated using FLUMY. The models represent a range of Net-to-Gross ratios and sandstone body geometries. In order to quantify the effect of sample size on effective properties, the models are evaluated based on the statistical moments of the probability distributions of porosity and single-phase permeability as a function of sample size. The porosity and permeability show a high spread at small sample volumes, but the spread reduces as the sample size increases. A normalized standard deviation, the coefficient of variation, has been used as a criterion for the variability of the probability distributions. The coefficient of variation of the porosity and the horizontal permeability show a monotonic decline as a function of sample size. The coefficient of variation of the vertical permeability does not show a monotonic decline. This is caused by a drastic decrease of the mean of the vertical permeability with increasing sample volume. The mean of the horizontal permeability also decreases with increasing sample size, but to a lesser extent. The mean of the probability distributions of permeability as a function of sample size converges much earlier than the standard deviation. This convergence indicates that we can determine the effective properties at the Representative Elementary Volume (REV), without reaching REV. The convergence of the mean could potentially be used as a criterion for the relevant spatial scale of upscaling from the fine scale static model to the coarse scale model. Furthermore, if cells are uncorrelated at a scale where the mean of the permeability is not a function of sample volume anymore, random attribution of properties can be used to populate dynamic grid cells.","Representative Elementary Volume; effective properties; permeability; porosity; fluvial deposits; FLUMY; connectivity; Sandstone; claystone; geometry","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Earth Sciences","",""

(mentor); Keijdener, C. (graduation committee); Antonakas, Panagiotis (graduation committee); Hendrickx, P. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","Offshore wind farms are moving to deeper waters, implying that larger substructures will need to be installed. The monopile is the leading substructure nowadays and this structure could be promising for use in deeper waters as well. Generally, jack-up vessels are used for the installation of the substructures and turbines. However, the jacking up and down of these vessels is time-consuming and limiting with regard to the water depth. A solution to tackle these two drawbacks, is to conduct the installation with a floating vessel. However, this brings along other challenges due to the hydrodynamics of the floating vessel. Therefore, this thesis focuses on the installation of XXL Monopiles with a monohull vessel. An XXL Monopile is a monopile with approximately a length of 120m and a diameter of 10m.<br/><br/>Boskalis is expanding its position on the offshore installation market and has recently added a new heavy lift vessel to its fleet. This vessel is the Bokalift 1 which is a monohull vessel equipped with a crane of 3000 tons lift capacity. To strengthen their position on the installation market, Boskalis is thinking about a new kind of heavy lift vessel which will be an extended version of the Bokalift 1: a Bokalift 2. This vessel will be a monohull vessel as well but possibly equipped with two cranes. The idea is to use this vessel for the installation of XXL monopiles with the use of both cranes. Boskalis wants to understand the dynamic behavior of the lifted object and vessel during this kind of operation and to know whether the installation with this kind of vessel is feasible or not. This will be assessed by determining the Eigenmodes and corresponding natural frequencies of the system, including the dynamic coupling between the lifted object and the vessel.<br/><br/>The installation of the XXL monopile with a Bokalift 2 is a novel operation. The phase of interest during this installation is the upending of the monopile, which will be executed partly through the splash zone. Using a simplified model, the modes and corresponding natural frequencies are determined for the lifted object in air (no vessel included). This is done with a modal analysis. With a more complete model made in OrcaFlex, these modes and frequencies are verified. The model is expended by including the vessel and subsequently a modal analysis is done. Since the submerged part of the monopile during the upending cannot be seen as a slender structure, the Morison equation is not applicable. To run the time domain simulations with the correct hydrodynamics included, the model is improved using a diffraction software AQWA. With this improved model, the dynamic coupling between the monopile and vessel is determined and it can be concluded that there is a strong coupling between the monopile’s yaw motion and the vessel’s roll motion.<br/><br/>Since an XXL monopile is being considered, it was decided to take a look at the piston mode. This is a phenomenon where the water inside the monopile moves up and down. The water column in the monopile will be excited by the waves and this results in a harmonic moving water plug inside the monopile. Since the monopiles are becoming bigger, the water volume is becoming bigger as well and might be of great concern. In previous studies this piston mode has been investigated, but never been applied in a complete model. In this preliminary study, this phenomenon is modeled in OrcaFlex and implemented into the monopile installation model. From the comparison between a model with and without the piston mode it is concluded that, generally, the piston mode will result in larger responses. However, the approximation of the piston mode phenomena is done by making several assumptions. The coupling between the water in and outside is not considered for example and, therefore, further research is required to gain more knowledge on the effects of the piston mode.<br/><br/>The current thesis provides more insight into the behavior of the lift and vessel dynamics. Based on these results, it is known to which motions attention need to be paid. Also, the coupling between the monopile and vessel is established and could be reduced by the use of tugger lines. A novel way of modeling the piston mode is developed and the effect of the piston mode is resolved to be increasing the motions of the system.<br","Monopile Installation; Coupled Dynamics; Upending XXL Monopile; FLoating installation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-07-20","","","","","",""

However a lot of these hours are not spent effectively by students. Eventually students who have trouble with self-studying in an effective manner may end up failing courses because of this. When students realise they have a (self-study) problem they can seek aid by contacting the academic counsellor. However, there are problems with this workflow: students often need time to acknowledge they are having issues. Then, even when students contact the academic counsellor to get help, it is a difficult task to provide personalised support for each student. <br/> In this thesis we investigate the feasibility of a self-study support agent that can assist students with feedback on their self-study behavior. This agent can support students next to the academic counsellors. An agent can continuously track students and provide immediate feedback, whereas counsellors have a limited amount of time available (per student). As part of this thesis we conduct a focus group with academic counsellors, organise a workshop with first year students to create a design for a prototype self-study support agent. Thereafter we implement this prototype and use this in an experiment where the activities of several first year students are tracked over the period of two weeks. Then we analyse the data collected with our prototype agent. In doing so we show that the concept of the self-study support agent is feasible.

Dit heeft een slecht mentaal functioneren door stress als gevolg. Daarnaast zorgt het ervoor dat je gedrag meer aangestuurd wordt door emotie, wat kan leiden tot een grote stapel ongeopende enveloppen en het verzwijgen van schulden. Door beide redenen hebben veel mensen met schulden het gevoel dat ze niet meer deel kunnen nemen aan de maatschappij. In sommige gevallen leidt dit tot sociale isolatie en depressie. Dit alles wijst naar het taboe dat bestaat rondom schulden, wat ervoor zorgt dat veel schulden onzichtbaar blijven voor bijna iedereen. Het doel van dit project is daarom het ondersteunen van mensen met schulden bij het doorbreken van het taboe, door hun persoonlijke behoeften te beantwoorden. Waardoor uiteindelijk al deze negatieve consequenties kunnen afnemen. In het onderzoek heeft de persoon met schulden telkens centraal gestaan. Het onderzoek heeft zich gefocust op de wijk het Oude Noorden in Rotterdam, omdat 21% (Idem, 2016) van de huishoudens in deze wijk problematische schulden heeft. Daarnaast is de wijk aan het gentrificeren, wat een diversiteit in cultuur en inkomen als gevolg heeft. Daarom moet men behoedzaam zijn voor de verdringing van oorspronkelijke bewoners of conflicten tussen beide groepen. Uit dit onderzoek blijkt dat mensen met schulden het gevoel hebben geen erkenning te krijgen voor hun problemen en bestaan als persoon, bijvoorbeeld van hulpverleners, kennissen of buurtgenoten. Ook moeten zij vaak al hun autonomie uit handen geven wanneer ze hulp krijgen, hoewel het over belangrijke beslissingen gaat. Daarnaast verliest iemand het vertrouwen op zijn kunnen en is er tijdens het oplossen van schulden vaak weinig mogelijkheid tot het ontwikkelen van nieuwe competenties. Daarnaast blijkt dat er een mentaliteitsverandering nodig is, om ervoor te zorgen dat het taboe doorbroken kan worden. Daarom focust dit project zich op het teweegbrengen van een mentaliteitsverandering bij buurtgenoten en tegelijkertijd op het vervullen van de 3 fundamentele psychologische behoeften die mensen met schulden op dit moment missen: competentie, autonomie en erkenning. Dit alles wordt bereikt met het concept DEBT. Dit concept biedt de debiteur een podium om erkenning te krijgen voor zijn problemen door de nadruk te leggen op zijn eigen kracht. Het concept begint met een creatieve workshop waarin mensen met schulden brainstormen over wat ze allemaal kunnen doen met hun oude enveloppen die ze krijgen. De productideeën die in de workshop bedacht zijn worden uitgewerkt tot design producten, gemaakt van bijvoorbeeld belastingdienst of gemeente Rotterdam enveloppen. Om deze producten heen wordt vervolgens een campagne georganiseerd gericht op yuppen in de wijk het Oude Noorden. Door het in aanraking komen met de campagne, lezen zij het verhaal van een wijkgenoot met schulden. Dit zorgt ervoor dat ze uiteindelijk anders over hen gaan denken en zich meer betrokken voelen. Door DEBT. voelen mensen met schulden zich weer sterk genoeg om over hun schaamte heen te stappen en zo samen het taboe rondom schulden te verbreken.","Debt; Rotterdam; Competence; Autonomy; Acknowledgement; Supporting; System; Human centered","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","","51.935833, 4.477778"

In practice this means that a few thousand children have parents with a mild intellectual disability (De Vries, 2005). Research shows that there is a limited system capacity to support parents with mild intellectual disabilities (MID). Whereas most other parents can rely on their social network when they need support with child rearing, parents with MID have to rely on the care system (McConnell, Matthews, Llewellyn, Mildon, &amp; Hindmarsh, 2008) because of their limited social network. Given the likely increase in parents with MID (Feldman, 1994) and the increased risks for their children there is a need to empower these parents and stimulate their self efficacy. This master thesis focuses on exploring different possibilities to create an intelligent support tool to empower parents with MID and stimulate their self efficacy through design. Elaborate, explorative user research resulted in concept Luna; an intelligent support tool to empower parents with a mild intellectual disability by providing them with extra structure during the eating routine in a pro-active way. At the end of the afternoon just before dinner time, Luna starts up by making a sound. Luna is an interactive table projector. A projection of plates and cutlery on the table at a given time is used as an intuitive way to motivate parents to set the table by imitating the projection. If a parent places a plate, Luna will give a positive feedback sound. Luna will make a positive feedback noise to confirm the good behavior of the parent. When the table is fully set, the projections of the plates and cutlery will disappear supported by sound; providing the parent with extra visual and auditive positive feedback. The design enables parents to snooze the projection. The parent can decide to delay the time the projection starts. The snooze function provides the parent with a feeling of autonomy. The parent can decide to delay the time the projection starts. This feeling of autonomy is an important element of the design. The design fosters collaboration. One of the requirements that was set at the start of the project is that parents should feel in control, they should feel like they could collaborate with the design like partners. (Oomen, 2009; Durinck &amp; Racquet, 2003; Het Nederlands Jeugdinstituut, 2014). However, the actual amount of autonomy is limited. The design can only be snoozed for three times and with each snooze the snoozing time will decrease. The results of this master thesis could be valuable for creating a behavioral change within the same target group for other activities, but for other target groups as well by teaching routine behavior through repetition and structure assisted by visual and auditive feedback in a pro-active way. With only little adjustments the design could empower any target group. The amount of possible applications is infinite.","empowering; intellectual disability; intelligent; object with intent; support","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

One of the main disadvantages of composites is its high susceptibility to impacts, such as tool drops which occurs on a single point of impact. As such, these types of impact have been thoroughly studied. Nevertheless, a much less studied phenomenon but with possible catastrophic consequences is the effect of impacts covering a large area, such as hail. This research, therefore, investigates the differences between a single point of impact and multiple points of impact through a purely experimental analysis.<br/> Upon investigating the difference, the research focused on three crucial hail event parameters which are impact separation, impact energy and the number of repeated impacts per impact location. The main results revealed that even though the damage response is worse for multiple location impacts, the overall damage response for hail events can be approximated with the available research on single point impacts. This observation remains unacceptable because the complete top surface of the aircraft is damaged and can have serious implications for the structural strength and can cause unexpected and unknown reductions in aircraft fatigue life. There are two essential topics for future research which prevail. The first is due to the crushing effect of hail upon impact and is the investigation of the difference in damage response of steel and hail impactors. The second is the investigation of 4-point bending fatigue on a plate impacted in multiple locations to investigate the damage growth and flexural stiffness. By understanding these additional matters it will become possible to determine if the new state of the art composite aircraft is susceptible to hail and if it will have a vulnerable fatigue life. Regardless of the outcome, it remains of utmost importance to possess this knowledge for the safety of air travel.","hail; impact; composite; aircraft; Low-velocity; repeated; multiple; locations","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

To increase comfort and trust in these automated cars, their motion planners, such as Model Predictive Controllers (MPCs), should exhibit a human-like driving style. However the effect of surrounding traffic on overtaking maneuvers has not yet been investigated. Here, the influence of the relative speed between cars and the width of the to-be-overtaken car on overtaking trajectories is analysed. In a driving simulator experiment cars with different widths (normal: 2m, wide: 2.8m) were overtaken at different relative speeds (20km/h, 50km/h and free speed between 20-50km/h). Drivers were found to decrease their safety time margin, measured as minimal Time To Collision (TTC), for increasing relative speeds from 20km/h (normal: Mean (M) = 6.74s, wide: M = 7.18s) to 50km/h (normal: M = 3.89s, wide: mean = 4.69s) and for decreasing car width. Additionally, increasing car width of the other car decreases the road margin at a relative speed of 50km/h (normal: M = 1.01m, wide: M = 0.91m). Due to large between-subject variability, individualized adaptation strategies of the controller are needed. An offline optimization method called Inverse Optimal Control (IOC) optimizes a personalized cost function for the MPC, based on demonstrated inputs and outputs, in about 1 hour. The lateral reference of the MPC adapts to different relative speeds and widths of the other car. By tracking the reference, the motion planner generates human-like trajectories online similar to the demonstrated ones within a small error (M = 0.17m)","Inverse Optimal Control; Overtaking; Human-like driving","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

First, it can be used for detection of general objects, for example cars, cyclists or pedestrians. Secondly, the camera can be used for traffic light recognition, which is localization of traffic light position and traffic light state recognition. No method exists at the moment able to perform general object detection and traffic light recognition at the same time, therefore this work proposes methods to combine general object detection and traffic light recognition. The novel method presented is including traffic light recognition in a general object detection framework. The single shot object detector YOLOv2 is used as base detector. As general object class dataset COCO is used and the traffic light dataset is LISA. Two different methods for combined detection are proposed: adaptive combined training and YOLOv2++. For combined training YOLOv2 is trained on both datasets with the YOLOv2 network unchanged and the loss function adapted to optimize training on both datasets. For YOLOv2++ the feature extractor of YOLOv2 pre-trained on COCO is used as feature extractor. On the features LISA traffic light states are trained with a small sub-network. It is concluded the best performing method is adaptive combined training which reaches for IOU 0.5 a AUC of 24.02% for binary and 21.23% for multi-class classification. For IOU of 0.1 this increases to 56.74% for binary and 41.87% for multi-class classification. The performance of the adaptive combined detector is 20% lower than the baseline performance of an detector only detecting LISA traffic light states and 5% lower than the baseline of a detector only detecting COCO classes, however detection of classes from both dataset is almost twice as fast as separate detection with different networks for both datasets.","Traffic Light recognition; machine learning; YOLO; object detection; COCO; LISA","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Vehicle Engineering","",""

In particular the different signatures (reflectivity, polarimetric and Doppler) occur at different heights. Based on the knowledge gained from the analysis and focussing on the reflectivity and polarimetric signatures, three different approaches were taken to detect and characterise the melting layer fromthe data. The first approach is based on an existing method in literature, this approach acts as the reference method. The second approach is based on image processing techniques, while the third approach is based on machine learning techniques. The second approach is later abandoned because of limitations of the techniques investigated. The third approach, machine learning, is the main contribution of this thesis work. For analysis of the performance of the different algorithms an annotated test dataset is created which represents the entire dataset. The performance is determined by the melting layer detection probability using a confusion matrix and by the determination of errors of the melting layer boundaries. The reference method proved to show an extremely low false positive rate (0%) on the test dataset. This means that if the method detected a melting layer, it is almost certain that there is one. The overall detection probability was 80%. The method fails in detecting the melting layer when the peak reflectivity is below the threshold (30dBZ) used in the method. The detected upper melting layer boundary of the reference method is on average 365 m lower compared to the ground truth. The lower boundary is on average 149 m higher than the ground truth. This means that the reference method only selects a part of the entire thickness of the ML. The correlation between the lower boundary and the ground truth is higher than the upper boundary (0.987 vs. 0.965). The proposed machine learning method has a detection performance of almost 94%, which is higher than the reference method, but some false positives occur (3%). The upper boundary is on average 20 m above the ground truth, while the lower boundary is 66 m lower than the ground truth. The machine learned method thus overestimates the thickness of the ML. The correlation between the lower boundary and the true boundary is 0.976 and the correlation between the upper boundary and the true boundary is 0.966. The upper boundaries of both methods have a very similar correlation, while the lower boundary of the machine learning method has a lower correlation. However, despite the lower correlation of the lower boundary and the introduction of false positives, the machine learning method is an improvement over the reference method since it has a significantly higher detection probability and it captures the entire thickness of theML much better. It is therefore suited forML analysis.","Melting; layer; machine learning; Melting layer; Detection; Characterisation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One of the means of satisfying thus requirements is miniaturization. Constructing, smarter, lighter and cheaper satellites to reduce the cost of delivering it to the orbit as the main chunk of mission cost falls on delivering the satellite to space. Lighter versions of satellites called nano-satellites (CubeSats) which could be fabricated in mass scale in a reproducible manner might be a suitable solution. In simple words nanosatellite is a state of the art device packed with advanced logic electronics, sensor and actuator arrays as well as power management systems, etc. to perform numerous tasks. Considering the already high cost for large scale integration of various components it is very important to extend the lifetime of the devices as much as possible. Beside radiation which is one of the main reason for the failure of the components, satellites are useful only if they remain in the orbit and not deviate from the specific path it was set due to drag. Therefore the propulsion system is required to control the altitude to increase the operational lifetime of the satellite. The project is a continuation of the work in realizing a new generation of noble green Vaporizing Liquid Micro Thruster (VLM) functioning in environmentally friendly propellant(water) fabricated in Else Kooi Laboratory (EKL) with the cooperation of Aerospace Engineering (AE) faculty with an intention of contributing to the DELFFI mission. Thesis includes fabrication and testing of a thruster with a heavy emphasis on improving the performance of the heating chamber. Fabrication was accomplished by designing modules separately and assembling them through part by part exposure in the lithography. Such an approach was taken due to the need for systematic analysis of numerous factors affecting performance by altering them and observe the effect on performance. Several heating chambers were designed with varying performance attributes and tested on its ability to deliver heat efficiently as well as affect to thruster performance like pressure drop. In addition to it, several fabrication techniques not used previously for the fabrication of thrusters were experimented and implemented on making various channel structures giving freedom of more 3D design. As a result novel type of Microelectromechanical Systems (MEMS) VLM heating chambers were fabricated by modular design and tested. Developed process is robust and flexible which allows to manufacture different types of VLM thrusters depending on operation demand and suited for integration. The novelty introduced in the project is step-wise heating as well as the application of a new type of localized heating chamber with improved geometry for enhanced heating efficiency and for wall temperature measurements.","MEMS; VLM","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering","",""

One of the most devastating events occurred in December 2017, which flooded the City Park area (West of the Municipality of Tirana). This area is strategical because it includes relevant centers of economic development, such as commercial and industrial areas, that are located nearby a main road connection between the Port of Durres, the Tirana International Airport and Tirana itself.  To mitigate the flood risk at this location, several hydraulic engineering concepts have been developed. However, the suitability of the concepts is limited by two main constraints: budget constraints and spatial constraints. With the aim to develop a flood protection system that is financially and spatially feasible, a system that combines dikes and flood walls is proposed. The industrial and commercial areas of the City Park are very close to the river. Hence, due to the spatial constraint, flood walls are used to protect these areas. Dikes are implemented in the river boundaries were agricultural and green land uses are found. Grass covers are implemented on the dike slopes to compensate the impact provoked by the water retaining structures in the local environment. The grass enhances the local visual amenity. Furthermore, bike paths are implemented on the dike crests and contiguous to the flood walls to improve the livability of the area.  In order to adapt further to the budget, the dimensions of the structures to be built are reduced by dredging the river beds, what increases the section of the river to convey water. A granular filter is placed on the river bed in order to reduce the soil erosion. Moreover, in order to reduce the financial and visual impact of the dikes, temporary structures of one meter height will be placed on the crest of the dikes in case a 100-year flood event occurs. A Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) of the proposed solution has been carried out to evaluate the feasibility of the alternative. The resultant BC ratio of the solution is 0.84, which is close to what is considered feasible (BC &gt; 1). However, this ratio is sensitive to the discount rate. According to the falling tendency of this rate in Albania in the recent years, as shown by the information published by the Central Bank of Albania, the rate is expected to fall from 1.25% to 1% in the close future. This drop would make the project feasible (BC = 1.05 &gt; 1). ","Flash floods; Flood Risk; Design methodology; Albania","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","","41.369223, 19.687103"

Improper planning of human activities and over exploitation of the surrounding natural resources has successfully damaged the biodiversity and the natural processes. Today humanity is at a stage where these ecosystem services are essential for our existence but the resources have been exploited beyond their capacity. In addition, climate change adds additional long-term threats due to erratic weather patterns and extreme natural events. Coastal Lagoons are one such geographical feature where such complexities are very visible. Given the high fertility of the surrounding land and the biodiversity hosted by the lagoons, they are rich resource banks for settlements to thrive on. This has led to issues like water pollution, loss of biodiversity and urban encroachment. Despite protection from the international communities like the Ramsar Convention, most wetlands are degrading everyday. The need of the hour is to find innovative middle ground solutions, where the services can be availed without degrading the environment. Further, to plan these services in a way that they are instrumental in reviving and enriching the lost ecosystem. This project attempts to present on such design and strategy for the Muni-Pomadze Lagoon (MPL) in Ghana.

In these cases, it is possible that multiple sensor detections are generated by each object of interest. Extended Object Tracking (EOT) approaches consist of algorithms which make use of multiple sensor detections per object to jointly estimate their kinematic and shape extent attributes within the Bayesian tracking framework. In the last decade, various EOT algorithms have been proposed for different types of tracking applications. This M.Sc. thesis project addresses the problem of extended tracking of a single pedestrian walking in the area of a stationary vehicle (referred as ego-vehicle in this report) during a real automotive scenario. The objective is to achieve accurate estimation of both the kinematic attributes (2D centroid position/velocity), as well as its shape extent in x-y plane. In more detail, PreScan software is enabled to design a simulation scenario that is very close to a real automotive application, in terms of motion characteristics of objects of interest and sensor data acquisition. In the considered scenario, different sensor modalities are mounted on the ego-vehicle, namely a Lidar sensor and a mono camera sensor. Moreover, OpenPose library is employed to to obtain pose detections of human body parts from obtained camera images. Concerning shape extent representation, the simplest and most popular approach in previous studies, in general and especially for VRUs tracking, is to assume an elliptical shape. In fact, the Random Matrix Model (RMM), proposed originally by Koch, 2008, is a state-of-the-art EOT state modeling approach that allows for joint estimation of centroid kinematics and physical extent for considered elliptical objects of interest. Based on that, a RMM-based filter using Lidar position measurements has been proposed by Feldmann, 2011. In this project, this algorithm is used as a baseline filter for comparison with our proposed algorithm.<br/> In addition, an alternative tracking algorithm is proposed in this study, which has the following differences with respect to the baseline filter:<br/> State Initialization of the filter: In our proposed version of the tracking algorithm, human pose detections of shoulders and ankles are are associated with obtained Lidar position measurements in order to provide initial values for the kinematic state (2D position/velocity) and shape parameters (ellipse orientation and semi-axes lengths) of the pedestrian.Measurement Update step of the filter: In our proposed version of the tracking algorithm, camera-obtained pose detections of pedestrian shoulders are associated with obtained Lidar position measurements in order to create an extra measurement, for pedestrian heading angle. Subsequently, a nonlinear filtering update step fusing Lidar-obtained point cloud data for pedestrian position and human-pose-obtained measurement for pedestrian heading angle is implemented. Both considered tracking algorithms are evaluated for the designed simulation scenario. In detail, the following performance metrics are used for evaluation of each filter: RMSE for estimated pedestrian 2D position and velocity, respectively.<br/>Modified Hausdorff distance for estimated pedestrian shape extent.<br/> In more detail, Monte Carlo simulations with multiple runs are designed to evaluate performance of each state initialization approach and each tracking algorithm, where the following parameters change in each run:<br/> Additive zero-mean Gaussian measurement noise on obtained Lidar position detections.

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","Radiotherapy is an important treatment type for patients with cancer. An advantage of state of the art proton therapy with respect to traditional photon therapy is the spatial energy deposition of protons, which is characterized by the Bragg peak. Due to this particular course of energy deposition, the tumor can be irradiated more precisely and as a consequence more healthy tissue can be spared. A drawback is that proton therapy is more sensitive to uncertainties like misalignment of the patient, which is referred to as a set-up error. Robust optimization is the current way to account for such uncertainties during which a few discrete error scenarios are included in the planning. Due to the nature of the uncertainties, probabilistic optimization, on the other hand, is more promising, since it can handle many more scenarios with their occurrence probability taken into account as well. To investigate probabilistic planning, Polynomial Chaos methods were used in this research. Polynomial Chaos can approximate a stochastic response, depending on for example the set-up error, by a series expansion in terms of polynomials. The advantage is that typically the Polynomial Chaos Expansion (PCE) can be evaluated much faster than the stochastic response itself. In this research an investigation is done how PCE can be used with probabilistic treatment planning for proton therapy. First, an overview is given on how PCE can be used to describe probabilistic objective functions. It has been found that in general it is possible to describe random set-up errors with PCE without the need of considerably additional computational power. Moreover, polynomials in dose are especially suitable when fractionation is taken into account. Second, a simple one-dimensional geometry consisting of a tumor with a surrounding organ has been considered. The effects of fractionation on the dose distribution has been calculated with PCE and the results were in accordance with earlier research by Unkelbach et al. (2018). Third, a simplified three-dimensional geometry which mimics a spinal cord with surrounding tumor has been optimized probabilistically with PCE. The expected value of the sum of the quadratic differences between the dose and the prescribed dose has been minimized. The effects of probabilistic optimization became clear from both the nominal and the expected dose distribution. This objective function (i.e. the expected value of a quadratic function of the dose) turned out to be extremely suitable for probabilistic optimization with PCE, however its clinical relevance is less clear. <br/>Last, a real skull base meningioma patient has been considered. As objective function, a percentile of the dose volume parameter has been used with PCE. This function demonstrated a bumpy dependence on the beam intensity and it has been proven that it cannot have a negative gradient. Consequently, a high step size is recommended to approximate the gradient and, if needed, the Hessian. Probabilistic treatment plans were obtained with a single probabilistic objective, with two probabilistic objectives and with nominal constraints and objectives on OARs. The results have been compared with a robust treatment plan according to the recipes of Ter Haar et al. (2018). It has been found that the probabilistic treatment plan shows a more conformal dose distribution, since it does not exhibit any preferred direction, contrary to the robust treatment plan. As a consequence, the automatic extension of the tumor is smaller. A clear benefit has been demonstrated in favor of the probabilistic treatment plan. Besides that, a major advantage of probabilistic optimization with respect to robust optimization is that it makes it possible to directly steer to a probabilistic goal independent of the patient and the treatment site. The computation time of probabilistic planning (in the order of 1-3 weeks) is unfortunately still too high for clinical practice.","Polynomial Chaos Expansion; Probabilistic Treatment Planning; Proton Therapy; iCycle; Fractionation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-12-31","","","","Applied Physics","",""

In the Netherlands one of the consequences is that water boards and municipalities are preparing for an increase in extreme precipitation. To evaluate the consequences in case of extreme precipitation all Dutch municipalities and water boards have to perform a stress test. In these stress tests the response of the water system is evaluated during extreme precipitation events which are much larger than the events used to design the water system. It is analysed which places are vulnerable to flooding and what risk (probability x potential damage) is involved. In the Netherlands the responsibility of different parts of the water system are with different government authorities. The municipality is responsible for the sewer system and the waterboard is responsible the surface water system. As a result both municipalities and waterboards often perform separate climate stress tests. Most of the time the municipality will not take the surface water into account or does it in a very simplified manner, for the waterboards this is vice versa. However, these systems do influence and hinder each other. This may result in an underestimation of the actual flooding, and corresponding damage. The aim of this research is to investigate to what extent the urban drainage system and the rural surface water system influence each other during extreme precipitation. In this research the case study area of Schijndel with the surrounding catchment area of the Schijndelse loop is analysed. The research must clarify if flooding caused by extreme precipitation is underestimated if the urban drainage system and the rural surface water system of Schijndel are analysed separately instead of combined. For this research a hydrodynamic model of the area is constructed in the hydrodynamic software package Infoworks ICM. The hydrodynamic model was used to investigate the difference between a coupled and separate model setup. The results show that the modelled flood locations correspond to known flood reports, but also that the difficult to determine infiltration rate, grid size and surface roughness significantly influence the model response. Nonetheless, the hydrodynamic model can be used to compare the response for short precipitation events between a coupled and separate sewer surface water model. The results show that flooding is underestimated if the sewer system and the surface water system are put to the test separately instead of combined. However, the differences are location and event specific and occur mainly just upstream and downstream of the combined sewer overflow locations in the study area. Here, the results show an increase in flood depth, flood duration, flood extent and the amount of houses flooded when the system is modelled coupled instead of separate. For future stress test studies it is recommended to schematize both the urban sewer system and surface water system together in one model, as this gives a better representation of the flow dynamics which occur in reality.","Stress Tests; Flooding; Modelling; extreme rainfall","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Water Management","",""

Traditional models already exist for the representation of these curves, with one of them being the van Genuchten model. When soil parameters are available, the van Genuchten model can be used to plot water retention curves. However, when these soil parameters are not available, regression can be performed to estimate and predict the water retention curves. Commonly, the Non-Linear Least Squares regression method is used in combination with a certain water retention model. Problems arise for inhomogeneous soils as the traditional water retention models tend to break down. To improve the representation of water retention curves, Gaussian Process regression will be implemented. This method will be combined with the Non-Linear Least Squares method to obtain new representations of water retention curves. These new curves are better in terms of curve fit and uncertainty, when compared to the traditional method. These comparisons can be made visually, by observing the plots and their confidence intervals, as well as quantitatively by computing the log-likelihoods of the different methods. When comparing the results of the log-likelihood computations for both methods, it follows that the value of the log-likelihood is greater for water retention data with correlated residuals.

(graduation committee); Vrijdag, A. (mentor); Polinder, H. (graduation committee); Godjevac, Milinko (mentor); Dijk, Marijn (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","During dynamic positioning operations, vessels typically run with an extra generator (spinning reserve) for redundancy purposes such that no single fault will cause the vessel to lose its position or heading. As a result, all other engines on the grid share the load equally to ensure that if a failure were to occur, the remaining healthy generators would be sufficient to satisfy the total power demand. As DP vessels operate on a split-bus mode, the redundancy requirement must be satisfied across both switchboards on the vessel. Past research has shown that significant fuel and maintenance savings can be made by eliminating the spinning reserve with a battery energy storage system. However, as Lithium-ion batteries are relatively expensive, efforts have been made in the past to attempt to incorporate a single battery system than can be connected to either switchboard in the event of a failure, however the analysis was conducted only for deep-water pipelaying operations. Shallow water operations are characteristic of large power surges in contrast to deep-water operations which has been the limiting constraint in ESS design and architecture. In this research, a solution was developed as a split battery design which is arranged such that the power surges can be handled by two independent units connected to one switchboard while a tertiary unit from the secondary switchboard can be independently connected to the one switchboard wherein a failure has occurred, hence acting as a spinning reserve. This allows all the battery units to be maintained at a low state of charge, which maximises the battery life. To complement the design, two power management system integration methods were pursued. Firstly, a rule-based monitoring system was developed which allowed the power management system to make generator start-stop decisions based on a back-looking principle of measuring power demand and power surge characteristics experienced by the battery. This resulted in fuel savings of 3.14 tonnes and a running hour reduction of 52.5 hours. The average engine loads improved on average 10-20\% in contrast to the current situation on the vessel and milder weather scenarios showing nearly a 30-40\% improvement.<br/> And secondly, a neural network based machine learning approach was used to forecast the vessel loads for the day ahead using weather and route plan parameters.The results suggest that in contrast to the rule-based system, the forecast model overestimates or underestimates the load which causes the fuel savings and running hour reduction to be less than the former control strategy. The neural network training was conducted on a data sample of approximately 2 million data points which was found to be insufficient to capture all the dynamics. In the scenario that the model can be trained on several years of data, it could be possible to forecast the load with enough fidelity to allow a 38\% reduction in ESS sizing compared to the base case design used with the rule-based control system.<br/><br","energy storage system; machine learning; power management system; ESS architectures; system integration","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-06-17","","","","","",""

Furthermore, it has been found that the usage of a new Lagrange multiplier, on the intersection of 4 or more elements, removes the spurious modes. Therefore, the associated system of equation is non-singular. The usage of the hybrid finite element methods reduces the computational time while maintaining the pointwise divergence constraint and the optimal convergence rate of all variables.<br/>At the end, the mixed hybrid formulation is modified to solve the Stokes equations.

A focus is placed on aspects relevant with the Sentinel 2 satellites. Using Python libraries, raw satellite housekeeping data is pre-processed to make available time and place of event occurrence. Then, a moving-average filter is applied to reveal the long-term behavior of SE position and rate. The filtered SE rate data shows a linear trend, attributed to solar cycle and device degradation. Further, there are features attributed to memory hot spots, South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA) semi-annual behavior and geomagnetic storms. Future event rate data and data on affected memory addresses will help to further distinguish these influences. Filtered event positions track the drift of the SAA, but contain suspicious differences between the satellites. These are attributed to memory hot spots as well. Spectral analysis reveals that the only short-term influences in the unfiltered data arise from the orbits of the satellites. Within the SAA, event rate is similar for eclipsed and sunlit, but outside of the SAA, event rate is approximately twice as high in sunlit.

The objective is therefore to lower arousal. The environment also has a very large impact on a person. It is therefore wise to see how that could be used in lowering arousal.

(mentor); Xin, H. (graduation committee); Hoogenboom, P.C.J. (graduation committee); Langedijk, Walter (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","Fatigue is an important issue for orthotropic steel deck (OSD) bridges and therefore a design criterium. Cracks will initiate at several locations of the bridge deck. It is likely that a crack at the trough web to deck plate joint at the crossbeam will initiate first. This crack initiates at the weld root and propagates through the deck plate. A crack at this location is harmful because it is not optically visible and therefore hard to detect. The first part of the report focuses on the fatigue assessment of the trough web to deck plate joint at the crossbeam. Fatigue assessment of this joint is possible with different assessment methods which are the nominal stress method and the hot spot stress method as given in the Eurocode, and the effective notch stress method, described by the IIW. A hand calculation using a simple 2D model is made and a finite element (FE) model is used for the assessment. Both a shell and solid element model are build. The fatigue life calculation of the joint for a deck segment is made. Experimental results for the same deck segment are available and used for validation of the FE models. The fatigue life of each method is compared to the determined load cycles to failure from the experiment. There is concluded that the hot spot stress method results in the most accurate fatigue life prediction and a solid element model gives a slightly longer fatigue life than using shell elements. The effective notch stress method results in a conservative fatigue life for this specific joint. Stresses in the zone near the weld root of the rib-to-deck plate joint at the crossbeam are in compression, while fatigue cracks will initiate due to tensile stresses. During welding, residual stresses appear in the joint. Therefore, a fatigue life prediction is made which includes these residual stresses. An approximation of the residual stresses is included in the initial state of the finite element model. Using the Smith, Watson and Topper (swt) parameter, which is a local critical plane based fatigue assessment, the amount of load cycles to failure is determined. The result is comparable to the experimental result. The second part of the report is focused on the geometry of the deck segment. A shell element model and the hot spot stress method are used to analyse different parameters. When the width between the trough webs is larger, a thicker deck plate thickness is required. Four alternatives for a bridge deck are made. The alternatives have a different amount of troughs over the width, which means that the width between the trough webs differs per alternative. The deck plate thickness is chosen so that each alternative results in a damage value just below 1 for traffic category 2 and a design life of 50 years. Fatigue load model 4 is considered. The weight of the alternatives is determined. There can be concluded that reducing the amount of troughs over the width results in a heavier deck. This is because the weight of the deck plate is a large part of the total weight of the OSD and if more troughs are used, a thicker deck plate is applied. There was assumed that the stress in the joint only is affected by deformation of the deck plate. However, the in-plane deformation of the crossbeam has a negative effect on the stress range in the trough web-to-deck plate joint. Besides the geometry, the effect of some assumptions for modeling are investigated. Including a load dispersal through the surface layer by applying a larger wheel contact area results in a reduced fatigue damage value of about 50% and is therefore beneficial to take into account in the design calculations. The stress range in the joint is highest if a wheel load is placed in the center of the trough. A transverse shift of the wheel results in a large decrease in stress. Therefore it is important to take into account the design load cycles per transverse wheel position.","orthotropic steel deck; fatigue; rib-to-deck plate joint; hot spot stress; effective notch stress; FEM analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This thesis provides a platform for reviewing 3-d construction printing technology. This thesis explored the barriers that make the adoption of 3-d printing technology in the construction industry difficult. The significance or effects of these barriers will be evaluated by assessing the positions and views of the study participants. These barriers include: • High costs of printer. • Immaturity of printing partners. • Unclear regulatory implications. • Inability to create larger structures. • High cost of printed structures. • Lack of commercial viability. • Lack of customer support. • Lack of sufficient successful examples. • Architect/designer unpreparedness. • Difficulty of transporting printers. • Technology interruption risk. • Need for expensive specialty materials. The three suggested problems climate change, depletion of natural resources and socio-economic factors are all considered important which is quite broad if not explained with a good point of 22 departure. However, the point of departure of this thesis is that it is about attributing to the solving of these 3 big problems (national and even world problems). And that scalability of a product and thus mass feasibility of 3-d printing is crucial for worldwide adoption and solving real-world issues instead of just creating a niche market for free-form architecture. When a product is highly scalable and brings real value, assumable big private (and even public) investments can be attracted if the product makes sense from an investor point of view. Therefore, 3-d construction printing really needs to add value on a larger scale and not just for a niche market on the longer term. It should be clear to see if big investments are worthy for 3-d construction printing. Besides, I wanted to learn how to research a new product for myself and on its potentials for providing a solution for important (world) issues. In short, there are potential new materials, there are barriers and I research the way how barriers can be discovered and potentially be overcome in the domain of digital fabrication, focusing on cementitious 3-d construction printing. The thesis was divided into different parts. The first section is an introduction from where the topic was introduced. The next part covered the research methods and more importantly, the techniques that were used to gather data and information from the study participants. From there, main research results were provided. Here, the results were divided into interview results and questionnaire results. Subsequently, a brief conclusion that summarized the main parts of the paper was be provided followed by possible recommendations. Dutch - Language Verschillende technologieën op het gebied van digitale fabricage zijn geïntroduceerd in de bouwsector om efficiëntie te bevorderen. Deze thesis biedt een platform voor het beoordelen van 3-d constructieprinttechnologie. Deze thesis onderzocht de barrières die het gebruik van 3-d printtechnologie in de bouwsector bemoeilijken. De betekenis of effecten van deze barrières zullen worden geëvalueerd door de posities en standpunten van de studiedeelnemers te beoordelen. Deze barrières omvatten: • Hoge kosten van de printer. • Onvolwassenheid van print partners. • Onduidelijke gevolgen met betrekking tot regelgeving. • Onmogelijkheid om grotere structuren te maken. • Hoge kosten van gedrukte structuren. • Gebrek aan commerciële levensvatbaarheid. • Gebrek aan klantenondersteuning. • Gebrek aan voldoende succesvolle voorbeelden. • Onvoorbereide architect / ontwerper. • Moeilijkheden om printers te vervoeren. • Technologieonderbrekingsrisico. • Behoefte aan dure speciaal materieel De drie gesignaleerde problemen klimaatverandering, uitputting van natuurlijke hulpbronnen en sociaal-economische factoren worden allemaal als belangrijk beschouwd, die vrij breed is als ze niet worden uitgelegd met een goed uitgangspunt. Het uitgangspunt van deze thesis is echter dat het gaat over het bijdragen aan het oplossen van deze 3 grote problemen (nationale en zelfs wereldproblemen). Daarmee is de schaalbaarheid van een product en de massale haalbaarheid van 3-d printen van cruciaal belang voor wereldwijde acceptatie en het oplossen van deze wezelijke problemen in plaats van alleen maar een nichemarkt te creëren voor vrije-vormarchitectuur. Wanneer een product zeer schaalbaar is en echt waarde oplevert, kunnen veronderstelde grote particuliere (en zelfs publieke) investeringen worden aangetrokken als het product vanuit het 8 oogpunt van de belegger logisch is. Daarom moet 3-d constructieprinten echt waarde toevoegen op een grotere schaal en niet alleen voor een nichemarkt op de langere termijn. Het moet duidelijk zijn om te zien of grote investeringen waard zijn voor 3-d constructieprinten. Bovendien wilde ik leren hoe ik een nieuw product voor mezelf kon onderzoeken en wat het potentieel is om een oplossing te bieden voor belangrijke (wereld) problemen. Kortom, er zijn potentiële nieuwe materialen, er zijn barrières en ik onderzoek hoe barrières kunnen worden ontdekt en mogelijk worden overwonnen in het domein van digitale fabricage, met de nadruk op cementgebonden 3-d constructie geprinte buitenwanden.

Vervolgens werd er een korte conclusie gegeven met een samenvatting van de belangrijkste delen van het artikel, gevolgd door mogelijke aanbevelingen.","Digital fabrication; 3-d construction printing; FLAM; Robotics; Algorithms","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Management in the Built Environment","",""

Companies are, therefore, renewing their identities and creating new business divisions to offer design capabilities to clients. Likewise, IBM iX is a department within IBM Global Business Services, that uses design techniques to solve complex business challenges. However, expressing the value of design in a business context doesn’t come without challenges. This especially happens in large organizations, such as IBM BNLX, where the IBM iX department encounters difficulties in defining who they are and proving their value to stakeholders. Specifically, the empirical analysis carried out within the organization demonstrates a lack of a shared vision and a clear positioning of the business unit, which suggests an internal intervention. Therefore, the central aim of this thesis is to help IBM iX enhance and communicate its identity both internally to create shared understanding, and externally to create awareness. The exploration of corporate theory shows that identity transfer is a long process that requires employees involvement in co-creation activities to help them internalize the it. Next to that, the notions of vision and positioning are explored as important elements that describe the core purpose of a business. In particular, a shared vision appears to be an essential element to express the “what” of a business while having, at the same time, the power to motivate employees in their daily work. Analogously, positioning is, by nature, an integral part of corporate identity building, due to his capacity to differentiate the organization from the competition. Based on the above-mentioned observations, and the analysis of theoretical frameworks from the literature, a process for the transfer of the iX identity is outlined and partially executed in the course of this thesis. The process is characterized by 4 main steps: awareness, understanding, internalize, communicate. To implement the process, two workshops are facilitated with employees with the goal to co-create IBM iX BNLX vision and identify their positioning which allowed to initiate the procedure of internal identity enhancement. To support the department in the external communication of the identity, a series of co-creative ideations are performed in close collaboration with iX employees. The results of these sessions include an iX story pitch and infographic to convey the identity internally and a marketing campaign whose purpose is to spread awareness among other departments in IBM. Final evaluation with IBM led to recommendations regarding the continuation of the process for the transfer of the iX identity. This includes a communication roadmap for the iX department that suggests the realizations of workshops, events, and constant renovation of the iX story.","brand identity; Vision; positioning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor); van Doesburg, Mark (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","In this thesis, the design and implementation of an improved current controller for grid-tied converters is discussed. Using this improved current controller, a power factor correction test platform achieves practically zero AC and DC error in steady-state. The power factor corrector accomplishes this by utilizing the parallel combination of a proportional-integral controller and a resonator to form the proportional-integral-resonant controller. The integrator in the controller has infinite gain at 0Hz while the resonator has infinite gain at the fundamental grid frequency. The extreme gain at these frequencies attenuates the error between reference current and actual current to practically zero. In prior art the proportional-integral-resonant (PIR) controller is implemented using the same resonator type that is also used in the well-known proportional-resonant (PR) controller. However, the use of this so-called cosine-form resonator might destabilize the closed-loop system. As a result, such a cosine-form resonator might not be the most suitable option to use in the PIR controller. This thesis researches the use of the sine-form resonator, which has been considered to be inferior to the cosine-form in prior art. The results show that the sine-form resonator can make a PIR controller perform better in terms of stability and disturbance rejection. Simulations and experimental results confirm that both the DC and AC steady-state error is attenuated to near zero, resulting in excellent tracking of the reference current. If multiple harmonic frequencies are present in the grid voltage, additional resonators can be implemented to attenuate these harmonics as well. The second contribution of this thesis focusses on the optimization for the numerically-controlled-oscillator used in the phase-locked loop in terms of computational load. By implementing the numerically-controlled-oscillator using a numerical resonator, an accurate but computationally efficient phase-locked loop is obtained. This originates from the fact that the numerical resonator integrates the angular frequency supplied by the loop filter in the complex plane. Experiments involving the phase-locked loop subroutine running on a Cortex-M4f microcontroller show an improvement in computation time of a factor of three compared to the use of trigonometric functions. In comparison to an implementation using a look-up table with interpolation, execution time is cut in half. The third and final contribution of this thesis focusses on the improvement of the voltage loop bandwidth. This is achieved by the implementation of an adaptive notch filter to remove the second-order harmonic voltage ripple from the DC bus voltage measurements. The notch filter is based on a second-order generalized integrator quadrature-system generator using the information supplied by the phase-locked loop to automatically tune the centre frequency to the second harmonic.","Power Factor Correction; PFC; Control; proportional-integral-resonant; Resonator; Gallium nitride device; Totem-pole; Phase-locked Loop; PLL; Notch Filter; Second-order Generalized Integrator; SOGI; Proportional-resonant","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Several studies have been performed about the zero-energy potential for skyscrapers, however taking into consideration single functions, particularly office and housing buildings. Realistic and modern tall building design however always involves a combination of uses (offices, accommodation, commercial and retail) for the project to be economically viable. On the basis of the Trias Energetica, the primary goal of the early design for sustainable buildings must be to minimize the demand for energy (heating, cooling, hot water, electricity) by means of active or passive techniques. This translates into design guidelines for the shape, orientation, building envelope and climate properties, parameters that have been already widely investigated by researchers and designers in practice. However, an important feature in order to improve the sustainable profile of a building is to employ circular techniques that aim to avoid wasting energy and re-use / re-purpose it. The main objective of this graduation research is to determine the zero-energy potential for high-rise buildings by taking advantage of a mixed-use scheme and examining the possibilities for energy exchange and cooperation between different functions by means of storing energy in the form of warm and cold-water tanks. This research aims to determine which synergetic combinations between functions can be performed, what type of building systems and technology can be used and, by establishing a complete energy simulation, conclude on what are the energy benefits for the building on a yearly basis . The results will be an important addition to the sustainable design for “MEGA” scale projects, according to the forthcoming Dutch regulation that after 2020 all newly built buildings must comply with the nearly zero energy guidelines.","zero energy design; sustainability; high-rise buildings; Energy storage; energy exchange; mixed-use buildings","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Building Engineering","",""

For this reason it is of great importance that the location and magnitudes of these stresses are investigated such that both manufacturing methods and operation of the equipment can be optimised thus preventing failures. In an effort to investigate the structural integrity of the heat exchanger this thesis develops a workflow in which a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) solver is coupled with a computational structural mechanics (CSM) solver in order to identify key stress regions. As a case study to trial this method a test-rig of a plate fin heat exchanger (PFHE) used to investigate typical stresses occurring in the main heat exchanger of air separation units (ASUs) manufactured by Linde has been selected. In order to simulate two heat exchanger blocks in their entirety some additional modelling steps are included. In the CFD simulation use of porous media is made to provide a simplified representation of the fins. Similarly simple block structures are used in the CSM model whose material properties have been changed to mimic the behaviour of the fins. The thermal model gives promising results and shows good agreement to analytical solutions however experimental validation is still necessary. This work shows that the coupling of the two solvers is generally possible but can still be streamlined in some respect with data extraction from the CFD solver being relatively slow and the following mapping of the temperatures onto the CSM mesh and eventual solving of the structural mechanics left with room for improvement in terms of computational speeds. In terms of identifying key stress regions the results indicate elevated stresses occurring at the weld which connects the two heat exchanger modules. Secondarily to the large scale model a submodel was developed, depicting the perforated fin type. This task served as a proof of concept to gain a better understanding of local thermo-hydraulic phenomena especially to what extent perforation played a role in local heat transfer coefficients since such variables cannot be monitored in the large scale model. From the sub-model it was found that the perforations play a significant role in the heat transfer ability of the fin and local heat transfer coefficients in close proximity to the perforations were more than double the value of the average heat transfer coefficient observed in the bulk flow.","CFD Simulation; FEM analysis; Heat exchanger; Fluid Structure Interaction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-05-01","","","","","",""

To tackle this challenge, many novel data compression algorithms have been developed. These compression algorithms can be embedded into bandwidth-bound applications to reduce their memory traffic volume. As a result, data decompression, in many instances, is in the critical path of the application execution, while the compression itself can happen offine or outside of the critical path. Therefore, fast data decompression is of utmost importance. However, most existing parallel decompression schemes adopt a particular parallelization strategy suited for a particular HW platform. Such an approach fails to harness the parallelism found in diverse modern HW architectures. To this end, we propose multiple parallelization strategies for variable rate data decompression. The proposed strategies aim to utilize parallel architectures efficiently. Our strategies are based on generating extra information during the encoding phase, and then passing this information in a side-channel to the decoder. After that, the decoder can use that extra information to speed-up the decoding process tremendously. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our strategies, we implement them in a state-of-the-art compression algorithm called ZFP and apply it on a real-life industrial application from ASML. Our implementation is publicly available on GitHub. This application is a feed-forward control model for controlling wafer heat in EUV lithography machines. The application is dominated by matrix-vector multiplication (which is bandwidth-bound) and is executed on GPUs. We show that parallelization strategies suited for multicore CPUs are different from the ones suited for GPUs. On a CPU, we achieve a near-optimal speedup and an overhead size which is consistently less than 0.04% of the compressed data size. On a GPU, we achieve a decoding throughput of more than 130 GiB/s which allows us to execute the ASML application within the given time budget.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-06-14","","","","","",""

(mentor); de Winter, J.C.F. (mentor); Doubek, Fabian (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","Due to recent advancements in automated driving systems, drivers are able to withdraw themselves from the control loop of the vehicle in certain driving situations. However, system limits occur relatively frequently, which results in the driver having to take back control. It is argued most currently used take-over quality quantification methods, such as identifying the minimum time-to-collision or maximum lateral acceleration, neglect inherent criticality of the driving scenario. This can lead to poor overall quality assessment, especially in challenging take-over scenarios. This thesis proposes a novel method of quantifying how well the driver performed in the task of executing an emergency automation-to-manual control takeover, by means of a scenario-specific quality reference in the form of an optimized trajectory. Firstly, a human-in-the-loop driving simulator study was carried out using a high fidelity 6-DOF driving simulator (n=25). The simulated environment consisted of a two-lane highway setting. During the drive, six different automation-to-manual takeover scenarios occurred. Optimized trajectories were also generated for these scenarios, using a State-of-the-Art trajectory planner developed at Volkswagen Group Research Facility, Wolfsburg. The independent variables were the time budget (5s, 7s, and 20s), and the traffic density (5 veh/km, and 10 veh/km). A variety of dependent variables were determined for both the human driver trajectories and the optimized trajectories: minimum time-to-collision, minimum distance-to-lane-boundary, minimum distance-to-overtaking-vehicle, maximum forced braking of the overtaking vehicle, maximum and standard deviations of accelerations (lateral and longitudinal), maximum and standard deviations of jerk (lateral and longitudinal), and lateral quickness. Based on the findings from this human-in-the-loop driving simulator study and the generated optimized trajectories, a quantification framework was developed. The framework subdivides take-over quality assessment into two separate parameters. One with regard to safety, and one with regard to comfort. The safety parameter quantifies criticality of the human driver take-over based on the sum of normalized weighted quantification scores. These scores are computed for the metrics minimum time-to-collision, minimum distance-to-lane boundary, minimum distance-to-overtaking vehicle, and maximum forced braking of the overtaking vehicle, and are based on the difference to the metric values corresponding to the optimized<br/>trajectory. The comfort parameter quantifies comfort in a similar manner based on the metrics lateral quickness, maximum lateral and longitudinal jerk, and standard deviation of lateral and longitudinal jerk. The final quantification scores are comprised of a value between 0 and 1 for both the safety and comfort parameters. A perfect score of 0 would indicate all metrics were identical, or better than the optimized reference trajectory. A value of 1 indicates a crash for the safety parameter, and highly uncomfortable driving for the comfort parameter. The resulting quantification framework is scenario-specific as the quantification is performed relative to an optimized reference trajectory.","Automated driving systems; take-over requests; Quantification; Optimization; trajectory planning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-06-01","","","","","",""

In order to accommodate this growth, existing infrastructure such as gates should be used more efficiently. One technique to increase gate utilization is by introducing gate pit-stops. Introducing gate pit-stops leads to additional towing movements which can potentially interfere with other traffic on the apron. This in turn will lead to delays, which is undesirable. Currently, gate pit-stops are only performed for flights with a turnaround time of three hours or more. In order to investigate whether pit-stops can be effectively introduced on a broader scale, a model has been created that simulates gate assignments and apron movements. This model provides insight in the effect of gate pit-stops on gate utilization and apron congestion for different airport scenarios. Results show that introducing pit-stops for flights with a turnaround time of less than 180 minutes leads to an increase in flights that can be handled at a gate instead of a remote stand, at a small delay penalty. Airlines and airports can benefit from these findings as they will be able to handle more flights at a gate using existing infrastructure.","Gate pit-stops; Gate utilization; Gate allocation; Apron movements; Apron delays; ETS; operations optimization; Aircraft taxiing; Aircraft towing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Execution of 4096-bit modular exponentiation using an embedded system requires many arithmetic operations. This work aims to improve the performance of modular exponentiation for an existing FPGA platform containing a soft core RISC-V processor. The solution is to introduce a peripheral that performs Montgomery multiplication with 4096-bit operands. These operands are represented using the Residue Number System (RNS) and each residue is assigned to a RNS processor core. In total, the system consists of 121 RNS cores and each core is responsible for a 34-bit residue. RNS Montgomery multiplication requires a base extension algorithm, which will be represented by the Bajard and the Shenoy base extensions. Two designs are proposed: one using a tree-based reduction circuit and one with an iterative reduction circuit. The former focuses on performance overall, while the latter is more efficient in terms of performance per area. Synthesis for a XCKU035 FPGA gives an area usage of 83484 LUTs for the tree-based design and 41857 LUTs for the iterative design. Both designs also require 132.5 BRAMs and 485 DSP blocks and are running at a clock frequency of 400 MHz. The tree-based design performs Montgomery multiplication using 4096-bit operands in 434 cycles (1.09 µs), while the iterative design does that in 577 cycles (1.44 µs). For performing modular exponentiation, the sliding window method is used with an optimal window size of seven. A modular exponentiation with 4096-bit operands takes on average 5.09 ms for the tree-based design, while the iterative version needs 6.78 ms. Few other implementations were found performing Montgomery multiplication using 4096-bit operands. However, compared to those the proposed design provides better performance.","4096 bits; RSA; RNS; FPGA; Montgomery multiplication; modular reduction; base extension; exponentiation; hardware accelerator; multi-core; parallel processing; heterogeneous architecture; encryption; decryption","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Engineering","",""

Low-thrust propulsion is an attractive option for space manoeuvres and transfers, since it provides a large specific impulse and hence efficient use of propellant. Thus, the propellant mass can be decreased, which brings advantages such as higher payload mass and extended mission life.<br/>Two constraints have been posed on the thrust acceleration, which often appear as a result of optimal solutions. Firstly, only bang-bang control is allowed, thus the rocket engine can only be turned on or off. Secondly, no radial thrust is allowed, such that no gravity losses occur. The modified equinoctial elements have been chosen to describe the trajectory. If it is assumed that the eccentricity is equal to zero, analytical solutions have been derived. While this seems as a substantial restriction on the developed method, it is shown that the analytical solution provides very reasonable results for eccentricities smaller than 0.2. Furthermore, separate analytical expressions have been developed when no in-plane thrust acts on the spacecraft. For the implementation of the bang-bang control, each individual revolution around the central body is allowed to have two thrust arcs and two coasts arcs, where the analytical solutions have been used to describe the motion of the spacecraft during the thrust arcs. By cleverly choosing the switching points where the rocket engine is turned on and off, the transfer orbit is achieved in an efficient way. The performance of the developed algorithm has been assessed for different input parameters. More specifically, different magnitudes of thrust accelerations have been analyzed. Furthermore, the lengths of the thrust and coast arcs, together with the direction of the thrust force, have been varied to evaluate the applicability of the algorithm. Lastly, the algorithm has been tested with the introduction of a stop criterion, which determines the required propellant and time of flight to arrive at a set target element. The algorithm has proved to give results with relatively good accuracy for orbits with an eccentricity smaller than 0.2. However, if the time of flight or the thrust acceleration become too high, less feasible solutions are perceived.","Low-thrust transfer orbit; Analytical solution; Bang-bang control; No radial thrust","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-06-30","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Often there is a lack of space near the levee or it is desired that the landscape is maintained. Because of this, alternative methods for reinforcing levees are still sought after (CUR-commissie C141, 2007). In this study, the technical feasibility of a possible alternative reinforcement method for regional flood defences is studied: mass stabilisation. Mass stabilisation is a soil improvement technique with which soft soils are mixed with a binder on site and in-place to create a stronger soil layer (Forsman et al., 2015). It is presumed that mass stabilisation requires no extra space at the levee, does not affect the landscape and requires little transportation of materials. For determining the technical feasibility of applying mass stabilisation for reinforcing regional flood defences, three criteria have been examined. First, the ability of mass stabilisation to solve a stability deficit at levees was examined using two-dimensional stability analyses. Secondly, the achievability of the required effective strength parameters in compliance with Dutch standards was examined in the laboratory. Thirdly, the practicability of mass stabilisation at levees was examined using two-dimensional stability analyses. Although the results of this thesis have shown that mass stabilisation is a technically feasible technique for reinforcing regional flood defences, further studies will be required before a definitive conclusion can be drawn. It is therefore recommended that additional analyses into the practicability are carried out and that the relationship of the properties and the variability thereof between soils stabilised in the laboratory and the field is studied.","Regional flood defence; Inward macro-stability; Mass stabilisation; Soil stabilisation; Soil improvement technique; Binders; Reinforcement method; Levee","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geo-Engineering","",""

(mentor); Pourquie, M.J.B.M. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","Horizontal Directional Drilling permits the creation of tunnels which pass beneath rivers and canals to allow the passing of services from one side to the other. The final stage of this process involves lining the tunnel with a plastic or steel pipe. The pipe is pulled inside into the borehole using the same drilling rig that was used to bore the tunnel. For the case of a plastic High Density Polyethylene (HDPE) pipe, issues of buoyancy may arise during this pullback process since the tunnel is pre-filled with drilling mud which now primarily acts as a lubricant. This presents a problem since with this buoyancy, the pipe is lifted up to brush against the tunnel wall, creating issues with the pullback process because of the added pulling resistance. There is the possibility of cutting slots in the pipe wall at the front end of the pipe in order to allow in drilling mud so as to ballast and offset this buoyancy. The drilling fluid is a suspension of bentonite in water and is characterised as a non-Newtonian shear-thinning Herschel-Bulkley fluid, which possesses a finite yield stress. This study aimed to find whether the current slot proportions used for a given borehole diameter, pipe diameter and pipe thickness are sufficient for allowing in drilling mud to ballast the pipe. This was a case where the multiphase flow given by the interaction of air and drilling mud can be simulated using CFD. OpenFOAM is used for this purpose to first simulate the current practice. The multiphase solver interFoam together with the non-Newtonian Herschel-Bulkley and air model was validated for a series of cases before the main simulations were run. These validations included the Marsh Funnel test and the Slump test. These are two kinds of workability tests used for cement pastes and drilling muds. Cement pastes and drilling muds are characterized as three-parameter Herschel-Bulkley fluids and the physical setups of the Marsh Funnel and Slump tests were replicated in computational space. The flow time of theMarsh funnel test and the slump diameter from the CFD simulations were compared with experimental data from literature thus validating the model in OpenFOAM. The main simulation setup recreates the situation of an HDPE pipe concentric with the borehole, with the axis of the domain at an angle to the horizontal. There is drilling mud above the slot at time t = 0s. The drilling mud comes into the domain from the annulus from below the slot. The simulations showed that the flow into the slot initially came in from both the drilling mud above the slot and from the inlet. After the volume of drilling mud above the slot is almost drained completely through into the inner pipe, the mud level inside the pipe starts to become comparable that outside the pipe and both interfaces rise upwards at approximately the same pace. Subsequently, certain parameters were changed from the first benchmark case in order to see what is the effect of these individual variables. The effects of a lower drilling mud yield stress, a longer pipe slot, lower drilling mud density, a different slot aperture shape, increased flow and a steeper angle of pipe penetration were all tested in the simulation campaign. The idea is that with better and faster filling, less pipe buoyancy results. An extension of this idea is that the difference between mud levels inside and outside the pipe should be kept to a minimum. That is why the aim is to increase the flow rate through the slot in the pipe. The results show that increasing the slot length by 30% from the current practice increases the throughput of drilling mud by 10%. The results also show that an elliptical slot profile has a neutral effect and decreasing the yield stress of the drilling mud has a slightly beneficial effect.","CFD; multiphase flow; OpenFOAM; Drilling; Horizontal directional drilling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

The Palmerah Tidal Bridge, an enterprise of the construction company BAM, will become future's largest tidal power plant and a floating bridge between two islands in the Flores region, Indonesia. A combination of the two functions requires a dynamic design that allows movements and a design that is able to withstand severe loads. A pre-feasibility design is proposed, however the technical feasibility is not proven yet. Safety and stability are two key concepts to substantiate the technical feasibility. In addition, an estimation of the probable motions and accelerations may indicate whether traffic is able to cross the bridge safely. The aim of the project is to create insight in the rotations and accelerations of the coupled ﬂoating bridge structure. In addition, obtaining information regarding the most sensitive structural parameters of the system may suggest design changes that result in an increase in stability. First, data is acquired that is required to create a virtual bridge model. The project location and present bridge design are analysed with available data, literature and calculations. Serviceability limits are estimated that allow traffic safely across the bridge. Governing loads that act on the bridge are determined and the structural properties of the bridge are calculated. The natural frequencies and hydrostatic properties of a single freely floating floater are calculated. The hydrostatic stiffness is used to calculate a first estimation of the roll-rotation as a result of current-induced pressures. The software programs used for the data computations are Matlab, Matrixframe, MathCad and Excel. Secondly, the data is converted into a virtual bridge model in the software package Ansys Aqwa. Ansys Aqwa is globally used to indicate the dynamic response of offshore maritime structures to wave induced pressures. The software has limitations regarding the current velocity implementation. The drag force should be defined manually and acts at the centre of gravity of the structure. As a result, the force 'moves' with the structure and the application point of the drag force can be located above the waterline. The virtual bridge model seems realistic for waves and positive flow speeds. However, the response to negative flow speeds is unrealistic, indicating that the Ansys Aqwa model is inaccurate. The model can not be calibrated as knowledge about the likely motion of the bridge is unknown, but the roll-rotation during a positive current is of the same magnitude as the stability calculation. The dynamic response to governing wave and ﬂow speed combinations is computed. With an iterative process, the sensitivity to certain parameters is found. The observations and results that are obtained during the process resulted in various alternative design proposals that may decrease the magnitude of rotation with 70%. However, even with the improved design suggestions, the estimated serviceability limits are still exceeded. The dynamic response is based upon two components, a gradual main rotation that originates by the drag force and a ﬂuctuating line over that curve that represents wave induced motion. In the end, wave induced motion will result in sincere discomfort for trafﬁc.","floating brigde; Palmerah; tidal water power; turbines; Indonesia; highly moveable; Ansys Aqwa; BAM Infraconsult","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-06-30","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","","-8.316960, 123.023429"

These so-called qualitative aspects are therefore important means in the tender to distinguish a bid from competing bids. Although competition is believed to enhance a fair quality price ratio in the tender phase, this study points out that safeguarding the competition principle throughout the execution phase is not guaranteed. It turns out, added value of a measure in the execution phase, does not always coincide with the promised value in the bid (=misalignment). The objective of this research was to determine to what extent distinctive tender elements are aligned with added value during or after project execution for projects procured with the BPQR tender procedure. Besides, the aim was to define what underlying mechanisms in the BPQR tender process are causing eventual (mis)alignment. In this regard, the following research question has been drawn: What underlying mechanisms cause (mis)alignment between distinctive BPQR tender elements and the actual added value during or after project execution? Three research phases are being distinguished in this investigation: the exploration, the analysis (consisting of phase A and phase B) and lastly the synthesis. The exploration phase involved a literature study in which the aim was to gain full understanding of the theoretical aspects surrounding the topic of research. It was found that misalignment is mainly perceived as both disadvantageous for the client as well as for the losing bidders. As a result, the current focus is on alignment between tender and practice. This explains initiatives like SMART formulation of measures and the introduction of fines for non-fulfilment. Even new ‘out of the box’ ideas emerge like involving the losing bidders of the tender in auditing the execution of the project . All these approaches aim at maximising alignment, assuming misalignment would be disadvantageous for the client. The first phase of the analysis involved the analysis of the BAM Infra tender results. This analysis is used to create a general image of the tenders on which BAM Infra did perform outstanding and thus was able to distinguish itself. Furthermore, this analysis enables a proper selection of the tenders to conduct the case study research. The second phase of the analysis therefore explores the impact of quality aspects, bothin the tendering as well as in the execution phase of a project. This second phase involves a case study on four strategically selected projects regarding the distinctive character of the tender bid for each project. Subsequently, the study assesses how these elements turn out in practice, by conducting interviews with both the client and the contractor. The first finding is that measures can be divided in four quadrants: 1. Measure not implemented; effect not achieved (Q1) 2. Measure not implemented; effect nonetheless achieved (Q2) 3. Measure implemented; effect not achieved (Q3) 4. Measure implemented; effect achieved (Q4) Only measures in the fourth quadrant are examples of alignment, since in those examples both the implementation and the effect are aligned with the original promise formulated in the bid. Literature refers to, among other causes, strategic behaviour of contractors (adverse selection, moral hazard and strategic misrepresentation) as the cause of misalignment between tender and practice. The researcher did however identify four main causes for misalignment: Change of situation (A), enhanced / new insights (B), strategic behaviour (C) and bad luck (D). Subsequently, the total set of measures determining the distinctive character of the bid has been analysed. Resulting from this analysis, the researcher composed a categorization and a list of characteristics that measures can have. The categorization is both Mutually Exclusive and Collectively Exhausting (MECE) and it involves a distinction between process vs. product measures and temporary vs.permanent measures. Furthermore, the researcher did formulate seven characteristics. These characteristics are not MECE, which implies one measure can have multiple characteristics and the list might not necessarily be limited to the seven characteristics listed below. Ø Integral measures Ø Performance measures Ø Technical specification Ø Sexy measures Ø Beads (Dutch: Spiegels en kraaltjes) Ø Commercial-off-the-shelf measures Ø Multi-applicable measures Thereafter, the measures are mapped in the quadrants and subsequently analysed on commonalities. It was found that although their abundance in the set of most distinctive measures is roughly equal, product measures are more frequently implemented and more often achieve the intended effect than process measures. Furthermore, it turned out that measures that are not implemented whilst the effect is achieved, are always process measures. However, most process measures involved concerned situations in which the added value was absent. Besides, temporary measures are most coincide with process measures and, hence, score for the majority similar with these process measures (measures not implemented prevail). Temporary measures are less often implemented than permanent ones. Also, performance measures seemed to be the perfect measures in order to achieve alignment. Nevertheless, the room for distinguishing on this type of measures is questionable. But since the promised effect is very likely to be achieved by these measures, criteria of high importance of the clients could best be formulated as a performance measure. Commercial-off-the-shelf measures are preferred by contractors since they are easy to implement and are proven concepts. Yet, the clients state that these measures do not add value, since they would also have been conducted anyway. Sexy measures come with a large reputational risk for the client. This also relates to the responsibility public authorities have: generating public value. If public expenditures do not generate the value expected; public authorities will encounter social discontent. Based on the findings of this research, the following conclusions are drawn that answer the main research question: What underlying mechanisms cause (mis)alignment between distinctive BPQR tender elements and the actual added value during or after project execution? This research pointed out several causes for misalignment, of which strategic behaviour is one category. Strategic behaviour does however not dominate. It was however found that presumably, changes of circumstances are stimulating strategic behaviour of contractors. Issues underlying causes of misalignment are amongst others: multi-headedness of both the client as well as the contractor; lack of full-openness (of both parties) during the competitive dialogue and the use of inappropriate criteria to mitigate future maintenance costs in a construction contract. This results in misunderstanding, or a lack of (correct) information. In this respect it was learned that higher similarity in team composition (i.e.linking pin principle) between tendering and execution phase, can avoid loss of background information on important measures in a project. The research did also reveal that alignment is no holy grail. The focus on alignment not always generates value. Of the identified causes for misalignment, several cases are found in which fulfilment of the measure appeared to be disadvantageous for the client (!). This is especially the case when new insights occur and unforeseen added value appears. Yet, this study reveals that in those cases the specific measure involved often is not implemented. So, client satisfaction can also be achieved in case of misalignment. Although important, alignment is no cure for contractual discussions. A rigid focus on alignment may even have a negative impact on the provided added value for the client (and thus a negative impact on public value). Discussions whether measures are righteously implemented or not, consume time. And time – delay – means money. Given the fact that most clients are public bodies, this would involve loss of taxpayer’s money. In addition, rigid focus on alignment will put strain on the element of trust in the relationship between contractor and client, bringing the positive outcome of other future discussions in jeopardy. This reflection implicitly emphasises that a more externally focused value approach may have its advantages. Initiatives such as mixed client-contractor construction teams (Dutch: Bouw teams), that have an entirely different approach of project definition before the tendering phase, anticipate on that. In other words: currently the aim is to maximise internally focused value (=alignment of tender and practice) but in the end the evolving relevant issues all seem to indicate more externally focused value generating approaches in the future.","Misalignment; Infrastructure industry; Construction Industry; Tender procedures; Public procurement; Best Price Quality Ratio","en","master thesis","","","","","","Some parts of this thesis are not made publicly available due to confidentiality reasons","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

As mobile phones became more important to our daily lives they've taken up a bigger part in forensic research as well. These devices contain digital traces telling us the story of our lives. Digital forensic research traditionally focused on recovering data, in particular data from broken or undocumented systems. While security was not the primary concern of most manufacturers, this has changed in recent times. Cryptography has become a major roadblock in forensic science, which has shifted the focus from recovery towards exploitation. Traditionally Digital forensic research focused on physical acquisition. While often tools supported logical extraction, this would leave many deleted traces inside of the memory chip intact. Instead methods such as Flasher tools, JTAG-based acquisition, In-System Programming and Chip-off were often used to make images of the physical contents of the memory chip. This would then be analyzed by data-analysts in order to extract evidence from the images. On many modern devices cryptography has ensured that these methods are no longer effective. Software exploitation techniques such as DirtyCow have proven to become much more important in digital forensic science, but more methods should be developed. JTAG is of particular interest in this regard. It is a testing system that was previously left unsecured and providing attackers with an easy way in. More recently manufacturers have started using novel ways of protecting JTAG from malicious use, but very little research exists testing these new security measures. This is a recipe for vulnerabilities. This thesis focuses on attacking Secure JTAG; Samsung's authentication module for ARM CoreSight. Several potential attacks have been highlighted that are potentially applicable to Secure JTAG. A novel model has been developed that allows an attacker to evaluate the complexity of their attacks. While models such as CVSS and DREAD exist, these focus on threat analysis rather than offensive research. Using this model two attacks were chosen: One focusing on reversing the internal JTAG boundary scan chains and the other attempting to force authentication through fault injection. In order to reverse the JTAG boundary scan chains a new set of tools had to be developed. Existing tools were often incapable of communicating with the internal scan chains or did not provide enough freedom to enable research. After their development these new tools were able to confirm that the internal scan chains were secured. The internal boundary scan chains will not be a viable attack vector until the authentication mechanism is circumvented. The second attack focused on a potential fault injection vulnerability in the Secure JTAG authentication scheme. Because Secure JTAG is a purely hardware component it provided a unique challenge. Where normally firmware is analyzed to prove the existence of a vulnerability, Secure JTAG has no such firmware available. This makes discerning between failure because the device is not vulnerable and failure because of chance nearly impossible. To increase confidence in the attack and decrease attack space this project focused on Electromagnetic Side-channel Analysis. By locating the signals produced by Secure JTAG authentication it is possible to greatly reduce the attack space, thereby increasing confidence in the attack. In the end correlating signals were located near the high-power processor of the chip, albeit not the hashing engine itself. This lowered the attack space enough for an eventual fault injection attack.","Samsung; Secure JTAG; ARM","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-11-13","","","","Computer Science | Cyber Security","",""

The retreat of the cliffs will eventually result in losing university assets, infrastructure and archaeological treasures. Wave-induced sediment transports are supposed to be the main marine erosion mechanism. This report presents other potential marine erosion mechanisms (e.g. direct wave attack, sediment budget deficits, sea-level rise and increased storm intensity) over different time scales and studies the sediment transport and budgets in more detail. The study is performed with the help of a numerical hydrodynamic model with representative scenarios of the hydrodynamic conditions. The model and scenarios are set-up by means of a site visit, literature, water level records, wind and wave records and sediment samples. The resulting scenarios and results provide an hydrodynamical overview of flow- and wave conditions. Subsequently, the sediment transports, indeed, seem to be initiated by waves. Results also opened up a new potential sediment transport path not yet mentioned by sources. However, the sediment transports does not seem to be the only erosion mechanism. A potential human-induced sediment budget deficit is likely as well. Additionally the direct wave attack and the combined sea-level rise and intensified storms are also either present or becoming more relevant in the future. The contents of this report forms a basis for developing design criteria for a coastal solution to the marine erosion of the Point Grey cliffs. An engineered beach, together with a foreshore nourishment, out of locally dredged material seems like the most logical option. By further improving the numerical model and the overall study with presented recommendations, this study can inspire further design steps for a solution to save the Point Grey cliffs.","coastal cliff erosion; Point Grey; Vancouver; Canada","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","","49.269142, -123.263475"

Conventional wastewater treatment plants are not designed for the removal of OMPs and need to be upgraded to reduce OMP contamination. The adsorption of OMPs to zeolites is proposed as an alternative treatment method. Zeolites are synthesized as powders, however they need to be shaped into pellets to be used in water treatment practice. This research focussed on engineering zeolite pellets and which properties of these pellets are important for the adsorption of OMPs. <br/>First the influence of the calcination temperature and binder content on the mechanical stability and porosity of the pellets was analysed. Second, the influence of two different preparation techniques (extrusion and high-shear granulation) and the introduction of a polymer on the mechanical stability, porosity and adsorption kinetics of the pellets was assessed. Third, the effect of the porosity on the breakthrough for an empty bed contact time (EBCT) of 20, 5 and 1 minute(s) was determined according to the linear driving force (LDF) model. It was found that an increasing binder content and calcination temperature increased the wear resistance and porosity of the pellets. However, the effect on the porosity is minimal. The introduction of the polymer had opposite effect on extruded and granulated pellets. For extruded pellets, the introduction of the polymer increased the porosity. However, the granulated pellets showed a decrease in porosity. A relation was found between the porosity and the wear resistance and between the porosity and adsorption kinetics. A larger porosity decreased the wear resistance of the pellets and increased the kinetic rate constant. The porosity was of great importance in relation to the breakthrough. First, the porosity in the zeolite pellets determined to a great extent the bulk density of the filter bed. A higher bulk density resulted in a later breakthrough point. The bulk density was also influenced by the shape of the pellet. Spherically-shaped (granulated) pellets had a higher bulk density than rod-shaped (extruded) pellets. Second, the porosity was related to the kinetic rate constant. At lower EBCTs (5 and 1 minute), the kinetic rate constant had an influence on the breakthrough point. For these EBCTs, a higher kinetic rate constant led to a later breakthrough point. It was recommended to optimize the zeolite pellets by making the extruded pellets in a more spherically-shaped form and to start column experiments to validate the LDF-model.","Zeolite pellets; Micropollutants; Adsorption","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study aimed to discern how the signal robustness of a novel modular sensor based on the technology of the MPA is dependent on the contact force between the vascularized tissue and the sensor surface. PWV data was collected as the distal phalanx of the left index finger from 26 subjects was placed on the Force Alterable- MPA (FA-MPA). Contact force was altered by placing differing weights (0-300g, 50g increments) on top of the phalanx using a linear stage. Contact force was determined as weight measured by a scale underneath the FA-MPA. PWV and weight data was collected from a total of 182 measurements. Measurements were pooled in 8 weight groups between 0 and 400g at increments of 50g according to the weight that was measured during that measurement. PWV data per weight group was analyzed for three characteristics: 1. Pulse Wave Quality Ratio (PWQR); 2. PWV variance; 3. Realistic and non-negative values for PWV. ANOVA of PWQR resulted in a significant effect between weight groups (p = 6.91E-7). Further qualitative judging of data resulted in the recommendation to thoroughly redesign the FA-MPA for structural and electrical integrity and measurement protocol for elimination of movement and placement artifacts and to reiterate the experiment for the contact force range of 1.96 to 4.43N.","photoplethysmography; pulse wave velocity; contact force; variance; pressure pulse wave; signal robustness; photodiode; artifact","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-06-12","","","","Mechanical Engineering | BioMechanical Design","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","class=""MsoNormal"">When propellers are operating near the free surface,  phenomenon called ventilation might occur. Due to insufficient immersion and high thrust loading, the propeller draws air, resulting in a reduced thrust. Reduced thrust may have consequences such as loss of propulsive power, control and steerability, and may therefore be leading to safety issues. Long time exposure to ventilation’s unsteady torque loading can also lead to propulsive unit malfunctioning. As propeller diameters tend to grow bigger, free surface clearance decreases and room is left for air to be drawn. To increase understanding of the phenomenon, current experimental and numerical research was executed.  The used propeller was a Wageningen C4.55-propeller, an in design condition lightly-loaded propeller with low blade area, fitting to the trend of increasing diameters. The research was bound by perfect conditions to capture ventilation in the purest form; no influences of wake, waves and ship motion were taken into account. Experimental research showed that free surface ventilation appeared to be the most stable and predictable ventilation regime. Inception through free surface breaking mainly depends on the pressure gradient between the propeller tip and free surface, the tip immersion rate and the ability to draw the free surface. Increased ventilation thrust breakdown showed to be influenced by the local velocity on the blade, which mainly depends on the propeller rotation rate. Vortex ventilation was the most unstable regime in the experiments. Inception seems to be independent of the propeller loading, but influenced by local flow phenomena in the area above the propeller and propeller characteristics . It is believed that vortex inception, shape and wash-out resembles the appearance of the cavitating propeller-hull vortex. Vortex ventilation showed a bistability effect. Experimental results were obtained using a statistical research planning/Design of Experiments, such that polynomial models could be constructed. The model fitted the data well, demonstrated by the fitting coefficient r2 exceeding 0.9. Structural shortcomings were found in capturing the highly unsteady vortex ventilation, variations in mixed ventilation and increased thrust breakdown in free surface ventilating. Numerically, ventilation was simulated using the incompressible VoF-solver ReFRESCO. Vortex ventilation inception was not found, even when a scale resolving simulation was conducted. This is ascribed to insufficient application of the SRS-model in the near blade area, due to insufficient convergence of the omega-equation. Also application of Boussinesqs assumption in the k-equation might be stringent. Free surface ventilation inception was accurately found, both in simulations with a for ventilation adapted actuator disk model and with the propeller. Thrust breakdown was underestimated by CFD. Only breakdown due to surface piercing was found. Underestimation is ascribed to the absence of air entrainment. Application of TNT-EARSM-model (which is not using Boussinesqs assumption) and application of free-slip boundary conditions did not improve the shortcoming. As in literature, other free surface discretization schemes showed the same lack of air engtrainment, the origin might be in the VoF-assumption, being the increased interpolated density used in the momentum equation which prevents air to be convected.    ","ventilation; air drawing; thrust breakdown; thrust loss; Wageningen C; propeller; Design of Experiments; Volume of fluid","en","master thesis","","","","","","Experimental data may only be used with permission of MARIN.","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

However, in the Netherlands, the transmission costs of the offshore wind electricity are socialized. This would force the un-subsidized wind-farms to feed their electricity into the public grid exposing them directly to the whole sale electricity market. With large shares of wind penetration in the market, the value of the electricity is declining. At the same time, the intermittent nature of the renewable energy sources generates large demand for flexibility in the electricity system. These pros and cons of renewable energy sources create new opportunities for electrification of other sectors to support achieving Paris climate agreement goals of the country. Heat and hydrogen sectors are identified as potential flexibility options to facilitate the de-carbonization of the energy system by 2050.

This has resulted in a growing concern that today pilots lack the skills to safely and successfully prevent or recover from unexpected aircraft upset events or to take over controls after a sudden transition to manual flying. Although the necessity to reverse this decline in manual flying skills, by developing and implementing additional standards and guidelines for (recurrent) training procedures, is a topic of current interest, additional research is required to be able to implement scientifically substantiated standards to ensure pilots receive sufficient training opportunities to develop, maintain and improve manual flying proficiency. A human-in-the-loop-experiment was conducted to objectively and quantitatively evaluate the acquisition, decay and retention of skill-based manual control behavior in a compensatory dual-axis roll and pitch attitude tracking task. In this study, thirty-eight fully task-naive participants were trained in a fixed-base setting in the Human-Machine Interaction Laboratory at Delft University of Technology and subsequently divided into three groups based on their training performance. Performance of the first group was re-evaluated after a period of non-practice of six months, while the second group was retested at both three and six months after training and skill retention of the third group was measured after two, four and six months. The goal of the experiment was to model the decay curve of skill-based manual control behavior and to determine the reacquisition rate of lost skills compared to their initial acquisition rate. To quantify changes in manual control skills, participants’ control behavior was modeled using quasi-linear human operator models. The results suggest that control skills decay following a negatively accelerating decay curve and that lost skills are reacquired at a higher rate than their initial development rate. However, to construct a decay curve which is able to accurately model skill decay over an extended period of time, a larger-scale experiment should be conducted with a larger number of participants and periods of non-practice ranging from a few hours or days up to several years.","retention; long-term; skill decay; manual control tracking task; skill-based control behavior; cybernetic approach; human operator modeling; time-varying identification; crossfeed; cross-coupling; human operator remnant","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-06-12","","","","Aerospace Engineering | Control & Simulation","",""

(mentor); Cervone, A. (graduation committee); van Kampen, E. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","Current and future space missions require agile and reliable spacecraft capable of trailing and keeping the required attitude. Most of the agile spacecraft missions are near-Earth based but some are placed far away from Earth and its influence. One example of such missions is the Athena mission, which requires the spacecraft to perform fast and large-angle attitude slew manoeuvres. Such manoeuvres often imply simultaneous use of multiple actuators such as thrusters and reaction wheels (RWs). A fault in any of these actuators might lead to partial or full damage of sensitive spacecraft instruments. In this research project, a novel model-based Fault Detection and Isolation (FDI) strategy is proposed, which is able to detect and isolate various actuator faults, such as stuck-open/closed thruster, thruster leakage, loss of effectiveness of all thrusters, and change of RW friction torque due to change of Coulomb and/or viscosity factor. Moreover, the proposed FDI strategy is also able to detect and isolate faults affecting the RWs tachometer. The design of the FDI algorithm is based on a multiplicative extended Kalman filter, a generalised likelihood ratio thresholding of the residual signals, and a logic algorithm which unequivocally link the faults to the symptoms. The performance and robustness of the proposed FDI strategy are evaluated using Monte Carlo simulations and carefully defined FDI performance indices. In addition, the influence of faults’ magnitudes, times of fault occurrence, and uncertainties’ magnitudes on the FDI system performance are evaluated. Preliminary results suggest promising performance in terms of detection/isolation times, miss-detection/isolation rates, and false alarm rates. Also, uncertainties on the spacecraft inertia seem to have a negative impact on the FDI performance. In order to fully understand the research project presented here, graduate-level knowledge on rigid body dynamics and kinematics, control theory, and filters applied to estimation might be required. If any of these areas are not known by the reader, it is recommended to read some of the associated literature referenced in the bibliography.","Fault Detection; Model based; Fault Isolation; Agile spacecraft; Reaction Wheels; Thrusters","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

This paper aims to develop a conceptual model to describe these effects. Comparable to customary theories in transport geography, this conceptual model includes socio-demographic factors, attitudes, residential relocation and the built environment. Besides, the interests, goals and experiences of stakeholders that include these combinations are analysed. The analysis is based on a series of 12 semi-structured interviews with carsharing providers, municipalities and developers in the Netherlands. Using two examples of residential buildings that include a low parking requirement and carsharing, this article examines to what extent parking requirement and offering carsharing leads to a reduction of car ownership and use of carsharing compared to control cases. Based on online surveys (n=18/68) carried out, descriptive analyses and binary analysis were performed. <br/>The findings show that the stakeholders have the same goals. However, they have different experiences regarding car use and car ownership. The effects on car ownership and use of carsharing may also be influenced by other factors that are described in the conceptual model. Lastly, the findings of the differences between the selected and the control cases, show that it often appears that households in the selected cases did not have a car beforehand. Moreover, offering a shared car does not have a clear influence on its use. However, the use of the shared car and the ownership of the shared car may be explained by other factors.

To study the opportunity for Ampelmann to expand to the floating market it is necessary to see if working with floating structures requires a new way of operating. A potential market for Ampelmann is transferring maintenance personnel to catenary anchored leg moored (CALM) buoys. These on- and offloading buoys for tankers are stationed relatively close to shore and are connected to an onshore storage facility. <br/>The current method of connecting the Ampelmann system to an offshore structure is done by applying a constant force on the target structure to keep the gangway connected. There is a dynamic interaction between the Ampelmann system and the floating structure, which potentially can influence the motions of the floating structure and the workability of the Ampelmann system. <br/>The current method of calculating the workability is based on a kinematic approach where dynamic interaction is not included. The effect of the dynamic interaction between the Ampelmann system and the CALM buoy has been studied by a numeric, coupled, time-domain model. Using this model the response of the coupled system will be compared with and without the dynamic interaction of the gangway forces acting on the buoy. <br/>An analytical approach is used to perform a sensitivity study of the parameters exerting the total damping forces on the CALM buoy. This study showed that the hydrodynamical damping of the buoy is the governing factor. According to diffraction data of the buoy, the hydrodynamical damping can vary significantly in the frequency spectrum. For low- and high-frequency waves the hydrodynamical damping of the buoy is much lower than in the mid-frequency spectrum. The damping forces caused by the gangway are of bigger impact when the hydrodynamic damping of the buoy is low. This is used to create a case-study for regular, low-frequency waves to study the influence of the gangway damping forces on the motions of the buoy. This case study is used in the numerical model of aNySIM, and in a numerical model based on the analytical approach in Python. Both showed that the amplitudes of the motions of the buoy are reduced by the damping forces of the gangway.<br/>A workability study has been performed by creating time series of the dynamic interaction using the 3D aNySIM model and then comparing it to the operational limits using a MATLAB model. The operational percentage and statistics of each sea state results in the total workability. The workability obtained with a dynamic approach is improved by 1% compared to the workability obtained with a kinematic approach.<br","workability; Ampelmann; Dynamic Interaction; Numerical Analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

Nowa Huta was designed and build as a socialist ideal city in the socialist era, complete with its own steel plant where the majority of the inhabitants worked. The Lenin steel factory provided work, but it also financed social services in the town. The mono-product economy resulted in a working class society and was a political counterweight to Krakow, the intellectual city of the bourgeoise. Nowa Huta is incorporated in Krakow and is now a neglected neighborhood in a historic and vibrant city , attracting many foreign investors and tourists. The collapse of the Iron Curtain in 1989 was not only a shift of the political regime, it was also the starting point of globalization in Poland. The steel plant got exposed to the international market and the production of steel shifted partially to other countries such as China. The steel plant and the Nowa Hutians suffered not only financially but also socially from this. The mono product economy, once so powerful, turned out to be vulnerable.<br/>Nowadays, the inhabitants of Nowa Huta still suffer from socioeconomic problems relating to the image of the city, the deindustrialization and the urban neglect. This also resulted in high levels of socio-spatial segregation and social inequality within the region. Current trends do not seem to solve these problems, in fact, these trends only enlarge the segregation and inequality. Without interventions and redevelopment, the once so promoted neighborhood Nowa Huta will soon suffer from intergenerational segregation and inequality. This also negatively affects the metropolitan area as a whole. The overall aim for this research is informing powerful governmental stakeholders in Krakow about the problems <br/>involving Nowa Huta and giving them a possible strategy for regenerating and revitalizing the neighborhood. This research tries to discover and describe potentials for design interventions by utilizing local stakeholders.

In these tasks the goal is to design agents’ paths so as every point in the area of interest is covered more than once. In literature the persistent surveillance problem has been addressed under two different frameworks: 1) the visitation frequency of a finite set of points (discrete spaces) and 2) the amount of coverage offered by the agents over the area of interest. In the first category agents aim at visiting a finite set of points in the area so as the time elapsed since a point was last visited is minimized over the set. Here, the environment is considered static and no information on the coverage condition of the points is available. In the second category the environment is characterized by a property that changes over time, called coverage level and the goal is to design agents’ paths so as the coverage level is maintained at a desired level over the area. In this approach the error between the actual and desired coverage level of the area is bounded. However, locally no information is available on the frequency at which each point gets covered. The novelty of this thesis lies in the integration of the aforementioned solution approaches so as complete coverage information is provided for a finite set of points. Here, the goal is to design the agents’ paths so as the coverage level of each point is bounded from below by a desired level. The paths are planned over a finite optimization horizon and found as a solution to a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP). Two formulations of the problem are proposed and their efficiency is validated in simulation. The recursive feasibility of the centralized problem is also guaranteed when a set of time-varying terminal constraints is introduced to the problem. These constraints force agents to move along a pre-defined set of closed paths designed in a way that the coverage level boundness constraint is always satisfied. A two-step method is proposed for their design that relies on the solution of a Linear Program (LP) when a set of closed paths violating the objective is given, found as a solution to a modified version of the proposed MILP at step 1. Finally, two distributed formulations of the problem are introduced in which agents solve in parallel a local path planning problem. The difference on these methods lies in the accuracy of the information available to the agents for planning. Despite this difference simulation tests show a difference of only 1.5% in the coverage level performance when various sized teams of agents are employed for the task.","Multi-robot systems; MILP; Persistent Coverage","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

(mentor); Jommi, C. (mentor); van Eijck, L. (mentor); Zhou, Z. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","Peat is formed by biochemical processes and the accumulation of the soil depends on the aerobic and anaerobic conditions. The soil covers five to eight percent of the land surface of the earth. For this thesis a peat coming from a site called Markermeeer, which is a lake between the provinces Noord-Holland and Flevoland in the Netherlands, is used. The fabric of peat consists of a fine dark peat material and fibres. The peat material is made of water and decomposed plant tissue whereas the fibres consist of fragments of (semi-)degraded wood, stems, branches and grass. Furthermore the cell walls of the fibres consists of a primary and a secondary wall which are mostly made of cellulose and lignin. Knowing the fabric of wet peat is of importance to better understand the role of fibres in the unusual behavior of the soil. Previous studies on imaging wet peat with X-ray micro CT has proven to be difficult due to the indistinguishable linear attenuation coefficient of the peat organic matter and water. This coefficient is a function of the interactions of X-rays with the materials present in peat. Flushing a peat sample with lead(II)nitrate have shown to be the most successful approach to show the stems and branches in a peat sample using X-ray micro CT. However, according to \cite{kettridge2008x} this flushing approach showed that the focus was limited on the larger fibres present in the sample because the different materials in peat have almost the same linear attenuation coefficient and therefore this thesis also focuses on two other techniques to image the fabric of wet peat.<br/> Neutron CT was performed on cylindrical peat samples. This technique uses a thermal neutron beam to image a sample and was available at the Reactor Institute Delft. The resolution of this imaging station is 150 $\mu$m. Since the cell walls and the peat material between the fibres in peat have both a large attenuation coefficient for neutrons, it was not possible to distinguish the fibres from the peat material between the fibres, using this technique. To gain a contrast heavy water was used to replace the water because it has a low attenuation coefficient. Flushing a peat sample with heavy water showed the most effective way to do so. The aim of this procedure was to get a contrast difference between the peat material between the fibres and the fibres itself. A triaxial setup was used to flush the sample with heavy water. Heavy water diffused in the water present in the peat inducing a decrease in attenuation of the peat material between the fibres. The reconstructed tomographic images were filtered using a 3D visualization program Avizo version 9.4. Only the air-filled fibres could be observed on the tomographic images whereas the water-filled fibres could not be observed. Samples of the same peat were scanned in a dry and wet state using a X-ray micro CT scanner present at the geoscience section of TU Delft. On the tomographic images of the wet sample, white halo were observed representing the cell walls of the fibres.<br/>X-ray phase CT present at the Ghent University Centre for X-ray CT was performed on a peat sample coming from the same site. This method results in an image contrast using a large fixed distance for low absorbing materials like peat. The aim of this scan was to reveal more fibres than observed with the X-ray micro CT scan at TU Delft. However, edge enhancement did not occur because of the filtering needed during reconstruction of the raw data to visualize different structures in peat. \\ The white halo could be thresholded and filtered in avizo resulting in a 3D image of the rod-like fibres. These fibres were randomly orientated. On the micro CT scan of the sample in a dry state other fibrous structures than the rod-like fibres were observed. These fibres were not shown as white halo on the tomographic images of the wet samples.","peat; imaging; X-ray; neutron; tomography; fibres","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-06-11","","","","Geo-Engineering","Master project report",""

Extending the road network is no option and the public transport network cannot keep up with the capacity either. A solution must be found in another type of transport: cycling. The current bicycle infrastructure is not sufficient in terms of connectivity. In this research, a standardised bicycle network is developed for a part of the city, which can be used during future bicycle expansion projects in São Paulo. The development of the bicycle infrastructure concerns the whole city of São Paulo, resulting in a lot of interests being affected. The people behind these interests, the stakeholders, can have an influence over the project decisions, but do usually have conflicting interests. Therefore, these stakeholders are identified and analysed, through literature review and semi-structured interviews. In this case however, most stakeholders did not seem to experience any conflicts. The biggest problem in the development of the bicycle network, is that the stakeholders all work towards the same goal, but do now cooperate towards that goal. Cooperation between multiple stakeholders would result in more power, meaning they could makemore of an impact together. Most of the stakeholder‘s expectations could be met in this case, resulting in a satisfying design for most people. As a result of literature review and the performed interviews, a list of requirements is developed as a basis for the rest of the design of the bicycle network. The conclusion was made that not only a sufficient network needed to be designed, but that incentives for use were also needed. Therefore, the list of requirements is divided into three categories: infrastructure network, incentives for use and long-term guidelines and recommendations. The rest of the standardised design is based on the list of requirements. According to the requirement list, the new cycling network has been designed by greedy algorithm. The new plan can achieve 99.51%inhabitants with 320 metres of the walking distance. And it requires a new bridge for only cyclists and pedestrians’ use to cross Pinheiros River. Due to the demand of a bridge, a structural design is required. A literature review was performed, investigating the existing situation regarding the infrastructure. In the literature study, the different bridge types with their pro’s and con’s are described. Based on the existing situation and the literature study, a sound bicycle and pedestrian bridge design is designed. In this situation, for the standardised bridge, an arch bridge is the best choice. The standardised design allows for an efficient and fast design and execution process. This design process is obtained by using a parametric design in Rhinoceros and Grasshopper, so the design of the bridge can be used for multiple spans.","Sao Paulo; Bicycle Infrastructure; Traffic Jams; Stakeholders; Bridges","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","","MDP281","-23.5505, -46.6333"

However, agent observations do not yet include lane change intentions of surrounding vehicles. Resulting agents were able to drive on a maximum of three lanes and unfit to drive in lane changing environments. We aim to simplify the current state-of-the-art agent frameworks even further to improve performance.

In order for the model to deliver accurate predictions, a valid model structure and well chosen parameters are needed. Model parameters can be highly fluctuating or complex to predict, especially when looking into tyre ground surface interaction models. Instead of predicting parameter values beforehand, they could be estimated and updated in real-time. Fluctuation or incorrectness can be adjusted while driving. However, this uncertainty in parameter value must be accounted for when applying control. Solving this problem by regarding the uncertainty in parameters of the internal vehicle model as a POMDP has been researched in this paper. The research question being: is it worthwhile to use the POMDP approach for online parameter estimation of autonomous passenger vehicles? To answer this multiple sub-questions have been composed. We start off looking into: what is the most suitable vehicle model? Different vehicle models and tyre models were compared. Literature showed the bicycle model in combination with the linearized tyre model to be most suitable for autonomous passenger vehicles. The next question is: What is the most promising algorithm? Using literature, suitable algorithms for solving this POMDP have been found and compared. From three compelling algorithms, the one best fitting the autonomous driving criteria was chosen. Knowing the model and the algorithm for the simulation the next question became: Does the algorithm perform on a vehicle model? To answer this question, the simulation has been implemented in MATLAB and performance has been tested. The results showed significant increase in parameter estimation performance. Within 2 timesteps the estimate had converged correctly. The next question is: Does the algorithm perform within realistic bounds? To answer this question, the same simulation as before has been used, but now with saturation on the steering input. This showed parameter estimation performance increase compared to the original trajectory, but not as overwhelming as without saturation. The next question is: Does the algorithm suffer from high noise? To answer this question, the same simulation has been used, but now with different levels of noise. The results showed parameter estimation performance significantly affected by increasing noise. The final sub-question is: Does the algorithm suit increasing model complexity? To answer this question, the amount of parameters have been increased in the simulation and there has been looked into the large matrices that accompany the algorithm. Results showed that increasing the complexity has a significant effect on the size of the simulation and algorithm matrices. In conclusion, from all of these experiments arose some very interesting results. This produced a useful insight into the strengths and weaknesses of the POMDP algorithm performing on a passenger vehicle, answering the research question. This also led to various recommendations for future research. Interesting would be altering the belief filter to enhance performance on bounded steering input and increased sensor noise.","POMDP; parameter estimation; online; tyre model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Vehicle Engineering","",""

(mentor); Veeneman, Wijnand (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","The current construction market is segregated, under-performs and becomes more complex. Often leaving the client helpless when projects go wrong. Consortia arise to handle the complexity and segregation, while improved collaboration between contractors can raise performance, but do consortia solve these problems? This research examines whether consortia affect the collaboration between contractors and if the client can influence this collaboration. Therefore, research objective is: <i>”Improving collaboration in construction consortia in the Netherlands by gaining insight in (different client and contractor related) factors, which influence unanticipated key moments”</i>. The research question that is answered to reach the research objective is <i>”How does the client’s influence, on decision-making by contractors in key moments, differ when working with a consortium instead of a main contractor with subcontractor?” </i>The research considered three factors and five hypotheses that have been derived from literature. The factors are expected to be influential for collaboration, be- ing: management style, relational capability and contractual context. All include more specific, measurable sub-factors. The hypotheses are expected consequences of working with a consortium and relate to collaboration between contractors and to the involvement of the client. The influence of the client on the factors has been assessed, as has the factors’ influence on collaboration. This is done in four Dutch construction projects, using a combination of semi-structured interviews and sur- veys. Two of the projects are consortia and two are executed main contractor – sub-contractors (MC-SCs). Collaboration is examined using an ’unanticipated key moment’-approach, where two unexpected decision (during execution) were analysed. The decision-making process is traced to find which factors were of influence in which project and whether the client had an influence on them. The influences have been gathered and combined per case to conclude which factors influence decision-making and whether the client has an influence on this. The findings were then compared cross-case to draw better founded conclusions and to find what is affected by working in a consortium. This includes confirming or rejecting the hypotheses. As a last step, the results are validated using an expert panel of tender and contract managers from the client’s side. The research found that, though all factors influenced decision-making, the client’s influence was limited. Relational capability has the highest influence on decision- making and the client has the most influence through the contractual context (i.e. incentives and contract type), the broadening of solution space and improving the contractor’s higher management commitment. Though, the differences between MC-SCs and consortia were small for the factors, the hypotheses gave more insight in the differences. Working with a consortium does not improve the relation between contractors, neither does it improve goal alignment or reduces negative impact of conflicts. Working with a consortium does reduce the influence of the client on decision-making. Knowing that working with a consortium reduces the client’s influence and knowing that the contractual context, broadening of solution space and improving higher management commitment are possibilities for the client to influence decision-making, it is recommend to the client to use a combination of these if a larger influence is wanted. Above all, even though consortia are sometimes seen as a remedy against segregation, they are definitely not a guarantee for good collaboration and integration.","Construction Management; Collaboration; Consortium","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","Integral Design and Management",""

(graduation committee); Jonkman, Sebastiaan N. (graduation committee); Korswagen Eguren, Paul (graduation committee); Pasterkamp, Sander (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","’De Watersnood van 1953’, the largest Dutch flood in recent history, caused the death of 1795 people in the Netherlands directly from the flood conditions, while in the UK, 315 were recorded. Most of them were among those whose residence collapsed due to high water depth, quick rise rate of the water or strong flow velocity. Based on historical data of floods with similar flood characteristics and comparable buildings, mortality functions were developed to estimate the number of fatalities. These functions are still used, but the correlation between the flood characteristics and the damage observation is not clear according to multiple studies. The current study contributes to improving these functions by investigating which flood conditions may lead to collapse of the residences in the current Dutch building stock. From the BAG-registration (in Dutch: Basisregistratie Adressen en Gebouwen) it is found that 50% of the Dutch live in terraced houses (in Dutch: rijtjeshuizen), which is similar in the areas which are most likely to be affected by flooding. Most of these residences are built in the period of the housing shortage between 1965 and 1975 and the energy crisis between 1975 and 1994, which are considered as ’the typical Dutch residence’. This residence type consists of cavity walls with a load-bearing leaf of concrete or unreinforced masonry (URM), which can be clay or calcium-silicate. This inner leaf is tied to the outer leaf of URM consisting of perforated clay units, wood-based materials, or concrete. Stability is provided by piers in the façades in case of the URM walls or rigid connections between the concrete floor and walls. To define the properties of the building materials, existing experimental research on the masonry is used.<br/>Experiments with a physical model were conducted herein to measure the quasi-steady load in the form of pressures acting on different elements of the residence. This enables the comparison of the quasi-steady flood load and the lateral load due to wind on different elements of a building. Similar to FEMA (2011), it was found that the pressure coefficient decreases when the width-to-water depth ratio decreases. However, higher coefficients are found from the experiments than those provided by FEMA, resulting in higher hydrodynamic loads. Furthermore, the orientation of the residence compared to the flow direction changes the angle of attack. When the flow is perpendicular to the wall, the pressure coefficient is the largest. Decreasing the angle of attack causes a decrease of the pressure due to equal flood conditions. The pressure coefficients obtained from the experiments are used to define the hydrodynamic load due to flooding. The resistance of the load-bearing cavity walls, windows and piers were compared to the acting moment due to different depth-flow velocity combinations. The resistance of out-of-plane bending of the load-bearing wall is the critical failure mechanism for typical Dutch residences. Residences with calcium-silicate masonry walls and system floors have a higher resistance than residences with clay masonry walls and timber floors. Cracks start to develop at a small lateral load resulting in zero tension strength after cracking and an eccentricity of the normal force. This makes the influence of the dead weight carried by the wall, in combination with the compression strength and the thickness, more important than the flexural bending strength.<br/>All types of residences, using design values, already collapse before the hv-product (water depth times flow velocity) of 7 m2/s is reached according to Clausen (1989). A water depth of ±1.2 meters for the older residences (1965-1975) and ±1.8 meters for the newer residences (1975-1994), already cause the design moment resistance of the wall without taking the velocity or wave action into account. If the flood water has a flow velocity of 2 m/s or waves are generated by a wind speed of 29.5 m/s over a fetch of 100 m, the critical water depth reduces to respectively ±0.9 and 1.5 meters.","flood actions; damage; masonry; structural analysis; experimental; pressure coefficients; drag coefficients; failure mechanisms","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering | Hydraulic Structures","",""

This time consuming task can, on various levels, be improved and made more efficient. Technology Assisted Review (TAR) is already one of the available machine learning algorithms that helps speeding up the process of finding relevant information. In Technology Assisted Review a model is trained based on the classification of e-mails by expert review. During the review process TAR continuously gives back the (potentially) most relevant e-mails that still need to be given a classification. The downside of this algorithm is that a manual expert review is still needed before TAR can give recommendations. This thesis will focus on introductory research on models that give an initial sorting before the expert review is done. The hypothesis that will be used is that this sorting (or classification) can be done in a similar manner as spam e-mails are removed to the junk folder in a mailbox. Three different features have been used (word frequencies, word occurrences and length of an e-mail) on four different models for each feature (A generative and discriminative model, each with maximum likelihood estimation or Bayesian estimation). Each of these 12 different implementations have been tested on three different datasets (TREC, ENRON and a confidential dataset). Based on 5-fold cross validation the Bayesian generative model based on word frequencies has been shown to perform best on the confidential dataset. This model shows that a classification at the start of a digital fraud investigation can be helpful. Combining different models, and finding the best parameters for practical usage of the model is left for further research.","classification; fraud; generative model; discriminative model; Naive Bayes; logistic regression; TAR; e-Discovery; Bayesian statistics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These threshold values are very useful for structural designers, because during the construction of new structures or the demolition of existing structures, it is important to know if these structural vibrations can lead to damage to surrounding structures. However, for vibration speeds that exceed those threshold values, it is difficult to calculate the probability of failure of those structures. During this thesis, a procedure is proposed as a guideline to calculate probabilities of failure for masonry façades for vibration speeds higher than these threshold values.<br/><br/>Many factors influence the probability of failure for masonry structures, like soil properties, masonry properties, initial damage, initial loads or the type and frequency of structural vibrations. Also, it is important to know what should be considered damage. All these factors are implemented in this procedure. The proposed procedure is set up using two different models: a structural model, where the loads and façade dimensions and properties are implemented, and a probabilistic model, where the structural results are implemented, as well as stochastic parameters for some properties. This model leads to a probability of failure.<br/><br/>For the structural model, the software package SCIA Engineer has been used in this project. The structural model ensures that after drafting the façade, implementing the masonry properties, and applying the initial loads and the vibration speed and frequency, the maximum tensile stress for this frequency can be calculated. The tensile stress is the property that will determine if the structure fails, since the tensile stress of masonry is generally low. This tensile stress should then be implemented in the probabilistic model, which also takes the dispersion of the tensile strength and Young’s Modulus into account. A Monte Carlo simulation is performed, which results in the probability of failure of the specific façade for a specific vibration speed and frequency.<br/><br/>This thesis’ main focus was the linear-elastic procedure, where no soil-structure interaction was involved. Since masonry does not behave linearly after the first cracks initiate, some assumptions have been made to enable the calculation to be executed in a linear-elastic way, e.g. that failure occurs if the tensile strength is exceeded over a length of 210 mm. Also, in reality, soil-structure interaction will occur and will produce different structural results and following this, different probabilities of failure. Therefore, this study is able to provide a satisfactory statement regarding the probability of failure for masonry structures, but is not able to substantiate this statement completely.<br/><br/>In this thesis, the proposed procedure has also been executed on three different masonry facades in the city of Delft. The procedure is described extensively using these facades to provide a clear example how the reader can implement this procedure in their own projects. Also, because of the execution of this procedure on these façades, comparisons could be made, so the difference in probabilities of failure between façades, but also between different kinds of soil and vibration frequencies could be investigated.<br/><br/>The results show that the proposed procedure gives an adequate approximation for the probability of failure for masonry structures loaded by construction induced vibrations. Also, the results have been compared to a nonlinear case. This comparison shows that the assumptions that had to be made to approach this problem in a linear-elastic way were sometimes too conservative, but some assumptions were also a little too bold. Also, it is demonstrated that soil-masonry stresses have quite some influence on the structural results and therefore on the probability of failure, but more research regarding this topic is necessary to form a substantiated statement regarding the stresses at the soil-masonry interface.<br/><br/>Summarized, for this thesis, an assessment has been computed to determine the probabilities of failure for masonry structures using linear-elastic calculations. By following this procedure, one will be able to gather a good approximation of the probability of failure. However more research has to be conducted to ensure the soundness of this procedure.","Masonry; Probability of failure; Vibrations","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering | Structural Mechanics","",""

These contacts enable the passivation of the silicon surface as well as a high carrier selectivity. So far excellent results have been demonstrated with the use of poly-Si in stack with SiO2. In this work, we optimize an alternative stack, based on carbon alloyed poly-Si (poly-SiCx). Alloying with carbon provides wet-chemical stability, the material becomes resilient to blistering and the bandgap can be tuned depending on the carbon content. This optimized poly-SiCx is implemented as the rear contact of a solar cell. We investigate doped poly-Si alloyed layers with different carbon contents. Structure characterization reveals that carbon incorporation hinders the crystallization of the material. In addition, alloying with carbon decreases the absorption coefficient of the material in the as-deposited state (amorphous), but following the thermal treatment higher carbon contents lead to a higher absorption coefficient. Finally, we observe that higher carbon alloying reduces the conductivity of the poly-SiCx by several orders of magnitude, but the optimized material demonstrates a dark conductivity of 0.006 S/cm, which is 3 orders of magnitude higher than the amorphous one. We optimize the passivation quality of (p)poly-SiCx in symmetrical samples by inserting an (i)a-Si interlayer between the SiO2 and the doped layer using different deposition methods (PECVD/LPCVD). With the optimization of the gas flow ratio, high-temperature annealing and hydrogenation, we obtain a high passivation quality (iVoc of 709 mV and Jo of 10.5 fA/cm2) for the optimum LPCVD deposited interlayer, while the optimum PECVD deposited interlayer demonstrates a signi cantly lower passivation quality (iVoc of 684 mV and Jo of 34.7 fA/cm2). The hydrogenation is performed with the deposition of a SiNx capping layer followed by Forming Gas Annealing at 400°C for 30 minutes. The potential of the (p)poly-SiCx passivating contact is investigated by the application on the rear side of a solar cell. We fabricate initially double-side polished cells with the champion cell achieving an active area efficiency (ηact ) of 15.68%, featuring a Voc of 692 mV, FF of 74.7% and EQE current (Jsc,EQE) of 30.35 mA/cm2. Finally, we also investigate the potential on front side textured cells, obtaining the champion cell with an ηact of 16.80%, maintaining the FF at 74.7%, a lower Voc of 677 mV and a Jsc,EQE at 33.22 mA/cm2 . For all cells the parasitic absorption at the front (n)poly-SiCx contact remains high, due to the non-optimized thickness of the aforementioned contact.","solar cell; poly-silicon carbide; poly-SiC; passivating contact; Carrier selective passivating contacts","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-06-11","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

Sediment stored underwater due to storms is transported onshore by the migration of subtidal and intertidal bars under mild wave conditions. The intertidal zone is an im-portant interface, connecting the marine and aeolian zone and facilitating the transition of hydro-dynamic to aeolian sediment transport. The aim of this study is to investigate the cross-shore mor-phodynamics of intertidal sandbars. The dominant cross-shore sediment transport processes can mainly be divided into surf zone and swash zone processes. The surf zone processes are primarily determined by the balance of wave nonlinearities, undertow and infra-gravity waves. In the swash zone, the cross-shore sediment transport is determined by the balance between the turbulent uprush and the gravity induced backwash. A recent terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) measuring campaign conducted at Kijkduin, the Nether-lands, provided new insight in the intertidal bar behavior. The results of one cross section are ana-lyzed. In a period of 6 weeks, two distinctive intertidal bars formed, grew and migrated onshore during mild wave conditions and eventually eroded again during a storm. Within 5 days, the upper intertidal bar migrated onshore over a distance of 25m and grew with a height of 0.3m, attributed to swash zone processes. Onshore sediment transport fluxes reached values of nearly 2 m3 per meter width in one tidal cycle.<br/>The findings are compared with two XBeach models (surf beat model and hydrostatic swash model) which are used to reproduce the observed morphological behavior of the upper intertidal bar. Both models partly reproduce the onshore migration but show deviating results regarding the final growth of the intertidal bar. In contrast to the surf beat model, the morphological changes in the hydrostatic swash model are primarily induced by swash zone processes, which is comparable to the processes in the TLS measurements. Finally, a conceptual model is developed in which four intertidal bar regimes are classified based on the tidal water level. The distinction determines the dominant cross-shore processes for the for-mation, migration, growth and destruction of intertidal bars. The model shows that the swash zone processes are dominant for the onshore migration and growth of intertidal bars in the overwash regime, while the surf zone processes are dominant in the submersion regime. The findings presented in this study provide a better understanding of the intertidal bar behavior.

And 2) How should the methodology for revision of the material flow be set up? <br/>The current material flow of the bicycles leaves room for improvement. The bicycle is not designed from a lifecycle perspective, but it is optimised to increase the maintenance efficiency and prolong its lifetime. <br/>Reasons for Swapfiets to revise the material flow are diverse. The current material flow is unsustainable and can directly harm the brand value, on which Swapfiets builds strongly. Furthermore, it is economical unbeneficial, since the depreciated value of the frames are turned into direct costs when thrown away. Closing the material loop can add economic and brand value to the PSS. <br/>However, there is no methodology in place at Swapfiets to revise the material flow of the bicycles. The current way of working is not long term focused. Comparing Swapfiets’ PSS to other PSSs described in literature, shows that a closed material loop is a common success factor for PSSs. A PSS with a closed material loop is referred to as a sustainable product service system (SPSS). Optimising the lifecycle to create an economic benefit is one of the main drivers to develop an SPSS. <br/>No methodology is yet developed to transform a PSS into an SPSS. However, barriers to overcome and success factors to develop an SPSS are extensively described in literature. To create a successful SPSS, the project vision should be flexible, the network should be reconfigured and managed strategically. A methodology that has the capabilities to fulfil these requirements is co-creation. Co-creation is the joint development of concepts by the firm, its network and other external participants. <br/>For co-creation, the network is reconfigured by inviting a mixed set of participants. However, little research is done to link different sets of participants to the quality of the outcome. This research is exploring that gap, by organising two co-creation sessions with two sets of participants. The first set of participants are operating in the same sector as Swapfiets: inter-sector actors. The second set of participants are actors who have similar PSSs, but in different sectors: cross-sector actors. The two sets of participants are posed with the same question: how to keep the bicycle’s frame longer in the loop?<br/>The results of the research are separated in two categories: outcome and process. The direct outcomes of the sessions are three concepts for each session. Inter-sector co-creation shows a more technical focus and concepts can be implemented in the mid- or long-term. Cross-sector co-creation shows a customer centric focus and the concepts can be implemented in short-term.<br/>Both sessions show how interactions between all actors open windows for collaborations. Inter-sector actors are more interested in possible business partnerships, while cross-sector actors are eager to create in-kind collaborations.<br/>The co-creation process causes actors to find common ground. Inter-sector actors are more precautious in sharing information or experience, since they considered Swapfiets as a potential competitor. This was not the case for cross-sector actors, who share very specific information about their own companies. <br","PSS; SPSS; Material Flow; Co-creation; Actor selection; Closed loop","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

Next to affecting bed levels directly, the heavy modification of the river-estuary has induced significant changes in the hydrodynamic and morphodynamic behaviour of the Loire. As a result, the Loire river is experiencing an ongoing bed degradation. In the estuary, the interventions have led to an amplification of the tidal amplitude, a shift of the tidal and salt intrusion limit in upstream direction and a larger tidal asymmetry. According to Winterwerp and Wang (2013), this tidal deformation leads to an increased import of fine sediment in the estuary and a reduced hydraulic drag. This in turn enhances tidal deformation further. Due to this positive feedback mechanism the Loire estuary has evolved into a hyper-turbid state, associated with large suspended sediment concentrations and the formation of fluid mud.<br/><br/>The behaviour of the river-estuary on large temporal and spatial scales and its response to historical and possible future interventions is not yet sufficiently understood. Therefore, an idealized, computationally efficient, three-dimensional morphodynamic model of the river-estuary is developed with the FLOW module of the Delft3D software suite, in which the main processes influencing the morphology of the Loire river-estuary are included.<br/><br/>The current estuarine geometry, lacking the presence of large intertidal areas, induces a flood-dominant tidal signal. In the mouth of the estuary, the baroclinic pressure gradient introduces a mean landward-directed velocity near the bed and amplifies the mean seaward-directed velocity near the surface. This gravitational circulation causes the formation of an Estuarine Turbidity Maximum at the tip of the salt wedge, which is strengthened further by the flood-dominance of the tide. Model results confirm the feedback mechanism between tidal deformation, the import of fine sediment and the effective hydraulic drag as described above. However, next to tidal deformation, strengthening of the gravitational circulation also plays a large role in this mechanism for the Loire.<br/><br/>To mitigate bed degradation, several measures are simulated that decrease the transport capacity of the flow, increase the sediment supply or do both. Over the first 10 years, sediment nourishments are the most effective according to the model. However, after 100 years of simulation the removal of all groynes present within the domain leads to the most sedimentation relative to the reference scenario. To decrease the import of mud into the estuary, two measures have been investigated. Increasing bed levels in the main channel of the estuary mainly leads to a decrease of the tidal range, whereas restoring tidal flats turns the tide from flood- into ebb-dominant. In both cases, a decrease of the salt intrusion length and a significant weakening of the gravitational circulation occurs, leading to a tidally averaged export of fine sediment and very low mud concentrations.<br","Loire river-estuary; Idealized modelling; Delft3D; Morphodynamics; Bed degradation; Hyper-turbidity; Estuarine turbidity maximum","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","","47.294075, -2.090367"

The phenomena has been accurately described by differential equations, closed form solutions are available for specific cases and the solution for any load and any boundary condition can be obtained by finite element analysis. Timber and steel design standards provide a procedure based on equivalent moment factors. With this procedure, beams can be designed straightforwardly. However, modern designers continue to push the envelope and more irregular load patterns are found, on which the design standards do not provide solutions. Consequently, designers are forced to determine the equivalent moment factors based on case-specific literature and/or conservative assumptions. Unfortunately, this makes many challenging modern designs uneconomical. Furthermore, significant inconsistencies between the different design procedures are found. For that purpose, this paper proposes a solution in the form of a general formulation to determine equivalent moment factors for any loading on a single-span beam for both free and restrained lateral bending and/or warping at the supports, for both I-sections and rectangular slender sections loaded in the shear center. It is shown that the obtained moment factors are accurate and in good agreement with design standards and literature, and a wide range of irregular load patterns is considered.","Elastic laterial torsional buckling; moment equivalent factor; moment gradient factor; steel beams; timber beams; analytic energy approach","en","student report","","","","","","","","2020-06-01","","","","","",""

AM provides more freedom in design geometry combined with the possibility to produce (complex) products in low quantities. As a result, the need arises for printed parts with consistent mechanical properties that rival those of conventionally produced parts. Currently, the layer-by-layer process used by AM introduces weaknesses at the interlayer (weld) bonds. Polymer science suggests that raising weld bonds to temperatures above the glass transition temperature (Tg) can improve their mechanical properties up to bulk strength. This research aims to verify if fused ﬁlament fabrication (FFF) printing at elevated print room temperatures (Tenv) raises interlayer temperatures above Tg and as a result enhances mechanical properties. In order to measure the increase in interlayer properties double cantilevered beam (DCB) testing is used. Additionally, tensile testing is used to evaluate the eﬀect of elevating Tenv on general mechanical properties. DCB and tensile testing of samples printed at elevated Tenv values has shown an increase of 109 % in interlayer energy release rate (G1c), up to 50 % in ultimate tensile strength and 106 % in tensile toughness. This has been determined by comparing samples printed at elevated Tenv with samples printed at room temperature (23 ◦C). To further understand the mechanisms behind the enhanced properties, the temperature history during printing has been determined. This has been done by running simulations and using IR imaging. The temperature history of printed parts has been related to data obtained from mechanical testing. This showed that mechanical properties increased for samples in which the interlayer bonds resided above Tg for prolonged periods of time. In addition, optical microscopy and micro CT has been used to monitor the meso-structure of printed samples. This showed that voids in the sample caused by printing defects contributed to an increased spread in measured values. Mechanical properties corrected for eﬀective surface areas showed a roughly 10 % increase for average values. While signiﬁcant this is not in the same order of magnitude as the increase in mechanical values reported for printing at higher Tenv values. Combining these results it has been found that elevating Tenv does not signiﬁcantly aﬀect the meso-structure, but it does cause bonds to spend an increased amount of time above Tg. Therefore, it has been concluded that the enhanced mechanical properties are caused by weld bond healing due to the part residing above Tg.","AM; FFF; Thermoplastic polymer; Polymer welding; DCB test; PETG; Tensile tests; Micro CT; Glass transition temperature; Thermal analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therapeutic rituals are acknowledged as the core of contextual healing effects. To design for contextual healing in clinical practice, more insight is needed in the key ingredients of a ‘ successful’ therapeutic ritual and in their working towards healing. Research was executed in a hand therapeutic context. Because data from patient’s questionnaires by the Xpert Clinic indicates that expectancies of conservative treatments are lower than that of surgical treatments, the question arose how to increase this treatment outcome expectancies by integrating contextual healing mechanisms in a patient’s journey for hand and wrist physiotherapeutic treatment? Through a literature study, placebo mechanisms were identified. These mechanisms lead to directly increased expectancies to heal, but they also affect each other. Impact and mechanisms of the placebo effect are context-, illness- and patient-dependent. However, patient-practitioner interaction is considered as the most important factor in contextual healing. To understand the presence of placebo mechanisms in the hand therapeutic context, observations were made during different phases of the patient journey. Also, the presence of mechanisms was discussed with medical professionals, and patients were interviewed about their belief in treatment outcomes. Several mechanisms were already used by doctors and therapists, although not always in a conscious way. For example, patients are involved in diagnosis and treatment decisions. However, it was seen that patients’ belief in a treatment was influenced by the overall appearance of the therapist they were facing. Finally, an important patients’ motivator to belief in their treatment is the experience of improvement in daily life activities. Using the insights on the presence of placebo mechanisms in the context of hand therapeutic treatments, several design concepts were made to foster placebo mechanisms. Among them were concepts that made results more experienceable, a concept that focussed on managing patient’s expectations, a concept that stressed the hand-touching moment within a therapy session as an important moment of the therapeutic ritual and a concept that created better understanding to patients about their disease and reasoning for their exercises. The concept that was chosen to continue with was aimed at increasing the professional appearance and behaviour of therapists, in order to increase patients’ belief in positive treatment outcomes. A final design was made that fosters placebo mechanisms by increasing the way patients experience the therapist as a skilled medical professional. The specialised measuring tool organiser for hand therapists, presents the measurement tools in an open, professional way to the patient. The design motivates the therapist to measure with a professional and structured attitude. The presentation of the tools lifts them towards the level of medical equipment. Being involved in a session with a skilled professional, the placebo effect on patients is increased. By use of a prototype, the organiser was tested in actual therapeutic practice. Results showed more structured therapists’ behaviour and showed patients’ fascination for and attraction towards the design, indicating that the professional appearance and behaviour of the hand therapist and the session room is increased. Although direct involvement of patients could be improved, and a more suitable place for the design in the room has to be found, the design is assessed as useful by therapists. When patients experience the therapist, through the use of the design, as a more skilled professional, the design might contribute to contextual healing.","Contextual healing; Placebo effect; Placebo mechanisms; Hand therapy; Physiotherapy; Conservative treatment; Patients' treatment outcome expectancies","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction | Medisign","",""

Offshore wind turbines are becoming of special interest and more demanding with continuously increased diameters. However, their design poses great challenges, since the installation and fabrication tolerances in combination with high cyclic loading play an important role on the fatigue assessment of the wind turbine structure.One part of specific interest for the fatigue assessment of a wind turbine is the way that the transition piece is connected to monopile. Since now, grouted and bolted connections are commonly used, but they have many drawbacks. These disadvantages regarding their performance inspired by C1 Connections BV to invent a new type of connection to connect large diameter tubulars, the C1 Wedge Connection. This innovation allows to increase the fatigue life of the wind turbine structures and decrease simultaneously their construction and installation cost. The work that will be presented here deals with the fatigue assessment of the C1 Wedge Connection, and how the presence of imperfections may affect the fatigue life of it.After analysis of the load path and the innovative preload mechanism, a reference wind turbine has been selected and the 3D CAD software of Solid Edge is used to design all the components of the wedge connection and assemble them to their final position. The stiffness of the main components of the wedge connection (TP-flange, TP-shell and MP) is calculated analytically, based on the method proposed by Seidel and adapted for the C1 Wedge Connection. An analytical model using Timoshenko beam theory has been developed for TP-flange stiffness calculation. This model and all analytical calculations were verified against FEM results built on ANSYS Workbench and mechanical for that purpose.Once the components’ stiffnesses have been calculated based on analytical formulas, an approximation of the maximum closeable gap is plotted for different gap sizes for this specific geometry of the connection and friction coefficient μ=0.15 which was proved being conservative after calibration using results from tests taken place at TU Delft lab.Secondly different scenarios have been investigated using FE models regarding the position of the gap among the different components of the connection. From this analysis, in terms of magnitude of the remaining gap and the reaction force at the interface of both flanges, was concluded that the worst scenario is the presence of imperfection only at MP side.This worst scenario (only imperfect MP flange) is selected and examined for compression to tension under ULS overturning moment. The fatigue damage of the imperfect structure is calculated and compared with a perfect one. For the purpose of this thesis, preloading has been applied by once at all connections of the ring. Peak stresses are calculated and based on selected S-N curve from DNV-GL codes and by making use of the Miner’s rule, the fatigue damage at the critical positions of both perfect and imperfect connection is calculated. For the same imperfect structure, the fatigue damage is calculated again based on nominal stresses measured underneath each hole of imperfect MP segment. In that case the specific for the C1 Wedge Connection S-N curve is used, based on fatigue single segment test results taken place at TU Delft lab, in 2018.From this research, it is concluded that based on peak stress method the selected imperfect structure is not able to withstand the fatigue damage loads. On the other hand, the same cannot be stated using nominal stress method which is more realistic based on test results and not sensitive to mesh details. In that case the fatigue damage for every hole is &lt;&lt;1.","waviness; imperfections; transition piece; Wedge connection; monopile; wind turbine; ring flange","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-06-03","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering","",""

A method to incorporate vibration dampers in FBS is the practice of Full Decoupling but this can be a time consuming and cumbersome exercise so the alternative method of Inverse Substructuring was developed. This approach is quicker and simpler but suffers from shortcomings as underestimating stiffness and neglecting some DoF relations. In this thesis an improvement on this technique is proposed by making use of the geometrical shape of the vibration isolator. This results in better prediction of the dynamics of the vibration isolator in most directions however the dynamicist should make a decision if this simpler method of Improved Inverse Substructuring is more suitable for the application over Full Decoupling.","Experimental Dynamic Substructuring; Inverse Substructuring; Vibration Absorber","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Vehicle Engineering","",""

The current protection consists of mercenaries which are flown in by helicopter to protect merchant ships in threat areas. This is not only expensive, sometimes innocent fishermen are seen for pirates, in some cases with a lethal ending for the fishermen. An alternative could be in the form of an autonomous unmanned vessel, which intercepts potential pirates in a non-lethal manner. This thesis presents the design of a situational awareness system of such a vessel. The autonomous interception vessel utilizes radar and vision systems to obtain information about the environment. The camera detection algorithm makes use of a modified version of boolean map saliency to segment the target from the background. The radar and camera detections are passed to a global nearest neighbor data association algorithm. The states of the interception vessel are also estimated using sensor data using an EKF. This estimation is used to compensate for the self movement of the interception vessel in the estimation of the states of the target or targets. The target states are are tracked by an interacting multiple model framework, using extended Kalman filters. The algorithm is tested on scenario-specific simulations, which include a visual feed and sensor data. The simulated scenarios are case studies with staged pursuits of the interception vessel and its targets. In the evaluation, multiple algorithms and design parameters are tested and compared. Next to the design of the algorithm, some modifications and improvements to the existing literature are proposed. A modification to the boolean map saliency algorithm is made to make it less sensitive to target disappearance from the image frame. Also, a motion model is proposed, based on ship dynamics. It is shown that for the generated data set, this model obtained better performance in estimating the velocity and heading of the target. Finally, the measurements are obtained in polar coordinates, while the motion models are defined in Cartesian coordinates. The coordinate change is done using the converted measurement Kalman filter. To convert the single bearing obtained by the camera, the predicted range is used. In order to deal with the increasing uncertainty in the range prediction, a time dependency in the range variance is proposed.","Situational Awareness; USV; Automated ship","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

Typically, this is done by manipulating the interest rate. This process is executed by the central bank of a country or union. Specifically, the policy makers of a central bank make policy decisions manually, based on advise and experience. The process, of manipulating a variable to get the desired outcome, is a technology where system and control engineers are specialized in. Mostly, they focus on dynamical technological processes. Nevertheless, a new field in system and control theory pledges to widen this variety. Specifically, towards applying these system and control theories to economic processes: Economic engineering. Up to now, very little attention is paid to the possibility of applying system and control theory to monetary policy. This work combines the current model of the European Central Bank (ECB), used to analyze monetary policy in the Eurozone, and the economic-engineering analog that can be used to model economics as if it were a mechanical system. It builds on these two theories by presenting monetary policy as a control problem. Firstly, the analog is extended in order to express money and interest in mechanical terms. With this extension, a first-principles model of the economy is developed. The results of the ECB’s model are analyzed and an alternative is offered by the application of open loop transfer function characteristics. A PID controller is designed and the design conditions are interpreted as policy decisions. Finally, the effects of these design conditions are explained. The model, developed in this thesis, adds to existing models because of its distinction between disturbances and the control input. This contrasts the existing models because they approach both disturbances and control input similar - i.e. so called shocks. The first-principles modeling approach offers the first model that presents the underlying dynamics of the system. These dynamics can now be analyzed in the form of the effects of disturbances. The model offers the possibility to better understand monetary policy. Policymakers can now simulate possible policy actions and the effects on different economic variables, such as wages, GDP and investment.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

Within this thesis, the context of those challenges has been explored. The following four domains were analyzed; VGM, teens, interactive narratives and transformative experience design. The insights within these domains led to the following research question: “How to design for transformative teen experiences at VGM while also designing a fitting interactive narrative and suggestions for an MMT?” Two existing models were combined to ensure a holistic reference when designing for transformative experiences. The first one, the Contextual Model of Learning (Falk &amp; Dierking, 2012) and the experiential journey (Bär &amp; Boschouwers, 2019). Based on the vision and requirements, six design iterations were performed: two co-creation sessions, three individual creative sessions and VGM expert meetings. The iterations resulted in varying loose ideas, concept proposals, specific narrative content regarding Van Gogh and design implications for an MMT at VGM. Results that, all together, enabled the creation of the final proposed concept, Vincent &amp; I. The concept describes four perspectives regarding the transformative teen experience at VGM. First, the experiential journey is presented in which not only the museum visit but also the pre- and post-visit stages (in class) are considered. Secondly, six different stages within the museum are described: introducing, exploring, selecting, discovering, recharging and wrapping-up. Within this museum visit, an interactive narrative structure was created. This structure consists of two different narrative directions, four themes (determining the narrative content), 6 “must-see” plus 4 “your choice” paintings and four narrative elements: information, open questions, multiple choice questions and activities. Finally, design suggestions for an MMT were made. These suggestions provide examples for the visual and auditory elements needed to communicate the interactive narratives. The concept was tested with 25 teens at VGM resulting in insights indicating initial transformative experiences. This thesis is concluded with a proposed initial design approach for future projects that consider designing for transformative museum experiences.","Transformative Experience Design; Interactive narratives; Teenagers; Van Gogh Museum; Education","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

This puts more effort on the structural design and especially for superyacht longitudinal stiffness is important, since the luxurious interior and delicate systems installed in a superyachts are not allowed to cause creaking noises or be damaged. A method is developed that can provide global and local deformations in operational sea conditions to use for risk assessment and provide guidance on clearances or connections that should be used for interior installment. Wave-induced loads are calculated with a linear response analysis in combination with a regular equivalent design wave. The yacht hull is modelled as a 1D Timoshenko beam including shear deformations and torsion for which good agreement is found with a detailed 3D FE model with shear deformations accounting for 20% to the vertical displacement. <br/><br","Superyachts; Longitudinal stiffness; wave-induced loads; strip method; linear response analysis; Timoshenko beam theory; Shear deformations; Comfort; risk assessment; equivalent design waves; Finite Element Method; 1D beam elements; FEA; FEM; Finite Element Analysis; Structural analysis; Structural Modelling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

The current industry standard is to separate these aircraft with a minimum distance, called Distance-Based Separation or DBS. European regulation requires all European airports to implement separation based on time (Time-Based Separation or TBS) before 2024. Due to this implementation, effectively changing the APP ATC task from a geometrical to a time-based problem, and because of further complications such as the European re-categorisation of aircraft types, experts fear that the theoretical gains attainable by using TBS will not be fully realised. In this research, a display tool concept to aid APP ATCos in realising the full potential of TBS, the Ideal Turn-In Point (ITIP) display is designed and evaluated with respect to the current state of the art. The ITIP display assists controllers in selecting optimal approach strategies starting from the moment aircraft enter the Terminal Control Area. The display aims to assist the operator by showing the possibilities and restrictions in the system rather than giving (restricting) advisories. In an initial proof-of-concept experiment, comparing the ITIP display to the current industry state of the art display, promising results were found; the ITIP display was shown to maintain safety and increase efficiency, whilst maintaining controller workload. The current industry state of the art display is a tool designed by the National Air Traffic Services, currently operational at London Heathrow Airport.","Time-Based Separation; Air Traffic Control; Display Tool; Approach","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-06-01","","","","Aerospace Engineering | Control & Simulation","",""

To treat these bone defects, standard hemispherical acetabular implants offer in most cases the solution. However, when these defects are large, a custom triflange acetabular implant is needed. Although this type of implant performs well in general, it also has some drawbacks. These include higher costs and a longer design- and development cycle, since every implant is custom-made to the patient. In addition, it is expected that the triflange implant causes more stress-shielding (loss in bone-mineral-density (BMD) due to insufficient loads) than the standard implant. However, the evidence for this last statement is quite weak, since studies on both cups use different parameters,materials and environments. Objective: The objective of this study is to determine if the custom triflange cup causes indeed more stress-shielding than the standard hemispherical cup. Furthermore, the goal is to find a solution for this and the other above-mentioned drawbacks of the custom triflange cup. Therefore, the goal is to study the potential of a deformable acetabular cup, which in theory should solve these issues of the triflange cup. Methods: First a statistical shape model (SSM) of the human pelvis was developed to find patterns in defects of the pelvis, which could eliminate the need for customization. Next, a Finite Element (FE) Model with a bone-remodelling algorithm was developed to determine the difference in stress-shielding between the standard and the triflange cup. Furthermore, a FE model of a deformable implant is developed which is pressed into multiple defected pelvises. Finally, a machine-algoirthm is trained to predict the optimal deformable cup parameters, based on the type of defects. Results: Several modes of deformation were found with the SSM, which were utilised in creating damaged pelvises for the Finite Element Model. Furthermore, it was found that the custom triflange cup decreases the BMD of the pelvis by 28.6% compared to pelvis without cup. With a deformable implant, this decrease can be reduced to 7.1%, which is in the similair range as the standard hemispherical cup. Finally, it was found that the machine-learning algorithm can successfully predict the optimal cup parameters, based on the type and size of defects.","stress-shielding; Custom triflange cup; finite element analysis; Statistical Shape Model; Pelvis; bone adaptation; acetabulum; Implant; UMAT; Fortran; Strain; Stress; deformable","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-12-30","","","","Mechanical Engineering","Prosperos",""

These themes are adapted and used to analyse the Dutch waterscapes of the Wadden Sea and the island of Schiermonnikoog. The scenario method is then used to project the outcome of this analysis into a future where West Frisian island of Schiermonnikoog is left to nature and risks slowly disappears into the currents of the North Sea. The design intervention narrates a new myth: ‘guarding the water’ by using the typology of a fort. The scenario has four chapters and each of them narrates a different time period of the island’s future. Thus the project derives its name from the heraldic motto of Zeeland: ‘Luctor et Emergo' - ‘I struggle and Emerge’.<br","North Sea; Wadden Sea; Moving Islands; Island Schiermonnikoog","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The post-disaster Reconstruction Plan (2011-2018) of this town focused on rebuilding the previously existing town with large-scale engineered interventions, resulting in a fragmented set of spatial interventions which solve problems in a single faceted way. The management of a post-tsunami reconstruction process should represent a resilient design for the future. This paper demonstrates that a modified land use design, developed and achieved through an interdisciplinary approach, represents a holistic solution to the drawbacks of the reconstruction plan. Through an iterative framework, site-specific strategies are developed at the urban and the building scale that combine safety and livability by finding synergies among disciplinary fields in an integrated manner. The result of this paper is a quantified evaluation of the reduction in flood risk achieved with a new design, making spatially evident the areas in which a refinement is required to mitigate flood damage.<br/>Subject: tsunami; interdisciplinary; resilience; spatial planning; strategy<br","tsunami; interdisciplinary; resilience; spatial planning; strategy","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","Master project report | MP299","39.36, 141.90"
