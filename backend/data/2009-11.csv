(mentor); Hagen, A.A. (mentor); Mulder, K.F. (mentor); Enserink, B. (mentor)","2009","Climate change is characterised by a global increase in temperature and by the increase in the number of extreme weather events like; heatwaves, extreme droughts, and heavy rainfall. Ur-banisation can be seen as a climate problem, for example because of the lack of water storage in cities during times of drought and the lack of drainage during periods of heavy rainfall. Urban heat also can become a problem of urbanisation. During heatwaves the problem will occur there it may increase the risk of heat stress. The urban heat island effect therefore can be described as one of the causes of heat stress. Den Haag, like many other cities, is confronted with the phenomenon urban heat. This phenomenon is not new in the Netherlands, because Conrads already proved the presents of an urban heat island in Utrecht during his research in the early 1970’s. The extreme manifes-tation of city heat is the so-called urban heat island effect, which can be described as the ef-fect of the city accumulating heat and consequently being warmer than its surrounding. The difference in temperature between the city and rural areas especially during the night can be up to 7ºC. The effect and its intensity are caused by the characteristics of a city. Solar energy is stored in for example pavement or buildings while vegetation, that has the ability to sub-tract heat from its environment by its natural process of evaporation, is often lacking. This in combination with the reduced airflow in urban areas makes the city prone to higher tempera-tures. The higher temperatures in the city are causing trouble especially during heatwaves and other warm periods of the year. Since these events are more likely to appear due to climate change the urge for action increases. Urban heat directly affects the health of people, the con-sumption of electricity, the people’s level of comfort, the air quality, and even the mood of people. There are different adaptation strategies available for the urban heat problem. These strategies have to be found in reducing the solar exposure, reducing the absorption of solar energy, and increasing the natural cooling capacity. The level at which these actions can be taken differs; the actions can be taken at building, at neighbourhood, and at city level. Meas-ures at building level mainly influence the indoor climate of the building and not directly the outdoor climate, while actions at neighbourhood and city level mainly influence the outdoor climate. The measures at building level considered in this thesis are green roofs and cool roofs. At neighbourhood or city level the options are applying cool pavement, add more trees and vegetation, apply water in different forms, and changing the whole city structure so air-flow and shading are increased. Den Haag is a historical town resulting in areas with different characteristics, as a conse-quence different measures might be appropriate to use on different locations in the city. The layer which was build before 1870 (the city centre) can be characterised as densely build and populated. Also therefore this layer is expected to have a severe urban heat problem. The sec-ond layer that originates between 1870 and 1920 is characterised by the densely build neighbourhoods with stony appearances. This part of the city is also expected to suffer from urban heat, because of the number of people living here, and the physical character of the neighbourhoods. Some of these neighbourhoods are selected by the national government as being Krachtwijken, which means that there are opportunities to change the situation in these neighbourhoods. The neighbourhoods build after 1920 in general can be described as becom-ing increasingly greener and better adapted in terms of urban heat. This does not mean that there are no problems foreseen in these neighbourhoods, but that the problems are less urgent compared to the other layers. In finding the appropriate strategy for the different areas of Den Haag different experts are consulted. In a qualitative way they scored the available adaptation strategies in the three dif-ferent city areas on six criteria. These criteria are investment, applicability, expected effect, additional effect, durability/maintenance, and acceptability. The criteria investment, expected effect, and acceptability are considered to be more important compared to the other criteria and therefore received a higher weight in the calculation. This calculation was done with the ELECTRE I method. For the layer build before 1870 the option to change the city structure was not taken in the calculation because it was considered to be impossible to change this. For this layer the strategies cool pavement, trees and vegetation, and cool roofs seem to be the most favourable adaptation options. For the layer build between 1870 and 1920 and for the layers build after 1920 cool pavement and trees and vegetation seem to be the most favour-able adaptation options. The first step Den Haag needs to take is to create a sense of urgency for urban heat. If this is done urban heat can become a policy theme for the municipality in the kadernota duurzaamheid. After that action can be taken in different steps from motivating to initiating.","urban heat island; Den Haag; climate change","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Technology, Policy and Management","Values and Technology","","","",""

(mentor); Hamidoui, S. (mentor)","2009","Hybrid memories are one of the emerging memory technologies for future data storage. These memories are structured by integrating non-CMOS nanodevices (e.g., carbon nanotubes, single electron junction, organic molecules) with CMOS devices. Non-CMOS nanodevices build up crossbar-based memory cells, whereas CMOS devices form peripheral circuits. CMOS/Molecular (CMOL) memory is an example of hybrid memories. In spite of providing a huge data capacity and low power consumption, such memories suffer from high degree of cluster faults impacting their reliability. This thesis investigates the use of error correction codes (ECCs) to tolerate faults in hybrid memories. The ECCs considered in this work are Hamming, Reed Solomon (RS), and Redundant Residue Number System (RRNS) codes. The error correction capability and the cost incurred (in terms of area and time overhead of encoder and decoder) for each ECC and for different input data width are analyzed. The experimental results show that RS and RRNS codes are able to correct cluster faults, yet requires higher cost as compared to Hamming code, which can only correct single fault at lower cost. Moreover, the area cost of RS and RRNS encoder/decoder tend to increase linearly and exponentially, respectively, as the input data width becomes bigger. Meanwhile, the time overhead of RS remains steady and while that of increases linearly, as the input data width increase. Overall, RS is the best ECC to tolerate cluster faults in hybrid memories.","ECC","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Computer Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Gaydadjiev, G. (mentor); Goossens, K. (mentor)","2009","Network-on-Chip (NoC) is established as the most scalable and efficient solution for the on-chip communication challenges in the multi-core era, since it guarantees scalable high-speed communication with minimal wiring overhead and physical routing issues. However, efficiency of the NoC depends on its design decisions, which must be made considering the performance requirements and the cost budgets, specific to the target application. In the NoC design ?ow, merely verifying and validating the design for its adherence to the application’s average communication requirements may be insufficient, when the need is to get the best performance within tight power and area budgets. This calls for NoC design validation and optimization under real-time congestions and contentions imposed by the target application. However, application availability issues (due to Intellectual Property restrictions), force us to look at alternative solutions to mimic the target application behavior and help us arrive at an efficient and optimal NoC design. This thesis is a step in the said direction, and proposes a performance analysis and validation tool (infrastructure) that employs synthetic and application trace-based traffic generators, to efficiently emulate the expected communication behavior of the target application. Novel methods are suggested to model and generate deterministic and random traffic patterns and to port reference application traces from and to different interconnect architectures (from buses to NoCs or vice versa). Further, these traffic generators are supported by efficient traffic management/scheduling schemes, that aid in effective analysis of the NoC’s performance. The proposed tool, also includes a statistics collection and performance validation module that checks the designed network for adherence to the performance requirements of the target application and explores trade-offs in performance and area/power costs to arrive at optimal architectural solutions. The significance of this tool, lies in its ability to comprehensively validate a given NoC design and suggest optimizations, in the light of the target applications expected run-time communication behavior.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2009-12-17","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Computer Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Juurlink, B. (mentor)","2009","Over the past few decades we have witnessed an exponential growth in the amount of data being used in virtually all domains. Extracting useful information from massive amounts of data is crucial and hence lot of data mining applications employing complex algorithms have been developed to aid in this task. As these data mining applications are gaining prominence it is very important to understand and address these application needs and translate them into design choices to have efficient and scalable processor architectures. This thesis is a step in this direction and involves investigating architecture alternatives that offer maximum scalability for data mining applications. For investigation we choose the Minebench benchmark suite from the data mining application domain and specifically worked with clustering and classiffication benchmarks. For evaluating the different architectural alternatives, we employ the SESC simulator. We identify the different architectural alternatives to be used for exploration by carrying out performance analysis experiments and identifying characteristics common to all the applications in this domain. Based on these observations, we select Asymmetric Chip Multi-Processor and Heterogeneous Multi-core Processor as candidate architectures and evaluate them by comparing them to a baseline Homogeneous Chip Multi-Processor. The evaluation shows that Asymmetric Chip Multi-Processor architectures provide better performance scalability than Homogeneous Chip Multi-Processor architectures for all the benchmarks considered. For Heterogeneous Multi-core Processor architectures we use two different scheduling strategies and observe large differences in performance results. Based on the results we conclude that Asymmetric Chip Multi-Processors consistently perform better than Heterogeneous Multi-core Processors.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2009-12-01","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Computer Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2009","The lack of adequate integration of geology and engineering into the design of engineering structures might have significant undesirable consequences. It appears that all too frequent the interface between the engineering structure and the natural environment, such as the dam foundation, presents a virtual interface between both disciplines of engineering and earth science, respectively . This work demonstrates how to integrate both disciplines into the final design of an engineering project, using the example of the Cumbidanovu dam in Sardinia. Foundation stability is one of the most important factors influencing the safety of a concrete dam and has been one of the key technical problems in the design of the studied dam project. The central research question to be answered, is if the latest final design of the Cumbidanovu dam complies with the standards for safety and if it is economically sound. To do so, the following four central hypotheses and theories are verified during this work. 1) A critical assessment of sliding safety should be based on a high quality data base. Therefore a further refinement of the already available data of the Cumbidanovu dam site is required. The data acquisition should involve both simple and sophisticated means; 2) The safety factors for the planned Cumbidanovu dam with its complex foundation conditions can be increased by improvements; 3) Cooling of the dam during and after construction is necessary in order to ensure dam stability, which might be affected by crack initiation and temperature discrepancies; 4) The global stability assessment of the Cumbidanovu dam with its encountered complex foundation rock mass requires the combination of structural and geotechnical considerations. Structural and geotechnical aspects should be properly integrated into the overall dam design in order to achieve dam safety with an optimized final design. The desk study at the beginning provides an insight into the actual site conditions as well as their future development. Adapted to this outcome, a field survey is planned and conducted in order to determine the variations with time and work progress. Special attention is paid to the possibilities and limitations of geomechanical classification system. It is shown how to obtain a sound geomechanical data basis by simple means and the corresponding data processing. Especially, for the studied dam site, which is characterized by complex foundation characteristics, a careful geomechanical evaluation is indicated in order to estimate the influence of the rock mass on the dam structure. The acquired data are subsequently integrated into the structural analyses, which are recommended to evaluate the dam stability. By using different geomechanical and structural approaches, it is possible to cross-verify the results. The procedure of this work, which integrates both structural and geotechnical aspects into design considerations finally allows to come up with a suggestion for a safe final dam design, which in the end emphasizes the potential of engineering geology.","civil engineering; geoscience; dam; site investigation; foundation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geo-Engineering Section","","","",""

It is a kind of technology enable the data transfer via body skin, and accordingly make it possible that the human intuitive touch in everyday life can be the trigger of itself. The whole project is consisted of Literature Study, User Research, Design, User Test and following Reflection and Future Development. During the literature study and the user study, the opportunities and challenge of this project were collected, and the research questions were answered. Afterwards, my design goal came out which was to improve the interpersonal connectedness between family members by ADA via relaxing touches. Keeping this goal in mind, and also with the support as well as suggestions from my coaches and ADA experts, a final concept called “AL” was generated collaborating with ambience lighting system and digital photo frame. In “AL” scenarios, firstly, users can trigger their favorite lighting ambience (previous set) accordingly when they sit in the sofa naturally. Secondly, users can experience other family members’ lighting scenes before getting their own lighting ambience, while seeing these family members’ pictures on a digital photo frame. Thirdly, family members can share their lighting ambiences by sitting together. Following, “AL” went through a user test which finally revealed that “AL” is a good design. People enjoyed the ADA way to control lighting ambience, and they gave the feedbacks that the momentary connectedness between them was improved. At the end, I made reflection on the whole project process, and showed up some inevitable effects which should be treat neutrally. Then a plan basing on “AL’ and specifically on ADA technology was created for their future development.","ADA; interpersonal connectedness; home context","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor); Bouwmans, I. (mentor); Pieterse, C.W. (mentor); Van den Hoogen-Bakker, W.L. (mentor); Weijenen, M.P.C. (mentor)","2009","Due to an asset swap in July 2008, Statkraft became a shareholder of two 20 MW biomass fuelled power plants in Emden (BKE) and Landesbergen (BKL), Germany. Both power plants are able to combust almost every solid biomass, but the main fuel is used-wood. Currently, the procurement of the fuel for both plants is outsourced to E.ON. Statkraft is not able to assess the current procurement activities on effectiveness due to a lack of knowledge of the used-wood market. This is a problem faced by all companies entering a new supply market: lack of knowledge. The research objective is to construct a pilot methodology and test this methodology in the case study of Statkraft. The methodology should generate and gather the required knowledge of a new supply market and procurement policies based on Transaction Cost Economic theory (TCE). From the research objective the following research question is derived: How can the most appropriate procurement policy be identified for companies that enter a new supply market? The methodology, which is set up to find an answer for this research question, is based on TCE. This theory addresses the question how to organize transactions, focusing on the internal and external exchange of transactions and transaction costs are recognized. However, this economic theory is not enough to cope with the multi-disciplinary, multi-level and multi-actor characters of a new supply market. Therefore, the methodology is to be augmented with several additional methods. The methodology is applied in the case study of Statkraft. The governance arrangements spot market, hybrid forms, and vertical integration are assessed by a inductive method based on TCE decision variables and a deductive method based on a Multi Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA). Regarding the TCE decision variable method, the most appropriate policy is selected based on the decision variables asset specificity, uncertainty, frequency, complexity, and contestability. These variables have been identified in the case and valued based on the additional methods. Regarding the MCDA method, the governance arrangements are ranked based on weighted criteria selected by Statkraft. Both approaches have selected the hybrid form network of firms as the most appropriate policy in this case. In order to implement this option it is recommended to select experienced suppliers with a positive CSR-check and good quality standards. Exchange of knowledge on each others business, working manners, attitudes, interest and wishes is recommended in order to have a fruitful cooperation. In the agreements with the suppliers it is worthwhile to negotiate financial quality incentives, i.e. let the supplier benefit from a higher quality delivery. A direct feedback-loop on the delivered quality can be a tool to achieve a better quality. The conclusion is that TCE theory accompanied by several other methods form a successful and accurate methodology to identify the most appropriate procurement policy for a company that enters a new supply market. Further application of the methodology is recommended in order to get experience in other cases and test its usefulness. Regarding the level of generalization of this conclusion, in the TCE decision variable method the decision variables have no weights. If this methodology is used in other cases it might be helpful to add this to the analysis to prevent uncertainty in the results. In the MCDA methods the weighing of the criteria is also crucial. If this methodology is used in other cases it should be done accurate.","Pilot methodology; Biomass; Used-wood market; MCDA Argus method; Transaction Cost Economics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Technology, Policy and Management","Infrastructure Systems & Services","","","",""

They are fully depending on their wheelchair and this is not an efficient transport product for distances further then 2 km. A handbike is the solution and give the users more freedom to become mobile in the city and at the same time maintain a proper health. For my graduation project I have developed an attachable handbike which can be used on fixed frame and foldable wheelchairs. The advantage is that the user can maintain his personal wheelchair and convert this to a tricycle with arm propulsion. The project is done at Van Raam BV in Varsseveld in cooperation with Welzorg sport. Van Raam makes people mobile with specialized and unique bicycles like tandems, wheelchair bikes, three wheel bikes and comfort bikes. Welzorg supply products for people with a function or mobility disability, such as walkers, wheelchairs, handbikes and mobility scooters. Welzorg has the knowledge about handbikes and contact with end users and Van Raam has the knowledge to manufacture the handbike. My graduation assignment is to design an attachable handbike which is technically, functional and aesthetically outstanding. It will need a universal mounting system that suit several types of wheelchairs and the size of the handbike need to be adjustable to several user dimensions. After analyzing the context of the handbike the design guidelines are listed and the starting points for the design phase are generated. In the conceptualization phase principle solutions are generated for the mounting system that can be divided in a docking station on the wheelchair and a coupling mechanism on the handbike. Several quick mock ups are made to test the working principle of some ideas. Several sketches are made for the design of the frame which will have a slim, solid and sportive look. From these ideas three concepts for the coupling mechanism and the appearance where chosen to elaborate further on. One of the concepts is chosen and detailed in the realization phase. The mounting mechanism had to fit on several wheelchairs tubes, be light and have enough strength. The result is a docking station that is easy to add on and of on the wheelchair from the side while the user maintain his position in the wheelchair. The coupling mechanism is working like an excavator which hooks and lock the docking station and lift the front wheels of the wheelchair from the ground. With a lever the coupling block is compressed with the docking station. The system is easy to release with a squeeze lever at the top of the handbike and the lever at the coupling mechanism. From a 3D CAD model a 1:1 scale prototype of the handbike is build so it can be tested for functionality, appearance and usability. The users where enthusiastic about the design and would fit their lifestyle. The driving performance was comfortable but they where used to a smaller turning radius. The coupling mechanism worked but the users needed some practice to get used to the coupling movement. Recommendation for optimization are fine tuning the accuracy of the coupling mechanism so it will be fluent and reliable in use. The weight can be reduced of the docking station by using aluminum and the frame can made by aluminum extrusion so parts will be reduced. A big trend at the moment is to apply electric engines on bicycles and also for the handbike a power assist engine with battery can be applied on the handbike which is an optional feature. The product assortment can become deeper by making a children version and supply accessories for the handbike.

Due to the buildup of plaque the coronary arteries become narrow. The plaque can suddenly disrupt and partially or completely occlude a vessel, this can lead to myocardial infarction and sudden death. Angioplasty is a surgical procedure during which stents are placed inside the coronary arteries to keep these vessels open. Quantitative analysis can be performed on an imaging technique called OCT to study the lumen areas over time and the effects of implanted stents. The lumen areas are the part of an artery where the blood flow through. Contour detection is necessary for calculating the lumen areas. To our knowledge the lumen contours of the coronary arteries from OCT data-sets are currently only manually detected, no method for automatic contour detection exists. The lumen volume can be calculated using the lumen areas and is also used in quantitative OCT analysis. However, motion artifacts are introduced due to the cardiac cycle while acquiring an OCT data-set. These motion artifacts reduce the accuracy of the calculated lumen volume. The focus of this thesis is on automatic contour detection and selecting a subset of cross-sections is proposed as a possible solution for reducing these motion artifacts.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Mediamatics","","","",""

(mentor); Meijer, G.C.M. (mentor)","2009","The Universal Transducer Interface (UTI) is a mass-produced interface circuit which can realize the functions of measuring signals of various sensors such as capacitive sensors, resistive-bridge sensors and resistive sensors. For some of the front-ends, an instrumentation amplifier, which is implemented with dynamic-element-matching (DEM) for its feedback structure, is integrated in the chip. In certain UTI modes, this amplifier is used to amplify small output signals of a resistive-bridge sensor or a single resistive sensor before it enters the applied modulator. According to customers’ complaints, the UTI doesn’t work well. This thesis describes how with systematic investigations three problems have been identified. The first one is that undesired offset is introduced by the limited common-mode rejection ability of the instrumentation amplifier. The second one is that for input common-mode voltages higher than 3.4V, the On-resistances of the applied NMOS switches that control the DEM loop, cause the system to be out of function. The third one is that the electromagnetic interference can introduces unwanted noise in the wiring of the external resistive-bridge sensor. Two dynamic-offset-canceling techniques have been proposed and one of them has been realized on board. With these techniques, the offset has been successfully reduced from up to 200?V to about 7 ?V. The noise introduced by interference can be eliminated by applying proper shielding.","resistive bridge; resistive sensors; dynamic-offset-canceling; electromagnetic interference; universal sensor interface","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2009-12-01","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Electrical Engineering","","microelectronics","",""

(mentor); Duinkerken, M.B. (mentor); Van Wee, G.P. (mentor)","2009","KLM’s Components Services is responsible for availability of repairable aircraft components for KLM and third party airliners; on behalf of planned and unplanned maintenance. Repairable aircraft components are interchangeable. Hence the realization of components availability includes monitoring components flowing through a continuous cycle that consists of storage, logistics, component removal-exchange-installation, reverse logistics, repair, and storage again. This monitoring process is executed by the unit vendor control (VC), part of Component Services (CS). Since components availability is sold as insurance, CS needs to fulfill 100% of the component requests. Thereby it is complicated by the complex nature of the process cycle, the high value and large variety of unique components as well as the unpredictability of component failure. Clearly this has in impact on inventory management and maintenance logistics headed by Component Services. Define the problem While ensuring 100% component availability, often last-minute activities are required to recover delivery problems that are caused by stock-out situations. These activities are referred to as recovery activities. A stock-out of a component is the result of unstable demand and unstable repair times (TAT). Stock-outs indicate that the process cycle is not fully under control, this is called process instability. At present, the consequences of process instability (i.e. stock-outs) are only reactively recovered. This means that people tend to act as the stock-out already originated and not try to avoid it. Thereby, the following research question is formulated: Main research question: How should Component Services proactively anticipate on process instability in order to improve availability management by avoiding stock-outs instead of only solving these? The DMAIC methodology is adopted to create insight in the root-causes and impact of process instability and finally give an answer to the main research question. DMAIC is a six-sigma improvement methodology that attempts to understand and eliminate the negative effects of process instability. Measure delivery problems To be able to know what kind of component often cause stock-out situations, the operational characteristics of service parts defined by Huiskonen (2001) are used for component categorization. From that is concluded that problematic components have in common that these represent an important share of the turnover realized by CS. Besides that, problematic components are critical to direct aircraft operations and have a demand that can be describes as not frequent and when occurring; low amounts. When demand and turn around time performance of 25 problematic components is simulated, the average stock-out probability (PSO) is 23% while the average turn around time reliability is 30%. This means 23% of the component requests cannot be delivered directly from stock while only 30% of the repairs are executed within determined turn around time-norms. These findings conflict with CS its objective to deliver 95% of the all component requests from stock (i.e. a maximum PSO of 5%) and repair 95% of all components within time-norms. Analyze process instability The reason for the high PSO and low TAT-reliability is analyzed. In the current situation, the probability to run out of stock is intensified by the high variance of repair time (TAT) of separate components. Three clear root-causes can be distinguished related to the variance in turn around time regarding problematic components. A first root-cause is the misalignment of repair priority between vendor control and the related workshop. This is especially the case with regard to the Engine Shop which mainly focuses on repairing engines instead of separate components. A second root-cause is the fraction of units of which the repair is dedicated to an internal workshop but whose repair is sometimes outsourced to an external vendor. The third root-cause is the fraction of forward exchange requests on a component. Forward exchange requests originate from customers who want to receive a serviceable component first after which they return the defective counterpart. In a theoretical situation -with fixed turn around times are simulated- the demand variance intensifies the stock-out probability too. A root-cause for demand variance is the determined maintenance strategy of a component: components with a fixed maintenance interval (hard timers) show a more unstable demand pattern. The demand variance of the regarded components is independent of numerousness and heterogeneity of the customer population active on a component as well as the age of the component population itself. When absolute demand of these problematic components is analyzed, no clear influence is found of seasonality and the aircraft utilization rate. Absolute monthly demand has a direct relationship with monthly flight hours with concerning half of the analyzed components. The four deducted root-causes lead to the recognition of four problem fields. All problem fields intensify process instability and have different causes, but have a general solution in common: increase of TAT-reliability. This means, more components need to be returned into serviceable status, within the agreed time-norms. Improve availability management The most effective way to create stability in the process cycle is maintenance planning on component level. When maintenance is planned, components are removed according to a planning and thereby vendor control and workshops, both have balanced workloads. It is expected that this results in a higher TAT-reliability. Due to the fact that many stakeholders are related to maintenance planning, it is hard to realize this in practice. Therefore is requires further analysis. The most feasible way to create stability in the process cycle is proactive monitoring of components. This can be realized by the unit vendor control (VC) alone. VC is responsible for process cycle stability and monitors the repair and logistical processes related to component availability. In order to effectively decrease PSO by increasing the TAT-reliability, VC needs to utilize its reclamation capacity according to priority. This means it has to ensure that the components that have the highest probability to run out of stock are repaired first. Thereby VC dictates the repair order sequence of the workshops’ workload buffer. The repair order sequence is determined by a component’s minimal serviceable stock level and the deducted root-causes, which function as early warning indicators. It might be the case that VC and internal shops do not posses the required resources to realize the required TAT-reliability without the necessity to pay extra costs. Therefore a theoretical balance exists between the TAT-reliability and the expected PSO, resulting in the lowest total costs. This balance depends on the cost to recover a stock-out and the proactive (on-time) reclamation costs (i.e. the costs required to realize component repair within time-norms). To be able to make this trade-off accurately, further research needs to be done on costs drivers of availability management. Control proactive anticipating From the perspective of transparent performance measurement, a variable TAT-reliability per component or workshop is not desired. Therefore a TAT-reliability of 95% is a condition. When CS wants to realize a TAT-reliability of 95%, the proactive (on-time) reclamation costs remain for optimization towards lowest total costs. Two general measures can be applied to do that: realize more efficient component repair or reclamation (1) or adjust TAT-norms so that on-time repair requires less effort (2). Hence, vendor control proactively monitors components based on minimal serviceable stock and early warning indicators. As VC recognizes that the TAT-reliability of a component is hard to realize, internal shops are forced to take responsibility. As extensive additional costs are required, vendor control proposes to adjust TAT-norms and thereby increase stock levels. As a rule of thumb applies that as the costs of a stock-out are less than 11.5 times the costs of proactive (on-time) reclamation, TAT-norm adjustments are justified. To realize continuous improvement of the monitoring-effectivity, a method can be used that detects and analyzes process instability and assists to reduce it cost-effectively. Conclusion Component Services should proactively anticipate on process instability by monitoring those components that have the highest risk to run out of stock. A height stock-out probability is indicated by a components minimal serviceable stock and early warning indicators. Thereby it has to balance the on-time reclamation effort (i.e. workload) and PSO according to cost-ratios of those two variables. To realize continuous improvement of process stability, CS should use the general method of cost-effective process instability reduction. This method enables to detect and analyze process instability and assists to reduce it in a cost-effective way. When CS still wants to realize a TAT-reliability of 95% it can increase its reclaiming capacity by working more efficient or decrease the required effort by adjusting TAT-norm. Thereby it has to find a total cost optimum taking into account all related cost-drivers.","logistics; closed loop supply chain; monte carlo simulation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2009-11-24","Technology, Policy and Management","Infrastructures, Systems and Services","","Transport Infrastructure and Logistics","",""

In the section of the Leaching Plant copper is lost, iron and aluminium are precipitated. Sampling of this process showed that the removal of copper from the solution is a function of pH and is mainly linked to the removal of aluminium. Tests with process fluids at stable pH levels showed that ferric ion and aluminium are mainly removed as jarosites at pH = 2 and pH =2,5. Copper is also removed at those pH values and is thus precipitated in jarosite form. This is the actual loss of copper. At pH = 3 and 3,5 more aluminium was removed, but now also in the form of aluminium hydroxides. It was found that copper is adsorbed onto these hydroxides and hence more copper is removed from the solution. At these pH values also jarosites are formed which permanently remove copper, but it is assumed that the adsorption onto aluminium hydroxides prevails. The result of the adsorption of copper onto these hydroxides is that it eventually returns to the FeP in which it has another chance to get lost to jarosites. Hence the only way to prevent copper from being lost is to prevent copper from reaching the FeP. One way to prevent copper from reaching the FeP is not using calcine to neutralise the acid from the SiHALO, but with alternative neutralising agents which do not contain copper. Another way is to prevent copper from leaving the SiHAL. Copper cementation is a method which can totally remove the copper dissolved in the SiHALO. Copper cementation with iron was found to yield the highest recovery and is thus also the most cost effective.

The expected fatigue life of certain subcomponents is an important design requirement. Fatigue damage is triggered by a periodic loading of the construction. The number of load-cycles (and thus the lifetime) and the amplitude of the periodic loading dominate the fatigue behavior. The lifetime greatly increases if the load amplitude is decreased. One of the possible ways to reduce the periodic behavior of the loading is by applying flaps to the blades of a Horizontal Axis Wind Turbine (HAWT). The flap deflections can be preprogrammed to counteract the periodicity of aerodynamic phenomena like wind shear or yawed operating conditions. In the future, it should even be possible to add a sensing system, calculating in real-time the required flap deflections. With this 'Smart' autonomous system, possibilities open up to even use the control surfaces for non-periodic peak loads occurring due to turbulence or wind gusts. In this master thesis, an aerodynamic model (Vortex Panel Code) is used to investigate the loads on the blades of the HAWT. The simulated wind turbine is an experimental rotor which will be tested in the Open Jet Wind Tunnel Facility (OJF) at the TUDelft. The loads for three different cases are calculated. In a first simulation, the reference condition is analyzed, i.e. the rotor is operating in pure axial inflow. Secondly, the turbine is operating under yaw misalignment. This simulation gives the uncontrolled (and mostly unwanted) periodic behavior of the blade loads. Finally, the effect of a prescribed flap deflection is analyzed. When the output of the flap deflection case is compared to the output of the yaw misalignment case, it is possible to make an estimation of the required flap control in order to reduce or even eliminate the periodic behavior of the loading. The obtained estimations indicate that the smart rotor concept is useful to compensate for periodic structural loadings, but it is not very suitable for applications where the purpose is to level a periodic output of the rotor power.","Windenergy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","AEWE","","","",""

(mentor)","2009","The amount of data involved in medical volumes, especially in the case of volumes consisting of stacks of histological sections, tends to be very large. Despite rapid advancements in computer processing power and storage- and memory capacity in the past years these volumes are simply too large to be transferred to and visualized on regular workstations. At the same time Internet connectivity is becoming common and connections are getting faster every day. In this situation a client-server remote visualization can be used to hand off visualizations to (clusters of) dedicated, well-equipped, servers which can do the heavy work and send the result, or a part thereof, back to the client when ready. In this project we developed a client-server framework for remote visualization of histological data. The framework is designed to be scalable and effectively utilize hardware resources from multiple servers for each visualization pipeline. The framework uses the concept of strategies to assign resources to each visualization and to distribute these resources over the available hardware according to predefined rules. To manage the available data we designed a data scheme in which multiple objects belonging to a certain dataset, we will define these objects as modalities, can be stored in a relational database. A key feature of our solution is that the scheme allows appropriate visualizations of the modalities to be stored along with the data in the same relational database. Additionally, as part of this project, we developed a reference client application which is able to use the framework to do remote visualization. This application was purposely designed to work on many platforms without the need for state-of-the-art hardware or software. The application currently offers support for visualizations that require viewing of images, viewing of planes extracted from volumes and viewing of three-dimensional scenes under control by a camera. Both the framework and the reference client application are designed to be extensible and will be made available to the public domain so that the software can be used freely and adapted to future demands whenever needed.","medical visualization; histological sections; client/server framework","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2009-12-01","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Mediamatics, Computer Graphics & CAD/CAM","","","",""

(mentor); Van Beers, C. (mentor)","2009","In March 2007, the European Commission presented the “Renewable Energy Roadmap”, a document establishing a binding target for all European Union’s Member States to increase their renewable energy consumption rates from sources such as wind, solar, hydro or biomass. The overall value (for all EU Members) was set at 20 percent and should be reached by the year 2020. The renewable energy production was introduced in the energy production sector just after the energy crises of the 1970s as private attempts of few countries to deal with prospective energy security issues. In addition, renewable energy technologies contributed in pollution abatement, which has been a challenging issue for the European Commission ever since, due to their non-depletable nature and the decreased amount of greenhouse gas emissions compared to the ones produced by fossil fuels. In December 2008 the European Union adopted the proposal of the Commission (2008), which stated each Member country’s target share of renewable energy consumption, calculated on the basis of per capita gross domestic product. The Directive included in-between targets (such as 25 percent of the overall target between 2011 and 2012) but no binding constraints on their implementation. Besides the increase of the Renewables share, another solution which has been proposed by the European Commission has been the concept of “energy efficiency”. This idea is defined as decreasing the energy consumption by 20% by the year 2020. In contrast to the renewable concept, energy efficiency has been implemented following regulations suggested by the European Commission. The general policy instruments which have been used remain the same with those of Renewables but they have been more clearly defined for all sectors (households, industries, transports and services). Despite the fact that the Renewables have proceeded as a concept, energy efficiency has been adopted widely and faster. These two trends have been the most representative concerning the energy changes which the European Union started promoting the last decades. Their effect is multi-oriented: prevention from energy depletion and dependence on foreign countries and pollution abatement, according to the directions of the Kyoto protocol. The success of the implementation of environmental friendly technologies has been related to the technological change in the energy field. Many researchers tried to connect environmental innovation with various characteristics, such as R&D expenditures or policy instruments, in order to suggest effective means for their promotion. Characteristic researches have been these of Popp (2005) with “lessons” over environmental innovation and connection of innovation to energy prices, Brunnermeier and Cohen (2003) who modeled, for the US industrial sector, the determinants of environmental innovation, Vries and Withagen (2005) who connected environmental innovation to stringency policies and Johnstone et al. (2008) who modelled the environmental innovation determinants and specified their research in policy instruments. Johnstone et al. (2008) tried to define a relation between environmental innovation and energy policies for the Renewables using an empirical model. The model included some general variables, such as electricity prices or energy consumption, and then defined binary variables to operationalise the policy measures. The environmental innovation was defined as the number of patent counts for specific classes of the International Patent Classification. The present study’s model is based on Johnstone’s et al (2008) model. It follows the main lines of their research by using the same innovation output, i.e. the patent counts, and by having two sets of variables: the general ones and the policy-related ones. The patent counts were considered to be the most appropriate output indicator for this empirical study, as well, as they provided the necessary information to modelling (such as priority date and country of application) and were widely available (from the European Patent Office - EPO). Johnstone et al. (2008) defined a simple “input-output” model for six renewable energy sources. For each one of the sources, they used a specific classification in order to gather all patent counts relevant to each source. They also included seven policy types which were implemented for the renewable energies for a specific time period. Finally, they included a set of “explanatory” variables, which were considered as input innovation indicators. This study based on their model also used patent counts as innovation output. The main “modelling” differences are the introduction of more explanatory variables, such as R&D personnel, international trade indicator or R&D intensity, the different policy instrument operationalisation (from binary to semi-quantitative) and the empirical analysis methods. Also, Johnstone’s model is implemented for a different set of countries and a different time period than the one we examine. Our focus is on the effects of policies on environmental innovation for the EU15. The reason for that is that it is interesting to measure the effects of policies within the borders of the European Union (for policy recommendations) and that the data collected are from the EPO. Johnstone et al (2008) mention that, when coming from non-European country it is less likely to patent at the EPO. Also, our information is set for a shorter period of time for practical reasons (there was no available information before 1990 for the renewable sector and, by definition the European Commission has not started yet promoting the Renewables). The new framework has been yet once modified in order to include the effects on energy efficiency energy trend. Using the same variables, we created a new output set in order to incorporate the policy measures implemented for this second energy trend. Using a logarithmic scale, we performed two types of regression analysis to model our data, the linear regression using the ordinal least squares, which provides a linear relationship between the dependent variable (our output) and the independent variables (our input) and gives the best-fitting relation by minimising the least squares error and the general linear regression, which takes into account possible attributes of the dataset, such as heteroscedasticity or correlation, and, is also more efficient in analysing datasets with cross sectional data (such as time series) included in our model. The model used for both energy trends several explanatory variables, determinants of patenting activities. From these we extracted valuable information concerning the R&D input, the energy consumption and the electricity prices. R&D was measured in two separate ways: the R&D intensity, which reflects the R&D expenditures ratio, spent on each energy trend and R&D personnel. Both of these variables showed a positive linkage to the output. Positive impact also came from energy consumption. As for the electricity ratio, a subsidy for the electricity prices for households and industries, the results diverged, depending on the energy sector. For the renewable energy, the electricity ratio had a negative impact denoting the importance of the industry electricity price as innovation determinant and for energy efficiency; the electricity ratio had a positive impact denoting the importance of household prices as innovation determinants. At the same time, we should mention the fact that policy instruments follow this observation: for energy efficiency, most measures are implemented in the household sector, while on renewable energy most measures affect the industry sector. The regression analyses showed interesting results concerning the policy instruments for both energy trends. While the renewables favour price based instruments, such as taxes and tariffs, the energy efficiency favours legislative (like quotas) and financial (like grants and subsidies). This observation is very important as it shows the tendencies of the last 17 years to promote different energy trends. For renewables, which were boosted right after the energy crises, the measures have a more obligatory character in order to succeed. This information combined with the fact that renewables were mostly promoted in the industry sector (which by definition consumes the largest amount of energy) links renewable innovation to stringency policies. On the contrary, energy efficiency has a more liberate character. This is also connected to the fact that it is mostly implemented in households. After the conclusions, the policy measures provide a clearer picture of how environmental innovation is linked to them. In conclusion, the environmental innovation is strongly related to existing policy measures, and, in fact, different policy instruments have greater effect on different environmental friendly energy trends than others. Price based measures are most effective in inducing innovation for renewable energy technologies, while legislative and financial measures are most effective on energy saving innovation. During the study, there were found no significant results on voluntary measures. In general, public policies are linked directly to these two energy trends. This conclusion could urge the promotion of the two trends in parallel so that the targets (pollution abatement and security of supply) of the European Commission are achieved as scheduled.","environmental innovation; policy clusters; renewable energy technologies; energy efficiency technologies","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2009-11-30","Technology, Policy and Management","Innovation Systems","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","",""

(mentor); Van der Vliet, R. (mentor); Molenbroek, J.F.M. (mentor)","2009","Swimsuits are developing rapidly. In the last major competitions the most frequently asked question was “Which suit does he wear?”. Since the introduction of the LZR Racer from Speedo, and the significantly faster times achieved in these suits , the swimsuits have become subject of discussion. The FINA has decided to introduce new regulations at the beginning of 2010; this makes it even more interesting to gain insight into the cause of the drag reduction that the new suits offer. For InnoSportNL and the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, this was one of the reasons to initiate a research into “The effects of manipulations to a swimsuit on passive and active drag” (N. Cuperus, et. Al, 2009). TU Delft collaborated in this research in the development of an adjustable swimsuit to analyze the parameters that influence the drag properties of the swimmer. It was not possible to draw significant conclusions. According to laws in physics, including the law of Archimedes, it can be stated that the total displacement of water is not reduced by adding buoyancy. This was however not proven in the research. Earlier research has already shown that the total drag of swimmers is basically built up from three parameters (H. Toussaint et al., 2004 from Fish, 1993 and G. Kuiper, 2003), namely friction drag, pressure drag and wave drag. Although the exact ratio between these parameters is not known, and probably differs from one person to another, most studies (i.e. H. Toussaint, 2002) state that friction drag contributes the least to total drag whereas pressure drag contributes the most. Pressure drag is mainly influenced by the shape of the object, in this case the swimmer, and predominantly the frontal area. Wave-drag depends on the (hull-)length and shape of the swimmer. Friction drag depends on the surface properties. In addition to the research into active and passive drag of swimmers, a questionnaire, issuing comfort and experience, was held among fifteen national athletes of the Dutch swimming team. The most striking conclusions from this user research were that the effort needed to get in a competition suit (about 30 minutes) did not hinder the swimmer , and that compression on the torso and pelvis gave them (the idea of) support. Considering these results a new concept for a swimsuit was developed. The focus lay on reducing pressure drag and wave drag by smoothening the body shape. The elaborated concept does this by compressing the pelvis in order to shape the body in a drop-shape, which is considered to be an excellent drag reducing shape within this range of speed by maritime engineers. This was also the best solution regarding the user questionnaire. Furthermore, the concept swimsuit incorporates a fabric that is super-hydrophobic to imitate the lotus-effect. This was found very profitable under similar circumstances (a. Greidanus, 2009). The concept was evaluated by testing two working prototypes. For this test two users were chosen for whom a personal suit was made. The prototype was focused on the fit and pattern of the concept, no high-tech material was used. To test both active and passive drag, the MAD and tow system available at InnoSportLab were used. Also personal characteristics such as three different circumferences, weight, mass to relate the drag reduction of the concept suit to. Conclusions that can be drawn from this research are, if more compression must be applied, a dressing aid is needed. As for the factors that influence drag: the pressure drag can be influenced by shaping the body in a more fluent shape, not necessarily “drop shape”. Pressure drag is of less importance during swimming than with diving.","swimsuit; forward crawl; drag; compression","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design","",""

This module is to be coupled to structural dynamics modules for the analysis of wind turbine aeroelasticity . For this aerodynamic module a zonal approach will be used which incorporates an external unsteady potential flow solver and an unsteady integral boundary layer method(IBLM). It was my task to develop an unsteady two-dimensional IBLM from existing methods and then to apply the method using several Finite Differencing Methods (FDM), Finite Volume Methods (FVM) and a particular Finite Element Method(FEM) namely Discontinuous Galerkin (DG). Several systems of IBL equations as well as closure relations have been considered in some detail. All of the considered systems for the IBLM turn out to be hyperbolic and thus warrant the implementation of a Riemann solver. Various test cases were performed and compared with literature, most notably, the impulsively moved and oscillating flat plate and the impulsively moved cylinder. Results show that the unsteady IBLM is able to model the transient behavior correctly, even close to separation, for very high Reynolds number numerical smoothing is required. All finite difference schemes performed well, the same is expected for the finite volume methods. It is advised to apply the closure relations by Matsushita et al for laminar boundary layer flow. Further development is necessary for the DG method as the closure relations may give problems in combination with an expansion in basis functions for the flux vector and the source vector.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","","","","",""

Different terms like initial failure, propagation of failures and disproportionate damage are important aspects of such collapses. In current design practice, a method to measure a structures’ progressive collapse sensitivity in its early design phase and taking into account all aspects of a structures collapse resistance does not exist. The objective of this research is to develop a tool that takes into account all aspects of a progressive collapse and can aid the engineer in assessing a design, in its early design stage, on progressive collapse. At first, the initial failure is elaborated. Different events can cause the failure of elements. The probability an initiating event occurs at a certain element is different for each element. Mitigating measures can limit the chance of occurring for certain events. The initial events are applied on the model in 2 steps. First the location (or: element) of the event is chosen by a random selection method and a distribution of failure chances on the model. Second, the size of the damage is determined by applying a Gaussian curve over the model, both in x- and z-direction. This determines if adjacent elements, related to the removed element in step 1, are removed. The model is calculated by FEA-software. Only linear and first order calculations are considered. These limitations lead to inaccuracies of the results compared with reality. A stability analysis has been performed to determine the buckling lengths of columns with more accuracy. Catenary action is one of the main modelling methods in designing against progressive collapse. This method is implemented into the tool. Iteratively, the forces and deformations are calculated which develop during the occurrence of catenary action.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Design and Construction","","","",""

Based on this problematic issue, the current thesis is focused on the recognition of emotional facial expressions, finding interrelation between the facial expressions and labels and finally the classification of the expressions. One of the parts of this project is an emotional database which will contain images of faces, their corresponding Action Units and their labels. The contribution of this database to the problem stated above is that it can be used by systems in order to recognize emotional facial expressions given one of the database data i.e. action units’ combination. The other part of the project, which is an expert system for emotional classification, will enable to classify emotional expressions, the ones included in the database and all the possible combination of them.","facial expressions","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Mediamatics","","","",""

(mentor); Keyson, D. (mentor)","2009","The workplace environment is changing; office buildings no longer have a desk for everyone, people work from different places at different times, people become tacit workers, people work more individualistic and work life and home life start blending together. The challenge is to understand more about the nature and value of informal and spontaneous communicative activity and seeing whether technology could be fruitfully employed to aid it. Research is conducted amongst consultants of Microsoft who work with ‘Het Nieuwe Werken’ at Microsoft Netherlands to understand what they miss when they don’t have informal encounters. The design vision is to use the serendipity of face-to-face ad hoc meetings and surprise employees with context information of others while they are not especially looking for it. The design is an interactive wall which recognizes a passer-by and together with the movement of the person other contexts are shown of people who might be interesting for the passer-by. More context information is revealed when the person touches a context. Connections of the context are shown When there are two people standing in front of the wall correlations are shown. The passer-by can make a coffee request or choose to be reminded later about this other person. Serendipity plays an important role and the concept doesn’t distract the employees too much from their work. A test is setup at Microsoft to see how people respond to this wall and to let them criticize the value. The test showed that it is a good way to improve the cohesion of employees physically instead of virtually. This concept does support general awareness and the possibility to get in touch with (new) people. Certain aspects which still need to be investigated; the graphical appearance, amount of information, more interactive elements to navigate through contexts and possibilities for immediate actions.","workplace; future; microsoft; interactive wall","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor)","2009","Vectorizing code for short vector architectures as employed by today’s multimedia extensions comes with a number of issues. The responsibilities of these issues are moved to the compiler in order to keep hardware simple. One of those issues is memory-alignment, which requires the compiler to guarantee loading and storing vectors at aligned addresses. Previous work that covered this issue proposed a mechanism to reorder vectors at runtime to ensure proper alignments, while other work has focussed on finding a minimal number of reorderings. We combined these subjects into an in-depth research and implemented the optimization for the retar- getable CoSy(R) compiler framework. Instead of solely focussing on the minimal number of reorder- ings, we also considered dynamic (runtime) properties which may enable latency-hiding of reordering operations. Furthermore, we performed a comparison of the presented reordering-techniques and researched the impact of other compiler optimizations on the proposed transformation. Finally, we placed our results into perspective with unaligned load/store operations supplied by our target architecture. With our implementation, we were able to vectorize a number of applications for SSE and SSE2 vector extensions where alignment-issues were involved. For randomly generated loops we were able to achieve between 50% and 80% of the speedup obtained by unaligned memory instructions. (Our targeted architecture is less strict on memory alignment and supplies instructions that can handle misalignments by hardware). As for the benchmarks, we were able to achieve speedup factors of about 2.25x for a block-matching algorithm (combined with loop versioning to avoid runtime alignment), 1.6x for the SPEC95 Swim benchmark and a factor 4x for a Sobel FIR filter.","SIMD; vectorization; compiler; alignment","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics & Computer Engineering","","Embedded Systems","",""

(mentor); Moes, C.C.M. (mentor)","2009","Upper extremity prostheses can be divided in two main categories: body powered and externally powered. Human powered devices are controlled by a force that is delivered by the user, which often involves moving a limb. In an externally powered prosthesis the energy is provided by an external powersource, such as a battery. The majority of these devices is actuated by picking up myo-electric signals from the user. Not many individuals with an upper limb absence use their prosthesis on a regular base. Rejection rates of 50% have been reported due to various reasons on both user-level (need for wearing, predisposing characteristics, availability) as prosthesis-level (comfort, control and functioning, durability and maintenance, cosmetics). For each type of prosthesis the reasons for rejection, the priorities of the user and the dissatisfactory properties are different. The dissatisfactions, expectations, reasons for rejection and most common usage of a prosthesis were combined into a vision, where durability, feeling comfortable (physical comfort and appearance), natural control (simple, fast, low effort, feedback) and the primary activities (grasping objects of daily living, possible manipulation of object by sound hand, stability, feedback, automatically adjust to shape object) were the major focus points. Based on this vision, a strong, low weight, multi-articulated, underactuated, body powered voluntary closing handprosthesis with multiple separate fingers was aimed for. Academic and commercial prostheses which had multiple (multi-articulate) finger integrated were evaluated and combined with self obtained knowledge which showed the pinchforce stability of the grasp are at stake due to the (obvious) counteracting leverages in the finger and the distribution of the actuation force amongst all the fingers. A second problem that was encountered was the dependency of each other of the phalanges and fingers when using an underactuated system. After consideration the best way to increase the pinchforce was to integrate a variable force transmission which provides a leverage after all the fingers have touched the object (speed of grasp is maintained, output force is increased and displacement decreases). The dependency of the phalanges is removed by using a one-way lock in the proximal phalanx, still enabling the mechanism to provide feedback to the user by the distal phalanx. Various mechanisms of the finger, one-way lock and variable force transmission were designed after which one of each was conceptualized. A prototype of the finger was made and evaluated. This resulted in the design of two improved fingers, of which one was made twice. The three prototypes were combined in to one hand, which was tested to grasp several objects of daily living. The outcomes were promising, as the mechanism appeared to function as intended.","prosthesis; handprosthesis; finger; adaptive; multi articulate; underactuated","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","Free Doctoral, combination of IPD and BME","",""

(mentor)","2009","Synchronous systems waste a lot of power in the clock tree, and must be designed based on the worst case scenario in terms of speed. Asynchronous circuits offer relief to these problems, by replacing clock signals with handshakes which only charge when data is being transferred, and delay signals which may adapt more easily to variance in speed compared to the clock period. Desynchronization is the process of turning a synchronous circuit into an asynchronous one. Scheduled circuits are a common way to provide a good compromise between conserving area of a circuit and increasing its speed. Desynchronizing such a system is made difficult because every functional unit in the circuit must respond to controls from the central state machine, which cannot easily handshake with all of them. This report demonstrates two related methods designed specifically for the conversion of a synchronous, scheduled circuit into an asynchronous, delay insensitive circuit. Decomposition of the central state machine into local, smaller ones is used to combat the problem of skew in the control signals, as well as to speed up the performance of the asynchronous circuit. The slack in the clock period can also be used for possible speedup. Conditions which threaten deadlock of the circuit are identified and rescheduling solutions are proposed. A tradeoff between the two methods of area conservation and hardware reusability versus speed is also explained.","Asynchronous; Scheduling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics & Computer Engineering","","","",""

Any real network can be modeled as graph, expressed by an adjacency matrix or list. In many complex networks, when a graph of a certain type grows in size, its properties are expected to change. Each complex network presents specific topological features which characterize its individual properties and are influenced by the dynamics of processes executed on the network. The analysis of complex networks therefore relies on the use of measurements capable of expressing the most relevant topological features. Therefore, understanding and analyzing the properties of different sized graphs is a challenging topic in the research field. The objective of the thesis is to understand the evolving properties of growing networks. Therefore it focuses on comparison of topological metrics with different number of nodes and links. Growing graphs will be approached by two different schemes: preferential link attachment and random link attachment. Several common types of graph models are involved in the thesis. And we also consider different real-world network examples. With the analysis and comparison of numerical simulation results, we want to understand the changing tendency of topological metrics for evolving networks. In final, the thesis reveals different crucial factors affecting the evolving properties of growing network and concludes evolving properties based on both empirical and analytical results.","complex network","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Telecommunications","","","",""

This area surrounded from three sides by existing residential units connecting to the A4 highway and commercial zone in the east side. A Main public space structures the project. In this matter, public space weaves five unit wings together around the green park in the center. Street paths in the project express the relation between pedestrian, motorway, green and public facilities. However, parking lots are located in the ground level as well as behind each blocks to not obstacle the physical view. Main entrance to the site is on the west side where there is a high pressure of transportation and a 18m north-south Vlietweg street also make a connection to the west side of the river. The green roof of public amenities on the west side creates a green continuity to the river and makes a transition between inside and outside. This project reflects the idea of coexistence of uses and combination of different activities. The buildings present variable identity along the public space. Different Functions ranging from public to private create diversity while keeping the unity. In the north side blocks consists of houses business in the ground floor, offices in the first floor and residential units beginning from the third floor. The ground level is the public level, the area for social interact and urban connections. The first floor recovers the urban front through a continuous gallery of offices. The change in the organization of units begins from the 2nd floor to the upper ones announcing the change in the function. In contrast to the vertical organization of spaces in the north, blocks in the south are located separately to emphasize on the continuity of green spaces and their interaction to the main public space. Hereby, a coherent public space is created for different user groups. A diverse housing apartment; studio, one bedroom and two bedrooms housing have been made different building forms while creating an integrity within a coherent shape and offering appropriate privacy and view. Accessing to each apartment requires passing through certain level of privacy. These spaces can be ranged from public to private from central yard to the housing unit. Besides that, generated by scripting an algorithm, a mass of housing units creates an environment with a series of diverse outdoor terraces in each wings. These terraces depending on the architectural functions in each level can be divided into public, semi-public and private ones belonging to each apartment.","high density residential housing; population; city expansion; density; algorithmic architecture; shape grammer; cellular automata","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture","Architecture","","Architectural Engineerin/Laboratory of Building Design","",""

(mentor); Post, J.H.N. (mentor); Van der Vegte, W.F. (mentor)","2009","Fast & Fluid Management is a world leader in POS (Point of Sale) dispensing and mixing systems for the paint industry. PPG Industries, the largest powder coat supplier in the world, approached F&FM to develop a powder dispenser for their newly developed coatings- Vivati®. PPG wants to be the first to offer the powder coating industry a unique and extremely valuable means of creating and dispensing custom powder coats at the Point of Use. This patented nanotechnology powder has the particle characteristics to allow blending, something not attainable by traditional powder coats. The F&FM dispenser will allow users to create color recipes and accurately, and repeatability, dispense the powder recipes prepared for spraying. F&FM wants to strengthen and broaden their product portfolio. Therefore a feasibility study was carried out to verify the technical and economical feasibility of a new powder dispenser; the price of the system cannot exceed  5000. The powder dispenser is based on a proven dispense technology, implemented in a new application. The dispenser can disperse powder in amounts as minimal as 0.1 grams to a maximum of 5000 grams within 15 minutes or less. The dispenser is equipped with thirteen 20-liter canisters for each base color. The canisters are mounted on a turning table, which rotates to the forward position to dispense into a holding canister each color in the recipe. The user is able to simply fill or refill the canisters with a specially developed packaging bag. The sealed bags allow the user to refill the canister without cross-contaminating the powder. The closed bag connector allows for a clean refilling process. The feasibility study is positively ended; it is feasible to dispense 0.1 gram, and to dispense 500 gram powder in 15 minutes. These findings are the result of tests with a functional model. The cost estimation of the powder dispenser showed that it is feasible to develop this system for a cost price of 4637. The following aspects making the designed powder dispenser innovative for F&FM and the dispense market: -The mechanical dispensing working principle is a proven technology. Implementing this technology in a new application, risks of failure are extremely reduced. The simplicity of the technology is it strength: A dosing valve is rotated and because of translational movement at the same time, an opening is created for the powder to flow out. By varying the rotation speed and the size of the opening, the flow rate of the powder is controlled. The technology appropriate for this application since: o The powder can be dispensed with high accuracy, o The customized colors can be dispensed time after time (repeatability), o A large volume range of powder can be dispensed: 100-5000 grams. The existing turntable principle being utilized by F&FM is renewed with this new system; the table is positioned at the top of the dispenser, the canisters are positioned underneath the table. This new turning table concept has multiple advantages: o Thirteen canisters together form a part of the housing of the machine. Since the canisters are positioned closely to each other, they form a solid and secure unit. Hereby, additional housing is not required, resulting in a cost savings. o The canisters can be easily placed, filled, cleaned or taken out for maintenance. o The open space between the canisters in the new dispenser is used. F&FM’s current designed dispensers use this space in-efficiently. By positioning components in the space, the entire dispenser is more compacted and less housing material is needed. The result is a cost saving for the system. Additionally, a compact machine is advantageous to the owner because less shop-space is required. o Since the powder is combustible, extra safety adaptations are applied. The powder dispenser is open at the bottom of the unit; hereby no powder and dust to build-up can occur in certain system regions. o If powder would be spilled during handling, it falls on the ground because of the open structure of the system. Since the powder falls in an open area, no dangerous explosion situations would be created. The project will continue with the build of an alpha prototype. This model will be used by the client for test purposes.","dispenser; powder; coating","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2010-11-06","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design","",""

(mentor)","2009","The administration of users and their related permissions in the IT environment is a complex and expensive task. The growing number and variety of applications, combined with the manual administration of related permissions results in an enormous administrative burden and lack of control. An effect of this situation is the accumulation of permissions by the employees, causing significant security risks. The implementation of Identity and Access Management (IAM) provides a solution for this undesired situation. Heineken Netherlands therefore initiated the IAM-project. Business drives for this IAM-project are; business facilitation, cost containment, operational efficiency, risk management, governance, and regulatory compliance. The identity management part of IAM focuses on the question who the user is, the access management part focuses on what the user is allowed to do. The use of Role Based Access Control (RBAC) for the realization of access management is common practice. Roles in such a role model can be seen as an abstraction of the user-permission relationship. The creation of a role model proved to be the major hurdle for the implementation of RBAC. For this purpose the RBAC-project was initiated at Heineken Netherlands, resulting in this report. The project started with the analysis of existing literature and best practices, resulting in a new RBAC terminology and the selection of four approaches for the design of a role model. Furthermore, the Heineken organization was analyzed, resulting in nine perspectives of which three were selected to form the foundations of the roles. Heineken preferred a hybrid approach for the design of the role model; however, a methodology for a hybrid approach was not yet described in literature before. Therefore a hybrid methodology was designed, containing seven steps to create the role model. As a part of the hybrid methodology, a new optimization algorithm was also introduced. The project continued with the customization of the hybrid methodology by incorporating the selected approaches and perspectives, resulting in the final Heineken Methodology. The validation of the Heineken methodology was done by conducting a pilot project at the Accounts Receivable Department of the Financial Shared Services Center. In conclusion, the RBAC-project provided a well founded, customized, and validated Heineken methodology to design the desired companywide role model. To my knowledge this is the first described study which implements a truly hybrid approach making use of a newly developed terminology and optimization algorithm. The implementation of the Heineken methodology within the pilot area resulted in a role model with 8 roles for 64 employees, reducing the number of assignments by 70%. This low number of roles and assignments enhances the control and maintainability of the role model and access management in general. The role model is now fully implemented as part of the IAM-project of Heineken Netherlands.","IAM; RBAC; Heineken; Role based access control; Identity and Access Management","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Software Technology","","","",""

This has resulted in this master thesis which presents further deepening of the understanding ‘legacy’ with its three main pillars of social – cultural, financial – economic and physical – environmental aspects. Further focus on the more tangible physical – environmental pillar with the identification of 5 key variables. Variables that create footing for liveliness and vitality to arise derived from urban planning perspectives. These variables are urban planning, mobility, routing, scale and programme.

(mentor)","2009","The most densely populated and economical most valuable areas in The Netherlands lie below mean sea level. These areas are protected against the sea by a joint coastal dune system. The vital importance of this dune system is reflected in the extensive collection of Dutch legal regulations that ensure the safety level of the dunes. The assessment methods currently prescribed by these regulations are developed in the early eighties. These methods are strictly speaking only valid for infinitely long, uniform and straight coasts. The Dutch coast with its curvatures, islands and estuaries does not meet these prerequisites. The wide application of these assessment methods is mainly justified due to intentional overestimation of the expected dune erosion. In virtue of the expected climate change and corresponding sea level rise, an effective and reliable coastal management becomes increasingly important. Dutch water management authorities therefore commissioned the development of a renewed probabilistic assessment method for dunes. Such method will provide a more accurate and elegant way of dealing with the large number of uncertainties involved in the dune erosion process. The original assessment methods for dunes along the Dutch coast are extended with a computational method for additional erosion along convex coastlines. This method is based on a limited data analysis, which resulted in a cautious guideline. It is therefore expected that current regulations underestimate the influence of coastal curvatures on the amount of dune erosion. In context of the development of a probabilistic assessment method for dunes, little is known about the relevance of coastal curvatures. It is questioned if longshore phenomena in general and coastal curvatures in particular should be incorporated in the newly developed assessment methods. A probabilistic model set-up is created using the numerical semi-two-dimensional dune erosion model DurosTA and a Monte Carlo routine. The dune erosion model is developed especially to investigate the influence of coastal curvatures. Using this probabilistic model set-up, series of computations with varying coastal curvatures and incident wave angles are made for different types of relevant probabilistic hydraulic conditions. From the results the influence of coastal curvatures on the erosion volumes, and thus the retreat distances and probability of failure, is obtained. The results are compared to current regulations. Furthermore the aspects of the dune erosion process that are particulary interesting for curved coastlines are determined. The physical and location independent importance of different model parameters is investigated by conducting a traditional sensitivity analysis. The probabilistic and location dependent importance of the model parameters is investigated by a probabilistic analysis using, amongst others, the design point. Results show that curvatures found along the Dutch coast can increase the 1/4,000 year retreat distance over 100%. Also coastal stretches with curvatures that are neglected in the current regulations still appear to suffer from a larger retreat distance up to 15%. In comparison, the maximum additional retreat distance to account for coastal curvatures is according to current regulations less than 20% in the observed situations. Furthermore the physical importance with respect to the amount of dune erosion of the sediment diameter increases along curved coastlines due to the more efficient transport of suspended sediments. From a probabilistic perspective the storm surge level gains importance due to the common formulation of the correlation between the storm surge level, the significant wave height and peak wave period.","dune erosion; curvature; curved coastlines; probability of failure; durosta","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2009-12-01","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Cuperus, Y. (mentor)","2009","The ongoing process of urbanisation in the Randstad area forces us take into consideration an integration of the Prins Clausplein with the liveable part of the city. However, as motorways cause both environmental and noise pollution, most motorways are nowadays isolated from urban areas through tunnels and sound barriers. Highway locations have a great potential. They are accessible, visible and there is lots of space available. Since the motorway is not seen as integral part of the overall urban fabric a sprawl of urbanisation is going on at these locations. This graduation project has the objective to research by means of design the possibilities to integrate the highway into the city fabric. Since this project is part of the Architectural engineering graduation laboratory the integration of Building technology and architecture is taken as point of departure in the structure of the research and design. The architectonic integration of the highway and the city and the engineering solutions for the neutralisation of nuisance caused by air pollution are integrated at all scale levels. A strategy is introduced to create buffer zones that innovatively neutralize pollution without obstructing the connection between the city and the highway. This research will focus on the neutralisation of air pollution caused by the highway in these buffer zones. The technical means of air filtering will be both researched and implemented in the design at all scale levels. The urban plan will be mainly designed to influence the airflow that direct the polluted air into filtering zones. For the filtering of air a vertical garden is designed as façade for the buildings facing the highway. Filtering air with vegetation is a very delicate matter. Not only should the airflows be optimized so the amount on air that contacts the leaf surface is maximized. Also the right mix of vegetation need to be planted to neutralize the different types of hazardous substances in the air. In this design project the combination of strategic urban planning and a innovative façade lead to an estimated improvement in air quality of 20 tot 30 percent. Above all the developed façade ads architectural quality to the harsh highway environment and could be applied both to new buildings as well as to existing structures.","A12; Prins Clausplein; highway; vertical garden","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture","Architecture","","","",""

The people at Fronteer Strategy have developed a tool for Cocreation called Rooftop. They knew that Rooftop worked well but they believed that they could benefit from a different and complementing tool in their portfolio. Co-creation, as a part of the more broad term Open Innovation, is a buzzword at the moment. And since there are many ways to co-create and many agencies offering similar services, it became interesting to find out how are people in firms making their choices on which way to cocreate suits them best. Following from a literature study and a competitor analysis, research questions were defined in order to investigate Co-creation from a practical perspective. Interviews were conducted among ten people in companies (initiators) and ten participants in Rooftop Co-creation sessions (contributors). Based on the conclusions and the insights from the research phase it was decided to focus the tool on a way to guide companies into the definition of their Co-creation strategy depending on their particular situation. The tool should also give knowledge about Co-creation to people in firms and create internal support for the Co-creation initiatives. The basis of the co-creation tool is a process, which was developed in the form of a workshop. The workshop is proposed to include key participants from the firm, facilitated by the people from Fronteer Strategy. Steps defined for the process of the Co-Creation Strategy tool. 1) Co-creation Shared Understanding, to educate people in firms about all the possibilities that lie in Co-creation and prepare them to think about the ways they could benefit from it. 2) Define the Scope, to give a framework that defines the size of the project and defines the problem. 3) Identify Important Players, to explore all the possible stakeholders, internally and externally, that could have interesting input in every stage of the project. 4) Make a Plan, to decide on the type and amount of people that will be invited to co-create in each stage of the project and visualize the action plan. 5) Ensure Success, to bring back some realism and take into account the points of attention that will make successful Co-creation. The tool was tested with three clients in order to assess how the development process worked in practice. The test client and Fronteer Strategy expressed enthusiasm for the tool. Based on the evaluation of the workshops and also on the opportunities that we found for improvement, adjustments were made to the process. The end result consists of a tool in the form of a workshop that helps companies design a Co-creation strategy and creates internal support to ensure success. After the termination of this graduation project, Fronteer Strategy wants to continue the development and make an on-line version of the tool accessible to everyone, following the spirit of Open Innovation.","co-creation; strategy; workshop; tool; open innovation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","Strategic Product Design","",""

The results showed that occupant-owners do prefer renovation concepts that do not change the façade (Light insulation). Respondents did not appreciate the idea of zoning. They preferred technical measures like solar boiler or heat pump. Higher levels of comfort, i.e. more functional floor space, might significantly contribute to higher acceptance of ambitious renovation concepts. This might be one way to compensate for disadvantages such as investments and inconvenience during the works. Simple payback time seems to become unacceptable when it exceeds the threshold of about 14 years. Regarding inconvenience, respondents clearly preferred to stay at home during the works.

It was my task to develop an unsteady two-dimensional IBLM from existing methods and then to apply the method using several Finite Differencing Methods (FDM), Finite Volume Methods (FVM) and a particular Finite Element Method(FEM) namely Discontinuous Galerkin (DG). Several systems of IBL equations as well as closure relations have been considered in some detail. All of the considered systems for the IBLM turn out to be hyperbolic and thus warrant the implementation of a Riemann solver. Various test cases were performed and compared with literature, most notably, the impulsively moved and oscillating flat plate and the impulsively moved cylinder. Results show that the unsteady IBLM is able to model the transient behavior correctly, even close to separation, for very high Reynolds number numerical smoothing is required. All finite difference schemes performed well, the same is expected for the finite volume methods. It is advised to apply the closure relations by Matsushita et al for laminar boundary layer flow. Further development is necessary for the DG method as the closure relations give problems in combination with an expansion in basis functions for the flux vector and the source vector.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","","","","",""

The ultimate (commercial) success of these systems depends on their monolithic integration which brings about significant size and cost reduction. A crucial element in such systems is the antenna element which has to be able to send and receive signals in a desired direction in space with sufficient angle resolution. The traditional way to realize such a component is by placing a conventional antenna with a broad predefined radiation pattern in front of a parabolic reflector to achieve a high angle resolution (directivity). However, this approach demands the mechanical adjustment of the reflector to change the direction of transmission/reception: a solution not viable for integrated applications. In this project we aim for the design and realization of an electrically tunable reflector as an alternative. The reflector consists of a large number of small antenna elements each terminated by an electrically tunable capacitor (varactor). By tuning the bias voltage of the varactors, the reflection properties of the elements and thus of the whole reflector can be adjusted. Of particular importance here is the resulting antenna radiation pattern (directivity) and beam steering capabilities.","integrated; tunable; patch; reflector array; mm-wave antennas","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","ECTM-DIMES","","Microelectronics","",""

(mentor); Bardow, A. (mentor)","2009","In this report the range of compounds that can be considered for simultaneous optimisation of process parameters and molecular structure through the CoMT-CAMD method is largely increased. The approach is extended by expanding a database of component PCP-SAFT parameters and development and implementation of a group contribution method GCP-SAFT. Before implementation of these approaches, the amount of structures for consideration was about one hundred, but it was shown here that this amount can be increased to over 1,000 and 100,000 respectively through implementation of an expanded PCP-SAFT parameter database and development of a group-contribution method (GCP-SAFT) respectively. An expanded PCP-SAFT parameter database was created by fitting measurements from the DIPPR database When this expanded database, containing PCP-SAFT parameters for 1371 components, is used for structure mapping, the value of the minimisation goal function (Second order Taylor Expansion approximation) can be decreased by an order of magnitude, compared to results obtained by Steur (2009). This indicates that the potential process performance, utilising real molecules, can be further increased by increasing the amount of molecules taken into consideration. The thermodynamic behaviour of components, for which no measurements have been performed, can be predicted through the development of a group contribution method for a physically based equation of state: Group Contribution Polar Statistical Associating Fluid Theory (GCP-SAFT). Three related group contribution approaches, derived from homogeneous fluid theory, showed very similar accuracy for the prediction of adapted non-associative PC-SAFT parameters. Therefore the approach developed by Vijande et al (2004) was adopted here as well, where the molecular parameters m , ms 3 and me k are linearly dependant on contributions for thecontained functional groups. This approach was expanded to associative and polar components constituting a maximum of a single dipolar or associative group. Molecular quadrupolar moments and binary interaction parameters were left out of consideration. Both dipolar and associative group contribution parameters were obtained by simple averaging. The prediction of dipole moments was relatively accurate, with AARE values for this parameter generally below 10% (36 out of 45 polar functional groups). Furthermore it is shown that the assumption of constant relative associative volume is rather strong for the homologous series of alcohols, whereas it is not well, statistically, supported for acids and amines. This is mainly due to the rejection of associative behaviour (negligible converged e AB k and k AB values) for a large portion of these series of compounds by the algorithm that fits PCP-SAFT parameters. AARE values for molecular adapted PCP-SAFT parameters m ,ms 3 and m2s 3e k are 9.28; 2.87 and 5.58% respectively for the GCP-SAFT method that takes dipolar and associative behaviour into account. This is less accurately than literature values obtained for the same model but can be largely explained through the incorporation of associative components. It is expected that Simultaneous Process Optimisation and Molecular Design overall prediction accuracy for mixtures will increase through the added prediction of dipolar and associative parameters. Model constants were fitted to 593 component PCP-SAFT parameter sets, which contained data for 75 associative components. This produced a set of 66 first order functional groups for which GCP-SAFT contributions are known. The confidence of this method is limited to components with a maximum of three branches, as the linear equations for m ,ms 3 and m2s 3e k are biased for cyclic and highly branched structures. These 66 functional groups were utilised in a sample structure generation algorithm to conveniently generate over a 100,000 different non-linear, non-aromatic structures and corresponding GCP-SAFT parameter sets that can be taken into account in simultaneous process optimisation and molecular design.","process optimisation; molecular design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Process and Energy","","Engineering Thermodynamics","",""

(mentor); Van der Voordt, T. (mentor)","2009","De toepassing van geïntegreerde contracten is in opkomst. Ze biedt voordelen, maar de toepassing kent ook nadelen. Voordelen ten opzichte van het traditionele model zijn ondermeer de verhoogde sturing op tijd en geld, maar daar tegenover staat een verminderde sturing op het kwaliteitsaspect. Er is een angstbeeld ontstaan bij voornamelijk kleine en middelgrote publieke opdrachtgevers, dat zij een verminderde invloed hebben op het ontwerp. Dit angstbeeld vanuit de theorie wordt onderbouwd in de empirie. Opdrachtgevers geven bij een geïntegreerde contractvorm, zeggenschap en invloed uit handen. De opdrachtnemer wordt in hoge mate verantwoordelijk voor het ontwerp én de uitvoering. De opdrachtnemer loopt hierbij risico’s, die traditioneel bij de opdrachtgever liggen. Het uitgangspunt van dit onderzoek is de toepassing van een geïntegreerde bouworganisatievorm. Één van de kenmerken van geïntegreerde bouworganisatievormen is de verschuiving van de verantwoordelijkheden van de opdrachtgever naar de opdrachtnemer. Opdrachtgevers zijn bang om hun invloed op het ontwerp kwijt te raken. Dit geld met name voor kleine en middel grote publieke opdrachtgevers. Deze opdrachtgevers vormen de doelgroep van dit afstudeeronderzoek. De hoofdvraag van het onderzoek luidt: ‘Hoe kan de angst van een verminderde invloed op het ontwerpresultaat, bij geïntegreerde aanbestedingstrajecten, worden weggenomen? Om de hoofdvraag te beantwoorden zijn er onderzoeksvragen gesteld zoals: waar komt de angst vandaan en is deze terecht? Hoe verloopt het geïntegreerde aanbestedingstraject? Wat is invloed voor de opdrachtgevers? Welke sturingsmiddelen zijn er voor handen? In welke fase kunnen zij hun invloed uitoefenen? En hoe gaan de actoren om met hun veranderende rol? Omdat de hoofdvraag zich leent voor een omvangrijke studie, zijn er kaders gesteld aan het onderzoek. Het onderzoek richt zich op:  de invloed van de opdrachtgever in de fases tot aan start bouw;  geïntegreerde aanbestedingstrajecten;  publiek aanbestede werken (door kleine en middelgrote opdrachtgevers). Het onderzoek richt zich op deze processen omdat hier de aanbestedingsregelgeving sterk van toepassing is. De criteria ‘transparant, non-discriminatie en objectief’ zijn van toepassing. Deze criteria vloeien voort uit het EU-verdrag. Ieder proces, elke stap moet volgens deze criteria uit te leggen zijn. Het onderzoek is zowel theoretisch als empirisch uitgevoerd, door middel van een literatuurstudie enerzijds en interviews anderzijds. Vanuit de literatuur is de opkomst van de geïntegreerde contractvormen gesignaleerd. Er zijn steeds meer opdrachtgevers die geïntegreerde vorm willen toepassen. Een geïntegreerde bouworganisatievorm wil zeggen dat de opdrachtgever het ontwerp en de uitvoering aan één partij uitbesteedt. Daarnaast kan het zijn dat de opdrachtgever, naast het ontwerp (Design) en de uitvoering (Build), ook het onderhoud (Maintain), de exploitatie (Operate) en de projectfinanciering (Finance) uitbesteedt. Hoe meer de opdrachtgever zal uitbesteden, des te complexer het traject voor hem wordt. De opdrachtnemer krijgt meer verantwoordelijkheden en draagt meer risico’s, maar hij is vaak beter in staat om deze te beheersen dan de opdrachtgever. Vanuit de literatuur is gekeken naar twee hoofdfasen van het proces tot aan start bouw te weten, de programmeringsfase en de aanbestedingsfase. Tijdens de programmeringsfase maakt de opdrachtgever een keuze voor de toe te passen bouworganisatievorm vanuit de interne, externe en projectorganisatie. Daarna stelt de opdrachtgever zijn wensen en eisen vast. Bij een traditioneel proces vertaalt hij zijn eisen en wensen naar een programma van eisen, welke wordt uitgewerkt naar een ontwerp, bestek en tekeningen. Bij een geïntegreerde bouworganisatievorm legt de opdrachtgever zijn eisen en wensen vast in een vraagspecificatie. Op basis van de vraagspecificatie besteedt de opdrachtgever zijn opdracht uit. De opdrachtgever is in vele gevallen vrij van het kiezen van de toe te passen aanbestedingsprocedure. Er is een bepaalde structuur te onderscheiden in verschillende aanbestedingsprocedures, die in vele gevallen hetzelfde is. Deze structuur is als volgt: aankondiging van de opdracht (1), eventuele kwalificatie (2), het uitnodigen tot inschrijven (3), het inlichten van de partijen (4), inschrijven van de geselecteerden (5), de beoordeling en de gunning van de opdracht (6) en het sluiten van het contract (7). De aanbestedingsregelgeving wordt als belemmerend en complex ervaren, daarnaast moeten publieke processen transparant, non-discriminerend en objectief zijn. Bij een geïntegreerde aanbesteding moet de opdrachtgever beoordelen en gunnen op de Economisch Meest Voordelige Inschrijving (EMVI). Dat wil zeggen dat de opdrachtgever niet alleen op prijs gunt, maar ook de kwaliteit laat meewegen. De beoordeling van kwaliteit is in bepaalde mate subjectief, wat één van de redenen is waarom opdrachtgevers moeite hebben met het geïntegreerde aanbestedingstraject. De actoren in het bouwproces zijn nog niet helemaal gewend aan hun (nieuwe) rol bij een geïntegreerde bouworganisatievorm. Opdrachtgevers hebben moeite met het uit handen geven van verantwoordelijkheden en zeggenschap. Er zijn een 18-tal interviews afgenomen met professionals (zeven opdrachtgevers, zeven adviseurs en vier aannemers) die ervaring hebben met geïntegreerde contractvormen. De empirie bevestigd het beeld dat opdrachtgevers bang zijn om hun invloed op het ontwerp te verliezen bij een geïntegreerde contractvorm. Velen van hen zien de voordelen van geïntegreerde bouworganisatievormen, zoals de verhoogde sturing op tijd en geld door de opdrachtgever, een betere risicoverdeling, grotere betrokkenheid van beide partijen in de beginfase, maar dus ook het nadeel van een verminderde sturing op de kwaliteit van de opdrachtgever. De grotere opdrachtgevers herkennen het angstbeeld wel, maar ondanks de verminderde invloed op het ontwerp, zijn zij gunstig gestemd over de toepassing van geïntegreerde contractvorm. Zij hebben ervaring met het geïntegreerde aanbestedingstraject en vinden dat er genoeg mogelijkheden zijn om je invloed te laten gelden. Zij zijn beter in staat om het hun processen te structureren. Volgens hen is er veel mogelijk binnen de kaders van een geïntegreerde bouworganisatievorm wanneer de opdrachtgever aanbestedingsproces gestructureerd en volledig doorloopt. De opdrachtgever moet daarbij wel inzien doordat hij meer sturing op tijd en geld heeft, hij zeggenschap over de kwaliteit moet inleveren. De grotere opdrachtgevers vinden dat zij, binnen de juridische kaders, voldoende vrijheid in het aanbestedingsproces hebben. Het proces is echter wel behoorlijk complex. De respondenten geven daarbij aan dat opdrachtgevers hun invloed gericht kunnen uitoefenen door middel van:  de vraagspecificatie doordacht en functioneel op te stellen;  de gunningscriteria zo op te stellen dat de aanbieders indirect gedwongen worden om een kwalitatief hoogwaardig product aan te bieden;  de aanbestedingsprocedure: de concurrentie gerichte dialoog (vaker) toepassen;  het toetsen en accepteren van het ontwerp en de voortgang van de opdrachtnemer door middel van het toetsings- en acceptatieplan en  kaders op te nemen waarbinnen wijzigingen kunnen worden voorgesteld na het gunningsmoment. De uitkomst van het onderzoek is een handleiding om de angst van de doelgroep weg te nemen. Daarbij is er een geïntegreerd proces, tot aan start bouw, ontwikkeld. Er zijn een aantal sturingsmiddelen opgenomen en er wordt toegelicht hoe deze moeten worden gehanteerd om je invloed te kunnen maximaliseren. De handleiding schrijft vanuit verschillende invalshoeken voor, hoe en wanneer een opdrachtgever zijn invloed kan uitoefenen. Omdat de kennis van verschillende processen van aanbestedingstrajecten gefragmenteerd is, zijn vanuit diverse bronnen, zowel uit de theorie als de empirie, de processtappen samengevoegd en doorontwikkeld. Daarnaast worden de belangrijkste op te stellen voorwaarden gedefinieerd, zoals aangegeven door de respondenten. Naast het proces en deze voorwaarden, is de dialoog als aanbestedingsinstrument vormgegeven. De opdrachtgever wordt geadviseerd om daarbij: 1. een helder en gestructureerd proces te doorlopen; 2. de belangrijkste voorwaarden op een juiste manier op te stellen in dit proces en 3. de uitgewerkte dialoog als sturingsmiddel te gebruiken. 1. PROCESMATIG DOORLOPEN VAN HET GEINTEGREERDE PROCES Voornamelijk de grotere opdrachtgevers, de aannemers en de meeste adviseurs geven in de interviews aan dat, wanneer een opdrachtgever bewust en gestructureerd het volledige proces doorloopt, hij voldoende invloed kan uitoefenen. Dit proces is echter complex en kost veel tijd, kennis en kunde. Het vraagt ervaring om het proces goed te kunnen doorlopen. De opdrachtgever moet in de initiatieffase een bouworganisatievorm kiezen voor zijn (her-)huisvestingsvraag. In de definitiefase stelt hij verschillende voorwaarden, zoals de scope, een risico-inventarisatie, een ambitiedocument, zijn selectiecriteria, de vraagspecificatie, de gunningscriteria en het toetsing- en acceptatieplan, op. Deze voorwaarden, waarin richtlijnen zijn opgenomen, zijn bepalend voor de invloed die de opdrachtgever kan uitoefenen gedurende het verdere verloop van het proces. Tijdens de aanbestedingsfase maakt de opdrachtgever zijn opdracht bekend, kondigt hem aan, selecteert hij de juiste partijen en doorloopt de dialoogprocedure. Er volgt een inschrijving van de aanbieders, waarna de opdrachtgever beoordeelt en een aanbieder de opdracht gunt. Tijdens de uitwerkingsfase, wanneer de opdracht gegund is, kan de opdrachtgever wijzigingen binnen de kaders van het uitwerkings- en realisatieplan doorvoeren. Hij kan de voortgang van de opdrachtnemer controleren door middel van het toetsings- en acceptatieplan. 2. INVLOED UITOEFENEN DOOR HET OPSTELLEN VAN BELANGRIJKE VOORWAARDEN BINNEN HET PROCES Door middel van het opstellen van een aantal belangrijke documenten, stelt de opdrachtgever zichzelf in staat om zijn invloed, tijdens en na het aanbestedingstraject te laten gelden. Deze documenten zijn voorwaarden en bevatten richtlijnen. Deze voorwaarden zijn ondermeer: de vraagspecificatie, de gunningscriteria, het toetsing- en acceptatieplan en het uitwerkings- en realisatieplan. Het blijkt uit de literatuurstudie en de interviews dat opdrachtgevers moeite hebben met het opstellen van de vraagspecificaties. Vaak is de vraagspecificatie niet de juiste invulling van de wensen van de opdrachtgever. Functioneel gestelde eisen moeten meetbaar gemaakt worden. De gunningscriteria zijn gekoppeld aan de vraagspecificatie. Er wordt gegund op basis van prijs/kwaliteit verhouding, daarbij speelt subjectiviteit een rol. De opdrachtgever moet zijn subjectieve eisen zoveel mogelijk objectiveren. Het toetsings- en acceptatieplan stelt de opdrachtgever in staat om de voortgang van de opdrachtnemer te controleren. Vooraf is er een plan opgesteld waarop de opdrachtgever gaat toetsen en eventueel accepteren. Er zijn hier richtlijnen over opgenomen in het UAV-gc. De opdrachtgever mag: documenten, zelfstandige hulppersonen, werkzaamheden en de resultaten ervan, toetsen en accepteren. De opdrachtgever neemt bij acceptatie geen verantwoordelijkheid terug. In het uitwerkings- en realisatieplan zijn kaders opgesteld, waarbinnen de opdrachtgever invloed kan uitoefenen op het ontwerp. Zo kan hij op niveau van bijvoorbeeld de stopcontacten of de kleur van de deuren, nog wijzigingen doorvoeren. 3. DE DIALOOG ALS AANBESTEDINGSPROCEDURE EN ALS STURINGSMIDDEL Zowel de theorie als de respondenten geven aan dat het missen van een dialoog tussen de opdrachtgever en de ontwerpende partij als ‘ongezond’ wordt ervaren in een geïntegreerd aanbestedingstraject. De aanbestedingsprocedure, de concurrentiegerichte dialoog (CD) komt hierin tegemoet. Een nadeel van de CD is dat het ARW voorschrijft dat de CD slechts in beperkte mate mag worden toegepast. Namelijk in het geval van een bijzonder complexe opdracht. Met een bijzonder complexe opdracht wordt in het ARW bedoeld dat de opdrachtgever ‘objectief niet in staat is om de technische middelen, de juridische en of financiële voorwaarden te specificeren’. De aanbeveling is om deze procedure vaker toe te passen, zodat opdrachtgever in staat wordt gesteld om in overleg te treden met ontwerpende partijen. De keren dat de CD is toegepast (minder dan 25 keer sinds 2005 en voornamelijk bij grond, weg en waterbouw projecten) verliep de dialoog niet altijd soepel. Er is een procedure ontwikkeld waarbij de opdrachtgever en aanbieder, volgens protocollen in overleg met elkaar treden. Het proces kan worden onderverdeeld in drie dialoogfasen te weten:  fase 1 bespreking van de visie van de aanbieder  fase 2 bespreking van varianten op schetsniveau  fase 3 bespreking van verder uitgewerkt ontwerp De handleiding is een advies gericht aan de opdrachtgever hoe hij zich zou moeten opstellen bij een geïntegreerde bouworganisatievorm, om zijn invloed te kunnen uitoefenen en te maximaliseren. Het geïntegreerd aanbesteden van werken is een complexe materie, daarom wordt als advies gegeven om het uiteengezette proces stap voor stap te doorlopen. De opdrachtgever heeft vele overwegingen te maken in dit proces. Er bestaan een aantal mogelijkheden om je invloed voor, tijdens en na het aanbestedingstraject te kunnen uitoefenen, maar daar moet de opdrachtgever zich bewust van zijn. Naast het proces stap voor stap te doorlopen, zijn er een aantal voorwaarden op te stellen, waarmee de opdrachtgever zijn invloed kan uitoefenen. Door de adviezen uit de handleiding, ter hand te nemen, heeft de opdrachtgever een aantal mogelijkheden om zijn invloed vast te leggen in richtlijnen. Daarnaast kan de opdrachtgever de dialoog als sturingsmiddel gebruiken. De dialoog als sturingsmiddel is verder ontwikkeld en kan worden toegepast in de praktijk. Het valt aan te bevelen om de voorwaarden; het toetsing- en acceptatieplan en het uitwerkings- en realisatieplan verder en dieper uit te werken. In dit onderzoek zijn zij aangeduid als belangrijk sturingsmiddel om invloed te behouden voor de opdrachtgever, maar verder wetenschappelijk onderzoek naar deze plannen ontbreekt vooralsnog. Gezien het tijdsbestek van dit afstudeeronderzoek en de complexe aard van het geïntegreerde aanbestedingstraject kon hier niet dieper op worden ingegaan.","geïntegreerd; concurrentiegerichte dialoog; aanbesteding; DB; DBM; DBFMO; bouwproces; PPS; onzekerheid; angst; contractvormen; bouworganisatievormen; aanbestedingstraject","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture","Real Estate & Housing","","","",""

(mentor); Ambrosius, B.A.C. (mentor)","2009","Europa, the smallest of the Galilean satellites, is characterized by a young water-ice surface showing a rich structure of cracks, ridges and chaotic terrain. Below the ice shell a subsurface water-ocean might exist, which in Europa’s case would be in direct contact with the silicate mantle. This direct contact is important from an astrobiological perspective, as living organisms might have developed at places where a hot part of the mantle contacts the ocean. As a consequence, many scientists consider Europa as the planetary body with the largest probability to harbor life within our solar system. It is therefore of utmost importance to find out whether a subsurface ocean exists underneath the ice shell. One plausible method to determine the existence of an ocean is based on the measurement of the radial deformation induced by the eccentricity-tide acting on Europa. If an ocean is present in the interior, the radial deformation at the surface will be one to two orders of magnitude larger than in the case that an ocean is absent. Such a large difference in deformation can be detected from measurements performed by a dedicated orbiter. As a result, a mission to the Jovian system would be required. An alternative method to determine whether there is a subsurface ocean underneath the ice shell is based on establishing a connection between the shape of the lineaments observed on the surface and the acting stress fields. Stresses at the surface might be induced by several different mechanisms, from which only the two most important will be analyzed in this research: the eccentricity-tide acting on Europa and non-synchronous rotation (NSR) of the ice shell. The first mechanism, i.e. the eccentricity-tide, induces a highly variable stress field that explains the formation of cycloidal features even without taking into account NSR stresses. The second mechanism, i.e. NSR, induces a nearly static stress field that explains the formation of slightly-curved or global lineaments. As both types of lineaments exist on Europa’s surface, the strength of NSR stresses should have changed throughout the geological history of Europa. Such a change can be driven by a variable rate of non-synchronous rotation, which can be the result of thickness variations in the ice shell. One important result obtained in this research is that tensile stresses at the surface of models without a subsurface ocean are too small to originate a crack at the surface if NSR is not taken into account. If NSR stresses are added to the modeling of the stress field, tensile stresses only become large enough to break ice when the stress field is practically static. As a result, the existence of cycloidal features strongly suggests the existence of a subsurface ocean underneath the ice shell of Europa.","sufbsurface ocean","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2009-11-23","Aerospace Engineering","Space Engineering","","","",""

Firstly, SCOR Model, being strongly operationally-oriented, relies heavily on benchmarking practices and does not take into consideration pertinent pitfalls highlighted by the concept of Business Strategy. Secondly, although the model has already followed the Sustainability current, practitioners appear to resist or fail to make use of the incorporated sustainable features. On this basis, this thesis attempts to explore how the notions of Business Strategy and Business Sustainability can be effectively incorporated in and contribute to the improvement of the SCOR Model towards the described directions. A qualitative approach is adopted and interview sessions with Supply Chain professionals are performed.

(mentor)","2009","Continuous variable selection using shrinkage procedures have recently been considered as favorable models in a wide range of scientific research; in particular biomedical research. In some cases, it is desirable to select as few predictors as possible, to increase the interpretability of the attained prediction rule. One frequently used shrinkage procedure; the Lasso, imposes a L1 regularization on the regression coefficients of general linear models, inherently leading to sparse prediction rules. When dealing with multi-class prediction in generalized linear models each predictor has a regression coefficient for each class. A major disadvantage is that the Lasso selects individual regression coefficients instead of the more logical selection of predictors. In this paper, we demonstrate a new regularization procedure, based on the Group Lasso in multinomial logistic regression. This results in a lower number of retained predictors, but with similar prediction accuracy when compared to the regular Lasso regularization. To illustrate the new regularization applicability we have employed it on a large cohort of acute myeloid leukemia patients (AML, n=531) who are characterized on a gene expression microarray.","regression; lasso; group lasso; leukemia; multi-class","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2009-11-10","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Mediamatics","","Bioinformatics","",""

Most washing nowadays is done by hand due to cultural and infrastructural reasons. Hand washing is a time consuming and backbreaking activity, done mostly by women. In prior research Procter & Gamble identified this washing behavior of low-income consumers as an opportunity; offering unique benefits to this consumer segment will allow P&G to make more profit and to gain a better share in the detergent market, which is currently being dominated by other brands. Offering access to automatic washing is such a unique benefit, if P&G could make the Indians switch to automatic washing, this would unlock a new market. Goal of the project The project has one underlying research question: ‘How to accelerated access to automatic washing for low-income consumers in India? This question is addressed by a literature research, a consumer research, and a synthesis of the data, leading to inspiring ideas that provide a starting point for further development. The scope of the project is restricted to the urban low income consumer of Mumbai. Analysis In the analysis, the Procter & Gamble, and its market environment is described. It describes P&G’s sustainability goals and how detergent manufactures can make more profit on detergents. The Indian low-income consumer is analyzed, and what (cultural) factors should be taken into account when developing a product or service, for this specific target group. Furthermore it describes different washing practices around the world, and specifically for India. Hand washing is most common in India and the penetration of washing machines is very low. A comparison of hand washing, machine washing, and laundry services is made. Qualitative consumer research The main focus of the project is a context research; an explorative qualitative consumer research of the target consumer. During a one month field research in Mumbai insights are gathered about the context; the barriers against adaptation of automatic washing, the consumers’ needs and aspirations; in general and concerning the laundry process. The data was analyzed by means of context mapping, resulting in five themes with insights; infrastructural barriers, environmental factors, cultural aspects; current ways of washing, and purchase considerations. Personas are developed, based on the consumers interviewed during the research. The personas keep the user central, and help communicating the ideas and concepts. Together, the context-maps and the personas give an inspirational and complete overview of the context of the low-income consumer of Mumbai. From the context-maps main insights are extracted. Ideas & Concepts The main insights are translated into opportunities; clustering these opportunities led to six distinct directions. Four out of six directions point to a service oriented solution. To demonstrate the directions and inspire P&G, an idea is developed for each direction, resulting in the following six ideas: The Magic Bucket, Tide Chit Fund, Share the Laundry Car, One Machine Laundromat, In-home Laundromat & Community, Washing & Water Solution. The six ideas are evaluated using the personas, and a ranking on different points segmented in People, Profit and Planet. The Community Washing & Water Solution is chosen as the solution with the most potential. Next to the Community Washing & Water Solution, the Tide Chit Fund is chosen to elaborate on, because it complements the parallel project conducted by Shri Patil, a colleague-student, researching personal low-cost washing machine design that performs best in the researched context. The two ideas are elaborated; describing the different stakeholders involved and how Procter & Gamble can ensure profit; Tide Chit Fund The Tide Chit Fund is a business model that enables personal ownership for low-income consumer; using a paying scheme with multiple women buying the washing machines together. It allows women to buy a washing machine within their budget, and receiving help in the adaptation process of automatic washing; allowing them to fully benefit from the capacity of the purchased machine. Community Washing & Water solution A Laundry Product Service System, which operates on pay per use basis, offering access to good fully automatic washing machines. The community washing & water solution also provide consumers with clean drinking water; using the P&G PUR product, and therefore delivering benefits to all members of the community. To conclude recommendations are made to further develop the concepts.","low income consumer; india; product service system; detergent; laundry; procter & gamble; sustainability","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2010-11-02","Industrial Design Engineering","PIM","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor)","2009","The sonic boom an aircraft creates when it travels with a velocity greater than the speed of sound has been a major drawback in supersonic aeronautic development for more than sixty years. The loud sound it produces has not only a very unpleasant effect on the human ear, it can also have an environmental impact and it can be the cause of structural damage. As a measure for sonic boom strength an expression for the asymptotic shock strength, an object produces at infinite distance in a supersonic °ow, is derived. The theory used to derive this measure for the asymptotic shock strength is based on the method of characteristics. The goal of the analytical study performed is to minimize this asymptotic shock strength of a 2D lift generating object. The relation between the shape of the object and the asymptotic shock strength it produces, coupled with a free stream Mach number, angle of attack and lift coefficient requirement is investigated.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","","","","",""

It can be used to predict the future water treatment situation which may happen or change. In water treatment plant Wim Mensink, the Stimela model train was set up to compare with other alternative water control strategies. Before starting the work of developing new water control strategies with Stimela model, Stimela model for Wim Mensink must be validated so that the model can be seen as a reliable and stable tool for the next work. Before the validation work, the current water control strategy for the treatment process needs to be investigated clearly to fulfil all the input control information is correct. Besides this, an experiment for obtaining the measured results of pellet diameters over different layers was performed in Wim Mensink. The validation work starts with single pellet softening process for three different reactors over first month from January 20th to February 20th. The fluidized bed height, pressure drop over total height of reactor, pellet diameters and porosities are validated. After that, the validation work is integrated with whole water treatment system to prove the function of pellet softening reactor and the four important water quality parameters over two important locations (after weir aerator location and final RO mixing location). The validated results of softening process are analysed by the relative error way to prove the reliability of the model results compared with measured results. The final step of the thesis work is developing the new water control strategies to optimize the current control plans of Wim Mensink. Five different water control strategies are put forward. They can be either reached separately according to their own advantages and limitations or fulfil with a step by step order as a whole optimization process. Moreover, the other water control strategies developed by engineering consultancy company DHV are evaluated here with Stimela model so that they can be proved reliable and achievable. In the future, the application of Stimela model will be spread over all the drinking water treatment plants in the Netherlands and contributes to the central automated control as a drinking water treatment operator training simulator.","Wim Mensink; stimela model; drinking water","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Watermanagement","","Sanitary Engineering","",""

Bathymetry and beach profiles were measured. With the data from previous years the long term evolution of the coast was analyzed. The main conclusions were that the beach in front of the Sirius hotel is still suffering from erosion and if this erosion trend continues it will damage the hotel itself in just a few years. More to the south the beach was actually a little bit accreting. The reason why only the beach in front of the hotel is eroding is probably because the beach there is at the leeside of the breakwater, which causes a gradient in the longshore sediment transport The hotel owner of Azalia, located at the Azalia beach north of Sirius beach, observed a retreating coastline during some months in the year. Therefore also here the bathymetry and beach profiles were measured. Unfortunately there were no previous measurements to compare the data with. From the beach profile we can conclude that there is probably a seasonal variation in the coastline. During winter the coastline is retreating due to the more severe wave climate. Yet in summer the beach is accreting. It can be possible that sometimes the beach has not accreted enough at the moment the touristic season starts. This can be a problem for the hotel owner because the beach is not wide enough then. A solution then can be found by some minor dredging operations in the form of beach nourishments. The sand can be recovered from deeper water or from shoals at the same beach. It can be assumed that the nourishment is not necessary at the moment but might be a good idea in the next years. Furthermore the owner of hotel Azalia wants to build a new marina a few kilometers to the south of St Constantine. Due to difficulties in obtaining a building permit it will be a floating marina which can be removed in winter, which must be protected by a breakwater. By a Multi Criteria Analysis a floating breakwater that will be removed during winter proved to be the best solution in this case. This breakwater can be designed with the milder wave conditions during summer which is a serious advantage.","Fieldwork; Varna; Bulgaria; Floating Breakwater","en","student report","TU Delft, Department Hydraulic Engineering","","","","","","Campus only","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2009","Offshore wind parks promise to become an important source of energy in the near future. To make economic use of offshore wind energy possible, foundation structures with minimum costs, but sufficient stiffness have to be designed. The horizontal loads from wind, waves and currents must be in equilibrium with the reaction of the soil. One foundation concept that has often been realized recently is the monopile. The traditional monopile is an open ended large diameter steel cylindrical pile driven into the soil. In the offshore energy industry the soil in horizontal pile-soil interaction problems is normally modeled by means of multi-linear soil springs, the so called p-y curves developed by the American Petroleum Institute (API). The p-y curves of the API are verified for piles with a diameter of up to 2.0 m. It was expected that for the design of the large diameter monopile foundations the API method would overestimate the horizontal pile displacements:  For large diameter piles the shearing resistance in the pile tip may play an important role. This effect is not included in the API method.  Large diameter piles have more shear stresses around and along the pile shaft due to the larger pile surface. This effect is also not included in the API method. However, the API does not take the interaction between the soil springs into account for the large diameter monopile foundation. To study on these effects the results of the API method are compared with the results of 3D Finite Element (FE) calculations for both a small diameter foundation pile (D = 1.0 m) and a large diameter monopile foundation (D = 4.3 m). Both piles are embedded 25 m in a homogeneous layer of sand. A representative static horizontal load and bending moment are applied to the pile. For the small diameter foundation pile the results of the 3D FEM should be comparable with the results of the p-y method.","wind turbines; lateral behavior","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geotechnology","","Geo-Engineering","",""

The Reserve’s installations are situated next to a lagoon which is separated from the open sea by a barrier beach. The lagoon is connected on the landward side to local river? and channel system. During periods of high rainfall, the lagoon is susceptible to break through to the open sea. After such breaches, high flow velocities and waves have caused significant land?loss and subsequently endangered the continued existence of the buildings at the Reserve. Since 1989, recorded breaches occurred in 1994, 2005 and 2009. It is believed that erosion of land is mainly caused by breaching events rather than continued coastal erosion by waves or currents. The breaching events may be caused by the increasing channelisation of river and drainage stretches and increasing water discharges by cultivated areas in former natural flood?plains. These interventions may be beneficial for some populated areas who are protected by channelised section and for the economy in certain regions as formerly unused land becomes productive (enabling banana plantations). However, the interventions increase the volume of water to be discharged in a confined space which reduces the capacity to discharge water safely towards open sea. The objective is to present recommendations for safely discharging water during extreme events towards the open sea, in which the ‘small scale’ breakthrough problem forms the criterion for damage for the reserve. The project consists of two areas of interest: river? and beach processes. The river processes were analysed and solutions were sought to safely discharge water using a computer model which models the real life processes. These solutions focus on the macro scale problem, and interfere in the water system as a whole. Analyzing the beach processes involved identifying the key processes in the stretch of coast between the Río Matina and Río Pacuare and modelling these processes in a computer model. Possible small scale solutions were then tested in the computer models and assessed on their effectiveness. These small scale solutions have to be interpreted as interventions the Reserve staff can implement themselves to help prevent the continued erosion during extreme events.","Costa Rica; turtles; beach erosion; river mouth stability","en","student report","TU Delft, Department Hydraulic Engineering","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","","10.167783, -83.233984"
