(mentor)","2008","The rod-airfoil configuration is a benchmark test case for aeroacoustic assessments of vortex- structure interaction noise. Several industrial devices are arranged in such a way that down- stream bodies are embedded in the wake of upstream bodies, such as gas turbines, high lift devices, helicopters among others. Aeroacoustic predictions usually rely on time dependent Flow field information obtained from CFD for the determination of the aeroacoustic sources. The present work proposes a novel approach for the aeroacoustic prediction of rod-airfoil noise based on time-resolved PIV experimental data. The aeroacoustic emission of a NACA0012 airfoil in the Karman wake of a rod is investigated by means of 2D TR-PIV in combination with beamforming and microphone measurements. First the time evolving velocity field around the airfoil is measured using high-speed PIV. The corresponding pressure field is then deduced by spatial integration of a Poisson-based algorithm for quasi-2D incompressible flows. Pressure and velocity computed on specific surfaces around the airfoil constitute the source terms of the implemented Curle's and Ffowcs Williams-Hawkings's aeroacoustic analogies. The calculated Sound Pressure Level (SPL) is compared with the measurements obtained by far field microphones. Velocity visualizations in the spanwise direction provide qualitative information about the phase coherence of the vortical impingement along the airfoil span. Parametric studies are performed to evaluate the effect on the acoustic prediction of the position of the integration surface and the numerical discretization methods employed. The vortex release-impinging mechanism revealed to be the main cause of the noise emission. Beamforming visualizations confirmed the major contribution of the airfoil to the total noise radiation. All the calculated acoustic spectra exhibit a main peak corresponding to the rod- shedding frequency. The high frequency components are the most affected by numerical and experimental noise. If the analysis is focused on the tonal peak of the computed spectra the method reveals an accuracy within 10 % of the measured SPL, varying with the spanwise correlation length. This provides good prospects for developments of experimental PIV-based aeroacoustic investigations.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","","","","",""

(mentor)","2008","Ever since the 1950s delta wings are being used as an efficient planform for supersonic flight. Over time extensive research on the aerodynamics of this type of wings has been performed using many different measurement techniques. Due to technical difficulties, measurements on delta wings in a supersonic flow are still scarce and often limited to qualitative data only. The addition of PIV as a diagnostic tool in aerodynamics opened doors for new measurements. Nowadays PIV is a well-established non-intrusive measurement method that is being applied in large scale subsonic industrial facilities on a regular basis and in research facilities in all flow regimes. Stereoscopic PIV measurements on delta wings are done previously in sub- and transonic flow, and one 2C-PIV experiment has been done on a delta wing in supersonic flow at moderate angle of attack. The motivation of the current investigation is to perform stereo-PIV measurements around a sharp-edged delta wing in a supersonic flow at high angle of attack using the latest advances in PIV. Furthermore an extension is made to a similar setup in the industrial facility of DNW-SST on the EUROSUP model. The flow around a delta wing is succesfully described at different Mach numbers and for several angles of attack. A spanwise scan using individual measurement planes in streamwise orientation has been made, which are combined to construct a mean flow field in the complete volume. The response of the tracer particles is measured by an oblique shock test, from which the slip velocity with respect to the flow and the drift from the flow path, due to their inertia, is determined. Schlieren, shadowgraphy and oil flow visualisation are applied to give additional information on the flow. Several flow features have been measured by PIV. As expected a vortex is present on the leeward surface of the wing. Due to the large deflection of the flow on the windward surface, a detached shock is present before the leading edge extending to the expansion side of the wing. Attached to the vortex an inboard shock wave has been measured. Furthermore the flow field appeared to be conical, i.e. the flow variables are constant on rays emerging from the apex. A similar stereo-PIV setup has been succesfully applied in the industrial supersonic facility SST at DNW using a high-repetition acquisition system including a model sliding mechanism to increase data production. However, due to the large size of the seeding particles in this campaign, the data generated in this tunnel remains questionable, and a thorough investigation on the seeding production is necessary to acquire reliable PIV data in this facility.","deltawing; delta wing; supersonic; PIV; stereoscopic","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Aerodynamics","","","",""

Three main influences were considered: the tide, wind waves and biological stabilization/destabilization. The study was performed by means of computational modelling, within the process-based model, Delft3D. By modelling several different scenarios, the separate influences of the tide, wind waves and biology were investigated. The results showed that the tidal asymmetry, entering the basin from the sea, was the main contributor to the import of fine sediments. In general, the tide promoted a large import towards the intertidal areas below the MSL line, and only a very small import towards higher elevations, due to the limited transport capacity of the tidal currents in these areas. Waves were the main contributor to the export-flux of fine sediments by the model, by increasing the bed shear stress in the intertidal areas and causing a relatively larger distribution of sediment towards the deeper areas. Waves were also the main contributor to the high suspended sediment concentrations inside the modelled basin, causing a substantial increase in the basin-average SPM concentrations. In case of a combined influence of waves and biology, particularly the interaction between the seasonal variations appeared to be of importance, which further enhanced the export flux from the modelled basin during late autumn and early winter. With respect to the distribution of sediment, the biological influences caused a landward shift in the deposition and the sediment was distributed much more evenly than if no biological effects were included in the model.","biogeomophology; tidal basins; wadden sea","en","master thesis","TU Delft, Civil Engineering and Geosciences, Hydraulic Engineering","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","","","","",""

(mentor)","2008","GPS-transmitted waves are affected by the Earth's atmosphere resulting in a decrease of the measured position accuracy. The highest region of the atmosphere, known as the ionosphere, is the main cause of this accuracy degradation. Due to the dispersive nature of the ionosphere for GPS-signals, the induced delay can be measured or eliminated if a dual-receiver is used. (By constructing the Geometry/Ionosphere-free Linear Combination, respectively). If a single-frequency receiver is used instead, one is obliged to account for the ionospheric delay in other ways. In this thesis is investigated how Global Ionospheric Maps (GIMs) can be used to correct for the ionospheric delay. Because these GIMs provide vertical ionospheric delays on given gridpoints and at discrete time-epochs, several processing steps have to be carried out: a spatial- and temporal-interpolation has to be performed to obtain an ionospheric delay estimate at the desired location and time and, subsequently, a mapping function has to be applied to transform the (interpolated) vertical value into the desired slant value. The objective of this research is to investigate the contribution of these processing steps to be able to develop an optimised procedure in using GIMs.With a stochastic analysis, in which GIM-based ionospheric delay estimates are compared with real measured ionospheric delays, a best-suited procedure in using GIMs is found. This optimised procedure is finally implemented into a single-frequency Precise Point Positioning (PPP) concept. Static observations reveal a position accuracy at the three-decimetre level horizontally and at the five-decimetre level vertically, for the European region.","global ionospheric maps (gims); gps; ionosphere; precise point positioning (ppp); positioning","en","master thesis","TU Delft, Aerospace Engineering, Mathematical Geodesy and Positioning","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","","","","",""

Two characteristics that made these thin shells very popular are the strength, and the architectural exciting forms. After this golden era the construction of these thin concrete shells has stagnated. Reasons for this stagnation could be found in the difficulties that had to be encountered in the realization of these structures. One of the attempts to make shells more often build is with the prefabrication of the shell. But not many free form shell structures in prefabricated concrete have been build. One of the reasons for this is that the design and production process of free formed shells in prefabricated concrete is not efficient enough to make the construction of these shells feasible in most cases.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Design and Construction","","","",""

(mentor); Goossens, K. (mentor)","2008","Due to recent progress in semiconductor technology, communication is becoming the major source of expense in today's chip design. Network-on-Chip (NoC) is a new paradigm for solving the problem of complex communication on the chips. However, in order to NoC to be ecient in providing complex on-chip communication, the designers should be assured about its correct functionality. For this reason, an ecient test method should be developed for testing the NoC. In order to test the NoC in an ecient way, the test method should be in a way that does not degrade the performance of the NoC (with online test). Moreover it should test the NoC with a high fault coverage (structural test). In this thesis, a new platform is proposed to do online-structural test on NoC. Although NoC's elements has been tested after manufacturing and before being used in a SoC, but when NoC is being used, after some time there is possibility that some errors occur in the elements (e.g. router) of NoC and ruin their functionality. The proposed platform, helps the system developers with online detection and localization of the errors that may occur in routers. Therefore, it increases NoC's reliability. In this platform, the idle routers of NoC are being tested while the rest of the routers are providing on-chip communication. For testing the router the standard test architecture for testing embedded cores (Test-Access-Mechanism (TAM), wrapper, source and sink)is used. In this architecture it is assumed that source and sink are given. The main contribution of this project is to design the wrapper element in such a way that it can be used in the proposed online-structural test platform and reuse NoC as TAM. The limitation of the proposed method is that the number of routers that can be tested at the same time without interrupting NoC's normal functionality depends on topology and size of the NoC. The major cost of this test methods, is related to the wrapper architecture.","network-on-chip testing; router test; online test; structural test","en","master thesis","TU Delft, Electrical Engineering, Mathematics, Computer Sci, Computer Engineering","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","","","","",""

Much research has been done on the subject of increasing the performance of grids. We believe that an adequate performance analysis of grids requires knowledge of the workload and the architecture of the grid. Currently, researchers assume that grids are similar to other distributed systems, such as massively parallel computers. However, workloads in grids differ from other distributed systems, because they consist for a significant part of bags-of-tasks. This research presents a method to model the workload of grids realistically, which enables us to analyze the performance of those systems. We have created a flexible workload model that is specifically tailed for grids. The model explicitly handles bag-of-tasks, which comprise the majority of grid workloads. This workload model has been built using a vast amount of workload trace data from seven real-world grids. The workload model enables us to conduct a performance analysis in which we analyze the impact of several workload characteristics, task selection and scheduling policies, and resource management architectures on system performance. We use simulations to systematically and realistically investigate the system performance in various scenarios. This research has resulted in a grid performance analysis toolbox, a software package that allows researchers to analyze, model, and generate workloads of grids. In addition, we have contributed trace data and analysis to the community by means of the Grid Workloads Archive, an on-line archive of trace data analyzed with our toolbox.","grid computing; scheduling; bags of tasks; traces; workload model","en","master thesis","TU Delft, Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science, Computer Science","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","","","","",""

Due to this renewed interest, this thesis investigates several hypersonic ramjet engine concepts using supersonic combustion to determine which concept is more viable of becoming the next-generation propulsion system. The investigation of hypersonic ramjets is done by identifying two kinds of supersonic combustion methods for ramjet engine concepts, which are diffusion combustion and pre-mixed combustion. From these two combustion types four di_erent ramjet concepts are investigated: the scramjet, the dual-mode combustor, the shock-induced combustion ramjet (shcramjet), and the oblique detonation wave engine (ODWE). To analyse their overall performance, di_usion combustion is modelled as a constant-pressure heat addition process (Brayton model), and pre-mixed combustion (associated with shock-induced combustion) is modelled as a constant-volume heat addition process (Humphrey model). Detonations, however, are modelled as a discontinuity wave where across heat addition occurs (Fickett-Jacob model). The analysis comprises of an ideal thermodynamic efficiency determination and an one-, or quasi-one-dimensional analytic performance analysis with freestream Mach numbers up to 20. The analysis investigates three combustion performance charachteristics; the total pressure loss, the entropy increase, and the speci_c impulse. The results show that detonation waves have the highest ideal thermodynamic effciency, followed by constant-volume heat addition and then constant-pressure heat addition. The analytical performance analysis however shows that detonation waves have the lowest overall performance and constant-volume heat addition the highest overall performance. This contradiction is explained due to the fact of irreversible entropy generation, coinciding with total pressure losses, being higher for detonation waves than for the other two heat addition models. The detonation wave thus remains a theoretical limit of the shock-induced combustion wave. A proof-of-concept test setup pre-design is then suggested to demonstrate the feasibility of shock-induced combustion as a next-generation propulsion system.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our experiments show that the Kettingzaag algorithm performs well for network sizes up to a hundred nodes, and is likely to perform just as well for larger network sizes.","live p2p; video streaming; chainsaw swarm","en","master thesis","TU Delft, Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science, Computer Science","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","","","","",""

(mentor); Sourdis, I. (mentor)","2008","Network Security is a significant issue nowadays. The information flow is enormous and the attacks have been substantially evolved.Every single packet of the flow must be scanned in deep and checked with all known attack rules (Deep Packet Inspection) to determine whether it is malicious. However, the task of Deep Packet Inspection requires a significant amount of processing, creating a bottleneck to the network. Packet Pre-filtering divides this task into two stages. The first stage (Pre-filtering stage) inspects the packet using a set of subrules and therefore needs less processing. This set is the result of preprocessing the initial rules where a smaller portion of every single rule is selected. In addition, this set of subrules must be efficient enough so that the least possible rules are needed to be processed in the second stage, achieving smaller implementation cost and/or smaller latency. This thesis proposes five techniques which accommodate Pre-filtering to meet these requirements. The three of them are the extraction techniques and create the set of subrules. Each subrule has a header and a part of the content (static pattern) or of the PCRE (type of regular expression). The extraction techniques are: the First Content Prefix which extracts the prefix of the first content of each rule, the PCRE Prefix which exploits the PCRE and extracts a prefix of it, and the Unique Part Rule which creates a set of unique subrules, extracting part of the content(s). Two more techniques have also been proposed. The Rule Correlation correlates the subrules (of the Pre-filtering stage) with similar characteristics to exclude them from the first stage of processing, achieving smaller latency. Secondly, Smart Rule Reuse optimizes the second stage of processing by exploiting the temporal locality of the activated rules between consecutive packets. All the techniques were evaluated using SNORT Network Intrusion Detection System and real attack traffic traces. The most efficient extraction technique is the Unique Part Rule (selected part length to 8 bytes), because only 2 rules on average are activated per packet while the maximum number of them, which indicates the required number of resources in the second stage, is approximately 64. The Rule Correlation achieves to correlate about 1700 rules out of the 9000 rules when used in combination with Unique Part Rule technique, achieving smaller latency or fewer resources in the first stage, while the Smart Rule Reuse uses rules activated by previous packets and hence avoids memory accesses so that the second stage of processing has lower latency.","pre-filtering; packet inspection; network intrusion detection system; network security","en","master thesis","TU Delft, Electrical Engineering, Mathematics, Computer Science, Computer Engineering","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","","","","",""

(mentor); Mhamdi, L. (mentor)","2008","High-performance routers constitute the basic building blocks of the Internet. The wide majority of today's high-performance routers are designed using a crossbar fabric switch as interconnect topology. The buffered crossbar (CICQ) switching architecture is known to be the best crossbar-based architecture for routers design. However, CICQs require expensive on-chip buffers whose cost grows quadratically with the router port count. Additionally, they use long wires to connect router inputs to outputs, resulting in non-negligible delays. In this thesis, we propose a novel design for the CICQ switch architecture. We design the whole buffered crossbar fabric as a Network on Chip (NoC). We propose two architectural variants. The first is named the Unidirectional NoC (UDN), where the crossbar core is built using a NoC with input and output ports placed on two opposite sides of the fabric chip. Because of the chip pins layout, we improved the UDN architecture using a Multidirectional NoC (MDN) architecture, by placing the inputs and output around the perimeter (four sides) of the NoC-based crossbar fabric. Both proposed architectures have been analyzed with appropriate routing algorithms for both unicast and multicast traffic conditions. Our results show that the proposed NoC based crossbar switching design outperforms the conventional CICQ architecture. Our designs offers several advantages when compared to traditional CICQ design: 1) Speedup, because short wires allow reliable high-speed signalling, and simple local arbitration per on-chip router. 2) Load balancing, because paths from different input-output port pairs share the same router buffers. 3) Path diversity allows traffic from an input port to follow different paths to its destination output port. 4) Simpler switch design by allowing simple input memory structure such as first-in first-out (FIFO) input queueing, as opposed to traditional design where virtual output queueing (VOQ) is required.","buffered crossbar; network on chip; switch; high performance router","en","master thesis","TU Delft, Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science, Computer Engineering","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","","","","",""

(mentor); Pasterkamp, S. (mentor); Hoogenboom, P.C.J. (mentor)","2008","Biomimetica is de wetenschap waarin elementen uit de natuur worden nagebootst met het doel menselijke problemen op te lossen. Evolutionaire ontwikkelingen hebben eraan bijgedragen dat de natuur bestaat uit voornamelijk geoptimaliseerde vormen, structuren en processen. In dit afstudeeronderzoek is biomimicry aangegrepen om tot het ontwerp voor een vloedbestendige woning te komen. In de eerste fase van dit onderzoek zijn de gedragingen van verschillende elementen in de natuur bij (dreigend) hoogwater vastgesteld. Vervolgens is geanalyseerd of deze natuurlijke gedragingen een interessante bijdrage kunnen leveren aan het ontwerp van een vloedbestendige woning. Eén van de elementen uit de natuur die interesse heeft opgewekt is het bananenblad. Deze wordt belast door luchtstroming in plaats van door waterstroming en is aangepast aan deze situatie.De structuur van het bananenblad is zodanig dat deze inscheurt bij hoge windsnelheden. Het belaste oppervlak wordt hierdoor verkleind, zodat de totale belasting op het blad afneemt. De kans dat de plant de storm overleeft wordt groter doordat vitale onderdelen als de stengel minder snel zullen beschadigen. Geanalyseerd is hoe dit concept vertaald kan worden naar een in de woningbouw toe te passen concept. Door de oppervlakte van een gevel te verkleinen zullen de totaalkrachten op de constructie afnemen. Een bijkomend voordeel is de lagere stromingsweerstand van de woning bij afnemende eveloppervlaktes. Dit is een voorwaarde om in bepaalde gebieden te mogen bouwen, bijvoorbeeld in de uiterwaarden van rivieren. Om de bruikbaarheid van een dergelijk concept aan te tonen is in de laatste fase van het afstudeeronderzoek een praktische toepassing gepresenteerd in de vorm van een ontwerpcase. Het resultaat is een ontwerp voor een vrijstaande woning in de uiterwaard van de Nederrijn bij Arnhem. De ontworpen woning beschikt op de begane grond verdieping over lichtgewicht gevels die omhoog kunnen worden geschoven in geval van dreigende hoge waterstanden. Hierdoor transformeert de woning in een paalwoning. De rivier zal bij hoogwater de onderste verdieping benutten voor de doorstroming van het water, iets waar bij de indeling van de woning rekening mee moet worden gehouden. De voornaamste functies van de verdieping zijn het bieden van parkeergelegenheid en opslagruimte.","","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Design and Construction","","","",""

The breaker bars in front of the Holland coast show a seaward movement, starting small at the waterline, growing during their seaward motion and dying out at deeper water. A typical profile in front of the Holland coast has 3 breaker bars present. This pattern repeats itself with a certain cycle time. Research on seven different locations along the Holland coast has indicated different cycle times in different transect along the Holland coast. In these locations a relation between the yearly volume changes of the sediment volume of the Holland coast and the calculated cycle time of the breaker bars is sought. This is done by comparing the cycle time of the breaker bars to the year to year fluctuations of the volume. This research has shown that the seaward motion of the breaker bars have very little influence on the fluctuations of the volume. This means that other processes that cause sediment movement are more dominant. The difference in calculated cycle times indicates that a single breaker bar can move with different speeds, this causes the bar to create a growing angle with the shore. Analysis of yearly measurement have shown that bars can make a so-called barswitch to solve this.","breaker bar; barswitch; holland; jarkus; coast","en","master thesis","TU Delft, Civil Engineering and Geosciences, Hydraulic Engineering","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""
