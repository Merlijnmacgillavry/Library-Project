(mentor); Sloff, C.J. (mentor); Mueller, E. (mentor); Vargas Luna, A. (mentor)","2017","The Colorado River with a total length of 2330 km is located in the Southwest of North America, originating from the Rocky Mountains and flowing into the Gulf of California. In 1963 the Glen Canyon Dam was built to generate hydropower. The construction of the dam caused several significant changes in the river system. One of these changes is the expansion of the riparian vegetation. Because of its magnitude and importance as a natural water carrier, the Colorado River has been studied extensively for decades. One can argue that the sandbars in the Colorado River are well mapped and its dynamics are well understood. Additionally, the species of riparian vegetation, the location of growth as well as the dimension of vegetation changes are extensively mapped. However, the influence of the aforementioned riparian vegetation expansion on the sandbar dynamics is poorly understood. It is crucial to shed light on this correlation as the dynamics of the system indicate the course of action and determine the possible activities in the area. The main research objective is to gain better understanding on the correlation between vegetation expansion and sandbar dynamics. Two different methods are used to explain the phenomenon; an analysis of data concerning vegetation and geo-morphology is performed and also a detailed hydraulic and geo-morphodynamic model is created. Seven locations in the Colorado River are selected for the data analysis in the period between 2002 and 2013. Of each location different features are visualized and linked including the geo-morphology of the sandbar and the adjacent channel, the geometry and hydraulics of the channel and finally the vegetation coverage on the sandbars. As a result of this data analysis a clear relation was found between flood cycles and changes in sandbar volume. Moreover, a clear relation between change in sandbar volume and changes in vegetation coverage was observed. Lastly, a clear relation between the location of vegetation and the bed level changes was found. Finally, several methods in order to improve the analytical results are mentioned. The sandbar selected for modelling purposes is a reattachment bar in the Colorado River, overgrown with a significant amount of vegetation which has expanded remarkably over the years. The flow module of the DELFT3D suite is used. The Baptist model assumptions are used for the representation of vegetation. The parameters determined in the Baptist model are derived from field measurements on arrowweed. The flow features that are affected by the expansion of the riparian vegetation are, among others, the characteristic of the primary and secondary eddy, the deflection on the main stream, the location on the reattachment point and the velocity of the flow in the vegetated areas. Inarguably, the above mentioned changes heavily alter the geomorphology of the system. These changes in geomorphology, on its turn, are likely to influence vegetation succession and even the hydraulics. This lastly mentioned feedback, however, has not been thoroughly investigated in this research. Finally, several methods in order to improve the satisfying flow pattern and in order to reduce the discrepancy of the bed level changes are mentioned. Overall it can be stated that vegetation certainly contributes to the stability of sandbars and that it clearly contributes to their growth. Hydraulic forces, which are strongly related to the width of the channel, determine the magnitude of sediment transport fluxes. Sandbars which develop in narrow channels stay low in elevation and are dynamic; this generally obstructs the natural succession of vegetation. Sandbars which develop in wide channels become high in elevation and become stable; this promotes vegetation growth. If vegetation expands on low, dynamic parts of the sandbars the growth of vegetation is likely to promote stabilization and vertical accretion, creating a feedback towards a higher elevation and more stable sandbar. When this occurs the expected long term result is a river system with a significant part of the sandbars becoming high in elevation, less dynamic and vegetated. However continued monitoring of the system is necessary to determine what the exact vegetation extent over time will be. The iconic feature of the Colorado River during the pre-flood period, namely the open dynamic sandbar system, is currently replaced by a more vegetated river system with less open sand. On the one hand, vegetation provides riparian habitat for a variety of species. At the same time it decreases the open sand area available for recreational activities. The final decision upon the fate of vegetation should be taken after weighting the relative importance between scenarios and future planning. A suggestion to improve the overall study is to take into account other aspects that determine the ability of vegetation to expand such as the availability of groundwater, the daily exposure to sunlight, the fertility of the soil and the activity of the local species. If the effect of these parameters gets integrated in the interdependency between sandbar and vegetation dynamics then the result will give a solid picture of the natural system and the current beneficial results of this research will be further strengthened.","Sandbars; Colorado River; Riparian vegetation; Eddies; Numerical modelling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","","35.19830, -111.65130"

(mentor)","2017","The glass group of the TU Delft plans to realize a 14m span glass arched masonry bridge, yet no prescriptions are available on how to assess the structural safety of such a structure. Regulations and guidelines for structural glass relate to ﬂoat glass elements and do not refer to structures of cast glass elements. In addition, to display the aesthetic glass masonry structure, the arch directly serves as deck limiting the slope of the arch. Therefore its rise is relatively low compared to traditional stone masonry structures. It is unknown how this will aﬀect the stability. In this report the stability and strength of arched glass masonry bridges is investigated. In addition TU Delft’s design is elaborated upon in more detail. In order to establish which aspects are important when designing in glass, references of both glass bridges as well as glass brick structures are discussed. Subsequently a theoretical background is formed for both arched masonry, as well as for structural glass. In analytical investigations, the eﬀect of the geometry on the stability is assessed. Both an analytical as well as a numerical analysis of the stability have been executed for the boundary conditions of TU Delft’s design. Resilient interlayers may be applied to limit the tensile stresses introduced by imperfect conditions, i.e. an imperfect surface ﬂatness of the glass and a discontinuous stress distribution due to an eccentric line of thrust. These imperfect condition were analytically respectively numerically investigated, in order to enable the formulation of a maximum interlayer-stiﬀness. This maximum interlayer stiﬀness will assure that the maximum tensile stress remains suﬃciently low. This was followed by an experimental assessment of three interlayer materials in four thicknesses, to establish their suitability for application as interlayer in TU Delft’s design. Finally, the failure behavior with respect to the strength was established, resulting from experimental research in which a 1m span glass arch was loaded. Several design diagrams were composed that can be used to deﬁne the geometry of a circular segmented arch, taking into account the stability of the structure. A glass element in the arch is loaded in compression, but will only fail if too high tensile stresses are introduced as a result of imperfect conditions. If suﬃciently large, the eccentricity of the line of thrust will cause tensile stresses. An imperfect glass surface may also introduce tensile stresses. An interlayer may be used to resolve these problems, if its stiﬀness is not too large. If fracture in a glass brick occurs, this will likely not lead to global failure, which means that the failure behavior of an arched glass masonry bridge is ductile. The stability of TU Delft’s glass masonry bridge is suﬃcient under the expected support settlements, as well as under an asymmetrical crowd load scenario. The load scenario concerning a service vehicle, signiﬁcantly reduces the stability. It is therefore recommended to prevent entrance for service vehicles. Resilient interlayers with a stiﬀness between 3 3 26N/mm and 40N/mm should be applied between the bricks to assure adequate stress transfer, without compromising the stability. From the experimental research it followed that a 1mm-PVC or a 4mm-PU70 interlayer will be suitable. The design is deemed feasible, but before construction additional investigations on the time and temperature-dependent behavior of the interlayer should be executed. Additionally the strength of the full scale bricks must be assessed, too guarantee it is suﬃcient to resist the design loads.","Glass; Cast glass; Arched Masonry; Interlayer","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","","",""

As shown already in the 1990s, GPS is a promising measurement device to form a dense network for meteorology observation. Because of economic reasons, a network of dual frequency GPS receivers is densified using low-cost single frequency GPS receivers. In this thesis and the complementary thesis written by E.M.J. Stierman (2016), respectively, the quality of the Tropospheric Zenith delay and the Precipiatble Water Vapour recordings that are estimated using the single frequency receivers in the network are investigated. To do this, two networks of small (<10km) spacing and large (30-90 km) spacing have been set-up. After this, a L2- and C2-measurement is generated for the single frequency receivers, using epoch-differenced ionospheric delay for L2 and regular ionospheric delay for the C2 measurement together with the L1 and C1 observations of the single frequencyreceiver. This is done to be able to use web-based PPP processing software of NRCan, that estimates the ZTD for dual frequency data. The single frequency GPS show a ZTD that is much more variable in time than the ZTD found by dual frequency measurements. Secondly, the standard deviation to which the single frequency measurements converge is about 5 cm. It takes about half a day to obtain this precision. For comparison; the dual frequency receivers obtain a standard deviation well below 1 cm in less than 2.5 hours. The results show this processing method for single frequency receivers is not good enough to obtain an accurate and precise measurement of the ZTD. Further research could be done on taking the correlation between the made observation and generated observations into account, using other processing methods, for instance double differences, or improving this processing method.","precipitable water vapour; GPS; single frequency receiver","en","student report","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience and Remote Sensing","","","","0.3138386,32.5290842"

Magnet.me is a company which recommends companies and opportunities to students. Potential algorithms for recommendation systems are memory-based and model-based coll aborative filtering, graph- based approaches, support vector machines, rand om forest classifiers and w ide & deep learning. Based on a qualitative comparison of the algorithms, model-based collaborative filtering, which is what Magnet.me currently uses as well, was chosen to be the best fit. This is because it scored highly on the three most important factors for Magnet.me: potential performance, compatibility with the dataset and scalability. When comparing several well-known benchmarking metrics, the most suitable metric for testing the performance of the recomme nder was the F1 measure. To benchmark the model, the connection status of user-company relations should be used as the label, but must be excluded in the calculation of the implicit ratings. Logarithmically scaling the view counts before used as a factor in the implicit ratings has proven to be of negligible effect. Five other signals are found that could be used to improve the recommendations. Hyperparameter optimization with cross validation is implemented and has succesfully been deployed into the Magnet.me technology stack. The possibilities for a clustering algorithm are considered in order to solve the cold start problem, but we could not determine the numeric distances between features, which is required for training an accurate clustering algorithm. An unexpected challenge of this project was setting up the development infrastructure. It consisted on setting up an Elasticsearch cluster and a Spark cluster that can interact with each other on Google Cloud services. Another challenge was in benchmarking the recommender with proper metrics.","","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Intelligent Systems","","Computer Science","",""

This research gives a better insight in the precipitable water vapour in the atmosphere above Uganda. Besides weather prediction the results of this report could be used for climate studies in Africa. Together with the research of A.M.

This study was done during the months September and October of year 2016 in the surroundings of Kampala. To obtain the precipitable water vapour, 3 measurement rounds were done. All three networks were spanned by 3 dual frequency GPS receivers densified with at least 5 single frequency GPS receivers. The ionospheric delays measured with the dual frequency receivers were interpolated to the single frequency GPS receivers so these were transformed into dual frequency receivers as well. Thereafter, the RINEX files were uploaded on the PPP NRCan application where the zenith tropospheric delay was determined. Using the constant of proportionality found by Bevis 1994 together with Saastamoinen’s model to determine the zenith hydrostatic delay, the precipitable water vapour was found.","Preciptable water vapour estimation; Uganda; GPS; Single frequency; Dual frequency; TAHMO","en","student report","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience and Remote Sensing","","TAHMO","","1.0779357,30.9878067"

(mentor); Talmon, A.M. (mentor); Van Rhee, C. (mentor)","2017","Damen Dredging Equipment (DDE) has a quest to make their cutter suction dredger (CSD) and their DOP pump operable by everyone for every slurry type at the correct working point every time. To complete this quest, first a process status evaluating tool has to be developed which replaces the visual wear inspection. This thesis is the first step in developing this tool, its research question hence is ""How can the pump process status be evaluated pumping water?"" To answer this question, first a literature study about a centrifugal pumpis done (chapter 1) to understand the working principle of a centrifugal dredge pump. Next, the wear locations in a centrifugal dredge pump are going to be examined (chapter 3) after a small wear definition introduction (chapter 2). From the wear locations found, the ones that are expected to have the most influence on the pump performance (head H and efficiency ´) are further researched in this thesis. These locations are: the axial gap and the inner impeller diameter. For the axial gap, data was already available due to previous research at DDE [1]. The data for the influence of the inner impeller diameter change is created by own experiments on the sediment transport circuit at DDE, these experiments are explained in chapter 5. Also another conditionmonitoring option (not only the influence of the pump parameters) is researched after different possibilities were investigated (chapter 4). This method is the vibration analysis of the pump and is used to see whether or not the influence of wear on the pump can bemonitored. This wear is created by pumping a slurry (sand-water) mixture through the sediment transport circuit while using casted steel for the impeller and wear plate (it would take a lot of time to create wear on the original nihard impeller and wear plate). The data for the axial gap, inner impeller diameter and vibrational analysis is explained in chapter 6. The research question can be answered in two parts: the influence on the pump parameters and the vibration analysis of the pump. The data analysis of the influence of the axial gap on the pump parameters (section 6.1) shows that it is possible to indicate whether the axial gap is small or large (2mm vs 11mm) by using a trialand- error method proposed in this study. The data analysis of the inner impeller diameter (section 6.2) shows two methods to calculate the inner diameter increase from the data obtained during the own experiments. Both methods are based on the change of the velocity triangles resulting in an extended version of the pump affinity law for head. The NPSH could not be measured decent, so no model is obtained for this. The last part to answer the research question is the vibrational analysis (in radial, axial and tangential direction). The BEP point can be found using the vibrational analysis (lower vibration level). Also cavitation in the pump is detected by the vibrational analysis (high scattering of vibrational data points). A last thing that can be seen is when the pump operates left from the BEP, the axial vibration level increases a lot. All the findings in chapter 6 should be tested for not only the DOP250, but for a various range of pumps and settings. This to conclude if the findings are applicable for every pump, or only for the DOP250 in setting used in the sediment transport circuit.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-01-31","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Offshore & dredging engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2017","Defects are produced when lifting lugs being welded on ship sections during the building process. The large amount of heat produced in the welding work causes “heat affected zone” in the base metal on sections and destroys painted coatings on the plates; and residual stress decreases the mechanical performance of the steel plates. To eliminate the defects, it is hypothesized that “structural adhesive bonding” can replace welding for installing lifting lugs to some extent. An investigation of the application of adhesively bonded lifting lugs in ship building is processed to give methods for the application and check the feasibility of replacing welded lifting lugs with adhesively bonded lifting lugs. In the research, a serious of rules for adhesively bonded lifting lugs is adapted from rules for welded lifting lugs; “structural adhesives”, “adhesive bonding joints”, “the shape and geometry of lifting lugs” and “positions for installation” are investigated. Then adhesively bonded lifting lugs are designed based on the adapted rules; and then improved after the evaluation by FEM simulation. The results show that adhesively bonded lifting lugs can replace welding lifting lugs with high probability when the capacity is less than 20ton; when the capacity is between 20ton and 30ton, limitations such as “not enough bonding area” and “no positions for installation” constrain the replacement. When the capacity of a lifting lug is above 30ton, adhesively bonded lifting lugs cannot replace welded lifting lugs.","ship building; lifting lugs; structural adhesive; adhesive bonding","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Marine and Transport Technology","","","",""

(mentor); Dankelman, J. (mentor)","2017","DNA can function as a significant part of evidence in forensic investigation, because it can link a potential perpetrator to a crime. Even by skin contact, micro-traces of DNA-containing material can be transferred. This type of DNA is called ‘trace DNA’. When DNA is collected from an evidentiary item for forensic purposes, the goal is to collect as much as possible of the targeted DNA and as least as possible of other traces. The focus of this research is the collection of trace DNA from textiles. In the Netherlands Forensic Institute (NFI) this is mostly done by tape-lifting: using double-sided tape stuck to a stub, which is called ‘stubbing’. This method is used for about 10 years now at the NFI. However, the evolution of stubbing for DNA collection has mainly been empirically driven and no studies are done to improve its technique, even though this would be very useful when miniscule amounts of DNA are searched. The stubbing force (the normal force applied on the stub while stubbing) is assumed to influence the trace collection efficiency when stubbing, because a higher stubbing force results in a larger actual contact area between the adhesive tape and the textile, by which traces on the textile can adhere to the tape. Though, the stubbing force is manually applied in the current stubbing procedure by which it cannot be accurately controlled. Thereby, this possibly leads to a difference in the quality of resulting samples among different forensic investigators. This research is focussed on how the stubbing force is related to the efficiency of the collection of micro-traces, and on how the collection efficiency differs for traces from different depths in the substrate structure. This latter issue is questioned, because if trace DNA from multiple DNA sources are present on an evidentiary item, which is often true, it is assumed that DNA-containing material of the last handler is present in more superficial layers of the substrate. In that case, it would be very useful to know how traces can be collected selectively from specific depths of the substrate to obtain samples with a higher ratio between the targeted DNA and other traces. In this research, microspheres were used as representation of trace DNA. These spheres are sized in the same order of magnitude as skin cells (25 μm), which are a possible component in trace DNA. Microparticles were applied to the substrates in a suspension of ethanol, to get a uniform distribution over different samples. Experiments were performed on multiple textile substrates: flat spools wrapped by three different types of polyester threads. Traces were collected by stubbing while using 5 different stubbing forces. The stub tapes, as well as the substrates (before and after sampling) were analysed by using the microscope. In MATLAB a script was designed to automatically count these particles using image recognition routines. Results gave insight in how stubbing force increased for the used materials. To define the trace collection efficiency from specific depths in the substrate structure, the designed method was too inaccurate. Though, the measured impression of the used textiles indicated that when stubbing with 1 N, the substrates were almost impressed to its maximum impression. This indicates that when stubbing with a stubbing force of 1 N particles are potentially not only collected from the most superficial layer in the substrates but also from deeper layers. Recommendations for future research are given in the discussion.","forensic; contact force; DNA; micro-traces; stubbing; textile; adhesive tape","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-01-31","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Biomechanical Engineering","","","",""

In fact, they are increasing in popularity. There are a variety of crowdfunding platforms for different needs, such as for entrepreneurs seeking investments for their projects. However, there is one thing all these platforms have in common. There is always a central point of trust, resulting in unneeded costs for the users of the platform. This thesis presents the development process of researching and implementing a decentral market where mortgages can be crowdfunded. We have created a system that does not have a central point of trust, while it still connects people that need funding with investors and financial institutions. An earlier bachelor project has already implemented a decentral marketplace to trade digital currencies. At first, the idea was to reuse their implementation. However, after researching we came to the conclusion that their implementation was no use to our mortgage market. As their marketplace is specifically designed for trading digital currencies, we developed our own market. To ensure some level of trust into our market, we used a blockchain to save the agreements that are made between the users. The blockchain ensures that the agreements made cannot be changed. Therefore, when an agreement is added to the blockchain, the agreement is final. Our final product is a working prototype of a decentral mortgage market, which enables people that need funding to place mortgage and loan requests, receive mortgage offers and investment offers from financial institutions and investors. Financial institutions are able to receive mortgage requests and provide mortgages. Investors are able to search for investment opportunities, view campaigns that need funding and invest in these campaigns. The application can be run headless or using a graphical user interface, making it accessible for different types of users. It exposes a public API so third-parties can integrate it into their application. This is all possible without the risk of the mortgage market platform being shut down.","","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Software Technology","","","",""

(mentor); Frouws, J.W. (mentor); van der Bles, A.A. (mentor)","2017","Multipurpose vessels have the ability to carry multiple types of cargo. The larger quantities of cargoes are often transported by larger (more specialized) vessels such as bulk carriers and dedicated container vessels, but there are often a lot of small quantities of cargo that are too small for this type of vessels. That is where the multipurpose vessels come in: vessels that are capable of carrying multiple smaller quantities of cargo at the same time, one of the reasons that multipurpose vessels are generally smaller than other cargo vessels. The existing fleet of multipurpose vessels shows a large variety in terms of size and design aspects due to the diversity in cargoes to transport, ports to visit and contract types. Design aspects like a limited draught or a strengthened bottom for loading aground. Different design aspects are clearly chosen from the market to serve and not from a design point of view in terms of optimal design, each having their impact on the voyage profile of a vessels and as such on the economic performance of a vessel, so in order to evaluate multipurpose vessels the impact of these design aspects on the profit have to be determined. With different strategic decisions and a versatile and uncertain voyage profile determining one roundtrip upfront may not be sufficient when evaluating multipurpose vessels. Shipowners differentiate themselves by finding and operating in (profitable) niche markets. In this niche market the earning capacity of a vessel is believed to increase, for which specific design aspects are required to operate in this niche market. Shipowners tend to base their decisions on fragile parameters like market sentiment and experience, so trying to predict what will happen for a period of multiple years and as such determine a shipowner’s sailing profile is not sufficient. However by looking at required design aspects for certain niche markets and the design criteria which are stated by a shipowner, different decisions that result in these criteria can be identified. To determine the profitability of certain investments, the revenue is taken into account. Forecasting freight rates is a delicate issue and for periods of over ten years nothing is certain. Also the understanding that data is not available in such detail that specific markets (thus on micro level) can be modelled suggests that a scenario based model is more suited than trying to predict freight rates in detail. The model should be able to evaluate a vessel operating in a niche market for a certain period of time in combination with a certain period of time in the general spot market. The simulation model is based on different scenarios of sailing profiles to evaluate the risk of a certain investment. This evaluation is done by comparing the new concept design to existing reference vessels to benchmark a specific design. Instead of determining one roundtrip upfront, the time in different trades is decisive in the determination of the economic performance of a vessel and its risk in obtaining this performance. In this way the impact of market uncertainty on the economic performance of a vessel is illustrated. In this way it gives an idea when certain investment will be profitable and what the chances are that they are not: working together by the shipdesigner and the shipowner may definitely lead to a ‘better’ design economically spoken by combining both fields of expertise.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-01-31","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Marine and Transport Technology","","Track - Ship Design Production and Operation; Specialization: Ship Design","SDPO.17.003.m",""

(mentor)","2017","Bioreactors are used nowadays to produce proteins with therapeutical effect that can treat a new range of diseases in humans. Unfortunately, measuring protein concentrations directly inside bioreactors in real time is still an unsolved challenge. This is due the large amount of compounds that can be found inside the bioreactors that interfere with traditional protein quantification techniques. With this, quantifying protein is still highly desired because it would allow more efficient control of the cell cultures and better awareness on the development of the bioprocesses inside bioreactors. A probe system that combines ultraviolet absorption spectroscopy technology with a passive mechanical sieve system is designed and built in this project in order to measure protein concentrations directly inside bioreactors in real time. To fabricate the designed probe, Silicon MEMS fabrication techniques were used in order to reproduce the designed micron-sized structures with precision and reproducibility. Also, using silicon technologies would allow easier design upgrading, different technologies integration and production cost efficiency. The designed and built system showed in preliminary experiments the capability to quantify different protein concentration levels by creating a calibration curve although the obtained signal was low. Consequently, more signal fluctuations caused by noise was present and less accurate signal readings were obtained. Further improvements are required in order to increase the signal levels which would provide more accurate and reliable quantifications. On the filtration aspect, the system showed to successfully block all particles, such as cells, from entering the optical chamber avoiding signal interference in the short term. Further experimentations are required to assess the long-term performance of the filtration system. With this, the development of this project allowed to proof the concept of using a combined system of ultraviolet absorption spectroscopy and mechanical sieves that could enable measuring protein concentration directly inside bioreactors in real time. Consequently, further design and development iterations are required in order to improve technically the system that allow higher signal levels with more accurate quantifications. Also, further experimental tests are required to assess the long term performance of the filtration system.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-01-31","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics","","Electronic Instrumentation","",""

(mentor); Van der Wouw, N. (mentor)","2017","Managed Pressure Drilling (MPD) is a new drilling technique that originated from conventional drilling. This technique offers a solution to drill challenging wells and to increase drilling efficiency. It is a drilling process to precisely control the annular hydraulic pressure profile and to keep the bottomhole pressure (BHP) within its limits. Bottomhole measurements are not available, therefore, other methods have to be found to acquire bottomhole information in order to control the BHP. For these reasons, the objective of this thesis is to develop an automated control system that is able to estimate and control the BHP. This system should be able to deal with nonlinearities as well as unmeasured and varying parameters. In addition, it should only use surface measurements, since transmission of downhole measurements is either expensive or too slow. Furthermore, the system should be easy to use for the operators working on the rig site. In order to attain this objective, the MPD process, current control solutions and challenges were investigated during a literature study. Afterwards, during the research phase, a model of the well is developed and an additional validation model is designed. Furthermore, a case study is presented in order to evaluate the performance of the control system. Two estimators are designed based on the well model in order to estimate the BHP and other unmeasured parameters, namely an adaptive observer and an Extended Kalman-Bucy filter. Subsequently, the estimated BHP is used in the next phase to develop a controller. Two practical control solutions, a PI and LQR controller, are implemented on the MPD system. Finally, the performance of the MPD control system is evaluated using the developed validation model. This report concludes that the developed control system, suitable for operator usage, is able to control the BHP and secondly, that this can be done by using only surface measurements.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-01-31","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Delft Center for Systems and Control","","Systems & Control Engineering","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2017","Natural occurring arsenic contamination of shallow aquifer groundwater is a problem affecting millions of people worldwide. Long term exposure to high concentrations results in severe medical conditions. On-going research into the origin and spread of the problem, risk mitigation and problem solving is of great importance. Sediment eroded and transported from mountains adsorbs arsenic (As) from river water onto its iron oxyhydroxides coatings. The geomorphology of the river is related to the concentration of As in shallow aquifers. Helicoidal flow in a meandering river leads to erosion of the cut bank in the outer bend and accumulation of sediment at the point bar in the inner bend. The result is an asymmetrical depth profile. The process of meandering and avulsion sometimes leads to the complete abandonment of a part of the river’s channel. This still-standing water body is known as an oxbow lake. Fine sediment settles from suspension and the oxbow lake gradually fills up with silt and clay. A clay plug forms, surrounding the sands of the adjacent point bar. Clay filled oxbow lakes formed by meandering rivers are high in organic content and the anoxic conditions in the hypolimnion are considered the source for the release of the adsorbed arsenic. Under reducing conditions the As is released from its solid state by microbial respiration. In the geomorphological setting of meandering rivers, abandoned channels and point bar, this process of reductive dissolution is the generally accepted release mechanism for arsenic. This research aims to provide insight in the potential arsenic volume in Holocene clay plugs in Ganges River floodplains and to present ideas on the migration processes of arsenic from clay plug to adjacent point bar. Migration of dissolved As occurs by advection and by diffusion. Satellite data from Google Earth Pro was used to simulate clay plugs with a Matlab model. The simulated data was used for the calculations of the surface area of the clay plug, the volume of the clay plug, the potential volume of As and the contact area between the clay plug and adjacent point bar. These geometric properties and concentrations of As were used to apply Fick’s first law to estimate the initial diffusion flux and the initial discharge. The surface area of the twenty selected clay plugs vary from 10! to 10! m2. The corresponding volumes are in the order of magnitude of 10! to 10! m3. The calculated As volumes range within the orders of 10! to 10! kg. The initial diffusion flux was calculated and ranges approximately between 15-300 g/m2year. For the volume calculations the exact shape of the depth profile turned out to be of little influence. For calculations of the contact area and thus the diffusion flux estimations, the true profile is crucial. In-situ sampling would provide data to minimize uncertainties and improve results.","","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Earth Sciences","",""

The use of IGBTs in power converters has some disadvantages: they generate a lot of heat and are therefore not suitable for high-frequency operation. Developing power modules for electrical traction also has an other disadvantage: there is no standard electrification voltage. So for every customer a new converter has to be developed. These problems could be solved by using silicon carbide (SiC) based high voltage switches in a modular converter. The SiC switches enable high-frequency operation at high voltages and thus the reduction of the converter size. In a modular converter, multiple modules could be connected in series and/or parallel in such a way that the input voltage and output current is divided equally among the modules.

(mentor)","2017","With the growth of the air traffic movements and the population of people living around airports, the number of awakenings due to aircraft noise has increased. ICAO has defined four research fields to reduce noise and one of them is implementation of noise abatement operational procedures. This includes different trajectory optimization methods, one of which is rerouting of trajectories around noise sensitive areas. Research has proven that rerouting has a positive effect on reducing the number of people getting disturbed while keeping the fuel consumption as low as possible. Until now these trajectory optimization problems focused on either a departure or an arrival trajectory. When implementing these optimized routes, it may result in a conflict with other existing routes and this is the problem that is the main focus of this research. Within this research trajectories will be combined and optimized for number of awakenings and fuel consumption while assessing the effect of terminal operations. The model that combines trajectories is based on existing models, including a point-mass model and a noise model. These are combined in a multi-objective evolutionary algorithmwhere the objectives are the number of awakenings and the fuel consumption. The results of the optimization problems are presented as Paretooptimal solutions. To contribute to the field of noise abatement terminal operations, two trajectories are combined in an optimization problem. To assure enough distance between the two trajectories the minimum separation constraint is used. When a loss of separation happens, the flight path angle of one of the trajectories is adjusted. The designed model is used to optimize four trajectory optimization problems. The first being a departure trajectory, this is the current Spijkerboor standard instrumental departure that departs from runway 24 at Amsterdam Airport Schiphol. The second problem is the current night standard terminal arrival route starting at sea and landing on runway 18R at Schiphol. For the third optimization problem the two trajectories of the previous optimization problems are combined with keeping the minimumseparation constraint in mind. The final case study was used to focus more on the effect of the minimum separation constraint. From the departure optimization problem can be concluded that there is a big diversity in the vertical and horizontal trajectory between the minimum fuel andminimumawakening solution. For the arrival optimization problem the difference between these two solutions is not significant. The vertical trajectory is for both solutions almost the same, the main difference is caused by the ground trajectory. When combining the trajectories the results of the objective functions for the combined problemare the sum of the arrival and departure objective functions. This results in a bias to the departure trajectory because these numbers are atleast twice the value compared to the arrival trajectory. This also results in the arrival trajectory always being created around the departure trajectory. From the final case study can be concluded that when designing the trajectories the influence of the minimum separation constraint is mostly on the vertical profile of the departure trajectory. Also can be observed that small rerouting of the trajectories sometimes is needed to give both trajectories enough space to cross each other.","Trajectory optimization; Terminal operations; evolutionary algorithm","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Control & Operations","","Air Transport and Operations","",""

(mentor)","2017","In order to meet future energy demand, a more sustainable energy society is essential because fossil fuel reserves are depleting while the total energy consumption worldwide increases. One type of renewable energy which can play a role is ocean energy having the theoretical potential to exceed both current and future human energy needs. This study researches the feasibility of a hybrid system using two sources of ocean energy, namely offshore wind and wave energy. It is concluded that a single horizontal floating wind turbine sharing a foundation with a wave energy converter is most interesting to research. The main reason for this is that offshore wind energy is still limited to relative shallow depths and thus only limited locations are suitable. At further depths, floating foundations become more important. By sharing the mooring system, electrical infrastructure and other structure components with a wave energy converter, costs can be reduced while increasing energy yield in comparison to two separate systems. A classification of existing concepts within the same category is made. By comparing these different concepts based on platform motions and energy production, it is chosen to look into the combination of a WindFloat with a buoy point absorber. Motivation for this combination is the technical stage at which the WindFloat currently is. In addition, it has good overall stability and minimal heave motions which were found through numerical simulations in the time domain when comparing different floating wind turbines under similar wind and wave conditions using state of art software. Furthermore, a point absorber is used since minimal changes would be necessary to the WindFloat platform. In addition, the power take off system can be placed outside the water making contingent operation and maintenance easier to fulfill. The point absorber is modeled as a mass spring damper system with a power take off system relative to both a fixed and a floating platform. For both cases it is concluded that the relative heave oscillation between the WEC and platform should be maximized and thus the natural frequency of the system should match the peak frequency of the sea state. The steady state behavior of the hybrid system is investigated in eight sea states, which is modeled using the JONSWAP wave spectrum. Different buoy shapes are investigated which eventually leads to an optimal conical shaped buoy with a diameter of 5 meter. Hydrodynamic parameters of this buoy are found in literature and validated using state of art software. The power production of the WindFloat is found by introducing aerodynamic theory coupled to a wind wave relationship based on the Sverdrup-Munk-Bretschneider nomogram. Now that both response and power production of both subsystems are known they are coupled to see its effect. The wave energy converter will have no effect on the WindFloat motions due to the relatively low forces interacting between the power take off system and the platform. It can be concluded that the coupling results in a very low impact of wave energy on the total increase in energy production. Absorbed wave energy is between 0.75 and 73.07 [kW] which is in terms of contribution is respectively 0.07 and 1.44 [%]. Increasing the buoy size up to 25 meter shows the potential of wave energy contribution which can go up to 10.7 [%] for strong wave environment.","wave energy; offshore wind energy; wind wave hybrid system","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2017-02-01","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Offshore Engineering","SET3091 Graduation Project (2016-2017 Q1)",""

(mentor)","2017","Since the problem of global warming has been broadly considered as vital and due to constantly rising oil prices, further fossil fuels exploitation requires diametrical changes immediately. The demand for environmentally friendly improvements does not only entail searching for new resources but also utilizing those which are available and more importantly, renewable. Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) is possibly the most flexible technology in terms of temperature level and capacity nowadays. It is often the only applicable means of conversion for external energy sources and is therefore a very active research area in the field. Project investigates performance of an unconventional, small-scale, three-stage radial outflow, ORC turbine as this component has proven to be critical in the system. Main content embraces steady and transient computational fluid dynamic simulations by means of Ansys CFX software and evaluation of loss mechanisms. The main project objective is to evaluate the performance of the machine at its design conditions and fluid-dynamic characterisation of the flow. Geometrical data has been obtained from TU Delft in-house mean-line code zTurbo for preliminary fluid-dynamic design of turbomachinery. The main findings of this work involve performance evaluation of an innovative mini-turbine configuration and the applicability of available loss estimation models. Although there are guidelines on designing conventional, larger, axial power plants, still little is known about research in the field of small-scale, radial outflow machines working with molecularly complex fluids. Overall total-to-static efficiency of the machine is 65.3% for a 0.1 mm tip leakage gap and sealed stators. It is higher, and in close proximity to the one of 63.1% obtained by mean-line prediction tool zTurbo. Thermodynamic processes undergone by the working fluid in mini-ORC ROT can be represented by velocity triangles at midspan with a 2.2% discrepancy in overall efficiency w.r.t. two-equation, steady RANS. Relatively uniform blade load, ability to apply tight clearance, tangential deflection in rotors due to Coriolis force and the relative motion w.r.t. the casing contribute to a decrease in 3D effects. This efficiency is expected to be slightly lower if tip leakage is imposed also on the stationary domains, possibly with even better match. Total pressure loss coefficient for the first stator, for the steady-state case without tip leakage is of exactly the same value (23%) as the one for transient simulation with free-slip endwalls, accounting only for two-dimensional effects, averaged over the oscillation period. For the rotor, where the endwall boundary layer is more disturbed, steady state case predicts this loss by 3 points higher w.r.t. transient case, which gives 28%. Together with small secondary losses predicted in the stator, accounting for only 14% of the overall loss, 2D estimation/optimisation methods can be possibly used to predict the performance. Naturally growing passage area, allowing for smaller flaring angle, contributes to a decrease in span-wise velocity components and diminishes 3D effects. Stage 1 proved to be more susceptible to tip leakage increase. Small aspect ratios, in the order of 0.5, in mini-ORC ramp up the impact of tip leakage vortex compared to larger blades. The poorest performance (total-to-total efficiency of 51.2%) has been noted for the third stage, which requires profile optimisation and stagger angle modification. Expectedly, increase in tip leakage gap in rotational domains, leads to rise in entropy, which is even slightly more perceivable in low-aspect ratio blades, such as Rotor 1. Good match has been found between CFD and zTurbo in terms of overall loss estimation. Discrepancies for Rotor 1, Stator 3 and Rotor 3 are 0.1%, 0.1% and 0.2%, respectively. For Stator 1, Stator 2 and Rotor 2 these discrepancies are higher, of 3.3%, 7.7% and 3.0%, respectively. The main design problems are: profile losses and 2D design, including shock interaction shown in the results from the transient simulation. It is expected that this work will make a long-standing contribution to the body of knowledge on loss mechanisms in small-scale ORC machines and it will help to build a more sustainable and cleaner world.","ORC; ROT; organic; Rankine; cycle; radial outflow; renewable; energy; mini-turbine; turbine; centrifugal; CFD; RANS; unsteady; transient","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2017-01-30","Aerospace Engineering","Aerodynamics, Wind Energy & Propulsion","","","",""

SRAM PUF is a popular emerging hardware intrinsic security primitive: its start-up values (SUV) can be used to uniquely identify and authenticate silicon, due to the hard to clone, inherent and device unique deep-submicron process variations. ECC is an approach to public-key cryptography, which can be used to establish shared secret keys among parties; it has been gaining popularity among lightweight IoT devices because achieving equivalent security level requires significantly smaller operands when compared to other approaches. Our solution consists of two systematic steps: (1) development of a cryptographic protocol which utilizes PUF-derived key as the root-of-trust, while keeping the area constraint into account, and (2) design and development of a modular hardware architecture that supports the protocol. We propose four protocol variants with trade-offs related to security versus implementation requirements. Further, we verify and prototype one protocol variant on the Xilinx Zynq-7000 APSoC device, and analyze its practicality as well as its feasibility. The prototype offers interesting insights and lays a solid foundation for future research.","Security; authentication; PUF; public-key cryptography; protocol; communication","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Quantum Engineering","","Computer Engineering","CE-MS-2017-02",""

The findings were used to define a target group and a design goal. As a result, different concept directions were developed following a brainstorming session and taking as a basis a food waste avoidance model. The most achievable direction within the given time limit was selected and detailed. From this concept a prototype was designed, built and evaluated. The designed device enables households to develop positive habits to avoid food waste, specially the food that is normally wasted due to forgetfulness. It mainly provides an alternative system to the old way of labelling food, to track food freshness when expiration dates are no longer applicable, by having control of the days food has been stored at home inside the fridge. Reminders are only given when the system detects that food is danger of being forgotten.","IoT; food waste","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Ruijters, D. (mentor)","2017","Introduction: In this study, a novel anthropomorphic head phantom for quantitative image quality assessment in cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) is proposed. The phantom is composed of tissue equivalent materials (TEMs) which are suitable for ‘ home made’ fabrication methods such as silicone casting and 3D printing and equipped with inserts for quantitative measurement of the contrast resolution. A monocalcium phosphate/gypsum mixture (MCPHG), nylon and a silyl modified polymer gel (SMP) are proposed as bone, muscle and brain equivalent materials respectively. Methods: The TEMs within a prototype were evaluated for their radiodensity in terms of Hounsfield Units (HU). Separate TEM samples were evaluated for their scatter magnitude and spatial distribution. The measurements were compared with theoretical HU values and Monte Carlo based scatter simulations of bone, muscle and brain tissue. Results: The median radiodensity and inter quartile range (IQR) of the MCPHG and SMP were found to be within the range of the theoretical radiodensity for bone and brain tissue: 922 (IQR = 156) and 47 (IQR = 7) HU respectively. The median radiodensity of nylon was slightly outside of the HU range of muscle tissue, but within the HU range of a combination of muscle and adipose tissue: -18 (IQR = 40) HU. The median ratios between the measured scatter characteristics and simulated tissues were between 0.84 and 1.13 after removal of one outlier (IQR between 0.05 and 0.14). Conclusions: The preliminary results of this study show that the proposed design and TEMs are potentially suitable for the fabrication of a ‘ home made’ anthropomorphic head phantom for quantitative image quality assessment in CT or CBCT.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-01-30","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","biomechanical engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Stolk, E.H. (mentor)","2017","The city of Amsterdam has been growing and it continues to grow. While both the amount of visitors and the amount of residents continues to grow, the amount of public space stays approximately the same. This has led to an increasing pressure on livability, accessibility, and public space. Pedestrians, cyclists, and drivers alike often face the negative consequences of overcrowding. Much of this problem can be traced to the excessive space use of cars. Cars, while only accounting for 9% of movements in the city centre, take up approximately 77% of all public space that is not water. This project set out to remedy the pressure on livability, accessibility, and public space through the improvement of conditions for pedestrians and cyclists. These modalities have been chosen because their use was shown to correspond with a more efficient flow of people, a more livable city, and a more efficient use of public space. To do this, the promising upcoming technology of automated vehicles is engaged. This technology was found to possess the ability to completely change urban areas. This, however, can either deteriorate or elevate livability, accessibility, and public space. Therefore, taking a pro-active role in development for automated vehicles is essential. First, a literature research on walkability and cyclability was conducted which resulted in the establishment of eight pillars of walkability and cyclability: mixed uses, network coherence, legibility, protection of pedestrians and cyclists, dimensioning of infrastructure, presence of green, visual stimulation, and connecting of attractors. The project sets out to strenghten these pillars in order to mediate the problems the city faces. To do this, a literature research on automated vehicles has been conducted which explores possible implications of automated vehicles. These possibilities have been explored further through design within scenarios. The scenarios were constructed based on a scenario building methodology that was established through an in-depth literature research on scenarios and scenario building. The literature on automated vehicles and further exploration through designing within the scenarios has yielded 26 instruments that describe possibilities made possible either directly by automated vehicles or indirectly through interaction with automated vehicles. These instruments are priority lanes, induction charging roads, digital roads surfaces, convoy driving, shared space, subcanal parking, multimodal app, logistics app, multi-use vehicles, logistics nodes, time-dependent infrastructure, bike-share smart locks, bicycle GPS transmitters, car fleet as battery, centrally owned fleet, hodosses, park and charge hubs, replacing trams with AVs, tourist tram lines, delivery assistance vehicles, supply over water, autonomous boats, multimodal nodes, bicycle parking, bicycle sharing programme, and conditional access roads. Interactions between these instruments were researched and five main clusters were derived from the clustering of the instruments: new parking, mobility as a service, new logistics, multimodal travel, and network principles. These clusters of instruments, along with individual instruments, have then been applied on Amsterdam’s city centre to improve its walkability and cyclability in an iterative process of trial and error, reflecting the results with regard to the pillars of walkability and cyclability after each iteration. The most important findings of the project are that automated vehicles should be made to park themselves in garages to open up public space, and should be made to drive efficiently in convoys so they can replace buses and trams. Also the vehicles should both feed to and receive information from the cloud so they do not require signage, road markings, and traffic lights which clutter public space, and most importantly, should not be allowed to drive everywhere unconditionally. Rather, the connected nature of automated vehicles should be exploited to create individual route options for each vehicle based on its use and user. Neighbourhoods should not be accessible to automated vehicles unless they have specific exemptions. These exemptions can be granted by the municipality for reasons that can change over time. These reasons can include being a resident, being an emergency service, travelling through extreme weather, working in a neighbourhood, being physically impaired, or many other reasons. This conditional access, implemented strategically with other suggested instruments, will allow neighbourhoods to become healthier, safer, and generally more livable areas while remaining accessible for important purposes.","Livability; Mobility; Automated Vehicles; Autonomous Vehicles; Scenarios; Exploratory Research; Self-driving Cars; Walkability; Cyclability","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Urbanism","","","",""

An enabling technology is the four-dimensional trajectory (4DT) planner, which is the focus of this research. The aim is to consider the feasibility of a heuristic branching method for 4DT planning by developing such a planner and testing it against an established Dijkstra-like approach. Windﬁeld and obstacle ﬁeld complexities are varied and the solution eﬀectiveness and runtimes of the tested planners are compared by the developed metrics. No signiﬁcant statistical diﬀerence is found between the distributions of results for solution eﬀectiveness of the two planners, but a signiﬁcant reduction in runtime is shown by the newly developed planner. The study thus indicates the feasibility of a heuristic branching-based method for 4DT planning in the realm of ATM, which informs future research in this domain.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Control & Operations","","Control & Simulation","",""

Optimization of routing and timing is performed in order to minimize travel time and maximize compliance to target times at destination. Propagation uncertainty, found through analysis of historical data, is used in order to provide optimized and robust planning.

(mentor); Zijlema, M. (mentor); El Serafy, G.Y.H. (mentor)","2017","Around the world, areas with unique ecosystems are prone to harmful factors deteriorating their environment. Management of these areas need knowledge on the ecological status of these areas, to make decisions for future problems. They need easily accessible information on indicators describing the conditions of these areas. Obtaining this information can be done using numerical models. The use of models however will introduce uncertainty in the information, which should be taken into account when using model output for the making of decisions. When model output is known together with its uncertainty, it can be efficiently visualized in a toolbox to make it commonly available for users. In this way the use of uncertainty can be incorporated in management purposes. In this research, an uncertainty analysis is conducted and a visualization of model output together with uncertainty is made for the Wadden Sea area. In this area eutrophication and consequently algal bloom causes deterioration of the water quality. Due to Suspended Particulate Matter (SPM) in the water column, the incoming light is reduced, decreasing the amount of algal bloom. With a Delft3D-WAQ model, using the GEM/BLOOM module, the chlorophyll-a concentration can be modelled, which is an indicator of the amount of algae in the water column. The model Delft3D-WAQ Sediments is used to calculate the SPM concentrations, which is used as a forcing for the GEM/BLOOM model. Therefore, they are a main driving force and uncertainty source in the setup for this project. The main research question is formulated as: How can uncertainty from a SPM model as a driving force for a GEM/BLOOM model be identified, quantified and visualized to help decision makers? Using a literature review the uncertainty sources within the input files are identified. To quantify the uncertainty, first a sensitivity analysis and consequently an uncertainty analysis is used. This sensitivity analysis is done by varying the values of certain input files and assessing the variability it creates in the model output, resulting in the most influential input. The uncertainty analysis is used to obtain the magnitude of the uncertainty coming from this most influential input. This analysis is a Monte Carlo simulation, where different input is assessed by giving these a Probability Density Function (PDF) simulating the uncertainty in the input. From these distributions, samples are drawn to create different experiments to assess the influence of the uncertainty. Using a Latin Hypercube Sampling with Dependence instead of a random sampling, the amount of model runs is reduced from thousands to 188. The dependencies between the input parameters are taken into account. Afterwards, the output is estimated with a PDF from which the PDF characteristics mode and spreading are used to describe the SPM concentration and its uncertainty for each segment in time and space. A toolbox is developed for a 3D visualization of the model output and its uncertainty. A cubic shaped marker is placed in this environment for each segment by its x-, y- and z-coordinates. The SPM concentrations are visualized by coloring the markers and the uncertainty is incorporated using a white hue. The parameters in the erosion and deposition fluxes in the model equations are identified to be most influential and are therefore assessed on uncertainty. The SPM results are validated by a comparison against measurement data from Rijkswaterstaat and data used in earlier. The model gives a good approximation of the SPM concentrations. Some areas indicate a very high uncertainty, mainly where the SPM values are unrealistically high. Overall, the values are within the same order of magnitude as the validation data. The uncertainty in the model output is mainly present in critical areas, where the influence of different factors is significant, such as the effect of a river outflow, stratification and tidal influence. This indicates that either the bed load module of the model or the hydrodynamic input is not completely optimized yet. For the quantification of the uncertainty a log-normal distribution is used to estimate the output values at every location and time step. The characteristics of this distribution, the mode and the spreading, are used to quantify the concentrations of SPM and the uncertainty into values that can be used in the visualization. To answer the research question: the uncertainties are identified with a literature review resulting in the sources of uncertainty, quantified with the uncertainty analysis into a mode and a spreading and visualized in a toolbox with a 3D environment using a marker for each segment and using color for displaying the concentrations and a white hue to visualize the uncertainty. This toolbox than helps decision makers to easily access the data and according uncertainty. The SPM model has some high uncertainties, but is a good estimation to be used as a driving force for the GEM/BLOOM model.","SPM; turbidity; Wadden Sea; uncertainty analysis; visualization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2017","The study into sand wave dynamics in South Channel has commenced after large dune forms were observed in monitoring campaigns following the channel deepening project of the Port of Melbourne. The project involved deepening of the harbour berths and channels, but more importantly, it involved the deepening of South Channel in Port Phillip Bay. South Channel, the main shipping channel, crosses the bay over a distance of ≈20km. The growth of bedforms at various locations in South Channel now threatens to impede marine traffic. The dimensions and migration rate of the bedforms in the channel are remarkable, especially in the harsh flow conditions in the narrow channel. Therefore, the bedforms in South Channel cannot be given an obvious classification. The first part of this thesis studies the hypothesis that the bedforms in South Channel can be classified as tidal sand waves. Tidal sand waves are large-scale bedforms generated by recirculating flow cells that drive sediment to the top of a crest, and are commonly observed on shallow coastal seas such as the North Sea. The second part of the thesis explores different dredging strategies for tidal sand wave fields and these are assessed for the case of South Channel. The classification analysis follows two different directions. First, the dimensions of sand waves found globally are compared to the dimensions found in South Channel. Secondly, the flow conditions in the channel are compared to the tidal sand wave flow regime as defined in literature. This bedform issue in the channel properly illustrates the necessity of an evaluation of the current, and alternative, channel maintenance strategies. A numerical model in Delft3D software is used to assess the different strategies. Though the results of the model are promising, they cannot be applied straightforwardly to assess the navigability of South Channel for the various strategies. A probabilistic approach is applied to combine the insights from the numerical model and the survey data to produce the probability of breaching the maintained depth for the different strategies.","sandwave; sand wave; south channel; Melbourne; bedform; dredging; prediction; classification; modelling; delft3d","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-01-28","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Coastal Engineering","",""

(mentor); Di Maio, F. (mentor); van Roekel, E. (mentor)","2017","The Master's programme Industrial Ecology is jointly organised by Leiden University and Delft University of Technology. - Two main features of the construction and demolition systems translate into environmental pressure; an increasing need for building materials, to provide and maintain the infrastructure for growing urban populations, and the management of large amounts of waste streams that come from demolition and construction activities. Because of its high volume and limited management alternatives, the concrete waste is a critical stream. In the Netherlands, 95% of concrete rubble from construction and demolition waste is recycled into an application of lower grade through regular crushing. Alternative methods for reintegrating the coarse fraction into new concrete are Advanced Dry Recovery (ADR), electrical fragmentation (EF) and wet processing. Around 2% of the concrete waste stream is wet processed, but this alternative is energy intensive and expensive. Oppositely, ADR and EF are simpler technologies that also offer to retrieve the value of concrete, but are still at a pilot stage. This research project focuses on ADR as a recycling alternative to regular crushing in specific scenarios, addressing financial and environmental implications through the use of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and Life Cycle Costing (LCC). The main research question is: What are the environmental and economic implications of different concrete recycling scenarios in the Netherlands? The applicability of the results is that of a first estimate of the economic and environmental implications of shifting to ADR concrete-rubble recycling, with a detailed coverage of costs and types of environmental interventions. The research question is addressed from two different perspectives. First, a case study from the HISER project, sponsored by the European Union, is evaluated integrating LCA and LCC. The case is about the demolition of an end-of-life building and the construction of a new building on the same site where the old building stood. Therefore, it includes a waste management component and a material supply component. The materials retrieved from the demolition of a building were registered and the materials required for the new building estimated. As the demolition of a building is a one-time event, the real demolition and the construction plans are compared to a virtual demolition and the consequent construction plans. The scenario from the real demolition promotes circularity regarding coarse aggregate for concrete production, by recycling with ADR the clean concrete rubble from a ‘best-practice’ demolition. Second, with the Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) from the first perspective, the environmental implications of using recycled coarse aggregate instead of natural coarse aggregate for the production of concrete are explored. Regarding the impact assessment method, the modelled environmental interventions were better represented with the PEF characterization factors than with the EN15804 characterization factors. The integrated LCC-LCA study indicates that recycling concrete rubble into coarse aggregate for concrete with ADR technology provided environmental benefits at a higher cost for the Steiger 113 project, compared to the virtual option of processing the stony fraction through regular crushing and sourcing imported gravel for the new construction. The reduction of transport distances between the source of CDW, the ADR facilities and the consumer of the RCA would decrease the costs and the environmental burden. Within the defined scenarios from two different perspectives, the supply chain of RCA from concrete-rubble recycling with ADR technology presents environmental advantages compared to the supply chain of NCA. The Circular Economy Index presented advantages compared to mass recycling rates while contrasting the LCC environmental profiles with simple indicators.","Demolition; Waste management; Life Cycle Assessment; Life Cycle Costing; Concrete recycling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Engineering Systems and Services; Values, Technology and Innovation","","Industrial Ecology Joint degree Leiden & Delft","",""

The CiM architecture’s distinguishing component is a large two-dimensional crossbar on which large amounts of data can be stored, and on which many operations can be executed in parallel. When used as an accelerator to execute massively parallel applications, the CiM architecture can provide significant performance improvements over classical computer systems. However, the implementation of applications on the crossbar of the CiM architecture requires new algorithm specification and compilation techniques, as spatial information about a program is required to obtain an optimal implementation of that program. In this thesis, we introduce a domain-specific language to describe computational patterns and their spatial characteristics. We also design a compiler that is able to transform these patterns into the crossbar implementations of those patterns. We verify both the functional and spatial correctness of the systems generated for the crossbar by describing several distinctly different algorithms in the language, and comparing the compilation results to our expectations. This way, we both show the ability of our language to describe a wide array of applications, and we show that the compiler of the language works correctly.","Computation-in-Memory; Memristor; Programming Language; Skeleton; Compilation; Placement; Routing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Quantum Engineering","","Computer Engineering","CE-MS-2017-01",""

(mentor)","2017","The energy consumption in the industry field is considerable. Saving energy has great potential in many industrial processes. For example, heat recovery from the spent cooling water can be achieved by applying heat pump technology, and the recovered heat can be used for district heating. Previous study indicates that the compression-resorption cycle has higher efficiency than traditional vapor-compression heat pumps due to the fact that it can take advantage of the temperature glide of the multi-component working fluid. The absorption process within the resorber and its performance should be further investigated. Ammonia-water mixture is commonly used as the working fluid in the compression-resorption heat pump. Recently the CO2-NH3-H2O mixture has been identified as a promising working fluid theoretically, relevant experiment should be conducted to verify it. For the theoretical background, previous studies about kinetics of CO2 absorption in ammonia-water have been reviewed. Currently most of the theoretical and experimental studies are performed for post combustion capture usage. The working conditions deviate much from that for the compression-resorption heat pump cycle; therefore existent kinetic models are not suitable for predicting the absorption rate of the CO2 in ammonia-water within a compression-resorption heat pump cycle. Previous studies from TU Delft indicate that a more accurate model should be developed to predict the absorption process of the ammonia-water mixture in a multi-tube mini-channel heat exchanger. In this study a steady-state theoretical model has been developed to predict the absorption process of ammonia-water mixture in a multi-tube mini-channel heat exchanger by assuming Nusselt falling film theory and annular flow pattern. The model is extended to cover all three different phases (superheated vapor, 2-phase, and sub-cooled liquid) of the ammonia-water mixture. Experiments with two different working fluids (ammonia-water mixture and CO2-NH3-H2O mixture) on the tube side and cooling water on the shell side have been performed respectively. Results indicate that adding a small amount of CO2 (2.1 wt%) directly will lead to slightly better heat exchange on the water side when operated in optimum condition. But the operating status becomes much less stable than the experiment with ammonia-water as a working fluid. The pump becomes difficult to operate with constant mass flow. While when the flow directions on both sides are changed, more stable operating conditions can be achieved. This indicates the configuration of the heat exchanger and the flow direction influence the operating stability. Also it is possible to have CO2 desorbed at the pump even in low temperature. Therefore to put into practical use, more tests should be done to comprehensively investigate the feasibility of applying CO2-NH3-H2O mixture as working fluid in a compression-resorption heat pump. The theoretical model has been validated by the experimental data. For the 2-phase flow condition on the tube side, the simulation results indicate that the assumption of annular flow pattern is reasonable for most of the heat exchange area. But when the vapor quality is low, the film thickness prediction based on the Nusselt falling film theory is not reasonable any longer, this indicates a transition of a flow pattern. A new flow pattern occurs in order to enhance the transport phenomena. The validation results show that the extended model can accurately predict the heat load and the temperature profile along the absorption process. However the pressure drop cannot be reasonably predicted. This can be caused by inaccurate friction factor estimation or ignorance of other effects which can cause extra pressure drop. The heat transfer performance at the superheated region is studied in detail. Results show an obscure relation between the weakened heat transfer phenomenon and the hydrodynamic instabilities on the tube side. Experimental data are also applied to validate the thermodynamic equilibrium models for the CO2-NH3-H2O mixture. The model developed in this project can be used to predict the heat transfer performance for certain type of heat exchangers conducting ammonia-water absorption process, or be modified to apply for other conditions. The experimental data are useful for ammonia-water and CO2-NH3-H2O mixture absorption related studies. As a follow-up for this research it is of interest to further investigate and identify the flow pattern transition when the vapor quality is low, and develop a more comprehensive model to predict the absorption process. Visual observations will help to understand the flow pattern transitions. A complete compression-resorption heat pump setup will contribute to more useful experimental result to estimate the performance using CO2-NH3-H2O mixture as a working fluid.","compression-resorption heat pumps; ammonia-water mixture; absorption; mini-channel heat exchangers; waste heat recovery; CO2-NH3-H2O mixture; steady state model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Process and Energy","","","",""

(mentor)","2017","This thesis walks the reader through the research and design process of ‘Break’, a product for adolescent cancer patients. The design empowers adolescent children to deal with a situation of powerlessness, thereby fostering a positive self-image. This graduation project is part of the “Meedoen=Groeien” project of TU Delft and the Prinses Maxima centrum (PMC) for childhood oncology. The PMC employs a developmental care approach, meaning they focus on the development of the child, also in the context of family wellbeing. The approach can therefore be described as inclusive: It takes the physical, psychological and social needs of the entire family into consideration. In order to achieve this, this project extends the support framework to the home environment of the adolescent individual. ¬ Phase 1: analysis This first phase focussed on the understanding of the context in which adolescents aged between 15 – 20 years suffering from cancer operate. Literature research was conducted investigating a child’s development during older adolescence as well as the impact of cancer on this development. The main challenge for the adolescent while growing up is to understand and accept the person they are. This informed the following design question: How can adolescent cancer patients be empowered to develop and maintain a positive self-image? The key insight gained indicates that being accepting of one’s own situation results in a more positive self-image. Six cancer patients were interviewed using the context mapping method in order to understand their needs and wants. The ‘Momentos’ concept, which was developed as part of this graduation project, was used to further narrow down the scope of the project. One specific moment in an adolescent’s life was chosen to design for: Walking through the school corridors and being suspiciously stared at. Moments like these makes an adolescent feel powerless, resulting in insecurity or sadness. Phase 2: Conceptualisation The second phase involved several ideation activities. The resulting concepts were co-evaluated with cancer survivors, which informed several milestone insights. One insight was that all adolescents have the need to feel normal. This can be achieved by involving peers into the interaction facilitated by the design. That way, adolescents can accept and perceive the proposed design concept as something within the social normal instead of something unusual. Another insight was that participants valued ideas with a physical nature. They provided them with a tangible reminder of their significant relations with peers, while also providing a personal aid in dealing with stressful situations. Two main concept directions fitting the design requirements were iteratively explored, of which one matured into the final concept. Phase 3: Detailing This conceptual product, called ‘Break’, is a wearable device that can be attached to wire of existing earbuds. Adolescent cancer patients can distribute ‘Break’ to their loved ones and friends, thereby building an empowering social framework. Within this social network, users can listen to and share a song of personal meaning with others. The device is based on the interaction of bending (‘breaking’) the device. When bending, a song out of the selection will be played. That way, the adolescent cancer patient can actively influence his emotions in a situation of distress. Aspects of this concept were further elaborated through fast iterations during this detailing phase. Interactions and technical questions were addressed, amongst others. An interactive prototyping approach was chosen in order to achieve this. Phase 4: Evaluation & conclusion A final evaluation was conducted during this phase, involving one cancer survivor with a friend. Several prototypes detailing different aspects of the final concept were provided to the participants for evaluation. While both participants were very positive about the concept, the cancer patient expressed particular enthusiasm about the social aspects of the concept, whereas his friend related to the tangible nature of the interaction most. This shows that the design concept accommodates the needs of the two main stakeholders. As a recommendation for further research, other stakeholders, such as family members and hospital staff should be included in the testing procedures. Furthermore, detailing work on certain aspects of the concept remains to be done. Finally, the product should be long-term tested and evaluated with hospital professionals.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","","",""

(mentor)","2017","Historically, the offshore industry has encountered difficulties in accessing their offshore assets safely. Especially during rough sea climates, people and cargo transfer from a ship to an offshore structure can be hard or even impossible due to wave induced vessel motions. For this, Ampelmann developed a ship-based, offshore access solution. The Ampelmann system is a 6 Degrees of Freedom (DOF) motion system with a transfer deck and gangway attached to its top platform. The system measures the vessel motions and calculates a reference signal for six hydraulic cylinders to follow using a controller. This should ideally render the top platform motionless such that the gangway can be easily positioned and connected to the offshore structure, creating a safe passage for personnel to transfer between the transfer deck and the offshore structure. The current control strategy of the Ampelmann system consists of six individual feedback controllers to follow the reference signal; it is able to compensate for ship motions and stabilize the top platform. However, undesired Residual Motions (RM) of the top platform remain present during operation which cause several problems; (1) small platform motions result in large gangway tip motions resulting in difficulties when connecting the gangway to the offshore structure and (2) reduced comfort for personnel standing on the transfer deck. To improve the performance, Ampelmann is interested in minimizing RM of the top platform. For this, several causes for RM have first been identified after which the scope of research has been narrowed down to reducing the tracking errors of the reference signal. It was shown during the literature study that many tracking control strategies for similar 6 DOF motion systems rely on the dynamic modeling of a system. These dynamics can be inverted and used for an Inverse Dynamics Control (IDC) strategy which showed promising results. The main objective of this thesis is set to reduce RM of the Ampelmann top platform during operation by improving the controller’s tracking performance using an Inverse Dynamics Controller. In order to achieve this goal, a dynamic model of the Ampelmann system has been developed to simulate tracking errors under the current control strategy and to provide a basis for simulating the system’s response under novel control strategies. The insights of the dynamic model led to the development of IDC and an inner loop. IDC is based on calculating the reference actuator force required to move the top platform in a certain trajectory - or in this case - to keep the top platform motionless. The inner loop is an individual feedback control strategy which allows the hydraulic cylinders to track a reference force independent of the cylinder’s motions. Implementation of the proposed control strategy and simulation on the dynamic model shows that the IDC is able to reduce tracking errors significantly, even in cases where plant parameters are considered uncertain and varied within reasonable boundaries.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-01-27","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Delft Center for Systems and Control (DCSC)","","","",""

(mentor)","2017","The definition of the CubeSat is already nearly two decades old. This results in the trend that a large fraction of CubeSat missions are leaving the domain of (educational) technology demonstration and entering that of commercial applications. Therefore a larger focus is put on the reliability and compatibility of commercial of the shelf systems and the spacecraft containing them. One subsystem that is more or less fixed since the first CubeSat missions is the serial data bus. This internal network is essential for interconnecting subsystems. However, recent investigations have shown that the industry standard I2C must be re-evaluated due to performance and reliability restrictions. The research contained in this thesis sets off to evaluate these characteristics of other data bus standards to propose a possible future-proof data bus architecture. By splitting up the analysis cases into two parts, the choice and design of both parts can be optimised. The Telemetry and Command (TC) bus carries essential commands and housekeeping data between systems, while the Payload (PL) bus is dedicated to high speed bulk data transfers. An initial requirement-based selection of bus standards reduced the selection of standards to several options for both bus cases; for the TC bus, I2C, CAN and RS485 were selected. For the PL bus, CAN, RS485, SPI and USB were selected. The selected standards were all implemented in a data bus testing suite, comprising of up to nine simulated subsystems providing pseudo data to be communicated over the bus. Measurements were conducted of the buses' power consumption and data rates in several realistic test cases. Furthermore, the complexity and ability to withstand noise and voltage transients were evaluated. Ultimately, this resulted in a recommendation of using RS485 in future TC bus configurations and SPI in the PL bus configurations. However, this conclusion must be regarded a recommended direction of future research for several reasons. Firstly, more investigations are needed in the ability of these buses to work when subjected to large amounts of noise and other extreme environments. Secondly, the performed trade-off does not apply weighting to its criteria, as these can and will vary wildly for different missions. Finally, the test setup was limited in terms of processor ability for the PL bus case. These specific tests should therefore be redeveloped with more powerful equipment, allowing an even more realistic simulation of future CubeSat subsystems.","CubeSat; PocketQube; data bus; CDHS; delfi-pq; DWire","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Space Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Louter, P.C. (mentor)","2017","This report discusses the design analysis process of designing a maximum transparent roof for a stadium in order to create the most optimal semi indoor stadium climate. To conduct such research, the following main question had to be asked: How can a maximised transparent roof for the Khalifa International Stadium (KIS) in Qatar, with efficient use of energy, create an optimal semi indoor climate in extreme summer weather conditions? The research on creating a comfortable microclimate in stadia started in the early eighties, where at the time knowledge in this field was very little. During the nineties, more information came available on creating microclimates in large semi-indoor spaces. Thus academic experimenting began on the quality of air, lighting and acoustics in stadia. This resulted in new stadiums built with new techniques from these academic analyses. In the zeroes one discovered a lot of inconveniences in the findings of the nineties and started to improve the academic research on stadia. With the rise of computers, it was a lot easier to conduct more complex and feasible analyses. Which brings us till today, where climate adaptation with complex forms can be tested and actually be made with the use of new kinds of materials. Because of the help of computers, designs are becoming much easier to predict, which makes us challenge ourselves to design in the most extreme situations where efficient and sustainable engineering can be achieved. Designing a roof for a stadium or a whole stadium gives new insights in different use of materials, smart climate/ structural design and the quality of sustainable building. Designing a roof for the Khalifa International Stadium (KIS) gives a clear insight in the complexity of the structural demands of a stadium and the relevance of climate adaptive building. From a climate till a structural perspective the design has to balance between both disciplines, without exceeding one another’s preconditions. For such roof, a wide range of design and engineering analyses is required. By conducting wind, heat and lighting analyses certain design requirements are imposed. Resulting in an interesting primary structural roof design based on the wind and an interesting secondary structural roof design based on heat and lighting. A roof where climate design meets structural design and vice versa.","Structural Design; Climate Design; Structural Glass; Stadium Design; Semi-Indoor Environmental Quality","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Building Technology","","Chair of Climate Design, Chair of Structural Design","AR4B025",""

(mentor); Bilow, M. (mentor)","2017","The long and slender structural member, the elastic column, fails due to buckling. Buckling is a predictable, and visible, mode of failure allowing for timely repairs or replacement. This is no longer true when we look at long and slender columns made out of glass as glass is a brittle material. At the moment the critical buckling force is reached the column does not deform as much but suffers from explosive brittle failure, because of this it is unpredictable and extremely dangerous. As a result of this brittle failure behavior we apply safety factors twice as high when designing with glass compared to other construction materials, leading to excessively large, heavy and costly elements. Research focused on creating load bearing glass colums has been conducted and has led to a few preceding glass columns. These columns did lack either mechanical or architectural desirability though. New research is being conducted into producing a glass load bearing column by laminating solid rods together, this research is very promising but is still limited by the boundaries generated as a result of this immense safety factors. Increasing the cross-sectional properties of such a column does increase the column’s resistance to buckling, but again leads to excessively large structural elements with increased weight and cost. But what if we can, rather than accepting the consequences of the high safety factors, reduce the safety factors by increasing the mechanical behavior during buckling, transforming the brittle and explosive failure into a more gradual and ductile failure. This thesis researches the potential of post-tensioning a bundled glass column in an attempt to transform the explosive brittle failure into a ductile mode of failure. In order to verify this behavior a total of six slender glass columns have been produced with a length of 2400 millimeters, three of these where loaded with around 3000 kilograms of prestress and all six were destructively tested. A prestressed member appears to be a more flexible element than a similar non-prestressed member and has post-breakage load bearing capabilities.","post-tension; glass; transparency; column; bundled","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2017-07-31","Architecture and The Built Environment","Building Technology","","","",""

(mentor)","2017","The department of Flight Performance and Propulsion at the Faculty of Aerospace Engineering has developed the Design and Engineering Engine (DEE) concept to supportMultidisciplinary Design Optimization (MDO) of complex products. The goal of the DEE is to accelerate design, analysis and optimization by automating repetitive and non-creative design activities. A central part of the DEE is theMulti-Model Generator (MMG), a Knowledge-Based Engineering (KBE) application that provides a generative modeling capability. Over the years several aircraftMMGs have been developed to support aircraftMDO. The previous aircraft MMG was built using the KBE system GDL. Over the years, several limitations of the fuselage model included in the GDL MMG, called DARfuse, have become apparent. Therefore, this thesis describes research done into the development of a new parametric fuselage model to be included in the next generation Multi-Model Generator, currently under development within the department of Flight Performance and Propulsion. The new fuselage model is called ParaFuse and has been developed using the KBE system ParaPy. The scope of ParaFuse is limited to conventional, low-wing, passenger aircraft certified under CS 25 airworthiness requirements. The first goal of the thesis was to develop a new parametric fuselage model. The implemented modeling approach uses longitudinal guide curves and fuselage cross sections to generate the final fuselage geometry. A separate parameterization approach is taken to provide a smooth nose end cap. Furthermore, a parameterized wing-body fairing has been implemented in ParaFuse. As a second goal, an inside-out fuselage sizing and cabin configuration method has been developed and implemented to automate the fuselage layout and sizing process. The inside-out design method can be used to automatically generate the outer fuselage geometry and interior components based on payload requirements posed by the user, such as passenger capacity and cargo type. The inside-out sizing method has been validated by reconstructing several reference aircraft using ParaFuse. On average, the error of the external dimensions of the resulting fuselages is 2% with respect to the dimensions of the fuselage of the actual aircraft. Thus, it can be concluded that the implemented inside-out sizing method can be used to accurately size the fuselage of conventional, low-wing, passenger aircraft. In addition, an outside-in cabin configuration method has been implemented in ParaFuse. This method can be used to perform cabin (re)configuration studies of fuselages with fixed external dimensions. ParaFuse is able to generate the fuselage models, including cabin interiors, within 20 seconds. This allows the user to rapidly evaluate a large number of different fuselage models. To demonstrate the functionalities of the application, two case studies are presented in this thesis. First of all, ParaFuse has been used to generate several cabin designs for the AAR cruiser, which has been developed by the faculty as part of the RECREATE project. A second case study has been performed to evaluate the fuselage design of a regional turboprop aircraft. The development of ParaFuse, together with the implemented fuselage sizing and cabin configurationmethods, described in this thesis is a step towards a next generation aircraftMulti-Model Generator.","Knowledge-Based Engineering; Multidisciplinary Design Optimization; Aircraft Design; Fuselage","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Aerodynamics, Wind Energy & Propulsion","","Flight Performance and Propulsion","",""

(mentor)","2017","IT is a known fact that aircraft noise and fuel emissions are the most constraining factors for the growth of aviation. Continuous Descent Arrivals (CDAs) provide significant reductions in fuel consumption and noise footprint on the ground, by following idle thrust descent and eliminating low altitude leveling off. However, limitations such as unpredictability of the trajectory and separation management for CDAs prevent wide-spread implementation. The thesis focuses on overcoming some of these limitations. Optimal control theory is used to optimize the descent trajectory of the aircraft by using fuel and time as the performance index. The problem is formulated as amulti-phase optimal control and is solved by using a pseudospectral method. The theory is also the backbone of General Pseudospectral OPtimal Control Software (GPOPS). The main focus of the thesis is to enable multi-aircraft trajectory optimization for CDAs and ensure sufficient separation between all aircraft along the entire trajectory by implementing the separation algorithm. The possibility of using both distance based and the time based separation is explored in detail. It is demonstrated using Amsterdam Schiphol (AMS) airport’s real-time inbound flight data that it is feasible to apply the separation algorithm to separate aircraft along the entire lateral path while still being able to performCDAs during the peak and non-peak periods. All the limitations pertaining to the separation algorithmare analyzed and discussed in detail. By addressing some of these shortcomings, the simulation environment can be improved to bring itmore close to a real-time scenario. Although a lot of other factors have to be considered for a practical wide-spread implementation, success of this method will result in the aircraft trajectory being more predictable to the ground controller, effectively addressing one of the major shortcomings of CDAs. On a more important note, the success of this method will also result in reduced noise footprint and fuel consumption by aircraft, benefiting both the environment and airlines.","Optimal control; CDA; distance based separation; time based separation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Control & Operations","","","",""

Since the rural industrialization process is losing its economic foundation, these semi-urbanized areas have to find a way to maintain and develop without abundant resource which cities have. The urban problems generated in rural areas makes areas like Jinsha in a dilemma. Facing flood risk but at a less important location compared to city centers, Jinsha Island need to change the paradigm of water management with limited resources. This project raises a series of strategies that integrate water management and urban development. The measures not only deal with flood risk but also try to make a better place for residents. As urban development is spatial and at the same time a socio-economic process, the demographical change in population will also reflect diverse spatial claims. By re-introducing deltaic landscape, this project will create an attractive natural environment in Jinsha Island which will be a positive element in future development. Three minor strategies aiming at optimizing infrastructure will help to improve the water system and benefit the local people. Guidelines on urban regeneration at the end is a necessary supplement responding to the changes brought by urban development strategies.

(mentor)","2017","Human controllers are an essential part of human-machine systems, because of their capability to adapt. However, current manual control cybernetics theory falls short in describing the adapting human controller. In this study the time-invariant human operator models are made parameter varying over time to describe human adaptation. A steady-state Unscented Kalman Filter method is developed to estimate the model parameters without making any \textit{a priori} assumptions on the shape of variation. The method is compared to the current state-of-the-art, which applies maximum likelihood estimation with assumed sigmoid shape parameter variation. A novel metric is introduced, the $J$ metric, which describes the model quality as a function of the local estimation errors. The $J$ metric is used for judgement on the estimation performance in computer simulations, where the exact estimation errors can be computed. Results show that the sigmoid parameter shape variation is reasonable. The model quality lost for the maximum likelihood estimation was below 2\%, even when the sigmoid assumption is violated with perturbations. It also revealed that the steady-state Unscented Kalman filter can retrieve the parameter variation while losing less than 10\% model quality. A human-in-the-loop experiment was conducted which showed the capabilities of both methods to retrieve the adaptation. As expected, the steady-state Unscented Kalman Filter has more difficulty with faster parameter variations, but did not lose any major model quality. This paper demonstrates the successful development of the steady-state Unscented Kalman filter and its capabilities to retrieve human adaptation. Future research can directly implement this method for compensatory tracking tasks.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-01-26","Aerospace Engineering","Control & Operations","","Control & Simulation","",""

(mentor)","2017","Interstitial free (IF) steel is widely used in the automobile industry for car outer panel because of its good formability. Recently automotive industry pays more attention to paint appearance, and therefore demands good waviness performance of sheet steels after stamping. This thesis aims to study the factors in the microstructure that influence the surface waviness after plastic deformation. In this study, two kinds of IF steel sheets with similar chemical composition but with different surface waviness after the deformation have been used. One has the desirable surface waviness. The other one which has a larger surface waviness shows wavy pattern after painting the deformed material. The waviness behavior of the materials is simulated by a plane strain tension using the DAMASK software. Virtual specimens based on the 2D EBSD data are used to study the material locally by correlating the simulated surface profile and the EBSD microstructure. Further, artificially created virtual specimens are used to reveal the influence of grain size, texture and spatial distribution of texture on the surface waviness. In addition, the Fourier image analysis technique is also used to study the banding behavior of the IF steel. The results show that the spatial distribution of texture plays a very important role in affecting the waviness. The analysis also indicates that a smaller grain size leads to lower surface waviness after deformation. Reducing the contrast of Taylor factor between neighboring grains shows the similar effect. The aggregation of soft grains surrounded by the hard matrix may be the reason to the large valley appears in the surface profile.","DAMASK; EBSD; Fourier image analysis; surface waviness; Taylor factor","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-01-26","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Materials Science and Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2017","The Netherlands recently developed a new risk approach for flood management. The approach changed the safety standards in the Water-Act. The safety standard used to be an exceedance probability of the design water level, and the flood defence was supposed not to fail for all water levels below this level. Since knowledge regarding the actual strength of flood-defences has improved, a change has been made towards expressing the safety standard as a failure probability. The main difference between both approaches finds its way in the explicit inclusion of all sorts of failure-mechanisms (new approach), instead of focusing on the design waterlevel (old approach). The new safety standards are supported with a cost-benefit analysis where one takes account of the economic value of fatalities. Although improvements of the flood defences already started, the Dutch safety protocol for emergency measures still relies on the old approach, based on threshold-waterlevels. The question is, if emergency-measures are still taken in time when knowledge of the new risk-approach is applied. Therefore, this research developed a decision-method for flood emergency-measures. In our method, the call for evacuation is based on the same risk management approach as used to define the new safety standards. Evacuation can save loss of life, but flood-events and dike breaches are often uncertain until they happen. On the other hand, certain costs are involved if a call for evacuation is made. Therefore, the method assessed the threshold to support the decision to evacuate or not to evacuate, together with a social cost-benefit analysis including a monetary value for a fatality. The proposed method is developed on basis of a theoretical example and finally applied to dikering-area 43 in the Netherlands. By use of measured and forecasted water levels, and fragility curves describing the strength of the flood defences, the conditional probability of failure is defined to support the decisions “evacuation” and “no evacuation”. When the expected costs for evacuation are smaller than the expected costs for no evacuation, the measure becomes worthwhile. Costs are related to economy (a fraction of the GDP) and fatalities by the evacuation-process (car-accidents, hospitals). Benefits are defined by the prevented loss of life and the value of moved goods. These rely on the uncertain flood-event. Probabilities and scenarios can finally be combined to calculate the expected costs for a decision. By doing so, one can find the moment in the discharge-wave one should decide to act. This decision-moment is finally compared with current emergency-procedures, based on threshold-waterlevels. These results make clear if emergency-measures should be revised.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

Then a prototype, which is optimized based on isotropic acceleration, is presented. A static balancing quality of 98.7% was achieved for this prototype. Finally a dynamic evaluation (both method and experimental), in terms of isotropic acceleration, is performed for the static balancing solution on the Arrow robot.

(mentor)","2017","Over the past two decades, the use of wireless communication has increased dramatically, reaching a total global data usage of several exabytes per month, as of 2015. The transmitters (TX) used in wireless communication systems typically operate at efficiencies in the order of 20–30%, which puts a large strain both on the wireless network operators, due to the high energy costs, and the environment, due to carbon emissions. Since the power amplifier (PA) is by far the largest energy consumer in any transmitter system, the development of highly efficient PAs has become a popular research topic in recent years. One way in which the PA efficiency can be improved is by using the polar architecture, in which the signal to be amplified is split into envelope and phase components, which are presented separately at the input of the PA. This facilitates the use of non-linear but highly efficient amplifier classes, which improves the system efficiency. Further efficiency gains can be achieved by combining this approach with digital techniques as well as traditional efficiency enhancement techniques such as the Doherty topology. One of the major challenges associated with the polar architecture is the bandwidth expansion that occurs when converting from a Cartesian representation of the signal to envelope and phase. In particular, very few phase modulators have been reported in literature that support modulation bandwidths large enough for advanced communication standards such as WiFi, WiMAX and LTE. This thesis aims to tackle this problem by presenting a novel phase modulator concept which is both wideband enough to support 80MHz QAM signals, and frequency-agile so as to support the numerous communication standards in the low-GHz range. This concept has been implemented in TSMC’s 40nm CMOS technology, and although the performance of the phase modulator has not yet been experimentally verified, simulation results show that in a TX system with an ideal envelope path, the modulator can achieve 36 dB EVM and 47 dBc ACPR for an 80MHz 64-QAM signal at 2:4 GHz. At 900MHz, when the bandwidth is scaled proportionally to 30MHz, the phase modulator achieves 34 dB EVM and 47 dBc ACPR. The power consumption for these two cases is 33:3mW and 15:6mW, respectively, while the occupied chip area is 0:17mm2.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-01-25","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Electronics","","","",""

The function of the tool is to estimate the required dimensions and quantities of essential container, dry and liquid bulk terminal elements, in an early design phase. As well as to give an estimate of the construction costs of these marine terminals. Terminal element dimensions are for instance the quay length and storage area. Examples of terminal element quantities are the number of berths and the number of ship-unloading equipment. The spear point of the tool is the probabilistic approach, in which uncertainties -concerning design rule variables- are taken into account. This approach results in probability distributions for the dimensions and quantities. The aim of the tool is to aid terminal or port designers by allowing them to easily consider a vast amount of input combinations. The designer therefore does not have to make exact assumptions that could lead to certain important combinations not being considered. The computations that the tool performs are based on research in this study. This research concerns terminal design rules and guidelines, common values of design rule variables and unit costs. For two variables -of which no common values could be found- Expert Judgement Elicitation (EJE) on uncertainty is applied. The results are weighted combinations of uncertainty distributions elicited from the experts. A different EJE on dependence is applied to estimate the relationships between average import, export and transhipment container dwell times. Finally, the tool is applied to the EMO terminal in Rotterdam. The EMO terminal is the largest dry bulk terminal in Europe. This application makes it possible to compare the tool’s results to the actual terminal properties. For the same terminal a sensitivity analysis is performed on the estimated total construction costs, to certain variables.","Marine terminal design; containers; dry bulk; liquid bulk; design rules; construction costs; unit costs; probabilistic tool; Monte Carlo simulation; Expert Judgement Elicitation; uncertainty; dependence; Cooke’s Classical model; conditional probability technique; EMO terminal","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2017","Master thesis at two faculties: ""Civil Engineering and Geosciences"" and ""Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering"". Department: Offshore Engineering. With increasing wind power capacity, the impact of wind power on power system operation increases. For a mature integration of large amounts of wind power, controlling wind farm output by temporary curtailment becomes increasingly relevant. Wind farm curtailment provides valuable technical and economic opportunities for balancing the power system. However, quantifying the exact amount of curtailed wind power at the wind farm level is not trivial. This is because curtailment induces a reduction of the wake effects, complicating the determination of the available power in the wind. Understanding the reduced wake effect is important to improve the technical reliability and business case of wind power curtailment, especially for very large offshore wind farms. The purpose of this research is to present and validate an algorithm to determine the available power of a wind farm during curtailment. Current best practices in available power estimation is to sum the individual turbine available power signals. This leads to an overestimation, as the reduced wake effect is not accounted for. In the algorithm developed in this thesis, existing wake models play a key role in quantifying the reduced wake effect. These wake models have been validated first for wind turbine operation without curtailment and then for operation during curtailment. For the latter, curtailment experiments were prepared and executed on the existing nearshore wind farm Westermeerwind, consisting of 48 wind turbines in commercial operation. Based on that, the developed algorithm has been validated for wind turbines in a straight row and for sub-rated wind speeds. In the experiments, the first turbine in the row was curtailed and the reduced wake effect was clearly observed at the second turbine. The reduced wake effect led to a power increase of the second turbine of 45% to 80% of the curtailed power of the first turbine. However, it also led to a power decrease for the third turbine in a range of 5% to 40% of the curtailed power. No noticeable structural changes in power production were observed from the fourth turbine onward. The algorithm was shown to perform well in calculating the available power at the second turbine, with the Jensen wake model delivering the lowest error. For the third turbine, the algorithm did not perform well, due to relatively large errors of the wake models for the third turbine. The Larsen wake model resulted in the lowest error considering the available power of the whole row of turbines. Overall, it is concluded that the algorithm proposed and validated in this thesis delivers a significantly improved estimation of the available power during curtailment. It is recommended to continue study of the proposed algorithm by testing the performance of other wake models, performing more (types of) curtailment experiments and obtaining higher quality wind data.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2017-01-25","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","European Wind Energy Master","",""

(mentor)","2017","In FMCW radar systems, spectral estimation methods are used to determine the beat frequency of the reflected signal in order to obtain information about the range of scatterers relative to the position of the transmit/receive elements. Array processing techniques take advantage of the phase shifts per element and likewise use spectral estimation methods to determine angle information. Range-Doppler processing methods utilize the Doppler shifts per chirp caused by the motion of the reflector to estimate the radial velocities relative to the position of the receiver. The problem of estimation of these three parameters of scatterers in an area can then be simplified as a problem of spectral estimation over three separate domains. The recent algorithms for solving such a problem in the context of array based radar applications range from adaptive, nonparametric methods, subspace based parametric methods and sparse recovery methods. However, these methods mostly ignore the inter- and intra- pulse Doppler effects of multiple moving targets. Furthermore, with demand for more resolution, investigation of wideband effects on range-azimuth-Doppler estimation is necessary. In this thesis, we firstly develop a MATLAB based MIMO radar simulator, on which the theoretical models are to be tested. The first aim of the thesis is to investigate the joint range-azimuth estimation methods and the shortcomings of narrowband assumptions, especially on the DoA estimation problem. We propose a novel signal model specifically for LFMCW radar systems and two methods of joint estimation using this model. The next aim is to investigate the effects of the movement of the targets on accuracy of the estimation problem. We study these effects firstly on the range-azimuth estimation problem and provide a more detailed signal model, which, theoretically also allows for the joint estimation of range, azimuth and velocity parameters using only a single chirp. Then we look into joint estimation in three domains and provide a subspace based algorithm, using the proposed signal model, capable of solving this problem. The accuracy of the new signal model and performance of the estimation algorithm is then tested on data generated by the MATLAB based simulator. Comparisons are made with respect to state of the art, MUSIC based joint estimation algorithm and theoretical bounds. Furthermore, range-Doppler estimation is performed on real life data, taken from the Dolphin prototype NXP automotive radar system. Future works based on this model is proposed.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics","","","",""

(mentor); de Jongste, A.L. (mentor); Mosselman, E. (mentor); Blom, A. (mentor)","2017","Bangladesh is characterised by its complex river system, which includes the downstream ends of two of the largest rivers in the world: the Ganges and Brahmaputra. Extremely variable flows and fast morphological changes are the principal characteristics of this system, which presents exceptional challenges for river engineering. Distributary rivers from the major rivers in Bangladesh are a key element in providing fresh water to the South-West and Central regions of the country. With the arrival of the dry season and the drop of water levels in the rivers, some of the distributaries become disconnected during several months from their parent rivers because of aggradation at the offtake during the monsoon season. Acquisition of all the field data required for a detailed morphodynamic study of those offtakes is very often not possible, specially for preliminary designs or during the initial stages of a project. For the rivers of Bangladesh, bed topography data are even outdated in a matter of months because of the extremely dynamic nature of those rivers. In order to overcome this lack of data, the approach of this MSc thesis is to use a physics-based morphodynamic numerical model based only on the most significant characteristics of the offtake system to be analysed. If this model correctly reproduces the most important characteristics and evolution of the river and offtake system, it is then possible to use it for an initial assessment of remedial measures to prevent offtake closure. An analysis of the offtake systems is made before setting up the numerical model. The focus of this analysis is on the relevant physical processes for the evolution of offtakes. Furthermore, the causes of offtake closure occurring at the main distributaries of Bangladesh are identified and possible remedial measures are proposed to prevent them. The setup of the model is based on the findings from these previous analyses. The choice is for a 2D depth average numerical model using the software package Delft3D. A schematised geometry roughly based on the Ganges and Gorai rivers and offtake is used, with a total length of 100 km for the parent river and 20 km for the distributary channel. The simulation is initialised with a flat bed and a constant slope, which then develops into a realistic bed topography shaped by the morphological module of the numerical model. Because this model cannot be properly calibrated, as data available are not sufficient, the order of magnitude of model results is compared with observations of the river system. With this comparison, it is found that the model is able to reproduce the behaviour of the river system with enough accuracy to obtain the correct orders of magnitude for the evolution of the offtake system and the effects of interventions. The offtake behaviour simulated by the model is then analysed and used as reference scenario for the assessment of different engineering measures. The results of this assessment show that dredging the upstream part of the distributary river during the recession period of the monsoon can prevent the discontinuation of flow in the distributary river for the entire dry season, and improves the flow conditions for the following year. However, this measure needs to be applied regularly and does not stabilise the offtake in the long term. Other measures tested in the model are major dredging at the parent river to improve its alignment; construction of submerged erodible weirs; a flow divider and the use of longitudinal training walls to reduce the width of the parent river. However, these measures seem not to be effective in maintaining flow in the distributary river when implemented in the numerical model. In conclusion, the methodology developed in this thesis is able to overcome the lack of data availability and simulate realistic scenarios of the complex process of offtake closures. With this tool, it is possible to perform fast and inexpensive modelling of the behaviour of offtake systems and assessment of engineering measures to prevent offtake closure that otherwise would require much more resources.","offtake; Bangladesh; Gorai; Arial Khan; Old Brahmaputra; Dhaleswari; Delft3D; morphology","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Civil engineering","","23.95N, 89.11E"

(mentor)","2017","The concept of twin matrix composites was proposed in the 1980s by Vasiliev and Salov1, as a means to increase the transverse tensile failure strain of unidirectional composites without sacrificing the longitudinal tensile strength. This could be achieved by impregnating glass fiber bundles with a stiff epoxy matrix, and embedding the cured bundles in a flexible epoxy matrix, thereby developing so-called ""twin matrix composites"". Comparable concepts in literature indicate other potential advantages, such as improved design allowables, reduced fiber waviness or reduced manufacturing costs. During this research, the potential of twin matrix composites is further explored, by selecting suitable constituent materials, by developing manufacturing and test methods, and by examining the mechanical performance, with a focus on longitudinal compression. The two primary constituents of twin matrix composites are the composite bundles and the flexible matrix. The composite bundles used during this research are micropultrusions with a circular cross section, consisting of carbon fibers with an epoxy or BMI matrix. Three different micropultrusion diameters are selected. A flexible epoxy matrix is synthesized by blending two epoxy resins and an amine hardener to appropriate ratios. The flexible (neat) matrix is characterized using flexural testing, to determine the stiffness, and using DMA, to determine the glass transition temperature. Three matrices with a different stiffness are selected for the development of twin matrix composites. Both twin matrix composites and standard, ""single matrix composites"" (serving as a benchmark) are manufactured using wet filament winding. A dedicated mandrel is designed, with which thin-walled ring specimens are created. The specimens are cured inside an oven and sanded after demolding. Cross-sectional evaluations of the resulting specimens are performed using optical and scanning electron microscopy. To investigate the longitudinal tension and compression strength of the composites, two ring test set-ups are developed. The tension test is based on the NOL split disk method. The compression set-up consists of a compliant ring that is placed around the composite ring and is axially compressed, thereby exerting an external pressure on the composite. Using these set-ups, standard composites with a stiff and flexible matrix are tested, as well as twin matrix composites with different combinations of the three micropultrusion diameters and flexible matrix types. Using standard tensile tests, the ability of the flexible matrix to impart a higher transverse tensile failure strain to the composites as compared to a stiff matrix is assessed. The results of the ring tests on standard composites are also compared to literature and to results obtained with standard tests as a verification. The tension and compression strength of the twin matrix composites is then compared against that of the standard composites with both the stiff and flexible matrices. As such, the effect of the micropultrusion diameter and the flexible matrix stiffness on the strength and failure mode is evaluated. The compression failure is examined in more detail, by means of optical and scanning electron microscopy. Based on the insights obtained during this initial research, specific recommendations regarding desired material properties, manufacturing procedures or improvements of the test set-ups are made. Furthermore, directions of further research are suggested, such as dedicated materials research or advanced mechanical testing. Finally, potential applications of twin matrix composites are provided. This research provides a broad perspective on many relevant aspects of twin matrix composites, and important steps are taken towards further development of these composites. Promising results are obtained, in terms of mechanical properties and manufacturing advantages. As a consequence, it is concluded that twin matrix composites have definite potential for future applications and provide an interesting approach towards more efficient composites.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-1-25","Aerospace Engineering","Aerospace Structures & Materials","","","",""

(mentor)","2017","It is a well known fact that the international dredging industry is of major importance. As the dredging industry has made a significant contribution to the development of many world economies through the construction and maintenance of harbors, canals, and waterways. The construction and maintenance of waterways depths is a continuous process in many ports and harbors, as the bottom contours are constantly changing due to silting near the mouth of rivers. Moreover, the ship's become larger and draft requirements increase, ports need to deepen their channels to allow for deeper draft ships, to remain competitive with other ports. Despite the evolving dredging market, a trend towards harsher environments can be observed. Harsher environments with higher currents, more wind and waves, will be the subject of future dredging operations and developments. As dredging contractors want to undertake larger waterworks even in coastal areas, their equipments had to be adopted for these conditions.One of this equipments is the backhoe dredger, which is a widely used tool in the dredging industry since the early 1900s. In order to overcome the harsher environment advanced equipment is needed together with a thorough understanding of the processes involved during dredging operations with a backhoe dredger. In line with the recent trends, the use in harsher environments, ship and equipment builders like Royal IHC have to keep developing and expanding their knowledge. The increased competition from shipyards abroad resulted in the fact that it not sufficient to rely on commercial engineering software which is also accessible to competitors. Therefore IHC MTI has developed the computer program DODO, which is used to study the dynamic behaviour of vessels and components in waves under the influence of interaction with the soil or sea floor. The current DODO model of the backhoe dredger is based on certain assumptions for the sake of simplicity and time. One of the most important assumptions made in the current model, is the introduction of an additional damping matrix to account for the spud-ship interaction. However, this damping matrix is still uncertain due to the fact that friction and impact are neglected and therefore additional research is required. Royal IHC has started a study with purpose of improving knowledge in some areas. The view has been introduced that a more complete review of the entire set of approximations, assumptions and simplifications of the current DODO backhoe model is required. A new 3D model was build which was used to perform a non-linear, time domain analysis in which it was possible to account directly for all the significant effects due to dynamic and non-linear response. The model was used in order to identify the significance of the present non-linearities and various damping sources on the overall system behaviour. Furthermore, the model is used to obtain a linearized damping matrix, which can be implemented in the current DODO model and into a linear model. In order to ensure for an equivalent dynamic behaviour between the nonlinear model and the linear model, the stiffness and damping coefficients for the nonlinear cases needed to be linearized. The linearization showed that spacing causes a higher equivalent stiffness. In addition, impact also results in higher stiffness coefficients. The linearization also showed that impact results in lower damping coefficients due to the used impact model. The various damping sources were quantified using logarithmic decay method to determine the damping ratios. The methoed provided a reasonable damping ratio in exchange for (much) lower computational expenses. Furthermore, this method can be used to provide more of an insight on the damping behaviour of the ship in all six degrees of freedom due to the various damping sources. Finally, the simulations results of the nonlinear model were compared with those of a linear model in which the linearized paramters are implemented. The linear model showed comparable deflections in comparison to the nonlinear model. However, when a single damping and stiffness matrix with complete linearized coefficients is introduced for the ship, the displacements and rotations in certain directions are overestimated.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-01-25","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

(mentor); Magnier, L.B.M. (mentor)","2017","The average shopper in the US goes to the shopping mall more than two times a week for groceries and other items. During the shopping consumers often use shopping carts to move larger quantities of items than they can carry. But the shopping cart that is currently used to increase the carrying convenience of moving groceries stops at the car. From that point on there is still quite a lot of transporting to do to get the bought items to the place where they need to be. This step to step moving of the items results in inconvenience for the consumer. And there are currently no real solutions to make this easier accept bundling items in bags at the cashier, this only takes partial care of the problem. The overall process is a discontinues sequence of steps, and the develop product should help to unify and streamline this process. The project aims to create a product that makes the transportation of groceries from the aisle to the kitchen a more continues process. And doing this by using a product that is prepared for the future of shopping by considering trends and upcoming changes of the (groceries) market. In the end the goal was to create a product that increases the convenience of transporting of bought items. But that also gives the consumer the feeling that they are dealing with an evolution of the shopping cart. And in general streamlines the overall experience of transporting bought items from the shelve to the consumer’s house. The result of the project is the personal shopping cart concept. The cart consists of a shopping basket with a foldable set of wheeled legs mounted to the side of the cart. These wheels enable the cart to slide into the opened trunk of a larger size car (SUV). This is made possible by sliding tracks at the front and bottom of the cart that allow the basket to ‘ride’ in and out of the trunk. The handle pushes the legs together creating a lifting motion to get the cart to trunk height. After that, the user can keep pushing and move the legs upwards, and push them inwards into the car. Additional functionality for the cart is a higher, smaller version. The two halves of the basket slide inward to form a basket that is significantly decreased in size. Then the wheeled legs can be moved towards each other, lifting and decreasing the footprint of the cart. This transforms the cart from a large groceries shopping cart into a smaller more agile retail cart. For this graduation project four stakeholders were involved (University of technology Delft, Graduate student, Design firm and the Client) with all a different goal for the project. So the project was also a balancing act to fulfill all the goals of the involved parties. With the ultimate goal to at the end have one graduated student and one product concept. So next to the development of the concept for graduation, the client was also to be taken along in the process that is required to create a product concept. The project was executed in collaboration with the Dutch/German design firm Design2Gather based in Shanghai, China. The majority of the time spend on this project was conducted from the office in Shanghai. And the project was finished in Delft, The Netherlands.","Shopping cart; convenience; Car transportable","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","","",""

This manifests in an extensive literature study on the CE and an analysis of the company, followed by design suggestions for improvements of their current Jansen VISS steel curtail wall system. The second part of this thesis focusses on the development of an assessment method to evaluate the circularity of facades and to compare the selected design to existing curtain wall systems. The design phase has resulted in the development of a hybrid system, which is based on an exchangeable modular panel system that enhances the adaptation and transformation capacity of buildings. In the developed method, two key variables were used for assessment; the reuse potential, expressed in a Material Circularity Indicator and the transformation capacity, expressed in three possible future transformation scenarios for the office building Port City III. The evaluation showed that the hybrid system has indeed the most potential for the development of circular buildings. Moreover, this study showed that in order to contribute to a future sustainable steel (curtain wall) market, ODS NL has to change their role in the overall process, whereby their focus should lay more on the user phase and the end-of-life phase. For a complete transition they should change their business strategy, which is still focussed on a sell more sell faster model, to a more service based approach whereby the end-of-life phase is integrated. Therefore, ODS NL has to find ways to capture additional value from their products, for example by offering extra maintenance services, after-sales treatments, buy back guarantees or the creation of a cost-efficient reverse logistics.","Circular Economy; Steel curtain walls; Facade Design; Built Environment; Business strategies","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-01-23","Architecture and The Built Environment","Architectural Engineering + Technology","","","",""

From a technical perspective, there are challenges that deal with the integration of the electricity from renewables, specifically sources such as wind and solar that have an intermittent nature. The solution is to provide flexibility. Flexibility in generation, demand and storage. This can be achieved by intelligently connecting the electricity sector to the emerging electric vehicle sector. Rather than creating grid capacity overload by uncontrolled charging and peak renewable power production, electric vehicles can be intelligently charged by adapting their energy need to the variable nature of the wind and solar resource.

(mentor)","2017","Moderate and Intense Low-oxygen Dilution (MILD) combustion is established to achieve high thermal efficiency and low pollutant emissions, including both NOx and soot. The Eddy Dissipation Concept (EDC) is the most widely used combustion model in the existing numerical studies of turbulent MILD combustion. It is easy to implement and has acceptable computational cost. EDC is a turbulence-chemistry coupling model which assumes that the reaction zone can be modelled as a well-stirred chemical reactor, exchanging mass with the environment at a rate determined by turbulence. However, the low Damköhler number found within the homogeneous reaction zone brings a challenge. The standard EDC model is found to predict too early ignition. A simple solution is to modify the model constant parameters Cτ and Cγ to a different value using the experimental data, which is not effective since the method is case dependent. Recently, Parente et al. proposed an extension of EDC model which qualitatively calculates the model constants locally, depending on the local turbulent Reynolds number and Damköhler number. The new extended EDC model used in this work is a further development of Parente et al.'s model. We improved the model by assuming the chemical time scale is the time needed to traverse the fine structures (T = L* /SL) for both Cτ and Cγ, In this way, the model is able to quantitatively define Cτ and Cγ locally without any tuning. Besides, Cγ is found to be proportional to Da*3/4 rather than Da*1/2 in Parente's model. The new model is validated through the Delft-jet-in-hot-coflow (DJHC) burner database and further applied in a laboratory-scale MILD furnace in order to give theoretical insight. For the DJHC burner case, the RSM turbulence model is proved to give better agreement compared to the widely used modified standard k-ε model. The new extended BOC model is validated in terms of temperature, flow, and OH-concentration-based liftoff height. The temperature peak is captured better. A study of influencing factors, including the jet velocity, fuel temperature, and temperature and oxygen concentration of coflow, is undertaken. The influences of these issues on flame volume, liftoff height and peak temperatures are analysed. For the furnace case, the prediction of the new extended EDC model is compared with the EDC model with modified constant parameters. The new model can provide a comparable prediction compared to the widely used model. The analyse of NOx shows the maximum NO concentration is lower than approximately 10 ppmv in the furnace. The thermal NOx formation process is not dominant in the furnace studied.","MILD combustion; EDC; DJHC; turbulence chemistry interaction; model constants","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Energy & Process Technology","","","",""

(mentor); Van der Hoog, W. (mentor); De Haij, M. (mentor)","2017","This thesis shows the process and results of a graduation project on redesigning WOW-NL, a crowdsource platform that collects weather data for KNMI. The first phase consists of an analysis on the value that the WOW-NL platform creates for KNMI and the users. Internal and external research was conducted to understand the context and the interactions on the WOW-NL platform. The data of 320 WOW-NL weather stations forms an addition to KNMI’s monitoring network. The current observation network is not dense enough to measure and warn society for some of the potential dangerous weather phenomena, which is one of the main tasks for KNMI. However, evaluation of the WOW-NL generated data led to the conclusion that it could not be used for an instant application. It is to time consuming, and there are to many stations needed to use this data. To achieve quicker results the focus for the platform should be more towards the community and their use of the data; The vision stated in internal documentation made sense: “An active WOW-NL community where users contribute to an insight to weather and climate developments.” Interviews and an internet research on the WOW-NL community showed loads of creativity, knowledge and enthusiasm about the platform and the applications found with the data. Unfortunately the current applications of the data by the participants aren’t shown on the website, they were communicated via closed communication channel or personal websites. These research insights are used in a design for WOW that is focussed on utilising the unique value of the user group, and the value of the data provided. The design process is guided by the design goal ""Attract, empower and sustain suppliers of the platform by showing the societal benefit they serve.” Supporting the strengths of the user group with the value of the data, a new concept is developed: WOLC, A co-creation platform that uses the knowledge within the WOW-NL community to find utilisations of the data together with the expertise of KNMI. WOLC facilitates 3 main uses: It accommodates tutorials to learn and share how to acquire data. It accommodates information and discussion on weather phenomena to learn and share interpretation of the data and the weather. It supports ideation to find utilisation of the WOW data. This ideation process is divided into 5 themes related to societal benefits and connecting WOLC to KNMI’s tasks and mission: Risk reduction, Living environment, energy, hobby/sport and quality of measurements. With a guided ideation process the users are able to conceptualise their ideas into concrete utilisations of the data. Through voting and selection mechanisms the best ideas are selected for KNMI and the community. subsequently the selected ideas are to be presented to the management team in KNMI in order to be implemented. This platform attracts new users by showing concrete uses of the data to the users, KNMI and the visitors on the platform. In order to sustain the users on WOLC, employees will have to acknowledge the users for participating. This will be done in the platform by steering, supporting, listening and inspiring the users throughout their process. During the build phase the concept facilitates users to get 'help lines' where they can get in contact with KNMI experts, user experts and the community to help them in in the conceptualisation phase. WOLC is a collaborative research platform that utilises the potential for the WOW data and for the community, it is an opportunity for KNMI to get relevant in society and become a user centered institute.","platform","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design for Interaction","","","",""

The marsh on this intertidal area supports migratory birds and salmon, and it is part of the coastal protection of the city of Richmond. The marsh has faced severe recession of up to 500 m between 1989 – 2011 after having been stable for over 50 years. This paper presents the results of our study investigating potential mechanisms for this recession. Using satellite imagery, aerial photos, field observations, water level records, wind records and sediment samples the system was analyzed utilizing expertise from both local Canadian agencies and the Netherlands. The study focused on defining the complex interactions between hydraulic forcing, tidal channels, sandy bed forms, elevation, and the marsh itself. Results showed that tidal channels were lost, bed forms migrated and inundation increased in conjunction with the marsh recession. Hypothesized causes like sea-level rise, a sediment deficit, migrating bed forms and pond formation could not singularly support the observed changes, and results leaned towards a combination of these causes based on the complex feedback mechanisms that inevitably are present in such a system. These feedback mechanisms (e.g. anoxic conditions, soil compaction, ponding) reduce the potential for marsh growth further after recession is initiated. Fundamental understanding in the complex interactions driving the dynamics of salt marshes is a prerequisite for successful development of future restoration strategies.","feedback mechanisms; salt marsh; Sturgeon Bank, Vancouver, Canada; Fraser Delta; marsh recession; marsh dynamics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic engineering","","","","49.156528, -123.202019"

(mentor); Polder, R.B. (mentor); Grünewald, S. (mentor)","2017","Blast Furnace Slag (BFS) is a latently hydraulic material used as additive or substitute for Portland cement. The market share for BFS cement in the Netherlands is currently more than 60%. Previous research proved the high resistance of slag-rich concrete in aggressive environments such as exposure to acid, chloride ingress or sulphate attack, but also the poor resistance against carbonation. The carbonation of a Blast Furnace Slag (BFS) cement paste involves the conversion of calcium silicate hydrate gel (also known as C-S-H) to porous silicate hydrates. As a result, it can be expected that the strength of the matrix decreases. Consequently, the carbonated BFS concrete is vulnerable to scaling under the combined load of freezing–thawing and de-icing salt. The disintegration of the concrete surface results in a higher vulnerability to other chemical attacks decreasing its durability. Sodium monofluorophosphate (Na-MFP) gained attention as surface treatment as a corrosion inhibitor. Recent studies revealed the recovering effect of Na-MFP on the microstructure of carbonated BFSC pastes with respect to their frost-salt scaling durability. Recently published, a study by Kempl and Çopuroğlu (2016) indicated that the impregnation of hardened carbonated cement pastes with aqueous Na-MFP resulted in a recovery of the initial pH of 98.85% and 79.81%, of an untreated cement paste for CEM I and CEM III/B, respectively. Their results brought insights on the reaction of Na-MFP solution with the cement matrix carbonated or non-carbonated. The goal of this thesis was to investigate the influence of applying sodium monofluorophosphate (Na-MFP) on the microstructural and micromechanical properties upon a surface treatment for carbonated BFS cement with different slag concentrations. The main objective of this study is split into two parts: 1) to investigate the penetration of 25% Na-MFP solution as surface treatment into the CEM III /B cement mortar or cement paste under different curing conditions and carbonation periods, and 2) to characterize the influence of the solution on the micromechanics and microstructure of the cement paste samples. The cement types used in this study were: 1. Ordinary Portland Cement (CEM I 42,5 N) which serves as a reference 2. Blast Furnace Slag Cement with a slag content of 67% (CEM III/B 42,5 N HSR LH) 3. Ternary blended cement (SP Mix) with a slag content of 55%, 30% CEM I 52,5 R and 15% fly ash. For the first part of the study polarized light microscopy (PLM), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) with Energy Dispersive X-Ray Analysis (EDX) and stereomicroscope were used for analysing the penetration of the Na-MFP solution into the cement matrix from the surface. For the second part, analysing the effect of the Na-MFP solution on the microstructure of the cement paste the following tests was applied: Nano-indentation (NI), Mercury Intrusion Porosimetry (MIP), and Thermogravimetric Analysis/Differential Scanning Calorimetry (TGA/DSC). The penetration results indicate that applying the Na-MFP solution once on the surface after the CEM III /B mortar sample (W/C=0.45) was carbonated was more effective than before carbonation. The penetration depth increased at increasing carbonation period. The curing methods, wet or sealed, do not show a significant influence on the penetration depth. The penetration depth for mortar samples was higher compared to the paste sample with the same water-cement ratio (W/C), cement type and carbonation period. Applying the Na-MFP solution on the surface of ternary blended cement paste, as used in the research (SP Mix), resulted in a higher resistance to carbonation compared to slag cement paste with the same W/C and carbonation period. The results of the microstructure analysis showed that the Na-MFP solution improved the strength (the elastic modulus and the hardness), permeability (decrease in the porosity) and provided high resistance against carbonation. The study showed that applying the Na-MFP solution before carbonation increased the porosity for the CEM III/B and SP Mix cement paste especially, with W/C =0.6. The recover capillary porosity due to carbonation was 38% and 26% for CEM III/B and SP MIX cement paste, respectively. In conclusion, the microstructural properties of the treated cement matrix were affected by the water - cement ratio in conjunction with the condition of the cement paste, whether the sample was carbonated or non-carbonated.","blast furnace slag cement; carbonation; Sodium Monofluorophosphate; microstructure","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","","",""

In hot and humid environments, most of the main mechanisms of thermoregulation are rendered ineffective or are not efficient enough anymore to compensate for the heat production during high intensity exercise. Prolonged exposure to too high body temperatures can lead to increased irritability, the loss of concentration, but more importantly lead to the loss of capacity to do precise mental/physical tasks and show faster fatigue and exhaustion. In severe cases it can lead to hyperthermia and other heat related illnesses. This project aims to develop a new cooling garment for rowers to be used during competition or training. The rowers are kept cool using special designed pads incorporated in a shirt (and pants) that are able to transfer heat using conduction. As opposed to its predecessors, the pads designed in this project maximize the contact surface area with the body, providing more cooling at the same amount of volume. The pads are cooled with the help of thermoelectric cooling, a beneficial side effect of this is that in very cold environments the thermoelectric cooling can be reversed to provide heating instead. The whole system is regulated using sensor on the skin, signaling if more or less cooling is needed. Initial user tests done with the prototype show promising results, the subject stating that the feeling of being cool on the entire torso was definitely apparent. Thermal imaging of the pads can back up that when active, the pads indeed cool down noticeably and that the cooling is spread across the whole surface of the pads.","cooling; rowing; smart clothing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2019-01-20","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","Integrated Product Design","",""

(mentor)","2017","Offshore wind is a fast growing industry that has the potential to play an increasing role in the near future of power generation. As the industry evolves, wind farms are constructed further offshore where the wind is less turbulent and more space is available to increase the size of the wind farms. Furthermore, the capacity and size of wind turbine generators is growing due to technical developments. As a result, the foundation structure increases in size to assure stability and sufficient support of the generator. In general a monopile (large diameter steel cylinder) is the preferred foundation due to its economic benefits and relatively simple installation. In 2015, approximately 80% of all the offshore foundations installed in Europe were monopiles. This amount is expected to rise taking into account offshore wind farms that are currently being developed. For the installation of a monopile, a large amount of energy is applied by the impact of a hammer on top of the pile. This impact generates waves that propagate through the surrounding air, water and soil over large distances and disturb the marine life. Consequently, pile driving has become a strictly regulated construction process. Therefore, the offshore wind industry developed a variety of noise mitigation methods to reduce the underwater noise. However, these are expensive methods, driving the costs of noise mitigation till approximately 15% of the total installation costs of an offshore wind farm foundation. Noise which directly radiates into the water is referred to as the primary noise path. Noise which re-radiates from the soil back into the water is referred as the secondary noise path. This is illustrated in the figure. With increasing size of the monopiles, the ring frequency of the shell (the frequency at which the monopile moves radially outwards and inwards together) shifts towards lower frequencies. In addition, the amount of energy required to drive the monopile into the soil increases, resulting at a longer duration of the impact force and hence lower frequencies to be excited. Low frequency waves are less attenuated in soil compared to high frequencies, increasing the influence of the secondary noise path. However, most of the noise mitigation systems nowadays do not consider the secondary noise path and hence become less effective in reducing underwater noise generated by large monopiles. The aim of this research is to investigate ways to reduce noise levels directly at the source of the noise, instead of mitigating the radiated noise. This is achieved by optimizing the impact force with respect to noise, while keeping the drivability unimpaired. First of all, insight in the noise propagation during installation of a large sized monopile is obtained. This is done by modeling acoustics with a basic spring dashpot model and a more advanced elastic medium model derived by Tsouvalas and Metrikine (2013,2014). The analysis shows a large amount of energy at low frequencies carried by waves traveling along the soil-water interface, so called “Scholte waves”. Both models are validated with measurements from a project where large sized monopiles were installed. The impact force, which serves as input for both models, is obtained from the drivability program GRLWEAP. For the optimization process, multiple steps are taken. Firstly, the dominant acoustic frequencies of the pile-water-soil system are derived that result in a high response after excitation. Secondly, a method is developed to evade the dominant acoustic frequencies in the amplitude excitation spectrum of the hammer. In order to keep the drivability with the adjusted impact force unimpaired, a basic non-linear drivability model is developed based on mass, springs and dashpots. The non-linearity is limited to the description of the sliding of the monopile into the soil with locally reacting non-linear springs. A concept which still needs to be verified for the case of large piles and relatively low frequencies. Finally, an additional analysis on the effect of the adjusted impact force on the noise levels is performed. The results show an increased amount of energy at low frequencies carried by waves traveling along the soil-water interface. Due to the high geometrical and material damping in the soil, the high frequency compressional waves attenuate rather quickly with increasing distance from the pile, resulting at shear and Scholte waves being dominant at larger distances. The energy carried by the latter is increased compared to the previous analysis with the non-adjusted impact diagram. However, the Scholte wave produces only pressure fluctuations in the water close to the soil-water interface and not further up into the water column. With the current derived analysis method, the noise levels at 100 m from the piling source are reduced while drivability is kept largely unimpaired.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","","","",""

The registration of 2D or 3D point sets is a common problem in computer vision [9], with applications that include aligning MRI/CT scans, and simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) in robotics [21] to name a few. The most common approach to solve this problem involves some variant of the Iterated Closest Point algorithm [2], which requires a preliminary rough registration to work properly lest it get trapped in local optima. A globally optimal ICP was published in 2015 [29], which no longer requires an approximate pre-registration, and will not get stuck in local optima, but it suffers from sensitivity to outlier noise [29]. A variant of ICP that might get stuck in local optima was published in 2014 [1], which provides robustness against outlier noise. This thesis attempts to bridge the space between these two methods and provide a method that is both robust against outliers and provides a guarantee of global optimality. Results over three sets of numerical experiments and two real world datasets show that the method is comparable and even better in some cases than either the global or the robust local methods when outlier noise is present and initial pose is unknown.","computer vision; point set registration; global optimisation; robust statistics; 3D","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2017-01-19","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Intelligent Systems","","Computer Sciences","",""

Improvement of the administration control of these passive devices can reduce the cost of therapy, improve the quality of care and make high quality IV therapy more widely available. A new technique for both flow rate sensing and flow rate adjustment is presented. The flow rate sensing technique makes use of a combination of two sensors. This combination of sensors facilitates accurate overall flow rate sensing by combining short and long term flow rate information.

(mentor)","2017","The increasing globalwarming and climate change has boosted research on sustainable energy in the last few decades leading to a lot of research being carried out on wind energy. Wind turbines have played a major role in harvesting wind energy withHorizontal AxisWind Turbines (HAWTs) being the dominant design. However, for urban and offshore applications, Vertical AxisWind Turbines (VAWTs) have been under consideration for a while. VAWTs have some inherent advantages such as no need for a yawingmechanism, easy operation and maintenance, low noise emission, and better potential performance under skewed and unsteady wind conditions. But due to lack of research on VAWTs, they have not been commercialized on a scale which is equal to that of HAWTs. This study is one of such attempts for a better understanding of VAWTs. The primary aim of this study is to explore and analyse the behaviour of VAWTs under the influence of turbulent wind. This target has been achieved by analysing the loads on the turbine and their effect on its fatigue life under the influence of constant wind and turbulent wind. For this purpose, first one hour turbulent wind fields based on statistical models were generated using the turbulence simulator, ‘TURBSIM’ and two-dimensional turbulent wind fields were extracted from the generated wind fields. Next, the simulations of a two-dimensional vertical axis wind turbine using the generated turbulent wind fields were done in an aeroelastic code named ‘Unsteady Two-Dimensional Vorticity Aerodynamics (U2DiVA)model’. These simulationswere done between the cut-in (4 m/s) and cut-out (25 m/s) wind speeds of the turbine at intervals of 1 m/s. The results from these simulations were the streamwise force, cross-streamwise force and the moment about the quarter-chord points of the airfoils of the blades. A post-processing tool was then developed for the processing of these results. Using this tool and the results of the simulations, the equivalent tangential force, the equivalent radial force and the equivalent moment on the airfoilswere calculated. All calculationswere done for both types of wind. First the equivalent loads at each wind speed were calculated and then the total equivalent loads were calculated. The equivalent loads were calculated for various values of inverse slope (m) of the S-N curve of thematerial used to manufacture the blades of the turbine. The same procedure was repeated with constant wind. Finally,the changes in total equivalent loads under turbulent wind were calculated with respect to total equivalent loads under the constant wind. The variation in these changes with respect to the change in the value ofmwas then calculated. Additionally, the effect of phase angle (angle between the blades and the incoming windstream at the beginning of the simulation) on the equivalent loads was also calculated. The value of m used for this case was 10 as recommended in literature and the four phase angles chosen were 0o, 45o, 90o and , 135o.The equivalent loads at various wind speeds were calculated for the different values of m and various peaks were observed at various wind speeds. It was recommended that the peaks can be avoided using a suitable control scheme to control the rotational speed of the rotor. The changes in total equivalent loads under the influence of turbulent wind were found to be less than 0.2% which indicates that the effect of turbulence on the fatigue life of VAWTs is not so significant. The value of m at which the change was smallest was found to be around 3. Under phase effect, the variation of the radial force and the moment with wind speed seemed to follow Gaussian distribution at phase angles of 45o, 90o and 135o. The total equivalent loads were found out for all the phase angles and the change in these loads were found out with respect to 0o phase angle. These changes were quite high and indicate that the operation of a VAWT at phase with incoming wind can be detrimental for the fatigue life of the VAWT.","Windenergy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Aerodynamics, Wind Energy & Propulsion","","Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

(mentor)","2017","The growth of traffic densities has increased the concentrations of air pollutants, especially in city centres. Although the natural immune system of the human body can withstand low levels of exposure to air pollutants, exposure to high levels of air pollutants can lead to adverse health effects and even death. These high exposure levels are often present at city centres, due to high traffic densities at these areas. Therefore, in this research is explored if exposure levels to air pollutants can be decreased by improving traffic distributions. In this research the benefits and challenges are explored of a traffic load balancing system that has the objective to improve the air quality locally, while bounding the length of the detours that are needed to achieve this. Traffic dispersion is achieved by influencing routes of individual drivers by a collective navigation system. A weighted combination of travel time and air pollutant emissions is minimized to achieve lower air pollution exposure levels to citizens, while drivers maintain short travel times. Nitrogen Oxide (NOx) is used to bound the vehicle emissions locally, while the emission of Carbon Dioxide (CO2) is minimized globally. For each car an emission trace is constructed using an emission model. The emission traces are combined to form a time-dependent emission map. This time-dependent emission map is used for the exploration of routes that have a lower impact on the health of people that live near these routes. The approach is evaluated by simulation on real-life maps with an estimation of the traffic demand. The weighted combination approach is configured and compared to a base case where the drivers would only optimize their travel time. Using the simulation, it is shown that the exceedance of local thresholds of the NOx concentrations can be reduced, with only a small increase in travel time. Furthermore is explored what the effect is if only a part of the drivers would participate in the constructed load balancing system, while the other drivers would optimize their own travel time. By simulation is shown that even if only a part of the drivers would participate in this traffic load balancing system, the air quality can still be improved with a marginal cost of additional travel time.","Traffic Load Balancing; Air Quality; Multi-Objective Route planning; Route Choice","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Software Technology","","Embedded Systems","IN4600 / IN4610",""

These earthquakes are new to the region and the structures built there are not designed for it. Therefore, they pose a great risk for the historical structures and people living in the area. Most of the buildings there are built using masonry and to analyze such structures on how they will be affected by earthquakes using currently available tools and methods is rather complicated. In this report, the author investigates the use of available continuum damage mechanics models for the purpose of simulating orthotropic masonry behavior during an explicit integration analysis. The material behavior is described in Fortran programming language and is used as a custom user subroutine (VUMAT) in Simulia Abaqus finite element analysis software. The developed material model exhibits 3D elasticity and 2D plane plasticity. Furthermore, it is assumed that two general failure mechanisms are present. One associated with tensile and shear brittle fracture represented by Rankine type yield surface and other with distributed crushing of a material represented by Hill type yield surface. The model exhibits uncoupled damage evolution in the tension regime and coupled in compression. Additionally, the model supports tensile crack closure, while in compression it accumulates the plastic deformations and if an element is crushed it can be flagged for deletion from the mesh. The model is formulated in such a way that most of the properties in material directions are independent of one another. The developed model was tested by examining its behavior in analyses where numerical models were composed out of one or few elements. Additionally, for experimental comparison, four shear walls were modelled, three subjected to monotonic loading and one to cyclic. The analyses closely agree to experimental results even when using raw test data. The material model is stable due to the explicit approach and provides qualitative results as it is flexible enough to be used for various types of analyses, either static or cyclic.In the final part of the report, further developments are considered, including improvements to the code base, additional testing, and development of a custom element.","material model; Masonry; FEM; damage mechanics; earthquakes; Groningen; Fortran; Python","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","","",""

This tool is part of the Initiator which is a conceptual/preliminary aircraft design tool developed by the FPP group. The methodology comprises out of a synergy between empirical relationships and low order aerodynamic analysis in terms of potential flow theory. The tool's empiricism originates from Datcom's semi-empirical Critical Section Method (CSM) and the Pressure Difference Rule (PDR). To complement deficiencies, routines have been implemented regarding induced angle of attack, flap lift effectiveness, chord extension, and multi-element lift curve slope. For rapid convergence, the Newton-Rapson root finding method is coupled with a Kreisselmeier- Steinhauser function to efficiently find the critical stalling conditions which are defined within both the CSM and PDR. The proposed tool is validated against several experimental test cases: A Fokker F27 straight wing model in clean configuration; two 45 degrees swept-back reference wings in clean configuration; and two Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE)’s 28 degrees swept-back wing having a variable span deployed single-slotted Fowler flap. The validation demonstrated that the maximum lift coefficient could be predicted within a 11% error margin while requiring a computational expense of mere seconds. Erroneous stall angle results were found on swept-back wings due to the negligence of spanwise boundary layer flow effects on wing stall. Configurations with high flap deflection angles showed deficiencies due to the inability to account for the combined viscous effects which prevail in high-lift flow within a conceptual approach.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Aerodynamics, Wind Energy & Propulsion","","Flight Performance and Propulsion","",""

(mentor)","2017","Currently the production process of acoustic guitar factories does not result in instruments with equal dynamical behaviour, due to the varying material properties of wood from tree to tree. Experienced individual guitar builders are able to handle those material variations, but this is a labour intensive process because there is no structured methodology available about how to obtain a certain desired frequency response. In this study it is investigated if the perceived sound produced by a guitar is controllable by using dynamic response optimization methods in order to adjust geometric design parameters during the production process. The goal is to find a method which is both able to improve the consistency between mass-produced instruments and to decrease the required building time of handbuilt guitars. Until now no research is available which uses optimization methods in order to shape the dynamic response of a guitar over a range of frequencies. Previous research presented an analytical model which is able to give a quantitative description of a guitar’s dynamic response. The response is characterized by a measurement of the sound pressure level at 1 meter distance over a range of excitation frequencies. It was shown that the sound of a guitar is mainly determined by the dynamic behaviour of its top plate. This study uses a finite element model in order to estimate the effect of geometric design variations. The finite element model is used in combination with an optimization algorithm which shapes the dynamic response to a certain desired response. Due to this optimization approach the finite element model needs to be evaluated for many combinations of design variables. A computationally cheap finite element model is needed to approximate the physical behaviour of the guitar’s top plate. Based on the results of the optimization algorithm it is concluded that it is indeed possible to control the perceived sound produced by a guitar, by using dynamic response optimization methods in order to adjust geometric design parameters during the production process. Although some aspects need to be worked out further before the approach presented in this research can be implemented in a production process, the theoretical background will definitely be useful in order to improve consistency between instruments by using frequency response measurements during the building process.","Optimization; Guitar","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Precision and Microsystems Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2017","Travelling through airports can be quite a stressful experience for passengers. Airlines, such as KLM, want to make the journey of their passengers through airports as comfortable as possible. This thesis proposes an indoor localization system for airlines called AirLoc. The research question was: ""Which airport specific indoor localization method can be developed, that is ideal for airlines and can be applied at multiple airports?"". Different localization methods were discussed and pedestrian dead reckoning was chosen as the most suitable method, because it is infrastructure free and requires no additional investments. AirLoc is implemented on an Android smartphone and uses a motion model as a sensing stage, pedestrian dead reckoning as the localization method and a particle filter combined with landmarks as the refinement method. The location based services include the passenger journey and airport navigation. A particle filter was created that can be used on a complex polygon based map, by using polygon geometry and by creating special collision detection rules and optimizations, such as obstacle distance measurements. Map data of different airports can be included to make the system work at multiple airports. A complete motion model was created that does step detection, step length estimation and heading estimation dynamically. The heading estimation can be used while the phone is in different orientations, by using an initialization stage in which the GPS heading is used to determine the walking direction relative to the orientation of the phone. This estimation has an error of 30 degrees. AirLoc was compared to the Polestar system, which is based on Bluetooth fingerprinting and is used in the Schiphol app. The system was tested in two orientations, hand-held and in a pocket. AirLoc has a mean error of 6.17 meters when held in hand and an accuracy of 7.23 meters when put inside the pocket. The estimated location of AirLoc is always in the correct area and at a reachable location thanks to the collision detection of the particle filter and it removes the glass wall problem introduced by infrastructure based methods. This makes AirLoc more suitable for location based services such as airport navigation. AirLoc consumes only half of the energy consumed by infrastructure based systems, such as Polestar. A system is also proposed that calculates queuing times at the airport security, by using activity monitoring combined with an x-ray landmark. Testing shows that the queueing time could be estimated with an error of 14 seconds.","Indoor localization; KLM; Airport; Schiphol; Particle filter; Smartphone; Android; PDR; polygon based Map","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-01-17","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Software Technology","","Embedded Systems","",""

Additional, the installation of electronics and inert gas purging systems to protect the optics against the abrasive optical beam extends the amount of components in the optical system, while keeping the surface area of the overall optical system as small as possible. Recent developments in optical systems lead to innovations of optical flexure mounts towards a more compact, accessible and user-specific system with integrated functionality at consistently high standards of optical stability. Additive manufacturing, commonly named 3D printing, offers new possibilities of designing optical flexure mounts, since the layer-wise manufacturing approach allows the production of highly complex parts compared to traditional processes. Topology optimization is a mathematical design tool that can help to design these increasingly complex parts, such as the optical mount, by computing optimal material distributions for a given objective with a determined set of constraints and boundary conditions. The thesis objective is bilateral: The first research objective investigates the design of compliant mechanisms for industrial optical mounts by means of additive manufacturing. The second research objective investigates the suitability of Topology Optimization for designing compliant mechanisms for optical mounts.

Due to this subsidence, the city is sinking further to under sea level. This has influence on the flood safety, both from an extreme sea event as an extreme rainfall event. The major cause of the subsidence is assumed to be the groundwater extraction, which takes place due to a lack of piped water. To reduce subsidence, the groundwater extraction must stop. It is concluded that this would not be feasible in the short term and scenarios are made on how subsidence will continue in the next years.<br/> <br/>To ensure flood safety, measurements have to be taken. Research has already been carried out for West Jakarta, but this report focuses on solutions for East Jakarta. Four different solutions are developed to ensure flood safety. The first is to heighten the coastal dike and the flood defences along the river with the same level as the relative subsidence. To accomplish this, high flood defences should be constructed in the densely populated areas along the rivers. A spatial analysis is performed to come to a cost estimation model for the necessary land acquisition for three types of flood defences. These designs are combined to come to a cost efficient design. Another way to ensure flood safety is to close off the rivers and to pump the water into sea. In this case heightening of the flood defences along the rivers is not necessary. To reduce the peak discharges and thus the needed pumping capacity, a retention lake should be built. This can be done inland, but it is concluded that this will not be a cost efficient solution. A more cost efficient solution is to construct an offshore retention lake. This can be done by building an outer sea dike. In this case, the rivers will flow into the retention lake, which is maintained at a given water level. The pumping capacity needed to ensure flood safety depends on the size of the lake. An optimum has to be found to come to the most cost efficient design. In this study it was concluded that the most cost efficient solution is to not make a retention lake at all, but install pumps with sufficient capacity instead to handle the peak discharge. To reduce the pumping capacity, tidal gates can be constructed at the river mouths. A great advantage of this solution is that an amount of pumps can be constructed to deal with mild subsidence rates and more pumps can be built when concluded that subsidence rates turn out to be larger. In this way an adaptive solution is created.<br","Flood Protection Jakarta","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","","MP229","-6.2371854, 106.8010383"

A better understanding of the way shoreface nourishments interact with the initial beach profile may help to reduce the degree of empiricism in nourishment design. Literature study has shown that numerical modelling is commonly used to design shoreface nourishments and to assess their development and efficiency. It has also shown that there are two dominant mechanism are to be expected from a shoreface nourishment to lower the coastal erosion. These mechanisms correspond to an increase in beach width and a lowering in significant wave height. Previous performed studies on shoreface nourishment design effects along the North-Holland coast (de Sonneville, 2012) concluded that the differentiating factors possibly influencing the counteraction of coastal erosion are; offshore distance, height and alongshore length. Therefore the objective of this study is to investigate how the significant wave height and beach width are affected by changing the; offshore distance, height and length of a shoreface nourishment using a process based modelling suite. These effects are divided in two different time scales: • First the long term shoreface nourishment effects are modelled in Delft3D to check how the beach width and wave height are affected after one year of morphological modelling. • The short term storm events effects of a shoreface nourishment are checked by modelling a storm event in XBeach. To see whether the effects per nourishment are alike for various beaches, two different cases are considered for the long term modelling approach. For the location of the two cases eyes fell on previous studies on shoreface nourishments in Noordwijk (NL) and Nags Head (NC,USA). Long term modelling results of both cases show that shoreface nourishments with low height and large alongshore length are best for lowering the significant wave height and increasing the beach width. Differences per case are found in the offshore distance of the nourishment. In Noordwijk a nourishment behind the outer breaker bar is regarded as the best design to counteract coastal erosion, where in the Nags Head case a nourishment on top of the breaker bar is preferred. As waves shape the lateral beach profile through a morphodynamic feedback loop, profiles tends to flatten as the wave height increases, thereby dissipating more wave energy. This transition between beach states and the response time needed to changes between these states implies a form of efficiency. While adding a shoreface nourishment to the lateral profile, its efficiency for changing between beach states should remain. Looking at the preferred designs per case, it shows that both designs follow the pre-nourishment profile the best, therefore making it easier for the beach to adapt to a new beach state. This concludes that shoreface nourishment with long alongshore length which follows the initial crossshore profile the best results in the lowest significant wave height and largest increase in beach width. The short term storm effects are checked my modelling the 1953 Watersnoordramp using the preferred shoreface nourishment in the Noordwijk case. This modelling approach yields in inconclusive results as the modelling duration is too short to observe differences between the scenario’s with or without the nourishment. However, the nourishment tends to help the reshaping of the profile towards a more dissipative storm state as more sediment is added in the coastal zone, implying more wave dissipation in the long term. More research has to be performed to confirm this hypothesis","","en","student report","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

These devices often make use of piezoelectric actuators, which exhibit creep and hysteresis. In open loop operation, hysteresis and creep limit the performance. Hysteresis limits the precision of the compensation and creep reduces the performance during extended periods of time. In research, many feedforward compensation methods for these effects have been developed. In this thesis, a dynamic Generalized Prandtl-Ishlinskii model is constructed, consisting of a Generalized Prandtl-Ishlinskii model to compensate for the hysteresis and a feedforward zero phase error tracking controller to compensate the creep. The dynamic Generalized Prandtl-Ishlinskii model is tested on a deformable mirror and lens. The singleinput and single-output performance is evaluated for step signals, a sawtooth signal and a more realistic signal. The multiple-input and multiple-output performance is tested for a realistic signal as well. It is found that the dynamic Generalized Prandtl-Ishlinskii model reduces the normalized root mean square of the tracking error by 38.5% on the mirror and by 53.8% on the lens for multiple-input and multiple-output operation. This reduction is larger compared to a static Generalized Prandtl-Ishlinskii model. At the end of the thesis, propositions for future improvements of the identification of the model are made.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-01-16","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Delft Center for Systems and Control (DCSC)","","","",""

(mentor); Van Keulen, A. (mentor)","2017","Since its introduction, Topology Optimization (TO) has been applied to a broad range of design cases. TO is a material distribution method which finds the optimal material lay-out for a given design space while upholding given constraints and boundary conditions. This has made the method popular in structural mechanics where it is used to find concept designs for a wide range of structural problems. In this thesis TO will be applied to a structural case inspired by a problem found in ship design: the connections between the hull and the decks as well as the connections between decks. These connections have a significant influence on the behaviour of the ship as they determine the stiffness of the ship. With TO it is possible to find new designs for these connections. Applying TO on these connections is not straightforward as they are a part of a large system, and the interaction with the system must be taken into account for realistic results. This complicates the transformation of the ship response into boundary conditions for the TO model. In this thesis this problem is translated into a general problem where the design region and the global model will be modelled as separate substructures.The Lagrange multiplier method is introduced in this thesis to couple the substructures with non-conforming meshes. Tests in this thesis show the advantages of the method, it is able to couple non-conforming substructures and the error between a coupled highly nonconforming structure (up to 6 times smaller elements between the substructures) and a single structure remains below 1%. However, the Lagrange multiplier method is not free of disadvantages: it introduces additional unknowns, it makes the system indefinite and gaps and penetrations can be present on the interface due to the weak compatibility, changing the stiffness of the interface. The optimization process is only applied to one substructure. The test results show that the coupling has an effect on the stiffness of the interface, resulting in a different design when the non-conformity between substructures increases. A buffer-zone is introduced in order to exclude the interface elements from the optimization process and this will prevent the influence of coupling on the TO. The designs almost match perfectly with this buffer zone and the differences between the displacements and the compliance of the single structure case is _ 0.3%. Using static condensation it is possible to reduce the size of the system resulting in a reduction of the computational cost. The Degrees of Freedom (DoFs) of the global structures, and the Lagrange multipliers are removed, leaving only the DoFs of the substructure that is optimized. This will lead to a system that has the size of the model in the design region and which is unaffected by the size of the systems connected to it. The designs obtained using the condensed systems do not differ from the design obtained using the complete system, while the computational cost per iteration is greatly reduced and made constant. New steps are introduced that will add to the total computational time, such as constructing the condensed stiffness matrices. But these steps only need to be done once and this increase of computational cost is lower than the total reduction obtained. The method has been tested on a problem consisting of 4 substructures with non-conforming element sizes. With the correct buffer-zone the designs found by TO are almost equal and the difference in compliance is low (_ 2.3%). The power of static condensation is also shown in this test case, the calculation time of the optimization process is reduced by 40 to 80 %. Concluding that a design region can be coupled as a substructure to an existing model and optimized without substantially increasing the computational cost.","Topology optimization; Substructures; Lagrange multiplier method; non-conforming meshes; System-component problem","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2017-01-16","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Precision and Microsystems Engineering","","Engineering Mechanics","",""

(mentor); Molenaar, W.F. (mentor)","2017","Additional thesis - The Maeslant barrier was the final piece of the Delta works which protects a large area of the Netherlands. However the present barrier seems to fulfil his function, several Dutch experts have doubts about the system. However the discussion on the Maeslant barrier not being safe enough refers mostly to future scenarios. Experts expect that the barrier already will not provide enough protection from storm surges as of 2070. The goal of this research is to investigate an alternative solution for the upgrading of the existing Maeslant barrier in order to make it more reliable for the future. The two functional requirements that all future solutions must fulfil are assuring enough safety against storm surges and providing enough navigation space for ships. The new waterway has to be accessible at any time during normal conditions. For the hydraulic boundary conditions future water levels are taken into account by implying the most extreme Deltascenario steem. In a variant study four different designs are worked out. Design A introduces a solution with navigation locks. This solution closes of the new waterway entirely which can be an advantage for safety reasons but also a disadvantage in terms of navigation. The second design consist of an inflatable rubber barrier like the Ramspol barrier. The mode of operation and in terms of maintenance the inflatable barrier has a lot of advantages, two of the biggest disadvantages are however the tension forces and stresses in the membrane and the fact that the dimensions exceed the largest inflatable rubber barrier by the triple. Design C consist of a new barrier with tumble gates either hydraulic or pneumatic. This design was already introduced as one of the alternatives for the existing Maeslant barrier. However these kind of gates are straightforward and simple the disadvantage is that large movable parts are placed under water which makes maintenance work laboured and expensive. The last design consists of several rising sector gates as it has already been built at the Thames in the UK. The dimensions would be in the same range and therefore a lot of the experience could be used for the design. This design however leads to fixed structures within the water way which are a hindrance for navigation. The inflatable barrier is worked out in more detail. After taking a closer look at the biggest inflatable barrier in the world, the Ramspol barrier in the Netherlands, working out general information on inflatable barriers provides the basics for the design of the new Maeslant barrier. Because of the positive experience at the Ramspol barrier a combination of water and air was chosen to be the filling material. A purely air filled barrier leads to high tension forces in the membrane that exceed the bearing capacity. By using factors between the crest-height and the base width of the clamping lines and the crest-height and the circumferential length of the membrane based on the Ramspol barrier, the initial parameters for the new Maeslant barrier could be calculated using a crest-height of 22 meters. From that an iterative calculation process using a excel spread sheet calculates the shape, the internal air pressure and tension force in the membrane. First results than lead to an inflatable rubber barrier with a crest-height of 22.55 m, an internal air pressure of 0.6 bar and a tension force of 730 kN/m2. Optimizing the structure leady to a final design with a smaller base width, slightly longer circumferential length, lower tension force and internal air pressure and a higher crestheight. Using the calculated tension force the horizontal and vertical clamping forces are calculated and can be used to design the clamping lines and the foundation. The foundation also includes the bottom recess where the membrane is stored in the deflated situation. The membrane fits exactly over the ribs created by conveyors to facilitate the horizontal transport. The membrane will then be held in place by applying an under-pressure in the membrane.","","en","student report","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

After the realization of the design, this design was put on the market and was contracted. Contractors who wish to enroll for this work made a cost calculation on the basis of this design and the given quantities, required to carry out this work. The contract costs of the several tenderers were handed over to the client, after which the work was awarded to the lowest bidder. About a decade ago, integrated contracts were introduced after which this type of contract has increasingly gained popularity. Now, these types of contracts are fully integrated in the procurement phase of large complex infrastructural projects. The main difference between the traditional contracts is the design responsibility. By integrated projects, this is for the contractor. In the past, this responsibility was for the client. Nowadays the client only set up the functional requirements. Due to this shift, the contractor has obtained an additional design task besides providing costs. On the basis of functional requirements no factual cost calculation can be made. First, a design should be made out of which the design quantities can be extracted. With this data the cost experts can begin to calculate. In a tender phase is it far from certain that the work can be acquired and realized. It is more likely that a tender will be lost because of the number of candidates competing.

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution); Universiteit Leiden (degree granting institution)","2017","As extreme weather events increase both in frequency and magnitude (IPCC, 2012, 2014), and considering that over 60% of the world population lives in coastal areas (UNEP, 2016) flood risk is increasing. Hereby, the need to address Flood Risk Management (FRM) becomes evident. Especially on small island the need for adequate FRM is apparent: “relative to other areas, small islands are disproportionately affected by current hydro-meteorological extreme events, both in terms of the population affected and losses as a percentage of GDP” (Anthoff et al., 2010). In the young research field of socio-hydrology, the dynamic interactions between human systems and water systems are studied more integrated (Sivapalan et al., 2012). Socio-hydrology aims to gain a better understanding of the entanglement of human and flood systems in general. The institutional dimension has been studied with relatively little detail within socio-hydrology and Integrated Water Resource Management (Baldassarre et al., 2014; Brown and Damery, 2002; Gober &amp; Weather, 2014; Manuta and Label, 2005; Naess et al., 2005). Therefore, this research focuses on the institutional dimension of FRM, on the rules, norms, and shared strategies that guide decision making behaviour in flood risk response, recovery, mitigation and preparation. Institutional statements are defined as “shared linguistic constraint or opportunity that prescribes, permits, or advises actions or outcomes for actors ... [they] are spoken, written, or tacitly understood in a form intelligible to actors in an empirical setting” (Crawford &amp; Ostrom, 1995). The main research question is formulated as “what is the effect of interdependencies and connectivity between institutions on FRM, for the case of St Maarten?”. First, I address how interdependencies and connectivity between institutions can be studied. Secondly, this methodology will be tested on a case study. Third of all, I discuss how insights in the connections between institutions can be translated to better FRM. The Caribbean island St Maarten was chosen as a case study, as floods are the primary natural hazard on island (Sommers, 2015). The focus on economic development on the island increases vulnerability and exposure to floods, requiring adequate institutions to manage flood risk. Moreover, within the European PEARL research project, St Maarten was chosen as one of the case studies, which has led to the development of a knowledge base on FRM on the island and data availability. Socio-hydrology is used as a theoretical framework of this research. The integrated approach of human-water coupled systems is central in this research. The Institutional Analysis and Dynamics (IAD) framework by Ostrom forms the framework to further address the institutional dimension of human-water coupled flood systems. Institutions in flood systems are researched using the FRM cycle. Within the institutional dimension, we focus on interdependencies and connectivity between institutions, by taking a network perspective towards institutions.","Institutional Networks; Institutional Analysis; Agent-based modelling; Flood risk management","en","master thesis","","","","","","The Master's programme Industrial Ecology is jointly organised by Leiden University and Delft University of Technology.","","","","","","Industrial Ecology","",""

The objective of this report is to reveal the most suitable solution to the erosion problem that enables the development of a sustainable beach area. The most suitable solution should be technically feasible but also has to be economically and socially realizable. The report is intended to provide an insight in the current phenomena causing the erosion.

And it proposes various feasible solutions that could help in obtaining a sustainable beach area, these are tested against these aspects to define the most suitable one. Feasible measures that were given more detailed investigation, were placement of a breakwater to elongate the headland, placing a submerged breakwater, doing an alternative nourishment and creating a long- or short-term maintenance plan. Technically, the elongation of the headland with a breakwater appeared to be the most effective measure. However, in combination with other criteria that were taken into account like finances, politics and logistics, the submerged breakwater turned out to be most suitable.

It is part of the graduation project for the master Design for Interaction at the Delft University of Technology and was carried out on behalf of the Erasmus MC-Sophia Children’s Hospital in Rotterdam. Neonatal nurses encounter a great deal of stress, ranging from a high workload and a shortage in staff to the emotional burden deriving from the contact with newborn babies and their relatives. This may lead to among others mental and physical health issues, and absenteeism on the long run. Addressing this issue not only benefits the health of the nurses, but also increases the quality of patient care and the benefits of the organization. Therefore, the goal of the project is to reduce perceived stress of neonatal nurses. An analysis was carried out to find opportunities for design. The analysis included observations, questionnaires, interviews, contextmapping and literature reviews. This research was conducted among the nurses at the NICU. Important aspects that derived from this analysis were a lack of stress awareness and social support. These aspects were used as opportunities in the ideation phase. In addition, persuasive game design was explored and chosen as the deign method for the project. It focuses on a change of attitude and behavior, which suits the previous mentioned opportunities. Several ideas and concepts arose during the ideation phase. Interactive Mood was chosen as a final concept to address the problem. The design is a digital application in which the NICU is displayed in a cartoon-like design. The mood of the nurses as a team is metaphorically presented by means of the weather. Sunny weather stands for a positive mood in the NICU, whereas rain represent a negative mood. Nurses enter their mood manually and the application thereafter displays the average weather as the mean of al the input that is entered. A beta-version of the application was programmed to evaluate the design, usage and effects of Interactive Mood. This evaluation was also conducted among the nurses in the NICU. From the first results can be concluded that Interactive Mood receives positive feedback. Recommendations are made to test Interactive Mood on the long run in order to improve the desired effect.","persuasive game design; neonatal nurses; neonatal intensive care unit; occupational stress; Erasmus MC-Sophia Children's Hospital","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Design for Interaction","",""

This process strongly influence sediment transport and bottom evolution. State-of-the-art morphodynamic models traditionally represent the stirring of sand by irregular waves in a highly parametric way. For instance, the bottom orbital velocity is computed on the basis of a single representative wave with the peak period as wave period. This traditional approach does not properly account for the often complex distribution of the wave energy in the spectral domain, as revealed by the wave spectrum. The effects of this parametrisation on the bottom orbital velocity and sediment transport are unclear and motivate the current research. In this study, a new method is applied to compute the amplitude of the bottom orbital velocity, using spectral information. This method considers a sinusoidal wave for each individual frequency and calculates its contribution to the bottom orbital velocity. The impact of the new method was investigated using a point model, field measurements and a numerical morphodynamic model. The point model computes the bottom orbital velocities for a given wave spectrum for both methods. The field measurements are combined with the point model to validate the new method. The numerical morphodynamic model asses the implications on sand transport and the formation of ebb-tidal deltas, i.e., bodies of sand that are located seaward of a tidal inlet. The point model showed that the bottom orbital velocity using the new method was between 20% lower and 60% higher relative to the traditional method, depending on the peak period and depth. The difference arises from the frequency-dependent reduction of the bottom orbital velocity by depth. The field measurements suggest that the new method reduces the root-mean-square error between the calculated and measured bottom orbital velocity amplitude reduces by 30% compared to the traditional method. The morphodynamic model reveals that applying the spectral method leads to deeper channels and larger shoals. The computational effort of both methods were similar. The new method is recommended if the peak period is small (<6 s), the depth is large (>10 m) and/or if the wave spectrum is wide.","wave spectrum; orbital velocity; ebb-tidal delta; irregular waves","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","MSc-Civil Engineering","",""

(mentor)","2017","With electron beam lithography, a cutting edge technology has been developed that might introduce new possibilities in the design of chips. The word ""might"" has been used here because e-beam lithography is not yet available for the mass production market. One of the bottlenecks in the development of e-beam lithography is the positioning uncertainty of wafers with respect to the electron beams. A wafer positioning system is used to position wafers. The accuracy of the system is highly determined by a component, that mechanically couples the wafer with the position actuators and the mirrors that are used by the interferometers. This component is called the chuck. Topic of this project is the redesign of the chuck. The aim of this redesign is to reduce the position uncertainty caused by the chuck. In order to get to this result, a problem analysis has been performed that summarizes the bottlenecks in the positioning accuracy of a chuck. With respect to these bottlenecks, the performance of the present chuck has been analysed. The most critical bottlenecks in the present chuck turns out to be the optical quality and dynamic behaviour. This gives rise to the redesign of the chuck. In the concept development phase, 9 concepts have been created that promise to have a better overall performance. The most promising concept is a monolithic ceramic chuck with mirrors polished into 2 edges. Next to a great overall score on the estimated performance, the chuck design becomes simple which is a big benefit. A wafer table is mounted to the chuck with a kinematic mount. Expectations arise that stick slip might occur on the interface of the kinematic mount due to expansion if the grooves are integrated in the ceramic. An analytic model has been derived that theoretically assists the expectation. Two experiments have been performed, both suffer from measurement disturbances. Although these measurements were subject to errors, the data seems to confirm stick slip behaviour. Because of this, a third experiment is proposed. As a verification method, a set-up has been proposed to measure the actual performance of the present chuck and that of a ceramic chuck. This makes it possible to do a comparison of both concepts and select the best option.","ceramic; chuck; Silicon Carbide; wafer positioning accuracy; kinematic mount; Maxwell clamp; stick slip; sub nanometre roughness mirrors; thermal stability","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-12-31","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Precision and Microsystems Engineering (PME)","","Micro and nano engineering & engineering mechanics","",""

(mentor); Kroesen, J.O. (mentor); Storm, S.T.H. (mentor)","2017","In recent years, the renewable energy sector of South Africa has seen significant growth, but the biogas industry has been lagging behind. In this research, barriers and opportunities for the South African biogas industry have been studied while taking into account the institutional context that is created by informal networks. The research methodology consists of literature review, interviews with stakeholders of the South African biogas industry and three case studies of biogas projects in South Africa. In order to identify the barriers and opportunities that exist for the South African biogas industry, both the internal environment and external environment of the industry were considered. The barriers internal to the biogas industry were structured and analysed using Strategic Niche Management theory, whereas the external environment and its impact on the biogas industry was analysed from a Multi-Level Perspective. The regime that was considered is the fossil fuel based electricity regime of South Africa. From the empirical research it follows that the most strongly perceived opportunity for the South African biogas industry lies in the country’s current energy crisis, which has created a window of opportunity for renewable energy technologies. Furthermore, opportunities are created for the biogas industry through the increased environmental awareness and this is for instance seen from green policies and measures taken by companies and government to reduce carbon emissions. Three main conclusions were drawn regarding the barriers for the South African biogas industry. Firstly Biogas projects in South Africa are currently often found to be insufficiently financially feasible. This relates to the costs involved in the project, market conditions and a lack of funding opportunities. Secondly, the regulatory framework is not conducive to the development of biogas projects and this is forming a major barrier. Finally, the network of the South African biogas industry is not sufficiently internally aligned. This relates to both a lack of alignment within the government regarding a suitable legislative process and a lack of alignment within the network as a whole regarding the expectations for the industry. This research also aimed to contribute to the academic body of knowledge by considering the impact of informal networks on Strategic Niche Management. While this could not be derived conclusively from the empirical research, informal networks were recognized throughout this research and several impacts on Strategic Niche Management can be argued. Firstly, aligning the niche network towards a joint effort will be complicated by the division that is created by informal networks. Secondly, selecting projects for support is not based solely on project viability and value to the niche development as social relationships play a role in the informal institutional context. This makes it difficult to control the selection process though policy and is likely to impede learning processes.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Ethics / Philosophy of Technology","","","",""

In this domain, the goal of the recommender system is to activate users users to buy products in the data set. We explore six very different e-commerce data sets that contain contextual information and we show that the recommender’s effectiveness improves when contextual information is used in the recommendation process. We also find that it is difficult to predict which type of context will increase the effectiveness on which data set, and that not all users always benefit from using a context-aware recommender system.

By doing a qualitative research (N=14, interviews with patients, VCE nurses and a doctor], insights have been created on the problems that occurred within the VCE and the wishes of patients to realize a better experience. A patient journey tool has been used to find the different chances and design specifications. It has been found that many patients feel bored during the examination, which takes up to 8 hours. The service ""Op pad in het Maasstad"" has been developed to improve their experience. This service includes three different routings that are communicated via a flyer with a map.

Although false tilt can be counteracted by swaying the simulator cabin, an improper implementation of the motion drive logic for coordinating sway could cause delayed side-forces. The aim of this paper is to evaluate two methods of driving the coordinating sway, the classical washout filter and the coordination algorithm, and compare those with uncoordinated motion. An experiment was conducted in which 12 experienced pilots performed side-step manoeuvres in a large generic transport. Six motion drive configurations were compared: no-motion, rotations only, coordinated rotations only for the two motion drive logics and full motion for both motion drive logics. Results show unaffected performance, but subjective motion fidelity ratings indicate that pilots prefer the uncoordinated rotations-only condition, suggesting that the current methods for simulation of coordinated turns can be improved upon. The highest rotational accelerations are found in experiment runs without simulator motion, which shows that pilot control behaviour is affected by the presence of motion; pilots steer less acute when motion is turned on. Results suggest that the industry standard, the University of Toronto Classical Washout filter, can be improved if coordinating sway is performed with less phase distortions, which can be achieved if scaling of the coordination sway is allowed and thus lowering high-pass sway filter break frequency becomes achievable within the limited hexapod motion space.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-01-12","Aerospace Engineering","Control & Operations","","Systems and Control","",""

(mentor); Verhagen, H.J. (mentor); Reinders, K. (mentor); de Gijt, J.G. (mentor); Dijksma, N. (mentor)","2017","Since 1986, the northern part of the Netherlands, particularly the Province of Groningen, experienced around 1000 registered minor earthquakes. The cause of these earthquakes is gas extraction. This type of earthquake, caused by human influence, is called induced earthquakes. The Netherlands is not located in a historically seismic active area, therefore the effects of the dynamic loads due to earthquakes are not taken into account in structural designs. For Groningen Seaports, it is important to know what the potential consequences are of these earthquake loadings on the structures and facilities in the ports of Delfzijl and the Eemshaven. The breakwaters of Delfzijl and Eemshaven are one of these structures that perform a key function in the operation of the ports. In this report, the breakwaters of the Eemshaven are evaluated with respect to the effects of induced earthquakes. Induced earthquakes can result into different failure mechanisms of the Eemshaven breakwaters. The decisive mechanisms that can be initiated by the effects of induced earthquakes are: liquefaction, macro-instability, crest settlement and flow sliding. The effect or mechanism of liquefaction, and the build-up of excess pore pressures, can highly influence the other mechanisms. In this report there are uncertainties regarding the earthquake loading and information of the sand in the core of the breakwaters. For the potential of the mechanisms (except for the mechanism of flow sliding) scenarios are described with respect to earthquake loading and soil packing of the breakwater core. The respective earthquake loadings are; 0.10g, 0.175g and 0.26g, in which 0.10g is the reference Peak Ground Acceleration and 0.26g the design Peak Ground Acceleration. The respective soil packings are; loosely, moderately and densely packed sand. Simplified and simplified dynamic analysis are performed, to analyse the potential of the mechanisms. Upon the analysis of the mechanisms, under the different scenarios, a range of outcomes is obtained. Because of this, a safety philosophy is drafted. With a safety philosophy, the potential consequences for the Eemshaven breakwaters and port are described. The consequences are divided into the following classifications: Optimistic: The effects of the earthquake loadings are limited; no or small deformations/settlements are expected. No direct impact to the operationality of the port of the Eemshaven. Average: The effects of the earthquake loadings are significant; small to considerable deformations/settlements are expected. Limited direct impact to the operationality of the port of the Eemshaven. Conservative: The effects of the earthquake loadings are substantial; considerable to large deformations/settlements (instability) are expected. Significant direct impact to the operationality of the port of the Eemshaven. It can be concluded that the effects of induced earthquakes can impact the stability of the Eemshaven breakwaters. It is, however, dependent on the representative earthquake loading, soil characteristics of the breakwater core and the potential of liquefaction (excess pore pressures). Without the influence of liquefaction, the effects of induced earthquakes on the Eemshaven breakwaters are limited; only small deformations are expected. If the potential consequences are significant or substantial, different remedies/modifications can be implemented. A potential remedy/modification for liquefaction is the use of gravel drain piles. Gravel drain piles are permeable, so that build-up of excess pore pressures are limited. If the breakwaters are not affected by the effects of induced earthquakes, a large amount of deformation or even instability can still occur due to the mechanism of flow sliding. Flow sliding is likely to occur if the agglomerated sandbank consists of liquefiable layers of sand with a steep slope. Based on the findings/results it is recommended to determine the representative earthquake loading for the Eemshaven breakwaters. Subsequently, it is advisable to perform a detailed soil investigation. With this information a more complex dynamic model should be carried out. The dynamic model can indicate a more accurate response of the breakwaters to earthquake loadings and the potential/influence of excess pore pressures (liquefaction).","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2017","Our living spaces seem to be changing with the possibilities of digitization. However, the kitchen seems to be the exception in the integration of digital systems. For some reason, kitchen design lags behind on these aspects. Is this just a coincidence or does the kitchen house some essential social interactions? Historically, the kitchen was constructed to be functional, but developed to be the center of the household. It harbors the mealtime ritual and enables people to care for others and themselves. All of these interactions strengthen social cohesion and contextualize the roles of the individual household members, making them a social group. The kitchen therefore serves a predominantly social function rather than being a utilitarian space. If food was regarded as utilitarian, society would have switched to food pills and shakes with the masses, which is not the case. Thus the design goal was to design to emphasise the social function of the kitchen. This meant that the final design would harbour and empower a sense of togetherness and informality. The mindful kitchen The mindful kitchen proposes a change in configuration. Activities related to cooking, processing and eating were integrated in one central worktop that is accessible from all sides. The spatial configuration governs the types of interactions that can take place. Introducing a shared space on which multiple activities can take place will elicit more collaboration and conversation. Their interpersonal positioning resembles a group of people talking, with a shared space within their center. People are able to sit and watch someone cook, eat together or engage in reading or other leisure activities. The flexible worktop allows people to tailor the worktop to their needs at a specific moment. It enables multiple persons to cook at the same time, through zoneless induction. Pots and pans that are cooking on the surface have been given visual feedback through the Pebble underlayer system, which visualizes the heat that comes off the induction cooktop. The rest of the worktop does not heat, making it safe to do other things similarly.","kitchen; design; ViP; context","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Design Aesthetics","",""

(mentor); Sanchez Gomez, S. (mentor); Ronse, A. (mentor); Nieuwenhuizen, F. (mentor); van Dalen, K.N. (mentor)","2017","Due to global demand for safe and cost-effective offshore personnel transfers, Ampelmann has developed multiple-motion-compensated transfer systems. These vessel-mounted motion-compensated offshore transfer systems allow for safe and comfortable access from vessels onto offshore structures. These systems create a near-motionless transfer deck by using a Stewart platform. Because of the size and weight of the base structures, a standard Ampelmann system is unsuitable for smaller Crew Transfer Vessels. This thesis will present a system specifically designed to meet the size requirements of these smaller vessels. This design also mitigates the issues related to an increased vessel response due to the smaller size of the vessels. Problems related to the presence of residual motions, which occur during operations with the current design, are dealt with as well. In order to improve the performance and workability of a compact transfer system, a four-step analysis is performed. In this analysis, ship motions are simulated using various host vessels, which result in a set of operational requirements. This information is subsequently combined with additional operational and physical requirements predetermined by Ampelmann. Several concepts which meet the set of obtained requirements are developed. To assess the performance of these concepts, a kinematic model is used. The physical limitations, stemming from the previously mentioned Ampelmann requirements, are tested for every developed concept by running time domain simulations using this model. Additionally, the kinematic model evaluates safety and comfort levels during transfer operations for transferred personnel by analyzing specific relevant parameters. Finally, the dynamics of the mechanism are taken into account to investigate gangway deflection. In addition to the gangway analysis, system actuator forces and power consumption are determined for later use. These analyses identify the design parameters which are most beneficial as well as most disadvantageous pertaining to the workability and performance of the proposed system. Crew transfer vessels that are used in the offshore oil & gas are relatively long and narrow. This type of hull design causes severe heave motions as well as a very high roll sensitivity when ship motions are simulated. Taking these observations into account, the set of proposed systems is narrowed down by disregarding concepts unable to cope with these circumstances. Describing these systems as massless robotic arm yields very interesting results; it reveals certain characteristics concerned with the required configuration of the mechanisms during operations. Some configurations encounter unexpectedly high joint velocities and accelerations under specific environmental conditions. This observation significantly influences safety and required system performance due to extra requirements induced by these high parameter values. The gangway shows gangway deflection under certain wave conditions when taking into account system dynamics. This deflection consequently leads to fluctuations in required actuator forces. In order to counter these fluctuations two optimizations consisting of the relocation of particular joints as well as the addition of a counterweight are performed. These modifications show great potential improvements in system power consumption. To complete the feasibility study of the proposed system, development of a control system should be considered. Using recordings of ship motions allows for model verification as well as identification of station keeping performance. The results from the identification and optimization of the actuator requirements show possibilities for an all-electric actuated system. Further research concerning the feasibility of electric actuators in these conditions is necessary, as implementation of these actuators offers a wide range of potential benefits as well as a set of inherent complications involved with offshore electrical systems.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-01-11","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Offshore & Dredging Engineering","","","",""

Currently, Vessel Traffic Services Operators are provided with short-term prediction methods, used to resolve potential collisions. Research is done to predict collision risk at a larger time horizon, which is expected to provide a Vessel Traffic Services Operator (VTSO) with more time and information to anticipate upon and prevent situations with high risk of collision from developing. This thesis focusses on forming the basis for the prediction component of this goal. The objective is to provide a basic understanding of the process of medium-term behaviour of vessels. This is done by performing a data analysis of a case study of the vessel traffic off the coast of Rotterdam, investigating which variables can be used to predict the intent of a vessel. Two aspects of the intent of a vessel are considered: where the vessel intends to end (within the scope of the scene), and which intermediate waypoints it plans to follow. Entry points, exit points and waypoints are clustered using the Density Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) clustering technique. Waypoints are derived by detecting change-points in the course of vessels using binary segmentation. Variables from the dataset are selected and it is investigated which variables can distinguish between different intents, given the entry point of the vessel. The results are that the variables 'course' and 'destination' can distinguish between routes sufficiently enough to investigate them further. This further investigation for the course variable is due to its dependence on vessel position, among other variables. Other variables may add value also, but then in combination with these two variables. The waypoint determination has not yet been successfully implemented, but it is regarded as a promising means to describe and predict vessel intent in more detail, partially due to the conclusions drawn regarding the course variable.","Maritime Traffic; Medium-Term Prediction; Collision Risk; Vessel Traffic Services; Vessel Behaviour","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Control & Operations","","Control and Operations","AE5310",""

(mentor)","2017","The Ocean Cleanup’s goal is to extract, prevent and intercept plastic pollution by initiating the largest clean-up in history. It aims to achieve this by installing a large moored floating barrier, which passively concentrates the plastic debris using the ocean currents. In this thesis an alternative to this concept is developed and evaluated. By focussing on mobile solutions the need for complex mooring systems is avoided. First, different mobile cleaning concepts are generated. In a following multi criteria analysis an unmanned passive system was found to be the most promising solution. This concept is not actively propelled and will drift along with the ocean current. A sea anchor is deployed at deeper water layers to generate a braking force, slowing the system down in order to capture plastic. Several risks are identified for this concept of which three are related to the mesoscale movements of the system through the ocean. In the second part a hydro–elastic model, using the lumped mass approach, has been developed to simulate the hydrodynamic behaviour of this concept in the horizontal plane. This model will provide insight into the mesoscale movement of the system through the North Pacific. For a first estimation the scope is limited to current induced forces, since wave forces are expected to be small due to the relative size of the system. These current forces are calculated using the Morison equation. In addition, a constant draft of the flexible screen is assumed. It is proven that this is a reasonable assumption for the velocities under consideration. The developed model is validated using the results from a performed 3D test at MARIN. From the results of this validation it seems that model simulates the behaviour very well. With the validated model different simulations have been performed using the oceanic circulation model HYCOM as input. The results consist of the travelled trajectory of the system over a full year and insight into the hydrodynamic behaviour on a system scale. From these results it was found that the system tends to show unstable behaviour in low current velocities. A solution to this problem was found in increasing the weight of the sea anchor.","lumped mass approach; mesoscale hydromechanics; Morison equation; hydro-elasticity; plastic pollution; hydrodynamics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-01-10","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Offshore & Dredging Engineering","","Floating Structures","",""

In this thesis, we also share some of our success stories and lessons learned while applying Logness in the wild.","log; errors; analysis; anomaly; clustering","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Software Technology","","","",""

Yet, a crane is still exposed to a peak load as a result of the AOPS’ behaviour. Using an iterative method, a simulation model is constructed to predict the peak load during an overload situation. After each iteration an attempt is done to validate the model by comparing simulation results with recorded data of previously conducted experiments. With the current validation possibilities it has not succeeded to construct a valid model. Instead, the model produces results with an absolute error of 5.15 tonnes and a relative error of 0.22. A sensitivity analysis indicates the influence of different crane parameters on the peak load, but also shows that a large uncertainty is induced through uncertainties in experimental parameters. Nonetheless, the practical application of the simulation is proven by predicting the peak loads according the European Standard (EN) for an arbitrary crane.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-01-10","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Maritime and Transport Technology","","","",""

(mentor)","2017","Climate change without adequate countermeasures has become one of humanity's greatest threat. Energy production by means of renewable energy sources is therefore one of the crucial measures that will play a paramount role in reducing the pollutant emissions of fossil fuel dependency. Small islands in particular are an exemplary case of the extraordinary dependence on oil, the energy system often being entirely dependant on diesel generators. The relative high cost of sustaining this practice in combination with the geoeconomic properties of islands provides a unique incentive for the transition to renewable energy. By definition, islands are surrounded by water, making them highly vulnerable to the effects of climate change. In addition to the risk of being surrounded by water, it also provides a vast set of possibilities. Harnessing energy from waves, tides and the difference in seawater temperatures (OTEC) are just some of the examples. In this thesis, the effect of ocean energy integration is investigated. A simulation and optimization model of the electricity supply system is developed. A multi-objective genetic algorithm optimization regarding cost (LCOE) and renewable energy integration is performed. The model covers; PV solar, wind, tidal, wave and OTEC as well as battery storage as components of a renewable energy system. The resulting model is applied to two case study islands (Shetland and Aruba), the effect of the hybrid system including ocean energy technologies is determined. The cost optimal system was found to produce energy with an LCOE below the conventional fossil fuel energy cost. This corresponds to a renewable energy share of approximately 65%, consisting solely of wind energy. The cost was determined to have a significant influence on the system configuration. Currently, due to the high cost of energy based on their pre-commercial stage, ocean energy sources are added to the energy mix at high renewable energy shares (above 75% renewable coverage). The hybrid systems including the ocean energy sources displayed an evenly spread energy production. Based on this study, the future of integrating ocean energy provides an encouraging outlook. Cost will need to be reduced further for ocean energy to become economically viable. With the right investments in ocean energy, this process can be accelerated and will become viable.","Ocean energy; renewable energy; electricity system; optimization; simulation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Engineering, Systems and Services","","","",""

(mentor)","2017","Unmanned ships are a new concept in the maritime sector. The concept of unmanned ships is driven by safety of life, cost and the shortage in seafarers. However, it is uncertain how the change from manned to unmanned ships in?uences the design and exploitation of the ship. Therefore, the in?uences on the ship will be researched in this thesis. The results from this thesis can be used by various organizations, researchers, and designers, to determine whether the concept of unmanned ships is feasible. The main question is: What are the in?uences of unmanned shipping on the design considerations and what cost saving can be achieved by removing crew related equipment and the crew itself from merchant ships? First, it has been researched how the design requirements change under international law. The design spiral has been used to identify the parts of the ship design that change, because of the changed requirements. These parts are: deadweight, lightweight, powering, machinery selection, general arrangement and costing. To quantify the change in deadweight, lightweight and powering, a parametric study has been carried out and applied to di?erent sized ships. Additionally, an analysis on what additional equipment should be installed on the ship, to make unmanned shipping possible, has been performed. Furthermore, a cost analysis has been carried out to quantify the cost savings associated with the removal of the equipment which is no longer needed for unmanned shipping. The change in cost is the budget for additional equipment required for unmanned shipping. For the cost analysis, building cost, maintenance cost, fuel saving, manning cost, insurance cost, depreciation cost and interest cost have been taken into account. The cost analysis has been applied to di?erent sizes of ships. Subsequently, the parametric study and cost analysis have been applied to a speci?c case. In addition the change in capacity, dimensions, trim, stability, seakeeping, general arrangement plan and tonnage have been analyzed. To check the sensitivity of the results, a sensitivity study for uncertain parameters has been performed. The di?erent analyses showed that the change in weight and power is minimal, but that the saving in cost is signi?cant. In conclusion, it can be stated that a signi?cant cost reduction can be achieved by removing the accommodation and related systems from ships.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","ship design, production and operation","","","",""

(mentor); Córdova López, L.F. (mentor)","2017","This main objective of this report is to find the cause of the erosion problem and to design a solution for the problematic situation in front of the Iberostar Varadero Hotel, Cuba. This hotel is situated in the eastern part of the Peninsula of Hicacos. For almost 40 years erosion problems are present at this location and need direct attention. To find the causes of erosion the problem is split up in a contribution by basic longshore transport, different cross-shore transports during extreme conditions and transports due to more complex hydrodynamic processes around the Iberostar Hotel. For the basic longshore transport the model Unibest LT is used to calculate the quantities and distribution of the longshore sediment transport over the cross-shore profile. For the contribution of cross-shore processes to the erosion problem, the model XBeach is used. After calibrating the 1D model, the model is extended to a 2D model, with a full 2D wave input by SWAN. For the transport due to more complex hydrodynamic processes Delft3D is used. During the analysis some interesting flow patterns are found, which explains why there is structural erosion at the Iberostar Hotel. It turns out that the causes of erosion can be subscribed to a combination of two processes. Firstly, the general westward directed flow causes erosion west of the headland. Secondly, complex flow patterns occur during northwest wave conditions which often also cause erosion in front of the Iberostar Hotel. The negative influence of both processes on the recovery of the beach after storm and hurricane conditions is important. After explaining the causes of erosion the optimal solution for the structural erosion is investigated. Three final solutions have been checked by a MCA and cost analysis, and in the end the nourishment turned out to be the optimal solution. The nourishment is further optimised and the behaviour is modelled for multiple years. After modelling of the solution it seems that a nourishment of 100,000 m3 is sufficient to provide a good beach width for a period of 5 years. It also turned out that the construction time and construction method of the nourishment are very important. With this in mind, the following solution is proposed. A beach nourishment of 100,000 m3 in front of the Iberostar hotel, with a lifetime of 5 years and an approximate total cost of 1.1 million CUC. Since the erosion problems are structural, new nourishments are needed in the future. When making a nourishment maintenance schedule, costs can be saved. In that case, for a period of 50 years, the costs can be decreased to 12.8 million CUC, taking into account additional nourishments after possibly occurring hurricanes and extreme events. In this way the structural erosion problems can be dealt with in a cost effective, visually attractive and flexible way","Cuba; Varadero; Erosion; Nourishment; XBeach en Delft3D","en","student report","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","CIE4061-09","23°19'64.5,-81°16'22.3"

The most recent studies of the vulnerability of container terminals to climate change has been either qualitative, based on the subjective values from stakeholders, been focused on assessing the impact from a single weather event, or related to the effectiveness of a resilience measure. State of the art research to assess the vulnerability of container terminals to climate change is expensive and time consuming. Furthermore, since the models should face deep uncertainty related to climate change, it is questionable whether it is possible to validate any of the given scenarios. In such situations, exploratory modeling studies can be used to analyze the behavior of the system under a large set of scenarios. Also, it is not always desired to perform an in-depth study for every container terminal. Therefore, there is social demand for a more generic tool, which can be used for screening of container terminals. To screen for vulnerability of container terminals, an exploratory method should be developed, that can be used to estimate the operational impact of climate change for a given container terminal. The main question to be answered with such a tool is: “What is the effect of different climate scenarios on the operational performance of a container terminals?”.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Multi Actor Systems / Policy Analysis","","Systems Engineering, Policy Analysis and Management (SEPAM)","",""

(mentor)","2017","Spacecraft attitude refers to the orientation of the spacecraft body axes with respect to the inertial reference frame. Attitude determination and control is the estimation of the current orientation of a satellite and controlling or changing it on demand to reach a desired orientation. The SPS-2 Attitude Control System consists of four modes: Rate Damping, Sun Acquisition, Sun Pointing, and Science mode. This thesis covers the design of the science mode. The first part of the thesis gives a description of the modelling of the sensor and actuator models. The sensor models developed targeted for the science mode are the gyro model and the star tracker model, while the actuator model developed is a reaction wheel model. For each of the units, mathematical models were developed, and then these mathematical models were translated into Simulink models. An extensive market analysis was conducted for each of the units, to obtain input parameters for the models. The models were verified using dedicated unit tests. All the models have been implemented in a generic way such that they can be initialised with any inputs, making it easier for future use and or modification. The second part describes the design of the Kalman filter for state estimation and filtering. A six-state Kalman filter was developed to estimate the spacecraft attitude and angular rate. Then a quaternion feedback controller was designed for the science mode attitude control. The attitude controller has two sub routines, inertial pointing control and nadir pointing control. For the inertial pointing subroutine, a fixed inertial attitude was used as a reference attitude. A time varying inertial attitude was used as reference for the nadir pointing subroutine. The reference was computed with three constraints. The first constraint was that at all time, the spacecraft x-axis must point towards the centre of the Earth (nadir direction). The second constraint was that the spacecraft y-axis (the direction of the solar array normal vector), should be pointed in a direction that minimises the angle between the Sun vector and the solar array normal. The third constraint was that in case of slew manoeuvres, rotation is permitted only around the nadir pointing axis. The controller gains were selected in such a way that there is uniform performance, in terms of rise time, percentage overshoot, and damping, on all axes. The final part of the thesis focuses on performance analysis and requirements verification. Sensitivity analysis was performed in two steps. In first step, the parameters from a single unit were varied to assess the impact on the SPS-2 pointing requirements. In the second step, parameters from all the units were varied simultaneously. In addition, uncertainties in the satellite parameters and change in satellite geometry were taken into consideration. The performance simulation has shown that the absolute pointing error (APE) is within the required value of 0.1° (3-σ) for all axes. However, the requirement that the relative pointing error be less than 1 arcmin (3-σ) all axis for 1 hour. The obtained maximum relative pointing error was 3.1 arcmin (3-σ). Moreover, the absolute pointing error for the nadir pointing axis during a slew manoeuvre is greater than the required limit of 0.5°.","Gyroscope; Attitude Control; Kalman Filter; Nadir Pointing; Inertial Pointing; Reaction Wheel; Star Tracker","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-01-05","Aerospace Engineering","Astrodynamics and Space Missions","","","",""

(mentor); van Wingerden, J.W. (mentor)","2017","In an effort to reduce the Levelized Cost Of Energy (LCOE) of offshore wind energy to a market competitive level, a new wind turbine prototype with hydraulic drive train has been introduced by the start-up company Delft Offshore Turbine (DOT). In the DOT concept, a seawater pump is directly connected to the rotor shaft. The pump pressurizes sea water, which is transferred to a hydro-power station at sea level. There, the hydraulic power is converted to electric power by means of a Pelton turbine, which is mechanically connected to an electric generator. In below-rated wind conditions, practically all commercial wind turbines regulate the rotor speed by adjusting the generator torque demand. However, due to the decoupling of the rotor and generator in the DOT concept, conventional below-rated torque control is no longer possible. With the hydraulic drive train concept considered in this thesis, an alternative torque control strategy is designed and implemented, where fluid pressure is regulated to vary the system torque. The developed hydraulic torque control strategy is integrated in the turbine control system, which includes e.g. yaw, pitch and supervisory control. Functionality of the derived strategy is validated through field trials, performed on a 500 kW prototype of the DOT wind turbine. A second-hand Vestas V44 wind turbine was retrofitted with hydraulic components and installed on the Maasvlakte II for this purpose (see Figure 1). Since the required seawater pump for the ideal DOT concept is not yet commercially available on the market, an intermediate hydrostatic oil transmission was used as a hydraulic gearbox between rotor and water pump. However, the operating principles of the control strategy remain identical for both the ideal and intermediate DOT scenario. Results show that below-rated speed regulation is possible with the derived hydraulic torque controller. The developed strategy enables operation along the theoretical optimal tip-speed ratio for attaining the maximum (rotor) power coefficient. The blade fine-pitch angle, which leads to maximum rotor power extraction in the below-rated region, was subsequently found with the direct data-driven Extremum Seeking Control (ESC) algorithm. Finally, the ESC method was implemented to find the generator speed feedforward control gain. Results indicate an instant generator power increase and led to the detection of a malfunctioning sensor. Therefore, ESC appeared to be a valuable tool to deal with modelling and measurements uncertainties.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-01-03","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Delft Center for Systems and Control","","","",""

(mentor); van Haveren, R. (mentor)","2017","The method Erasmus-iCycle is able to generate a treatment plan for cancer patients, based on the patient's anatomy and a predefined wish list. This wish list contains goals for different organs near the tumour, listed by priority. However, it is not certain that the generated iCycle plan is the best fit for an individual patient, since every patient is anatomically unique. The goal of this report is therefore to develop a method that generates alternative treatment plans, from which a physician can choose the most desirable plan for his/her patient. To find useful alternative plans, Pareto optimal plans that are close to the iCycle plan have to be found. This can be done by applying the reference point method (RPM) to different reference paths, which leads to different solutions on the Pareto front. Preferably, these solutions are spread around the iCycle plan in all directions. Besides that, the density of plans has to be high near the iCycle plan and really low on the end parts of the Pareto front, since those solutions are usually not clinically desirable. In the TSRPM, which is the final method of this report, reference paths are lines through the ideal point and one other reference point (for which the coordinates are higher than those of the ideal point, so the reference path is increasing). The reference points are chosen in the tangent space to the Pareto front in the iCycle point. Using reference points spread through the right part of the tangent space, ensures that for each objective, solutions with higher and with lower doses in the corresponding organ are found. By choosing the desired number of reference points and smart boundaries, multiple optimal plans are generated. These plans can be analysed and compared, so the physician can choose a plan.","","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","2020-01-02","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Delft Institute of Applied Mathematics","","Applied Mathematics","",""

At the same time, different and complex methods to define sustainable measures, actions and interventions are used. The current research, aims to contribute at the City-Zen project for creating a structured energy urban planning approach, by answering the following question:<br/><br/>Which is the methodology leading to the design of a roadmap that helps to define which energy systems and retrofit measures should be applied where and when, on residential neighbourhoods of Amsterdam Nieuw West until 2050, for achieving their energy transition and CO2 emissions reduction?<br/><br/>The answer to the research question is given by developing an energy urban planning 4-step methodology, and by formulating a catalogue of energy and retrofit measures for the building, neighbourhood and district scale. The four steps are defined as the 1) mapping the present, 2) the definition of the future energy targets, 3) the development of the strategy for selecting the suitable energy systems, and eventually 4) the design of the energy transition roadmap for selected neighbourhoods inside Amsterdam Nieuw West district. <br/><br/>This methodology is required to be followed step by step, applying the first three steps initially on the city scale for the sake of creating a smooth transition of the steps implementation process from city scale to neighbourhood scale. Furthermore, the same steps are applied on neighbourhood scale with minor changes, to get to the final step which is the roadmap design, comprised of 3 sub-steps. First of all, the roadmap suggests the selection of suitable energy systems for 2050 for each one of the selected neighbourhoods. The selections are based on several variables retrieved by literature review. These variables lead to solutions for smaller clusters of dwellings consisting the neighbourhoods, formulated by similar construction characteristics and ownership status. Secondly, description templates are provided, one for each energy system, listing the used energy retrofit measures in steps, and quantifying the changes in heat demand and in CO2 emissions according to each step. Finally, the collected retrofit solutions from the first two sub-steps are used in the final sub-step of defining the interventions on timeline. The changes in heat demand are visualised on 3-dimensional heat maps, showing the results of 5-year periods of retrofit actions, starting from today until reaching the final energy goal in 2050.","retrofit; residential; energy systems","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the advance of infomation technology broke the strong relationship between the city shape, the transport system and the economic growth. Since the flow of information is no longer dependant on the physical transport system today, modern cites recently show the limits of current design methods in their urban spatial structure. <br/><br/>In the meantime. Landscape urbanism has been discussed as an alternative way of designing urban spatial structure. However, the actual method for design process is not developed yet. The problem of the method developing process is that Landscape urbanism does not have a quantitative part to materialize the concept of landscape as a structuring element. <br/><br/>For this reason, this paper attempts to combine landscape urbanism with a quantitative tool, Spacematrix. By the marriage between them, landscape urbanism have a tool to materialize the idea of re-structuring a city with nature. At the same time, a new usage of spacematrix for design process is discovered. <br/><br/>San Jose is a case chosen for the process of developing the method because the current situation of the city shows the struggle of the new urban transformation. It is located in the southern part of San Francisco bay, greatly overlapped with the area of silicon valley. Since the silicon valley has shown noticeable economic performance last decades, it has been gradually expanding, and reaching the periphery of the city toward the sea. <br/><br/>Today the area cannot offer enough land for new development of the silicon valley because of the shortage of available land. Besides, the trend of sea level rising is also threatening the availability of land. As a result, the migration of silicon valley is getting accelarated every year. In the process of developing the method. Therefore, this paper focus on providing a solution for both the development issue and the flood problem based on landscape urbanism and spacematrix.","Edge city; Urban spatial structure; Blue-green infrastructure; Landscape urbanism; Spacematrix; Agglomeration economics; landscape ecology","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, there does not exist an charging station for the ZEBRO yet. At this time, the battery still has to be replaced manually, which defeats the purpose of an autonomous system. An autonomous charging station has to be designed to complete the system. The charging station can be split into 3 parts: the autonomous charging station, the wireless power transfer, and the battery management system (located in the ZEBRO). In this particular thesis, the autonomous charging station will be discussed.<br/>Since all components in the ZEBRO are built to be modular, the design of the autonomous charging station is chosen to fit this principle. The charging station will consist of one central unit, and several connectable (modular) pads. Each pad will be able to hold and charge a single ZEBRO in 30 minutes. <br/>The charging station contains a communication module to communicate its location to ZEBRO's in need of charging. To calculate the locations of the connected pads, a grid will be created by serial communication between the charging station and the connected pads through Raspberry Pi's.

It is urgent to figure out solutions on how to manage the storm water in its urban area. Jakarta locates at the downstream of the catchment; the peak runoff generated in the city can occur earlier than the peak discharge coming from upstream, potentially leading to a ‘collision’ of both peaks. Since the storm water detention methods have both the runoff reduction and delay functions, whether adopting storm water detention methods in Jakarta is able to limiting the discharge magnitude because of its discharge reduction function or even increase the discharge because of the peak delay function is studied. In this article, there are 4 storm water detention methods, green roofs, household storage tanks, pervious pavements and on-site detention tanks, tested with a precipitation event with 100-year return period in a segment in the Jakarta City. The result of the example in this research shows that the delay functions of these 4 solutions are negligible, and the runoff reduction functions of all the solutions are almost lost in this extreme rainfall event when the discharge from the upstream reaches the peak value. So these 4 storm water detention methods in the example have no influence on the peak discharge in the downstream in this precipitation event. However, because the fast runoff is still contributing to the runoff at the exit of the segment when the peak discharge from the upstream comes, these storm water management methods are still possible to reduce the peak discharge during other precipitation events with smaller total precipitation amount or earlier peak intensity. An off-line detention tanks could have positive effects on reducing the peak discharge in the river to the downstream if they start to collect storm water certain period later so that they are capable to store the runoff when the peak discharge from the upstream comes.","Urban water management; storm water detention; Sacramento model","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The masterplan of Phase I will be done as planned in which CT 1 was already operated since 2016 and CT 2 and CT 3 are in the final phase of land reclamation. In the new masterplan (2017), Phase II of the development will start in 2030 – onwards, depending on future conditions. However, whether the development of Phase II (continuation of Phase I) will be needed is still a question for the Port Authority. Hence, this study is about creating robust terminal masterplan of Phase II (2030 – onwards) which will remain functional under future uncertainties. The methodology/framework being discussed is Adaptive Port Planning (APP) which is considering flexibility design of port masterplan. Flexibility is very relevant for projects with high investment and surrounded by future uncertainties. In this study, considering the long-term project characteristics, the framework of Adaptive Port Planning (APP) Scenario-Based planning is developed. As a definition, the scenario-based approach helps to open up the perspective of the future condition of the port as a horizon of possibility and it gives chance to anticipate the vulnerabilities. Developing the scenarios are based on defined critical uncertainties using a 2x2 matrix approach. The economy (related to cargo performance) and environment are defined to be the axes of the matrix. The outcome is four plausible scenarios: Green Growth, Business As Usual, Moderate Expansion, and No Expansion. The next steps are examining these scenarios through some analysis to look at the characteristics and the promising industries in each scenario. In order to get the terminal needs in each scenario, traffic analysis in Port of Tanjung Priok is required; identifying the key influential cargos and commodities. There will also be a projection of containers based on defined scenarios. Producing the robust masterplan will lead us to a monitoring system and contingency planning for some highly relevant signposts. These signposts are the relevant future uncertainties which are not covered yet in the defined alternative layouts. Each of the signposts has to be analysed to prepare the contingency plans, mostly for IPC and some others for related stakeholders. In conclusion, this study proposes the adaptive framework of planning the terminal design for Phase II of New Priok, namely Adaptive Port Planning (APP) Scenario-Based Planning. It gives sequential work flow on designing future masterplan of the port, especially for the case of Phase II of New Priok. The alternative layouts and adaptive actions for IPC are some important outcomes of the framework. The port has to realize that uncertainties persevere and are very likely to influence the decision making for future layouts. Instead of ignoring uncertainties, the port needs to make contingency planning to deal with them. Hopefully, this study has benefits to make a robust terminal masterplan for Phase II of New Priok Development.","Indonesia ports; port design; port planning; scenario planning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","New Priok Development",""

The thesis presents a bi-directional flyback DC/DC converter design and prototype<br/>with analog power management, universal control signals and high integration potential.<br/>These aspects are accomplished by building upon the traditional flyback DC/DC converter design<br/>with respect to circuit topology, power-flow control, connectivity and accessibility. The<br/>difficult regulation and measurement of DC power flow has been reduced to a set of analog<br/>signals interpretable by any microcontroller, easing the integration of the converter into larger<br/>energy and control networks.<br/>A working prototype is presented and the inner-workings of the electrical circuit are discussed<br/>and evaluated in detail. The converter is tested beyond the limit of the design requirements and<br/>the performance is documented. Provided are possible reasons for malfunctioning and guidelines<br/>for future improvements.<br/>Design","Flyback converter; SMPS; eBike; solar powered","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Its main theme, digital manufacturing of reinforced concrete structures, has already been studied/researched by many other enthusiasts; but they adopted approaches mainly based on the digital production of formworks or 3D printing of concrete. None or very few re-searchers have tried tackling this topic by only investigating the reinforcement production methods. Reinforcement is an essen-tial part of any concrete structure and neglecting its role in de-veloping techniques of digital manufacturing concrete structure makes the technique unreliable. Therefore this report ap-proached this topic according to the suitable production tech-niques for reinforcement structures of freeform concrete struc-tures. Various techniques and concepts in production of rein-forcement structures have been designed and one chosen. This chosen concept got developed into its last minute details as well as its assemblage process got demonstrated on a freeform wall structure.<br/>All the stages are also fully explained providing a source of in-spiration for anyone interested in the topic to employ the pre-sented research in creation of other possible systems.<br/>Those research related to production technique which is done by the researcher of this report, can also be employed in other fields such as lattice mesh structure production or 3D printing of carbon fibers. <br","digital manufacturing; 3D printing; additive manufacturing; carbon fiber; Reinforcement; concrete; Free-form concrete; Freeform; Reinforced concrete","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Building Technology","",""

In addition, reliability analysis in combination with NLFEA results<br/>and safety assessments provide an insight into consistency of the safety assessments recommendations related<br/>to targeted safety. However, various complications arise regarding the appropriate constitutive model<br/>to be used in analysis, estimation and inclusion of modelling uncertainty in results from nonlinear finite element<br/>analysis, unavailability of a suitable function that defines the response of a structure when subjected to<br/>a certain load etc.<br/>In this additional thesis, a case study is performed to study the combination of structural safety assessment<br/>and reliability analysis using nonlinear finite element analysis. A wall specimen experimented by Lefas<br/>et. al is selected for the study [1]. Solution strategy is adopted based on the recommendations ofDutch guidelines<br/>with some deviations [2]. The nonlinear finite element analyses are performed inDIANA 10.1. Since only<br/>one solution strategy was used during the analysis of a single wall specimen, the modelling uncertainty parameters<br/>were estimated using results from previous studies[3]. The modelling uncertainty parameters were<br/>estimated to be, µm Æ 1.21 and Vµ Æ 6.88%. These parameters infer that the results obained from different<br/>solution strategies were close to each other but still had a considerable bias with respect to the structural<br/>capacity obtained from the experimental values. The NLFEA underestimated the capacity as compared to<br/>experimental results. Only 79.3 % of the experimental capacity was realized from NLFEA.<br/>Three different safety format methods suggested in [2] and a new safety format method by Schlune et al.<br/>[4] are used in NLFEA to estimate the design load capacity. The effect of inclusion of estimated model uncertainty<br/>parameters on design load capacity is observed too. The results of safety assessments indicated that<br/>the design load estimated by using ECOV and Schlune et al. safety format are comparatively higher than using<br/>Partial Safety Factor and Global Resistance Factor, but still conservative with respect to the experimental<br/>results.<br/>The reliability of the design load estimated by using different safety assessment methods is checked using<br/>response surface method and first order reliability methods. A response surface method together with FORM<br/>is used to obtain a quadratic limit state function that closely represents the response of the structural wall<br/>subjected to the design load value. The limit state function thus obtained is then used for FORM analysis,<br/>Importance sampling and/or Monte Carlo simulations to observe if the intended safety level is achieved.<br/>The study of acheived reliability index indicated that the design load values estimated by using three safety<br/>formats recommended in [2] are conservative, whereas the one estimated by using Schlune et al. format was<br/>found to be non-conservative.<br/>The additional thesis was carried out with various approximations and limitations. All limitations and approximations<br/>are explained in detail and justified where necessary and possible. The results and discussions<br/>of this additional thesis are dependent only on a single solution strategy adopted in a single wall specimen<br/>and in a single failure mode. Therefore, the results should instead be interpreted as an indication of need of<br/>further and extensive research and studies required in the field of reliability analysis and safety assessment<br/>using nonlinear finite element analysis.","reliability analysis; safety assessments; nonlinear finite element analysis; modelling uncertainty","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","","Reliability Analysis And Safety Assessments of Structural Wall with Nonlinear Finite Element Analyses",""

(mentor); Tilie, Nico (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2017","In this project the potentials of designing the fifth façade are being investigated for the city centre of Rotterdam. <br/><br/>The city is popular: in 2050 will 66% of worlds’ population will live in the city. The current practice, supported by national policy is to accommodate people inside the municipality borders in order to guarantee the open space in the landscape. The aim of compacting the city, is in particular focused on the city centre, to complete this area. In particular the city centre has to become more complete by accommodating houses. For now, the city centre is based on services and offices, which results in a low vital environment. Space for land is needed, to complete the city and complete the city centre.<br/> Beside the need for space in the city, the city acts in an opposite way by an inefficient use of land, because the fifth façade is underutilized as an element of the city. Designing in a more efficient way, to use the roof as land creates more space, and therefore value for the city in the form of land-use. <br/> This project investigate the possibilities of using the roof to a more efficient land-use approach in urban context. <br/><br/>In the search for potential to develop the fifth façade as useful land, the city-centre of Rotterdam has been selected as location. This city is chosen because of the high quality of the physical conditions of the roofs, the goal of doubling the amount of inhabitants and the current lively image of the fifth façade from bottom-up and top-down view. <br/><br/>The projects is based on the research of the Urbanisten (2015), who formulated four typologies of developed roofs 1) the green roof, 2) the blue roof, 3) the red roof, and 4) the yellow roof. According to these typologies, a the new term of a ‘public roof’ based on the red roof has been formulated: <br/><br/>‘A roof which has the physical capacity to be open for men and is well connected to the city in terms of the three dimensions’ (See terminology).<br/><br/>The approach of this design views this kind of roof as the base of developing the fifth façade of the city. <br/> A chain of roofs from the important places Central station, Blaak and the Erasmusbridge linked up to each other, creating an alternative pedestrian route on city centre scale, is the main concept of this design. This route, creates a pedestrian connection between important places in the city, creates small scale and green public spaces and small scale ‘optop’ real-estate. The design therefore creates a more efficient use of land, but also will stimulate roofs in surrounding areas to develop the fifth façade. Furthermore it stimulate places on ground level to develop a more human scale and it is expected to boost shops and services under the fifth façade. In this way, the roof is seen as city element, which results in more value because of scaling up, rather than developing each roof separately.<br/> To design a public structure of roofs, the city centre of Rotterdam will change from inefficient land-use to a more efficient land-use which gives space to more housing and public space.<br/><br/>The city centre of Rotterdam is suitable because of her amount of after WWII real-estate. A lot of (Dutch) cities have developed around a core of historical buildings in the city centre, and will therefore probably not be suitable for a linked system of accessible roofs. ‘New town’ cities will probably more be suitable. <br/> When designing the fifth façade as useful land,one has to take in mind, that it is customized work, because of the relation with architecture and is depending of lot of bottlenecks such as ownership and physical quality of the building. Every location where the potential is to design the fifth façade has to be carefully analysed. These bottlenecks can scare, but as the effects of the use of the roof will create a lot of benefits, it is worth to try and overcome these bottlenecks.<br","Urban fabric; Rotterdam; Fifth facade; Roof landscape; Multifunctional; Land use","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","Multifunctionele dakenprogramma Gemeente Rotterdam","51° 55′ NB, 4° 30′ OL"

(mentor); Verhagen, H.J. (mentor); Kuiper, C. (mentor); Reedijk, B (mentor); Eggeling, T (mentor); Hofland, B. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2017","Nowadays, the use of concrete armour units on rubble mound breakwaters designs has become a common practice. Concrete armour units can be placed in a single layer system or in a double layer system and can its placement can be either random or uniform. Recently, Delta Marine Consultants have designed a new armour unit called Xbloc+. This new block is applied as a one layer system and has a regular placement. As Xbloc+ is still under development, preliminary guidance on the performance of this new armour unit is required. This led this research to investigate how Xbloc+ behaves concerning wave overtopping. To analyse wave overtopping, small scale tests were performed in a 2D wave flume. Wave overtopping was measured at a 3Dn distance from the seaward edge of the crest, which is made of rock. In front of the slope there is a flat transition of 0.3m followed by a sloping foreshore of 1/30. In total, 10 series of tests were conducted. In this research, three wave steepness (S<sub>op</sub>) were tested (0.02, 0.04 and 0.06) to see the effect of wind waves and swell conditions on the armour layer and tests were performed in two different slope angles (1/2 and 3/4). Each series is formed by several sub tests conducted with increasing wave heights (and wave period in order to maintain a constant wave steepness). Tests were carried out until the failure of the armour slope was reached. Besides, a smooth slope was tested in a 1/2 slope angle to be able to compare smooth and rough results and determine the roughness coefficient of the armour unit more accurately. The test results showed that wave overtopping rates increase exponentially with wave height (H<sub>m0</sub>) and wave period (T<sub>m-1,0</sub>). Moreover, waves with lower wave steepness (swell conditions) induce higher overtopping discharges as compared to larger wave steepness. Steeper slopes also lead to higher overtopping rates. Therefore, the larger the breaker parameter is, the larger the overtopping discharge results. The influence of the armour roughness and armour permeability is also analysed and it is observed that swell conditions are less affected by these properties. This can be explained by means of the breaker type. Swell conditions are characterized by large surging waves. These waves have a thicker water tongue as compared with other type of breaking (e.g. spilling or plunging) and therefore, they tend to feel the top layer “smoother”. This fact is supported by the analysis of the influence of the roughness coefficient since higher values are obtained for surging waves. In fact, the roughness coefficient ranges between 0.34 and 0.68 showing that, although empirical prediction consider this parameter as a constant, it is dependent on the wave conditions.<br/>Concerning the comparison of dimensionless overtopping rate over Xbloc+ armour between test results and empirical prediction, it was found that the present formulae does not give a good estimation due its simplicity. In order to improve the representation of some parameters such as slope angle and wave steepness, correction factors are introduced in the empirical formulae leading to a better fit between prediction and measured data. <br","Xbloc+; Overtopping; Physical modelling; Breakwater","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Coastal and Marine Engineering and Management (CoMEM)","",""

First the possibilities of GP are tested on synthetic data, which results in a shortlist of good working objective functions and insight in the most important GP settings. The test on real data in the Belgium Ardennes showed that GP using the objective functions KG10, MM and Shafii performed better. Nevertheless all three models performed not well on simulating the low flows and high peaks. Furthermore GP using KG10 and MM both results in simple serial models which perform well overall, but bad on quick response runoff. Shafii resulted in parallel models which show quick response flow, however GP it is not able to capture the fast responses correctly (yet). GP has the potential to improve the understanding in the behaviour of catchments, however it still needs the human mind to observe, compare and analyse the modelling results. The main consideration with GP is to look for a balance between: model search space, objective function, randomness and (computational) time. The challenge is how to lead GP in an efficient way without removing the possibility of finding unknown patterns.","Genetic programming; Conceptual modelling; Hydrology","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Water Management","Additional thesis",""
