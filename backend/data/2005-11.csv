(mentor); Pinkster, J.A. (mentor)","2005","With the increasing number of risers attached to floating oil and gas production platforms, it is necessary to include the influence of risers in the motion analysis of the platform in waves. The motion analysis is required to determine the workability of the unit and the loads on the structure, therefore accurate results are of great importance. Deep-water semi submersibles with over fifty risers are being built, but still the risers are often extremely simplified in the motion analysis. This report describes the development and evaluation of a method to include the effects of steel catenary risers on the first order wave response of a semi submersible in frequency domain motion analysis. In this method the riser system is replaced by a damped mass - spring system. The method is applied on a semi submersible and the results are compared with results from the simplified method currently used by Marine Structure Consultants b.v. (MSC) and an advanced coupled method. Lumped mass simulations show that risers can be modelled as a damped mass - spring system. The damping is quadratically related to velocity, but can be linearized into fi-equency dependent linear damping. The effective mass of the riser can be considered constant over the frequency range of first order motions. The simulations reveal that risers approximately maintain their quasi-static catenary geometry during wave frequency heave motions, which is not the case during horizontal motions. Systematic lumped mass simulations with various riser types and configurations show clear relations between the riser parameters and the damping and mass coefficients as long as the riser motion is rather quasi-static, but these relations get disturbed when the riser deviates too much from its catenary shape. An empirical model is derived which can be used to find the coefficients of the damped mass - spring system for risers within the range of tested riser configurations. The current MSC frequency domain motion analysis includes the stiffness of the mooring and riser system and uses empirical riser mass terms based on the static vertical tension. The new frequency domain method improves this with mass and damping terms based on lumped mass riser excitation simulations. A linearized frequency dependent damping term is used, because quadratic damping cannot be included properly in the motion analysis software. The original and new methods are verified with a time domain motion analysis where the lumped mass model of the risers is coupled to the hydrodynamic model of the hull. This is the most accurate method available for this analysis. Both the original and the new method perform well in the horizontal plane. For vertical motions however, the current MSC method performs insufficiently; the new method performs much better, although there are still deviations from the coupled analysis. The main conclusion is that the new method significantiy improves the prediction of vertical first order motions. Other conclusions are that risers can have an important effect on the first order motions of a semi submersible and that risers can be modelled as damped mass - spring systems. The coefficients of these systems can be obtained using empirical equations with variables like water depth, diameter, frequency and amplitude, as long as these variables are within the range of tested risers. If they are not, lumped mass simulations should be used to obtain the coefficients. It is recommended to use either the new method or a fully coupled method. When the damping and mass coefficients can be obtained from the empirical formulas, the new method is very fast compared to coupled analysis.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","","","","",""

The current depth at the pier is too small for large coastal tankers to fully load when mooring at the pier. In order to increase their cargo capacity, the depth in the mooring area should be increased. To expand the present pier into deeper water would be too expensive. Another option is dredging. The stability of the pier, dolphins and gantry might be endangered by dredging activities, but since only 2 to 3 meters of soil need to be dredged, and because the gantry has a reach of 10 m., it is possible to design the dredging area far enough from the pier to not have an effect on the pier- and gantry stability. The dolphins are closer to the dredging area and need to be replaced. The new dolphin design is adjusted to the dredging depth. The new mooring area is only accessible for the largest mooring coastal tankers when fully loaded during several hours a day, because of the tides. Therefore they might have to wait in the mooring area for several hours if the pier is occupied. Smaller or unloaded tankers can reach the mooring area at any time. The second issue is about oil leakage from the refinery into the surrounding soil. On the area of the refinery of La Libertad petrochemical substances have been leaking into the subsoil. This has lead to the contamination of the soil around the refinery of La Libertad. Most of the pollution is found on the area of the refinery itself. However, on the ocean side of the refinery the contamination reaches out of the refinery's territory. A gasoline smell can be detected and petrochemical substances have been found in the subsoil of the beach. In this area there is a primary school, a military campus and a little village called La Carioca, that all suffer from this contamination. The source of the contamination of the beach area was a leaking pipe, upstream of the beach. This pipe has been traced and has been replaced by a new pipe. The contamination of the soil in this area causes risks for the human health and for the environment. To reduce the impact of the pollution in the contaminated area on the ocean side of the refinery of La Libertad different alternatives have been generated. Only methods have been used that involve groundwater or groundwater flow. The best way to reduce the impact of the contamination is to construct a slurry wall between the ocean and the contaminated plume. On the downstream side of the contaminated groundwater plume three extraction wells are located. The plume is entirely captured in the combined capture zone of these wells so the contamination can not spread any further. On the upstream side of the contaminated groundwater plume an injection well is located. This injection well makes sure that the plume can be removed more quickly. Additives can be put in the water that is injected through the injection well. This will cause more components of the oil mixture to dissolve in the water so more of the pollution can be removed from the soil.","Ecuador; pollution; refinery","en","student report","TU Delft, Department Hydraulic Engineering, departement of Watermanagement","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering & Water Management","","","","-2.218997, -80.905435"
