Further development of expertise in seismic analysis of jack-ups is required to improve safety and reduce costs. At present, a linear elastic foundation model is used in seismic assessments. Improved understanding of foundation behaviour can lead to a significant reduction in conservatism. In this thesis a brief comparison of available foundation models is made. The radiation damping model has been improved, which is found to have minor effect on jack-up response. To capture non-linear foundation behaviour, a hypoplastic macro-element has been implemented in seismic simulation software OpenSees. This results in reduced non-linear resonance and an amplitude-dependent resonance-shift. The modelled loads at critical locations in the structure consistently decrease more than 25\% as a result. Plastic displacements and hardening are found to be significant for highly non-linear soils and severe earthquakes. This thesis demonstrates significant conservatism in the linear foundation model. Implementation of the proposed hypoplastic macro-element can thus reduce costs and increase demonstrated capabilities of jack-ups significantly.","Earthquakes; Jack-up; Non-linear hysteretic model; macro-element; Opensees; Offshore Wind Turbines","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper we investigate and evaluate running gait as a unique attribute for video person re-identification in a recreational long-distance running event with 257 participants. We show that running gait recognition achieves competitive performance compared to video-based approaches in the cross-camera retrieval task and that gait and appearance features are complementary to each other. In addition, we compare gait recognition applied to walking and running sequences. An important difference is that we walk with straight arms, but run with bent arms. We propose to use human semantic parsing to create partial gait silhouettes from body parts to find the most discriminative combination. We demonstrate that the arm and leg swing are the most discriminative parts of the running gait. Our proposed method provides better recognition results by removing the torso from the silhouettes and allowing the arm swing to be more visible.","Computer Vision; Deep Learning; Gait Recognition; Human Semantic Parsing; Running Gait","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This fact, although fascinating, it creates complexity and many interfaces in its operation. The performance of such a system is governed by many aspects and involves many parties. Furthermore, these aspects and parties will have different needs and perceive performance in a different way. In order for the system to operate as smooth as possible, performance agreements are being made in different organizational levels. These agreements guide ProRail on how to manage the railway system and what it should achieve regarding several performance aspects. However, the railway system, as well as ProRail, are not single entities. They are comprised of several organizational levels. Each of these levels has its own needs and peculiarities, which in theory should be represented by their prescribed performance requirements. This creates a coupling between the performance agreements. They should be suitable for each organizational level while at the same time connected. These interrelationships can provide an overview of how the system performs and where adjustments should be made. Nevertheless, if their coupling is too strong, the organization can become cumbersome and stagnate. On the other hand, if their coupling is too relaxed, there will be no guidance and connection to what ProRail wants to achieve regarding the performance of the system. This thesis would like to examine the interrelationships between three performance agreements of ProRail. The Management Concession, Plan and its Performance Management System. The examination is focused on how well these agreements are coupled regarding different performance areas. Its proposed advice is a framework which can potentially alleviate the weaknesses described above. Its purpose is to strengthen the coupling of performance agreements while at the same time, leave enough room for adjustments and innovation. Moreover, the structure of the framework intends to minimize shielding behaviours by providing a process-based approach in the communication of performance requirements.

While new businesses contribute to economic development, valid reasons exist to inhibit data sharing (e.g. citizen privacy and sensitive information). Multi Party computation (MPC) provides a solution to these risks. However, MPC implementation remains limited, and we lack knowledge about the willingness to use MPC-enabled applications in organizational settings. The objective of this study is to investigate the effect of MPC on organizational willingness to contribute protected data for collective purposes. We ask: ""To what extent does MPC affect organizational perception of the contribution of protected data?"" From the quantitative assessment, MPC enhances organizational perceptions of data contribution and therefore significantly increases perceived trustworthiness and perceived security. Both of these aspects are found to be important and of approximately equal importance when considering contribution of protected data. That is, both are considered as the locus of willingness to contribute protected data through a web-based application. From the qualitative assessment, it is assumed that the positive contribution of MPC herein is because it allows data contribution independently from conventional data processors, which typically have access to raw data. The extent to which MPC increases perceptions depends on the extent to which an organization is able to assert the trustworthiness of the application and the security measure used by the application. MPC also affects perceived relative advantage. A weak correlation is reported between perceived relative advantage and willingness to contribute protected data, suggesting that relative importance is not perceived to be important as perceived trustworthiness and perceived security with respect to willingness to contribute protected data. Nevertheless, MPC also seems to enhance perceived relative advantage. Finally, although the relative advantage of MPC was not perceived as necessary, several findings are reported to further enhance the utility provided by an MPC application.","Multiparty computation; Confidential data-sharing; Organizational perception; Willingness to contribute framework","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","Safe-DEED",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","On board of High Speed marine Craft (HSC), the crew and the passengers are exposed to high levels of Whole Body Vibrations (WBV) and large magnitude Repeated mechanical Shocks (RS) caused by the motions of the craft. The HSCs are typically 10 meters long, capable of reaching a maximum speed up to 50 knots and widely used by various maritime organizations. However, the operators and crew suffer from fatigue and injuries, leading to a reduced effectiveness and operational capacity of the marine craft. In an attempt to reduce the physical loads, passive Shock Mitigating Seats (SMS) can be installed. Numerous research has shown that an improperly designed SMS may amplify the wave impacts forces through phenomena such as bottoming out and dynamic amplification. Therefore, it is necessary to ensure that a suspension design works properly by testing the performance during wave impact events, before the seat is manufactured and installed onboard the craft. The problem is that it is difficult to determine the performance of the seats in both the design and off-design conditions with either sea trials or laboratory tests. This research focuses on the prevention of injuries and adverse health effects due to repetitive wave impacts by incorporating an injury model in the analyses of various suspension principles in the design of SMS. In the current analyses of SMS either simplistic or specific models are used which restrict the application of these models to other suspension designs. Therefore, a computer program based on the finite element method is developed that allows realistic input accelerations in the surge, heave and pitch direction. The program incorporates highly non-linear elements, including the effect of bottoming. Additionally, the validity of the half-sine approximation for the wave impact excitation pulse was reviewed and concluded to be inappropriate for design purposes as it underestimates the probability of bottoming. Furthermore, the modified evaluation methods of ISO 2631 Part 5 using an optimized age-dependent coefficient based on gender in combination with a Weibull injury risk model were implemented to evaluate the resulting seat level accelerations. A case study was conducted on a Fast Raiding Interception and Special forces Craft (FRISC) of the Royal Netherlands Navy (RNLN). A design based on a parallelogram of pinned truss elements in combination with a coil spring element was altered by replacing the coil spring with a gas-spring element. The design was analysed with dynamic simulations of full-scale measurements of wave impacts on a lifeboat of the Royal Sea Rescue Institution (KNRM). For the most severe wave impact of the acceleration record, the seat level acceleration was reduced from 17.7 [g] to 2.8 [g]. An operator of the age of 24 years who is exposed to the accelerations for half an hour a day, 30 days a year for two consecutive years was assumed. The probability of spinal injury was reduced for a male operator from 99.5% to 16.3% and for a female operator from 100.0% to 42.0%. These results illustrate the high risk of injury to which the HSC operators are exposed. By incorporating highly non-linear elements and spinal injury models, the program and evaluation methods are capable of modelling various SMS suspension designs and analyse the performance. This can assist the seat designer, engineer or researcher with investigating suitable suspension designs before sea trials, experimental tests and prototype iterations. Therefore, the method offers the possibility to save time and reduce costs. Furthermore, the method can assist in defining new regulations in order to limit the exposure of the operators to physical loads and reduce the risk of spinal injury to an acceptable level.","Shock Mitigating Seat; High Speed Marine Craft; Repetitive Wave Impacts; Suspension Principles; Half-Sine Approximation; Spinal Injury Models","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Marine Technology | Ship Hydromechanics","",""

(mentor); Kotsonis, M. (mentor); Casacuberta Puig, J. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","The location of laminar to turbulent transition is an important consideration as turbulent flow is associated with higher skin friction drag and, by extension, lower fuel economy. In unswept boundary layers, natural transition proceeds by the amplification of Tollmien–Schlichting waves. Tollmien–Schlichting waves are convective instabilities with spanwise oriented vorticity. The amplification of these instabilities/perturbations is sensitive to roughness elements, such as forward-facing steps. These surface imperfections are inevitable as steps, gaps, and humps are a byproduct of mismatch between panels of a wing. However, their interaction with Tollmien–Schlichting waves is not very well understood. Direct numerical simulation of the flow field around forward facing steps has been performed in this thesis to gain an in-depth understanding of the particular flow features that stabilise or destabilise the incoming Tollmien–Schlichting wave, with respect to a flat plate zero pressure gradient flow. The forward facing step is found to significantly distort the base flow, its effect scaling with the roughness Reynolds number in the upstream regime. This distortion of the base flow is observed to amplify the incoming instability, both upstream and far downstream. At the step location, however, stabilisation or destabilisation can be observed, depending upon the height of the step. The step causes the incoming Tollmien–Schlichting wave to split into two, just upstream of the step, and leads to two counter-rotating structures at the step location. The interaction of these structures influences downstream growth. Localised stabilisation is observed, at the step location, for step heights that are smaller than the boundary layer displacement thickness. Destabilisation is observed for larger step heights. The upstream base flow distortion is due to an adverse pressure gradient imposed by the forward facing step. The magnitude of the pressure gradient is found to scale with the roughness Reynolds number. The upstream amplification is due to the Tollmien–Schlichting wave encountering the distorted base flow. The response of the Tollmien–Schlichting wave to the distorted base flow is observed to scale with its wavelength. The ratio of the roughness Reynolds number to the wavelength ($\gls{Rehh}/\lambda$) is found to be the governing parameter for the upstream interaction of the step with the instability.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

The production of geothermal energy incorporates the use of corrosion inhibitors to protect the steel well-parts from the corrosive production fluid. The injection of inhibitors leads to a risk of exposing the reservoir rock to these solutions. Up until now no data has been published to describe the effects of the corrosion inhibitor on the mechanical reservoir rock properties. This thesis aims to remedy this situation by performing compressive triaxial experiments on rock samples which have been saturated with inhibitor solutions. Two rock types which are representative of geothermal reservoir rocks were tested using two different inhibitors. The results were compared to a set of control experiments performed on water-saturated samples. The sandstone experiments show no discernible difference between the different fluid-types. The limestone experiments do show a number of differences: The limestone samples that were saturated with the first inhibitor type saw an increase in rock cohesion and a decrease in internal angle of friction. In contrast limestone samples that were saturated with the second inhibitor saw a decrease in rock cohesion and an increase in internal angle of friction. The lack of difference between the sandstone samples could be attributed to the inert nature of the constituent minerals. Limestone minerals are chemically more reactive and even though the exact nature of the chemical processes which lead to the observed differences remains unclear, a number of potential explanations are provided. We suggest that the change in mechanical rock parameters in the limestone rock are a result of the adsorption of the inhibitor components onto the particle surface. This adsorption alters the particle surface charge which leads to a change of the electrostatic repulsive forces. Additionally the same adsorption may affect the interparticle friction of our rock samples.","corrosion inhibitor; mechanical rock properties; Sandstone; Limestone; Failure behaviour","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(mentor); Sciacchitano, A. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","Closure of Collar's triangle represents a complete framework of fluid-structure interactions (FSI) enabling the comprehensive understanding of different design elements compromising aeronautical applications. Experimental methods such as tomographic particle image velocimetry (Tomo-PIV) are proven to provide accurate acquisition opportunities of fluid properties in three dimensional domains. However, not only the closure problem requires simultaneous investigations of fluid and structure behaviors but also the maximum attainable measurement volumes for characterizing these behaviors are severely limited for conventional Tomo-PIV applications. Therefore, a large scale Tomo-PIV setup capable of measuring simultaneous flow motion via Helium Filled Soap Bubbles (HFSB) and structure motion by means of surface markers is employed for experimental investigations of turbulent boundary layer interactions with an unsteadily deforming elastic membrane. Despite the aforementioned benefits of large scale tomographic PIV/PTV techniques, available spatial resolution characteristics for time-resolved flow field measurements are significantly restricted due to the tracer particle specifications of HFSB. This restriction requires additional post-processing algorithms to be applied over the raw experimentally acquired datasets in order to mitigate the effect of experimental trade-off between the temporal and spatial resolution specifications, and allow instantaneous flow field characterization. Although state-of-the-art data assimilation approaches provide the capability of reconstructing high resolution flow features by interpolating the available scattered particle tracking information for global time-resolved flow field reconstruction, drawbacks due to the inability of resolving the viscous effects for near wall flow behavior, incapability of handling physical intrusions to the flow field and propagation of measurement errors, compromise accurate characterization of flow structures in close proximity of the FSI interface. First of all, these algorithms are developed for reconstructing flow features involved with engineering applications where the flow conditions are dominated by turbulent characteristics. However, the fluid behavior in close proximity of walls are dictated by non-negligible viscous forces. Hence, achieving dense interpolation of flow properties of near wall features requires proper characterization of viscous effects for which the thesis proposes the employment of wall function applications for appropriate boundary condition determination. Secondly, even though the available data assimilation methods are able to handle flow behavior around objects, characterization of regions in direct interaction with the object boundaries is not possible. Therefore, in order to handle non-uniform solid boundaries, computational FSI frameworks of the Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) and the immersed boundary treatment methods are utilized. Furthermore, as the local closure of Collar’s triangle demands fluid loading over the structural surfaces to be determined, surface pressure information is required to characterize the aeroelastic interactions. Hence, an alternative approach of non-intrusive surface pressure reconstruction from PIV data over unsteadily deforming non-uniform boundaries is introduced via interpreting the ALE method with boundary fitted coordinate systems. Finally, measurement and processing errors contained within the experimental procedures propagate through the data assimilation algorithms. Therefore, to enable the the mitigation of experimental measurement and processing errors, an alternative approach of governing equation based dense flow field interpolation is developed using solenoidal and irrotational radial basis functions (RBF). Capabilities of the proposed methods within the thesis project are demonstrated with various theoretical, numerical and experimental test cases. The wall function application enabled accurate characterization of average streamwise velocity profiles as well as providing slight improvements on the fluctuating velocity components compared to the no-slip boundary condition implementation. Both approaches introduced for handling of physical intrusions resulted in increased coherence levels of flow behaviors within the respective test cases, where the local variations of velocity components revealed promising improvements against the state-of-the-art assimilation algorithms favoring the developed methods in terms of providing greater agreements to the reference flow fields. The introduced surface pressure reconstruction scheme with boundary fitted coordinates yielded relative error levels confined below 4% compared to analytical flow field properties where the resultant errors are computed to be related to the numerical truncation errors rather than the discretizations of mesh deformations or vectorial transformations. The developed alternative approach of dense flow field interpolation with solenoidal and irrotational RBFs allowed inherent mass conservation for the velocity field reconstructions that significantly increased the agreement of the interpolated velocity and vorticity fields with the reference flow field information while irrotationality imposition on the material accelerations provided elevated accuracy levels for pressure field computations. Consequently, the proposed methods of wall function implementation, ALE-VIC+ and ImVIC+ are utilized for experimental characterization of surface pressure variations over the unsteadily deforming elastic membrane exposed to turbulent boundary layer conditions. The instantaneously available low density particle tracking information is assimilated towards dense interpolation of material accelerations to capture temporal evolution of static pressure values at the central membrane location. The superior accuracy specifications of both ALE-VIC+ and ImVIC+ against linear interpolation owing to the kinematic characterization of the influence of membrane motion on the flow field properties provided greater agreements of the non-intrusive time-resolved pressure field computations with the pressure tab measurements.","Fluid-structure interaction; Data assimilation; Pressure from PIV","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","HOMER",""

This thesis provides the theory required for the implementation of both exponential sinusoids and the sixth order inverse polynomials with 3D capabilities. These methods have been successfully implemented, verified and validated into the TUDAT shape-based framework.<br/>The four shape-based methods have been applied to an Earth-Tempel-1 transfer for start dates from 2020 to 2025 and time of flights of 100 to 8900 days. It is found that the following order can be established with respect to their lowest ΔV, based on both an unoptimised grid search and global optimisation: Inverse polynomial shaping (10.51 km/s), Spherical shaping (11.71 km/s), Exponential shaping (13.09 km/s), Hodographic shaping (26.22 km/s).<br/>Optimising for ΔV and peak thrust acceleration with the Earth-Tempel-1 transfer including a coasting arc between two powered arcs for inverse polynomials and spherical shaping compared to the standard transfer, yields the following results: Trajectories with similar and lower ΔVs, similar and lower peak thrust for the same ΔV and similar and longer time of flights. In conclusion coasting arcs provide more flexibility in terms of start date, time of flight and peak acceleration thrust for a marginal increase or decrease in ΔV.","Low-thrust trajectories; Shape-based methods; tudat; exponential sinusoid; inverse polynomial; spherical shaping; hodographic shaping; Implementation; Application; Optimisatiom; Earth-Tempel-1","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

This work provides a comparative study on the different vibration suppression algorithms, which would aid in developing a distributed placement of actuators (over-actuation) and sensors. The main aim is to achieve multi-mode suppression systems and improve collocation for higher-order modes which facilitates accurate control of the end-effector of a system. A comparison is drawn between point actuation and over-actuation in terms of energy consumption, amount of damping, and precision.

This study aims to understand the void formation mechanisms and investigate different soldering effects. Cu/Sn solder joints in flip chip packages were examined at 190°C after zero to four weeks thermal aging. Experimental approach included ion milling and plasma focused ion beam (PFIB) cross sectional examination, while simulation approach such as finite element modeling (FEM) was used to support the results. Results showed voids presence at Cu6Sn5/solder interface after three weeks aging due to the large local tensile stress induced by volume shrinkage associated with intermetallic compounds formation. These voids have tendency to self-heal after four weeks aging by a compressive stress that originates from the solder ball shrinkage. Compressive stress of 59 MPa was found sufficient to close the 3 µm void. Moreover, higher level of carbon and organic additives during the electroplating of Cu substrates showed a remarkable effect on the impurities incorporation, which in turn has led to more Krikendall voids at Cu3Sn/Cu interfaces. This suggests that by avoiding C and O impurities on Cu substrates, there will be less voids and thus more reliable joints. Furthermore, solder joints in Cu/Sn/Cu sandwich structure without underfill were found to release volume shrinkage stress by height reduction and thus resulting in no voids formation. On the contrary, in structures that have underfill filled in between the solder joints, stress will accumulate to a higher level when the volume intends to shrink and stimulates voids to form. The simulated strain in solder joints with the underfill can be as high as 60 % while it can only be 25 % without the underfill. Both experimental results and FEM suggest that voids have higher forming tendency when subjected to the underfill. Last but not the least, cracks will generate due to large mismatch of coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) when solder joints undergo multiple reflows. Underfill can compensate the large difference and suppress the cracks formation. Consequently, the application of underfill is very crucial for voids formation and solder joints reliability. ","flip chip; Cu-Sn; Voids","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Materials Science and Engineering","",""

(mentor); De Martino, C. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","Commercial interest for millimeter-wave wireless communication has increased significantly over the past years due to the appearance of large volume applications such as automotive radar and telecom applications, i.e. as 5G systems operating in the FR2 band, ISM applications in the 60 GHz E-band, and beyond 100 GHz in the W-band and D-band. Developments in this frequency range are enabled by the continuous improvements in silicon-based technologies over the past decades and are driven by frequency congestion in low-GHz bands. To support development for these applications there is a demand for new millimeter-wave test equipment, de-embedding/calibration methods and device characterization approaches. Three topics related to challenges in millimeter-wave on-wafer characterization are addressed in this work.<br/><br/>A novel characterization method is developed for in-band linearity estimation that overcomes the limitation of harmonically generated spectral content by the frequency extension modules in the millimeter-wave active load-pull setups. The method is able to estimate trends in the EVM across input drive level, frequency and loading condition from vector gain measurements of the active device. On-wafer measurements were performed to benchmark the method against true EVM measurements in two sub-30 GHz bands. A proof of concept demonstration at 165 GHz showed the ability of the method to estimate trends for in-band linearity across drive level and loading condition at millimeter-wave.<br/><br/>A new parametrized 16-term error model and calibration algorithm was developed to overcome probe-to-probe cross-coupling effects during millimeter-wave on-wafer characterizations. Conventional 16-term calibrations are not practical as these are only effective if the probe-to-probe spacing is not changed after calibration. This new approach allows for interpolation of the error terms for devices under test that have a pad spacing not included in the set of calibration standards. This makes the method powerful and practical as it would only require one set of calibration structures for large-scale on-wafer measurements of devices with a different pad spacing.<br/><br/>Finally, a preliminary investigation was performed into active device behaviour when operating close to the maximum oscillation frequency of the technology. This investigation is conducted using on-wafer millimeter-wave large signal measurements on a 22-nm CMOS FD-SOI technology. A new experimental method is proposed that could show different operating behaviours when moving towards the maximum oscillation frequency. This approach uses large-signal (load-pull) measurements of the device across power and supply voltage. Under the hypothesis that a slew rate like operation is obtained when the maximum oscillation frequency is approached, this characterization may show the transition point in frequency for the onset of such device limiting behaviour.","mmWave; load-pull; 16-term; calibration; on-wafer; active device; Millimeter-wave","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-03-31","","","","","",""

Support and expertise of citizens is needed to solve these challenges (Gerton &amp; Mitchell, 2019). Due to the demand for public participation, Participatory Value Evaluation (PVE) fulfils the needs of involving many participants in a scalable way in the process of participation and evaluation. PVE is unique in the way that it allows people to be a virtual decision-maker in a specific context. This method is not a decision-making tool in itself, but it allows participants to make their quantitative decisions and asks them to motivate their answers qualitatively. This results in qualitative and quantitative data about their choices. This research has explored opportunities of Natural Language Processing to automate the qualitative data processing of motivations given by citizens regarding a policy. The focus of this research has been set on human values to categorize the motivations of participants.Results from qualitative data analysis can support the process of policymaking. The outcomes of this exploratory study have been reflected by stakeholders involved in the case study to validate the application within the domain of decision-making. One outcome is that results from qualitative data analysis in PVE should never become a decision-making tool by itself. These outcomes help in creativity and reflection of the policy. Policymakers want to have outcomes of public evaluation and they want to be to act upon them. Analysing the qualitative data based on values give substance to certain values and can give guidelines on how to take these values into account. One way of doing this is visualising the values, norms and design principles in a value hierarchy using Value Sensitive Design. By doing this, knowledge of ‘the public’ can be used to support making policies.","Participatory Value Evaluation; Public Participation; Natural Language Processing; Value Based Decision Making; Policy-making","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","",""

(graduation committee); Huls, Chris (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","While innovation has always been viewed as a way to create sustained competitive advantage, the need to innovate has never been more for the financial sector. The financial industry, especially the financial service industry has been dominated by traditional institutions: Banks, in the past. However, with the advent of the digital transformation era, the distinction between different industries hardly stands. Tech companies are challenging established financial firms through high tech financial products and services. This creates a highly competitive innovation environment for Banks to compete in. Innovation was not a high priority for banks previously, however now they see themselves fighting against technology companies on unfamiliar battlegrounds. To compete with technology companies, the financial industry is shifting its focus to products and services based on emerging breakthrough innovations. Innovations centers are being set up in organizations that experiment with several technologies simultaneously. This study is aimed to help innovation centers at financial organizations in their innovation efforts, more specifically in understanding when the innovations are ready. When several innovations are being developed in parallel, it is easy to lose sight of what qualifies as mature. Past literature, in the field of innovation management, has suggested Innovation readiness assessment as a method to understand the maturity/readiness of innovations. However, most of these studies have been fragmented, with no application in the financial sector. Based on these gaps this study is used to answer the research question “How can innovation centers at financial institutions evaluate the readiness of emerging technologies in the pre-diffusion phase?” Through an intensive literature review, four dimensions are identified as crucial to innovation readiness: Technology, Organization, Market, and Regulation. The Regulation dimension is later combined with the Market dimension to keep this study more generalizable. Based on these dimensions, an initial framework is developed combining factors from each of the four dimensions. The initial framework consists of 28 factors: Six technology factors, ten organization factors, and twelve market factors including factors for the regulatory aspect. The initial framework is later tested in a financial organization using three case studies. Each case study is considerably different from the other. These cases are investigated from a dyadic viewpoint, considering opinions from both technology and business actors in the organization. The data is collected via semi-structured interviews and is predominantly qualitative. Furthermore, Data is codified and analyzed using a Computer Assisted Qualitative Analysis Software (CAQDAS). The results from the analysis are presented in the form of individual case reports followed by a cross-case study of all distinguishing factors. The framework is readapted into a tool, based on the insights generated. Known as the Financial innovation readiness tool (Financial IRT), it delineates readiness factors into Pivotal, Indeterminate, and Differential. While Pivotal factors are highly relevant to innovation readiness, the Differential category accounts for factors with fluctuating relevance across cases. This tool is supplemented with a process for its application. The process allows innovation centers at financial centers to surface relevant readiness factors associated with an innovation and compare different innovations. As an addition to the existing decision-making process, the tool allows exploration and identification of potentially successful innovations. Prioritizing ideas allows time, effort, and investment to be directed towards projects with more chances of being a final product. Hence, with the use of the Financial IRT, the innovation process at financial organizations could be made more efficient. Although the results are quite encouraging, the generalizability of the tool is weak. The tool needs to be tested for its applicability across industries. Moreover, the tool is in no way definite in its application. The study was explorative in nature. There may exist other concepts that were not covered in this study. This opens the possibility for further investigation.","Innovation; Readiness Assessment; Transition management; Financial innovations","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

The effective use of data presents opportunities for banks to meet their obligations in improving financial risk and also ensuring business growth and continuity in their offerings. For these reasons, there is value in acquiring and using mixed or aggregated data sets from external sources as a means to extrapolate and gain information and knowledge. However, the balance between data privacy and data use remains a challenge for banks which impedes on their ability to proficiently and resourcefully generate and protect their assets. Privacy-preserving data sharing methods such as Secure Multiparty Computation or MPC may be a viable solution for enterprises facing this issue. Through the use of multiple cryptography protocols and computational algorithms, MPC is a technology that enables parties to anonymously compute functions on shared data without demanding a trusted third party. This study aimed to explore the potential business impact of MPC whereby semi-structured interviews were conducted with expert stakeholders from three major EU multi-national banks. The possible future outcomes of MPC implementation is determined via a scenario analysis over time horizon of five years (2020-2025). Based on value creation theories from inter-organizational systems and business model disciplines, a conceptual model for MPC implementation outcomes was developed to guide the scenario analysis process. This study found that there are generally four archetypes of scenarios for MPC implementation in banks leading to improved internal efficiency of banks and/or (in)direct MPC enabled business models. Besides known MPC use-cases in money laundering initiatives and security risk frameworks, new MPC business cases were found for data-driven ""as a service"" models and (cross)industry data platforms.

Well- known bicycle brands in their portfolio include Babboe, Batavus, Ghost, Haibike, Koga, Lapierre, Raleigh, Sparta and Winora. Since Accell has decided to give sustainability a higher priority, there is a need to integrate sustainability in the product design process (also referred to as PDP). In the analysis phase of the project, the context, sustainable progression and product development process were analyzed. Insights from sustainable progression were that currently no strategy for sustainable progression exists, and biggest opportunities for lowering impact on the environment were in the use of recovered materials, and better end-of-use processing. Next, the product development process and its users were analyzed. Although designers are motivated to make design choices of influence to the sustainability of the bicycle and / or production process, the culture in Accell currently not actively encourages such choices in design as costs and speed of execution have a higher priority. To validate such choices in design, it should be quantified enabling it’s integration in bicycle requirement documents. These insights resulted in the choice of the circular economy as main approach in the project. It provides a clear vision (zero impact on the environment) and includes strategies that combine financial and sustainable demands. Furthermore, circular methodologies are being developed that enable to assess progression. In the circular exploration phase, the perspective of the circular economy is used to analyse the current bicycle lifecycle (from production to end-of-use) to spot opportunities for improvement. Various circular economy assessment methodologies are tested through application on Accell Group. Insights gathered from this phase were translated into requirements for the development of the circular tool. The methodologies, strategies and guidelines were discussed, validated and tested during the exploring phase on several project teams, and feasability also discussed with new business development and supply chain. Insights gained from these interactions were implemented in the development of the circular tool. In the development phase a circular tool was designed, using insights from the circular exploration. The tool functions a circular conversation facilitator, and simultaneously as a indicator for circular progression of a bicycle development project. Therefore, it can communicate the circular value of a project between project teams, I&amp;T department and managements, enabling to set goals and work towards them. The score achieved in a project is linked to assessments created on a system, design and component level, using indicators such as (dis)assembly time, percentage of recovered materials, use of toxic materials and established recovery players in a project. Furthermore, it includes guidelines on these same levels to help thinking in circular loops, create circular business models, choose green materials and circular plastics, design for disassembly and finally select sustainable suppliers. Circular indicators were created to include in the documents used in the product development process, with the goal of gathering information about materials and components from suppliers.

Within this industry, various solutions have been attempted to lower the environmental impact. Two of these concepts are the circular economy (CE) and industrialized construction (IC). CE refers to an approach that embraces circular supply chains as opposed to a “take-make-dispose” system. IC can be defined as a “construction technique in which components are manufactured in a controlled environment, transported, positioned and assembled into a structure with minimal additional site works”.<br/>The IC approach offers three potentials to overcome several barriers compared to circularity in traditional buildings. (1) The IC nature of supply chain integration supports the notion of shared responsibility for a CE. (2) IC is characterized by a longer planning phase to coordinate assembly on-site providing an opportunity to plan for disassembly in order to recover the material in the future. (3) IC focusses on standardization of prefabricated parts which supports adaptability and flexibility, thereby anticipating future modifications. Research on the combination of the Circular Economy and Industrialized Construction remains very limited. This thesis identifies opportunities to accelerate the integration of CE principles in industrialized construction methods within a Swiss context. This research is structured along three parts: (1) a literature review to assess the main developments of circular industrialized construction. (2) A conceptual framework combining two qualitative frameworks – the Strategic Niche Management and the Multi-level Perspective is developed to study and compare case studies demonstrating circular IC (UMAR unit, ICEhouse and ECO Solar Houses) including the external factors facilitating or impeding this development. (3) Finally, a list of recommendations providing a pathway for scaling up circular IC in Switzerland is presented. Data is collected through literature review, desk research and semi- structured interviews with stakeholders directly involved in the projects and industry experts. The findings indicate that five circular strategies should be present and work together to increase the circularity potential of IC: circular materials, product as a service, product lifetime extension, sharing platforms and resource recovery. At the start of a project, the use of comprehensive material database and increased documentation is crucial to make informed decisions about retaining value at a building’s end-of-life phase. Building layers should be separated and specifically for a building with many different materials and components, a higher level of pre-assembly is favored to increase control of construction to achieve higher reuse of recovered materials. Business models need to be reconfigured by extending ownership of components and modules. Transformation in design is recommended by incorporating standardization and design for disassembly practices to enable future reuse. The study showed that the establishment of demonstrator projects is key to facilitate the development of the circular IC niche. Specific network characteristics need to be present: a facilitator providing financial capital and flexibility and a diverse multidisciplinary team with stakeholders who are involved early in the process to create a common circular mindset. Finally, the initator(s) will have to demonstrate leadership through sharing the mission and vision explicitly to attract more stakeholders, who in turn can supply resources. Governmental involvement through VAT reductions on secondary raw materials and the provision of financial incentives is crucial. A regulatory framework for the input of construction materials will be essential and needs to be developed. In support of such a framework, a secondary raw material marketplace, outcomes of research programs and certification labels may be developed. By adopting these measures, circular industrialized construction can be scaled up through new projects, and in doing so contribute to a more sustainable construction industry.","Circular Economy; Prefabrication; strategic niche management; Industrial Construction; Multi-level perspective","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Industrial Ecology","",""

Focused as a visual display in some applications and as a medium of input or output in others, this technology holds a lot of potentials to be explored in present and future applications since it is a unique type of hardware that can actually show images in a real world. Recently, many such platforms have been created by the use of different hardware solutions and have found applications in gaming interface, physical telepresence, dynamic objects etc. Some research areas that can still be explored are applications for the blind, building and object modelling etc. With advances in applications, there is a need for hardware with higher resolution at a lower cost. Also, being an interact-able display, safety and comfort of the user is of utmost importance. This has been seen to be lacking in the existing projects.

The combination of a preemptive execution model and a multiprocessor platform poses a challenge when analysing the predictability of a system. In this thesis, we present a new type of framework for the worst-case response time analysis for preemptive tasks scheduled on multiprocessor platforms. The proposed framework analyses this worst-case response time by building a schedule abstraction graph that abstracts all the execution scenarios that occur in the system. Since preemptive tasks scheduled on a multiprocessor platform creates a large state space of execution scenarios to explore, a schedule abstraction graph can easily face a state space explosion problem. A novel methodology has been introduced in this thesis, that allows us to eliminate state space explosion altogether. We used this new schedule abstraction graph framework to initially develop an analysis for uniprocessor platforms and compare it to the state-of-the-art. We then explain how the analysis can be extended from uniprocessor to multiprocessor platforms.","real-time systems; global multiprocessor scheduling; schedulability; schedulability analysis; preemptive tasks; worst-case response time","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Embedded Systems","",""

(mentor); Storm, S.T.H. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","Integrated assessment models (IAMs) are greatly influential in global climate policy discussions and decision making. Mainstream IAMs suggest climate mitigation pathways which amount to making very little changes to emissions, consumption, and investment patterns in the short term. Instead, they rely on back-loading the mitigation efforts to reach outcomes that are the most economically efficient, and hence considered most socially optimal. It implicitly finds the social costs associated with the impacts of climate change acceptable up to the point where it affects the aggregated economic costs negatively. These socially optimum policies from IAMs lie at odds with the calls to expedited action by climate scientists and ethicists. Criticism is also levelled at IAMs for a evaluating the hardship caused by climate change to future generations much lower than present benefits from not avoiding it.<br/><br/>The thesis investigates this apparent dissonance by reviewing the economic foundations of the DICE IAM. The dissonance is traced back to the conceptualisation of welfare used in DICE based on the neoclassical Ramsey-Cass-Koopman growth theory in DICE. The welfare function includes the twin factors of time discounting, and evaluation of relative economic utility of costs and benefits of mitigating climate damage within each time-period. The shortcomings of the approach in context of climate economics are discussed by analysing the normative assumptions that underpin it. A novel disaggregation of the utility welfare is proposed to include a disutility of damage. The disutility of damage is modelled similarly, but evaluated independently from<br/>the utility of consumption to incorporate the impact of an uncertain climate damage more meaningfully in IAMs.<br/><br/>The proposed concept is demonstrated by simulating the outcomes from a corresponding modification to DICE. Towards this end, DICE is transformed from a deterministic optimisation model into a simulation model. An exploratory modelling and analysis (EMA) approach is used to evaluate the outcomes over a large ensemble of potential scenarios and policies. The outcomes are analysed and compared with those from Nordhaus’ approach used in DICE. Results suggest that a disutility of damage function calibrated by a prescriptive or descriptive consideration of the Elasticity of Marginal Disutility of Damage (EMDD) has a significant negative impact on the overall welfare outcome.<br/><br/>The approach provides a useful way to incorporate prevalent as well as changing social preferences towards consumption growth and its utility in light of increasing, omnifarious, and deeply uncertain damaging effects of rapidly changing climate. It also makes IAMs more useful to evaluate the relative costs and benefits from more expedient mitigation proposals including a more realistic social cost of carbon (SCC), greater investment in emission reduction and control technologies, and considerations of a global economy not driven by ever increasing consumption<br/>growth demands.","DICE; IAM; climate change; economic welfare; disutility of damage; climate ethics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","",""

(mentor); de Jong, P. (graduation committee); Liu, Y. (graduation committee); Roos, Robert Jan (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","Cost overruns in infrastructure projects has been a well-known phenomenon for almost a decade. As per the generally accepted definition, the industry has been measuring cost overruns as the cost exceedance with respect to the approved contractor’s budget. But researchers are realizing the fact that the decision-to-build is generally taken long before the ‘budgeting’, which thereby falsifies the existing definition of ‘cost overruns’. It has been henceforth also realized that projects under overruns also don’t offer the best capital value because their as-built costs exceed the costs estimated for them during the “decision-to-build” stage. As a result, such projects debar other deserving projects from getting approved by the funding authority/infrastructure ministry, which could potentially deliver more value for the same invested costs. A lot of projects which were in high overruns in the recent past shouldn’t have been approved/funded/preferred by the decision makers over others (For example: The Channel Tunnel in the UK, cost overruns = 100%, Denver intl. airport in the USA, cost overruns =200%). Consistent overruns also indicate that even with consecutive projects, the experts are not learning to improve on it as well. As a result, cost overruns in infrastructure projects have been a subject of discussion for more than 2 decades now. It has been realized that not only the estimates presented to the decision makers should be accurate, but also the total project costs post approval (at the decision to build point) should adhere (be controlled) to the approved estimate. Either of the two situations/or both would lead to cost escalations/overruns. Researchers have been demanding more exploration on the front-end cost escalations of the projects rather than on the cost overruns in the execution phases. It has been realized that the front-end phases allow for the maximum control over the as-built costs, but ironically, the industry experiences more cost escalations in the front-end phases. It has been emphazied that ex-post studies on the front-end phases of projects can bring revelations on how projects suffer front-end escalations. Limited research exists on the front-end phases of infrastructure projcts, with almost all of them based on the Nordic countries and only one on the Dutch governance setting by Nijkamp &amp; Ubbels (1998). The limited research mostly includes the studies that have produced ‘characteristic escalation figures’ &amp; the ‘factors/causes’ (technical, political &amp; cognitive). All these factors except ‘technical &amp; cognitive’ are quite external to the project teams and are difficult to research on through ex-post studies. Citing ‘political factors’ as the prime cause, most researches on the ‘solutions’ counterpart have been discussing over ‘political misrepresentation’ as the main factor/cause of front-end cost escalations. Very less researches have been done on the ‘technical &amp; cognitive’ factors, which are more internal to the project teams and can be easily studied through the ex-post researches on the front-end phases of recently completed infrastructure projects. This thesis aimed to gather such ‘technical/control’ based factors &amp; their data collection/analysis methods, in order steer them for controlling the total project costs from the very front-end phases itself. This thesis gathered 19 such ‘control’-based technical factors from Arcadis cost experts and considered it as the starting point. Structured-questionnaire surveys then helped to filter out the most important factors which lead to front-end cost escalations. Finally, 12 interviews from two recent Dutch projects (Schiphol Expansion : Landside works &amp; Redevelopment of highway N270) gave insights on what approach should be taken for data collection [cross-learning (CL)/open-data gathering (OA)] &amp; data analysis [top-down (TD)/bottom-up (BU)] methods in order to steer the ‘factors’ in the front-end phases of the projects. The thesis concluded that ‘project-control’ based technical factors are crucial as well, and can be steered. The research results gave some insights on which data collection/analysis approaches should be taken for steering each of such ‘factor’ from the front-end phases itself. The thesis conclusively highlighted the need of further research on gathering more such ‘factors’ and obtaining suitable data collection (CL/OA) &amp; data analysis (TD/BU) methods for steering them. The need to focus on ‘project controls’ based factors (and not just political factors) from the very front-end phases was also conveyed.","Cost overruns; Front-end cost escalations; ex-post analysis; cost control; bottom up approach; top-down approach; cross-learning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

Social robots will be deployed, in increasing numbers, in assisting health care professionals during the provision of care to patients. While research in Human-Robot-Interaction (HRI) has investigated mechanisms for making decisions taken by artificial agents more ethical, there is limited work done in investigating adaptations to HRI that promotes ethical behaviour on the human-side. Moral dilemmas can appear when decisions have to be made regarding patientcare. Dealing with them can be challenging for healthcare professionals since the impact of decisions affect multiple parties and involves different considerations and value-trade-offs of the involved people. There are different approaches in which healthcare professionals can be confronted with moral dilemmas. Based on decision making principles, a robot might assist the health care professionals in ethical decision making with an appropriate reflection or confrontation of the dilemma. This thesis investigates how a social robot can confront a professional with a moral dilemma and what the associated effects are. Following the Socio-Cognitive Engineering (SCE) method, two alternative proto-patterns are created for dilemma confrontation by a robot in a resuscitation scenario: Verbal and Multi-modal confrontation. In such a scenario, the robot displays protests of distress and affect in order to help the professionals carry out systematic reflection of the moral dilemmas they experience. In an evaluation, it is tested whether these confrontation patterns are being perceived as intended, comparing the two confrontation patterns with a neutral scenario.","human robot interaction; Ethics; dilemma; decision making","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-09-29","","","","Computer Science | Data Science","",""

In the project, the service scope of a mobility hub is a community, and the service objects are residents of that community. The concept of living services in the project is defined as the living service package which includes the rental service and a series of additional shared services, such as shared space, cleaning and maintenance. Online surveys and qualitative interviews are conducted to understand how different types of users participate in shared mobility and shared living services, as well as their needs and expectations for community-scaled shared services. The results show that tenants living in shared living communities have higher demand and expectations for shared services, thus are regarded as the target users. Moreover, it is found that there is strong association between people's community life and their participation in shared services. In addition to the physical shared facilities and space, tenants expect value-added services to help them use shared services without concerns and better manage their community life. In the design phase, DUWO community is taken as an example for designing a living service concept including mobility, to support tenants' community life. The final design, DUWO community service platform, is not limited to the functional combination of shared mobility and shared living services, but also makes up for the deficiencies of DUWO's shared services in supporting services and neighborhood interaction. The platform integrates all DUWO's living services including shared mobility, and also provides tenants with neighborhood interaction and communication services. Additionally, communitybot is provided as a community service assistant, responsible for answering users' questions and providing users with suggestions and information based on their living conditions.","Shared living; Shared mobility; Mobility hub; Community; Neighborhood","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

Increasingly, governments and companies implement data-driven strategies, and the number of sensors in the public space is increasing. This translates into abysmal amounts of data about people, their behavior and habits. While the use of smart technologies in cities and specifically in Amsterdam has many potential benefits—from improving local economy and transportation to quality of life and e-governance—there is a growing concern about the ethical risks. Martinez-Balleste et al. (2013) identify that their use in cities jeopardize citizens’ privacy. Moreover, one of the main problems of smart technologies in the public realm is that they are often placed without users’ consent and without providing any notice of their presence. At the same time, the attitude of smart city residents towards this new paradigm — along with the ethical, social and privacy implications that derive from it — is one of indifference. The misalignment between smart city residents attitudes and privacy behaviour is what motivates this project. This project aims to engage smart city residents with smart technologies in order to create awareness, better understanding of the privacy implications and build a democratic process for smart cities. The design solution focuses on empowering smart city users by making smart technologies, its privacy implications and data insights legible for users. By building this knowledge and making privacy implications more visible, users will be able to notice smart technologies in the public realm and spread awareness. Moreover, they will be better equipped to make inform decisions about smart city projects and co-shape the city they envision.","Smart City; Artificial Intelligence and Design; Design for Interaction; Sensors; Ethics; Internet of Things; Amsterdam; legibility","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

For designers, sharing stimulates creativity and encourages personal development via collective sharing within the community, making happier individuals and by extension, a happier team. For knowledge sharing to happen, cultural change and the way people do things needs to be improved and this can be done through better management of knowledge within the organisation. The company context of this project, Accenture Interactive (Amsterdam), wants to explore ways to support its designers in their creative process and strengthen their culture of sharing by streamline the process of designing across the organisation through a digital knowledge platform. Within this research, knowledge sharing is defined as the information that was exchanged between people and knowledge material is defined as materials required for the sharing to occur. The goal of this research is to support the designer's process of designing, information of projects, people and materials should be made visible and easily accessible across the organisation. Therefore, an informative knowledge platform is designed to serve as a source of inspiration and foster sharing within the design team. This thesis documents both the findings of the research as well as the development of the knowledge platform. The challenge of this project is to understand what content do designers in Accenture Interactive share within the design team, what do they generate and how can sharing of knowledge be facilitated. The research will provide insights and define requirements that will contribute towards the building of the digital platform. To this end, the central aim of this research has been to explore ways for sharing of knowledge that supports designers in their creative work. A practice-based research methodology has been employed, with research methods including interviews, case studies and observations has been done with the design team across different departments and roles. The outcome of this project is a conceptual design of a digital knowledge platform, a common place where designers are able to access shared design resources, share tips across the design teams can be facilitated, thus fostering the sharing culture.

Besides this primary purpose, the coastal dunes also provide a variety of other functions such as the supply of drinking water, nature conservation and recreational areas. With the secondary functions in mind, the Dutch coastal management strategy changed in 1990 from erosion control and stabilization of the coastline (reactive) to a policy of dynamic preservation (pro-active) with the introduction of a law called ‘’Dynamic preservation of the Dutch coast’’. This new dynamic strategy naturally induced irregularities in dunes that were completely stabilized before. One of these irregularities is the formation of a blowout. A small depression or hollow in the foredunes formed by wind erosion or wave impact may grow in time as sediment from the beach and foredunes is transported into the back dunes. In several Dutch cases such a blowout feature was artificially initiated as the exchange of sediment from the coastal system into the back dunes enhances the biodiversity significantly. Due to the high importance of the coastal dune performance as flood protection, good understanding and prediction of the (dynamic) coastal dune system is desired. Lately, general interest in this topic increased even more due to new societal challenges, such as decisions on coastal development for longer time scales, more complex management settings and sustainability. Coastal dunes and blowouts are shaped by wind induced sediment transport (aeolian sediment transport), biological - and hydrodynamic processes. To better understand and increase the predictability of dynamic systems, this study focuses on simulating the development of artificially initiated blowout features by including the combination of these relevant processes in the numerical model AeoLiS. This process-based model was originally developed to simulate aeolian sediment transport in supply-limited conditions, such as coastal areas. The study describes simulations of several academic dune formations to validate the applicability of the different (new) processes that were included in the numerical model. Finally, all processes are combined in simulations of a practical case that is used to compare numerical model results to field data on the development of multiple artificially initiated blowout features in the Dutch coast at Meijendel.","Aeolian sediment transport; Dune development; Coastal dune development; Blowouts; Process-based modelling; Numerical modelling; AeoLiS","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering | Coastal Engineering","",""

The Stjernøy mine is an open pit and underground mine for Nepheline Syenite and this thesis focuses on Mine 2, the underground mine which is partially completed. The stopes of Mine 2 are closely located to old stopes, which can cause stability issues. Between the new and old stopes is a barrier pillar which is a key element in the stability of the underground mine and the infrastructure for the open pit operation as well. This project consists of field work and laboratory testing to create a basis for the numerical stability analysis of the mine and the creation of a cost model for the two different mining methods. The results of the cost modeling show that the use of sublevel open stoping will result in a cost per tonne of 9.86 NOK and the use of vertical crater retreat will result in a cost per tonne of 10.39 NOK. The use of sublevel open stoping as mining method is the most economically beneficial option for the mining operation. It is less expensive as a mining method and it is a proven method at this mine site. The vertical crater retreat method uses a more expensive blasting method, with the same burden and spacing parameters as the sublevel open stoping. The results of the field work and the laboratory testing provided important parameters for the numerical modelling, such as the strength of the material. Based on these results the numerical modelling also showed that it is beneficial for the stability of the pillar if some stopes near the barrier pillar are not extracted. The extraction of these stopes will decrease the factor of safety of certain areas of the barrier pillar to one or for some areas below one. The stope size has also been reviewed.

Just take for example the ecological devastation the DDT and the carcinogenic asbestos have caused. The advancement in new technologies like AI, IoT, autonomous robots and big data brings with it plenty of uncertainties, risks and ethical questions that need answers to if we wish to reap their benefits safely. We need these technologies to tackle some of the greater challenges of your society (like sustainability) but at the same time, we require ways to know how they should be deployed responsibly. This project focuses on the responsible deployment of technologies in the city of Amsterdam and this project has been done in collaboration with the Cities of Things Labs and the AMS institute. The project starts with an initial problem statement of “How can the “Principles for Accountable Algorithms and a Social Impact Statement for Algorithms” be used to develop a strategic framework for responsible Al innovation in Amsterdam” and to answer this question a literature review was done, Municipalities were researched, perception of the citizens were researched and in order to understand the relation of devices to the city a technology called Scan Cars was researched. Later in the project, the initial problem statement was reformulated into a change statement. The formulated change statement was “I want citizens to get well informed about what data collecting devices are doing in public spaces so that citizens can help authorities decide what is best for them” the value of transparency and the ladder of citizen participation were seen as means for achieving the above statement. The final design that was developed is a mobile application that shows citizens where the various data collecting devices are around them in the city, what actions do these devices take after they collect the data, how do the devices work and it gives citizens the opportunity to respond to these devices by either asking a question, giving feedback or participate in programs that work to improve the way of working of these devices in the city. In order to ensure technologies responsible usage in the city, it is important to reduce as many uncertainties about the devices as possible. This can be done by making sure every citizen has the channels to ask questions, give feedback and even raise their voices against these devices anonymously. It is also part of the municipalities “inclusive digital city” ambitions and interests to work on such platforms. In conclusion, the application is one such channel that the city should be developing for informing and empowering their citizens and the recommendations given in the report can be the first steps for fully developing the application.","Strategic Design; Responsible technology; Transparency; citizen participation; responsible innovation; Scan Car; ScanAuto; Amsterdam; public space","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

In this study, the relation between propeller noise and efficiency is investigated. Adjusted parameters are sweep, advance ratio and the collective pitch angle. The performance of randomly generated blades is evaluated using both RANS and BEM methods first, after which the noise is evaluated using Hanson’s frequency formulation. All results are combined in a multi-fidelity kriging surrogate model. The results suggest that maximum efficiency and minimum noise cannot be obtained at the same operating conditions.

In this research a deep learning (DL) model in combination with a similarity-based curve matching technique is used to estimate the RUL of a component. The data-driven RUL estimation scheme consist of an online and offline step. In the online step, a 1-dimensional Convolutional Auto-Encoder (1DConvNet-AE) is trained in an unsupervised way to convert multi-sensor readings, collected from historical run-to-failure instances, into a 1-dimensional reconstruction error vector. The set of generated 1-dimensional reconstruction error vectors is used to generate 1-dimensional Health Index (HI) curves which represent the various degradation paths of the run-to-failure instances. The HI curves based on historical run-to-failure instances are stored in the HI library. In the online step, multi-sensor readings of a test instance are converted into an online HI curve, representing the degradation path of an operational component. By using the similarity-based curve matching technique, the online generated HI curve is matched with the HI curves situated in the HI library. The RUL is estimated based on a weighted average of a set of matches which pass a set similarity threshold value. The proposed procedure is tested on an operational dataset. This research shows the existence of a relation between the increase of reconstruction error and health deterioration over time. The RUL estimation performance is considered in an operational evaluation procedure in which a similarity threshold value is included. This research shows a usable RUL can be estimated directly from raw multi-sensor input data by the proposed model.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-09-29","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

It does not have the first non-collocated mode which is present in existing XY stages having parallel configuration. It also has high yaw rotation stiffness which is verified using experiments.

One of these targets is a dramatic increase in the overall energy portfolio's market share of renewable energies. This increase in renewable market share will, for a large part, consist of newly built offshore wind farms. In turn, this rise in offshore wind energy projects is expected to be especially dramatic in northern regions, where high and constant wind speeds prevail. However, as offshore wind farm projects move further north, additional challenges need to be faced. One of these is the technical challenge to design offshore wind farms for possible encounters with drifting sea ice. To tackle this challenge, a proper understanding of the mechanics associated with encounters of drifting sea ice with offshore wind turbines is essential.<br/>Such encounters are currently primarily understood phenomenologically, and the associated models simulating these encounters – or ice-structure interactions – therefore are phenomenological as well. Moreover, most ice-structure interaction models are fundamentally one-dimensional, whereas ice-structure interactions are generally not one-dimensional. This mismatch holds especially for ice-structure interactions with offshore wind turbines, where wind loads are generally misaligned with ice loads causing highly two-dimensional ice-structure interaction problems. Therefore, the first half of this work sets out to extend one of the industry-leading phenomenological one-dimensional models – the Hendrikse (2017) model – to a two-dimensional environment. The ultimately developed Zero-friction contact Area variation Model By Omnidirectional Numerical Ice (ZAMBONI) attempts to do so by introducing practical extensions rather than introducing new assumptions. Nevertheless, one extension does entail a shift from current one-dimensional ice-structure interaction models. Namely, the assumption that ice experiences neither friction at the ice-structure interface nor internal shear forces. Consequently, much of the correctness of this model hinges on this extension. To assert the correctness of ZAMBONI. A comprehensive verification campaign is performed as well as a simple order-of-magnitude validation campaign. Although both confirm the extensions' correctness, further validation is required, especially concerning the zero-friction principle. Upon developing and discussing this two-dimensional ice-structure interaction model, the second half of this work couples ZAMBONI to an offshore wind turbine model to gain further insight into ice-structure interactions. These dynamically coupled two-dimensional simulations serve two purposes. Firstly, to compare one- and two-dimensionally simulated load cases of aligned ice and wind. Secondly, to perform newly simulable load cases of misaligned ice and wind. Four primary findings are discussed. Firstly, as hypothesized, introducing a disturbing wind load lowers the ice-structure contact area, causing smaller loads and displacements due to ice loads. This effect is especially well observable for misaligned wind loads and low far-field ice velocities. Secondly, a new ice-structure interaction regime is observed where ice and structure synchronize in the structure's first bending mode. This synchronization occurs most dominantly for two-dimensional ice. Thirdly, frequency lock-in occurs solely in the second bending mode and is terminated at lower ice indentation speeds for two-dimensional than for one-dimensional ice. Finally, small ice-wind misalignments, which are most common, appear highly similar to load cases of fully aligned ice and wind.","Ice-structure interaction; Offshore Wind Turbines; two-dimensional; Frequency lock-in; Intermittent Crushing; 1st bending mode synchronisation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2025-09-29","","","","","",""

The future port will be in Bluefields Bay, which can be characterised as a lagoon-shaped estuary. The inner basin is connected to the sea by two tidal inlets, located north and south of a barrier island. This study assesses the hydrodynamics and morphodynamics of the area; in addition, it analyses the influence of the port structures on these natural processes. A qualitative analysis of the hydrodynamics and sediment transport in the area is conducted, and sedimentation rates in the navigation channel and the erosion rates of the coast are calculated. The area is analysed with the help of a conceptual model that is supported by the process-based model Delft3D. Large parts of the area consist of shallow depths of around 1.5 m below mean sea level (MSL). The bed of these shallow parts consists mainly of mud. In those areas with a depth of more than 5 m below MSL, which are the river channel and the tidal channels at the inlets, the flow velocity increases, and a more substantial fraction of sand can be observed. In the data analysis, distinct wet and dry seasons can be observed; these seasons change the hydrodynamic influences over the course of the year. The river discharge increases by a factor of 10 during the wet season. In addition, the river delivers large quantities of mud, particularly during the wet period. When the tidal flow enters the lagoon, it influences sediment transport. As the dominant hydrodynamics change throughout the year, the sediment fluxes change with them. Beyond the hydrodynamics within the lagoon, the adjacent coast is under the influence of a swell wave climate. As the waves mainly come from the east-northeast at a height of 1 m, a moderate southward longshore transport is initiated year-round. The Delft3D model is used to analyse the hydrodynamics and sediment transport of the area in more detail. The model is used to analyse the flow magnitudes and directions. This approach allows the dominant hydrodynamic components to be identified. The most relevant hydrodynamic components are considered in the Delft3D model. These include tide, river discharge, waves, and wind. The 2D mode is sufficient to model these hydraulic components. Because of the hydrodynamic climate changes that occur throughout the year due to changes in the meteorological climate, the simulation period is one representative year. The model is calibrated and validated by means of phenomenological calibration and expert judgement, as field data is scarce.","Delft3D; Morphodynamics; Tidal basin; Morphodynamic modeling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-09-29","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering | Coastal Engineering","",""

However, hydrogen is known to have adverse affects on the properties of steels. Hydrogen will dissolve in the steel matrix and contribute to a reduction of mechanical properties, causing Hydrogen Embrittlement (HE). There is currently a knowledge gap about the behaviour of pipeline steels and their welds in a gaseous hydrogen environment that prevents re-purposing of pipelines for hydrogen transport. In this work, a combined approach of modelling and in-situ mechanical testing was used to assess the HE susceptibility of X60 pipeline steel and its girth welds. To this end, a novel tensile setup featuring in-situ charging with high pressure H2 gas and a sample geometry representing miniature pipelines was developed and validated. To our best knowledge, this setup design has not been reported elsewhere, making this a breakthrough design. An FEA modelling approach was used to estimate the pre-charging duration as well as to gain an insight into the stress states inside the notched samples. It was found that both the base and weld metals lose ductility when subjected to gaseous H2. The base metal showed 27% loss of ductility when subjected to 100 bar H2, which further increased to 40% in notched samples. A trend of increasing loss of ductility was found with increasing pressure for the weld metal, which showed up to 14% loss of ductility at 100 bar H2. The weld metal also retained more of its reduction in cross-sectional area after fracture in H2 as compared to N2 than the base metal. Other characteristics like yield strength and UTS were not affected by the hydrogen gas. The fracture mechanism in the both metals was found to change from microvoid coalescence (MVC) fracture to quasi-cleavage (QC) fracture. The base metal fracture mechanism changed to QC completely, while the weld metal only showed partial QC fracture. In the base metal, ductile fracture mechanisms like HELP and possibly AIDE were found to be dominant even in the QC fracture mode. It was concluded that the weld metal is less susceptible to HE than the base metal in a gaseous hydrogen environment. For both metals, HE effects were only observed at high amounts of plastic strain, which is outside of the operating conditions of a pipeline. However, before pipelines can be repurposed for hydrogen transport, fatigue testing should be performed to assess the influence of existing defects and cyclic loading conditions on the HE performance of both steels.","Hydrogen embrittlement; Pipeline steel; In-situ testing; Fractography","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-09-29","","","","","",""

Fuel cells have demonstrated to substantially contribute to the greening of energy conversion technologies. Specifically, Solid Oxide Fuel Cells have proven to be a reliable technology to produce energy from Liquid Natural Gas (LNG). However, the limited understanding of the effect of the components around the stack (also known as Balance of Plant, BoP) in SOFC power generation system represents one of the reasons of the slow development of this technology. The main objective of this research is to gain insight in the performance of the BoP components and their influence on the SOFC power generation system for maritime applications. A dynamic model describing a complete SOFC power generation system is developed in this work. The chosen system configuration consists of three blowers, two heat exchangers, a mixer, an external pre-reformer, an SOFC stack and an afterburner. Specifically, each BoP component is modelled dynamically using a 0-D approach and verified individually by using the software Cycle-Tempo. Then, the BoP models are integrated with an existing 1-D SOFC stack model. A dedicated control system is implemented and the load following capabilities of the complete system are studied. The model developed is able to simulate the time variation of all the BoP component characteristics and provides insights in the system efficiency when varying operating parameters such as stack current, anode recirculating ratio and fuel utilization. In particular, it is proven that working at low current enables higher cell voltage and, thus, higher system and stack efficiency. System fuel utilization significantly contributes to the system efficiency, which reaches the highest value for the highest fuel utilization. Additionally, the effect of the fuel utilization rate on the stack and system is the highest at lower currents. System and stack efficiency of respectively 58 % and 66 % are possible with the chosen system configuration. Anode recirculating contributes more to the system efficiency than the stack efficiency. The highest system efficiency is obtained for low current values and high recirculating ratio. Moreover, significant CO2 emission reduction is obtained for high recirculating ratio. The chosen control strategy succeeds on ensuring thermal safe operation, but does not guarantee fast response to load changes. In particular, a system response within 2 hours is achieved with the controller developed when the stack current is changed from 27 A to 23 A . Moreover, a load ramp of the stack current is a better choice in terms of thermal safe operation than a stepped change. The developed model represents a solid base for future development and research in the modelling of SOFC power generation systems for maritime applications. Nevertheless, future investigations on model validation, control system, start-up operations and system optimization are recommended.","Fuel Cell; SOFC; Dynamic modelling; Balance of Plant; Power generation system; System integration","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-09-29","","","","Marine Technology | Ship Design, Production and Operations","",""

Common sources of errors in the measurements are identified following field visits and discussions with farmers. Two filters for identifying and removing faulty zeros and suspiciously high precipitation amounts based on the measurements of neighbour stations are proposed. These filters successfully distinguish extreme rainfall events from outliers and show that within 13.5km radius, 90% of zeros corresponds to a median of 0mm/day. However, all these results are strongly affected by the number of neighbour<br/>stations. The high density crowdsourced precipitation data are also compared against the lower resolution Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station data (CHIRPS) data set. Results show that although the range and the average over the whole period are almost equal for both data sets, there can be large temporal and spatial mismatches for the zero rainfall values and the extremes. Moreover, the inter-stations rainfall variability for the crowdsourced data is 4 times smaller than the stations-CHIRPS variability. The agreement between the 0-day the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts<br/>(ECMWF) forecast and the CHIRPS was higher than between CHIRPS and the crowdsourced rainfall data. This could be explained by the fact that both the CHIRPS dataset and the ECMWF model make use of the same satellite radiation data, making them more likely to be correlated with each other. The crowdsourced precipitation observations are used to verify ECMWF forecasts<br/>delivered to farmers in Burundi by WeatherImpact. Results show that only the 0 and 1 day lead time forecasts of ECMWF are more skillful than the climatology-based forecasts and that the skill of the forecast is comparable to what is observed in the tropics.

Where single models may no longer be able to grasp the complexities of a system, multi-modelling (Nikolic, Warnier, et al., 2019; Vangheluwe, 2000) enables the combination of the strengths of different models whilst enabling the development of multi-perspective insights. In this research, I developed a multi-model to provide policymakers in The Netherlands with insights on how to steer the Urban Energy Transition at both national and municipal level. This is done by combining a System Dynamics (Forrester, 1961) model for evaluating market behaviour at the national scale, and an Agent-Based Model (Epstein &amp; Axtell, 1996) for investigating investment behaviour at the neighbourhood level. The results from experiments with this model show that multi-perspective insights can be very helpful in designing policies and strategies for dealing with Sustainable Urban Development. It is found that challenges concerning the conceptualisation phase of the Model Development Cycle, could turn out to be opportunities for model development. As formalism selection and possible overlapping scales between models requires extra effort and attention, this attention results in model concepts that will be better evaluated, resulting in better concepts to be developed altogether. The main challenge that is currently unresolved, is that of the computational performance of multi-models. Although worsened by the choice for Agent-Based Modelling as one of the formalisms used in the multi-model, the computational requirements for the simulation seriously hamper the opportunities for experimentation and analysis. Although solutions can be found to minimise the computational demand or the effects of it, improvements are required in either computational demand or processing supply, for multi-models to become a suitable method for common modelling and simulation practice. CME: Energy Transition in the Built Environment With the EU goals (European Commission, 2018b) to reduce CO2 emissions to zero tons in 2050, The Netherlands has set up a climate agreement (Klimaatakkoord, 2019) in which municipalities get a leading role in reducing the carbon footprint of the Built Environment. To realise these goals, an energy transition is inevitable and strategies need to be developed for remodelling neighbourhoods into sustainable living environments. Before the end of 2021, municipalities have to come up with a plan in which they decide what neighbourhoods will be transformed and when. A problem in this is that currently, municipalities do not have the resources and tools to do so (RTL, 2019; Schuttenhelm, 2020; Straver, 2019). Currently, existing models, such as the Vesta MAIS model (Planbureau voor de Leefomgeving, 2019c) offered by the national government, are missing two crucial aspects which should help municipalities to set up their strategies: time dynamics and population dynamics. The techno-economic approach does present the ’best’ solution but is missing how to get there. Next to this, uncertainty around national policies makes that it is very difficult to decide on a robust policy. To deal with the aforementioned challenges, I use a multi-modelling approach (Nikolic, Warnier, et al., 2019; Vangheluwe, 2000), using System Dynamics (Forrester, 1961) and Agent-Based modelling (Epstein &amp; Axtell, 1996) in which on the one hand, the time dynamics and population dynamics aspects are incorporated, and on the other hand multi-perspective insights on effects of national policies on national goals as well as insights on the heterogeneous effects at the municipal level are provided. An important finding is the crucial role of a CO2 tax on the realisation of national goals. Without this tax, homeowners and housing corporations will not be motivated sufficiently to significantly invest in insulation measures, making that fewer alternative heating systems will be implemented. Next to this, it is found that major differences can be distinguished between rural and urban areas. Heating grids will be a viable starting point for urban municipalities to start their transition due to the availability of residual heat. For rural municipalities, this will be more difficult due to a dependency on low-temperature systems. There, starting with the neighbourhoods that have the most potential to insulate is advised.","System Dynamics; Agent-Based Modeling; Energy Transition; Built Environment; Sustainable Urban Development; Multi-Modelling","en","master thesis","","","","","","This submission is part of a double degree in Engineering and Policy Analysis and Construction Management and Engineering.","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

With the progress in decarbonizing the electricity sector, the importance of decarbonizing other energy sectors, like heat and transport, increased. Sector coupling is introduced as a new energy paradigm in order to curb climate change and overcome its vagaries. Modernized energy networks are considered as highly complex systems and as a result, modelling and simulation of energy systems has become invaluable and fundamental for their development and implementation. A simulation model is often a replication of a real life system, therefore a model is abstract by nature. Implementing a model then using it without validation may cast wrongful solutions due to improper assumptions.

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","Minimum-time optimisation has been used extensively in motorsports, such as Formula One racing. Using minimum-time optimisation, the ideal racing line as well as control strategies such as braking strategies can be found. This is interesting, as Reijne et al have shown that cyclists apply diverse strategies, specifically during a descent [1]. With minimum-time optimisation, it is possible to compare a riders performance to the theoretically optimal performance. The results from such optimisations can be used to help with training, as well as improve and test equipment design.<br/><br/>This work describes a free-trajectory steady motion control optimisation for the descent of elite cyclists. The prediction of the individual descent performance was formulated as an optimal control problem and solved with a direct approach to finding optimal cornering and braking strategies that yield the shortest descent time. While the state equations were kept simple (3 variables only), more elaborated performance limits were represented by g-g diagrams. Such diagrams represent the longitudinal, lateral, and combined acceleration limits for cyclists. A method to numerically derive g-g diagrams for cyclists driving on 3D tracks was designed. In this method, a tire model, power limit, and steady motion equations for a cyclist are used to determine the control space. The bicycle and cyclist are modeled as a single rigid body, the tire friction model is simplified as a friction circle, and the wind speed is considered to be zero at all times. As for the 3D road geometry effects, all possible effects are considered in the method, except lateral road curvature. The resulting method<br/>provides g-g diagrams as a function of 8 local geometry and state variables.<br/><br/>The optimisation model was tested against the velocity and trajectory output data measured on Team Sunweb professional cyclists at the L218 descent in Germany. The resulting trajectory was similar to the trajectory ridden by elite cyclists. The velocity profile showed large differences, which are a result of a combination of inaccurate track data, differences in friction coefficient estimation, and safety margins applied by the cyclists. The results show that descent performance can be improved, as even when adhering to safety margins harder braking is possible. Overall, the model responds as expected to changes in track, environment, and bicycle/rider parameters.<br/><br/>Steps can be made towards better implementation of the g-g diagrams in the minimum-time optimisation. Furthermore, a more accurate tire model and power model can improve the model and extend its applications. The presented model can be used for qualitative descent analyses, and facilitate the training of elite cyclists.<br/><br/>[1] A.L. Schwab, M.M. Reijne, D.J.J.

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","In recent times, composite materials are widely applied in the construction industry because of their superior properties compared to traditional materials like steel and concrete. The use of composite materials in defense and infrastructure protective applications to resist high rate dynamic loading conditions has been gaining the interest of a lot of researchers over the previous decade. The limitations involved in studying the behavior of composites when subjected to high rate dynamic loads experimentally generated a need for numerical models that could simulate such complex material behavior. These numerical models are also highly useful in situations where it is difficult to perform direct measurements in experiments. The idea of this thesis originated from an aim to study the behavior of a TNO developed composite laminate with alternate 0-degree and 90-degree ply layup when subjected to out of plane blast loads. Considering the complexities involved in such a loading situation, a simplified test setup that can approximately replicate stress conditions in the composite laminate due to out of plane blast load has been proposed to be designed. This simplified test setup is prepared by performing an angled cut from the composite laminate, thus making the plies off-axis with respect to the global coordinate system of its cross-section. The motivation behind choosing such a test setup is that the interface/s can be loaded by a combination of compressive and shear stresses with axial loading on the specimen. The behavior of the simplified test setup with off-axis angles 30-degree, 45-degree, and 60-degree, when subjected to dynamic compression loads with different rates ranging from quasi-static to high is analyzed in this thesis using the finite element method. The initial parts of the study focus on analyzing the quasi-static failure behavior of the off-axis angled composite specimens with a single critical interface at the center modelled using the rate-independent cohesive law coupled with friction. The later parts of the study focus on analyzing the dynamic failure behavior of the composite specimens. The rate-independent cohesive law with friction is improved by adding a rate-dependency feature based on a Johnson-Cook law. Finally, the dynamic behavior of different off-axis angled composite specimens with critical interface/s modelled using the rate-independent and the rate-dependent cohesive laws with friction when subjected to compression loads with different rates is analyzed. The results obtained from the quasi-static analyses indicate that an increase in the mode-II cohesive strength, mode-II cohesive fracture energy, and interface friction coefficient lead to an increase in the peak load carried by the laminates. An increase in the thickness of the plies of an off-axis angled composite specimen results in a decrease in its peak load and changes its governing failure mechanism. There will be a dominant contribution of local inertia and wave propagation effects in dictating the failure behaviors of the specimens when subjected to compression loads with higher rates. The rate-dependent cohesive law with friction developed in this thesis seemingly captured the rate effects in the off-axis angled composite specimens when loaded in compression at different rates. Finally, it is suggested to design the simplified test setup by performing a 45-degree cut from the original composite laminate to simulate delamination due to compression loads of different rates effectively. But all three simplified setups have to be tested to derive the unique set of interface parameters that dictate the failure behaviors of the specimens.","Off-axis laminates; Failure behaviour; Dynamics; Compression; FEM; Cohesive Zone Modeling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To stay competitive, New Service Development became an important concern for many companies to achieve. Company Z, which is one of the largest product-oriented corporations around the globe, continuously improved its New Product Development processes to successfully launch technology-driven product innovations. Aware of the current importance of service offerings, Company Z has integrated New Service Development into their processes but still faces challenges while developing their service offerings. A key role in developing and launching services plays the recently established New Services Design team of the service development and delivery function. <br/>The aim of this project was to identify the pitfalls of the current New Service Development process of the New Services Design team of company Z and identify opportunities for overcoming them to create an improved process framework that fits the flexibility required for services. The development and delivery stages of the New Service development process of company Z were reviewed and literature was researched about Services and New Service Development. It was found that New Service Development in order to be successful require, compared to NPD, a different mindset, high customer involvement and flexibility. However, product-oriented companies tend to keep their old New Product Development approaches for certainty reasons and the rather less researched field of modern New Service Development.<br/>Comparably, internal company research revealed that Company Z develops and delivers its service offerings with a product-oriented stage-gate process that originates from the company‘s product mindset. Based on the literature and qualitative research it was identified that this product-logic causes a highly fragmented and overstretched process that causes excessive amounts of bureaucracy, a strong focus on documentation, low customer involvement, and uncollaborative teams. In order to address any of these issues in the long term, the product-logic, which is the start point of the Causal Chain, needs to be replaced by a service-logic. To find a solution, in this rather academically unexplored research area, a Delphi study with several experts was conducted. Based on the Delphi study and literature it was discovered that an incremental change towards a service-logic can be fostered by establishing a high level of customer-centricity within the current New Service Development process. A solution was created that enables customer involvement within the New Service Development process of Company Z via early service prototyping to foster a service-oriented way of working. Finally, a Roadmap describes the implementation of the service prototyping approach in three horizons.","Servitization; New service Development; new product development; healthcare; Process design; Process model; service prototyping; service design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

The influx of new people brings new challenges for cities and municipalities to provide for a suitable environment for new and existing citizens whilst preventing adverse effects to occur. Current literature describes the dynamics of the city using effects such as segregation, gentrification and urban decay. However, the changing character of urban areas is not linked with the decision-making behavior of citizens in current literature. Furthermore, the dynamics of urban areas are rarely observed from a meso-scale perspective. This research aims to describe the relation between migration patterns and changes to the fabric of the city. A conceptual model on the dynamics involved in observing decision-making of citizens and observing changes to the city fabric is made. Using real-world data of the city of The Hague in The Netherlands, a Data-Driven Agent-Based model is made in Netlogo. Data analysis on the outcomes of the model using Python provide a better understanding of the impact of migration on the changes to the city fabric. The model output describes the impact on the city caused by the influx of migrants. More migrants entering the city can drastically increase homelessness or the ""pushing out"" of citizen groups because of housing shortages. This is most prevalent for the poorest citizens, since social rent housing is first to become scarce when more people enter the city. An increase in income inequality or a decrease in average migrant income results in even more pronounced housing shortages. The model simulates 6 policy interventions for the municipality of The Hague. The model shows that all policies that increase housing options significantly increases well-being of citizens. However, the policies that try to improve safety and health do not show an increase in well-being of citizens. By means of historical validation the model is tested for validity. The model is able to describe much of the decision-making behavior of migrants and citizens. However, for certain ethnicities, the model is currently unable to describe the decision-making process in such a way that it can represent the observed real-world moving patterns. A framework has been presented that can be used to better explain the impact of migration on cities. Furthermore, the conceptual model can be applied to different aspects of city dynamics, for instance the transport or energy sector. The ABM shows that current housing options and expected influx of migrants become problematic within the coming 10 years. An indication of the usefulness of proposed policy interventions is presented. More research and surveys are needed to better understand these mechanics and their relation to changes to the fabric of the city. Additional research into the changes to the neighborhood amenities and businesses as a result of changes in citizen composition can aid policy making and understanding the developments of the ever-changing city landscape.","Agent-Based Modeling; Migration; Decision-making; urban fabric; Conceptual model","en","master thesis","","","","","","GitHub page of project files and data sources: https://github.com/Jochem285/OpenDataDenHaag","","","","","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","","52.5,4.18"

Fuel cells and batteries are identified as relatively new technologies for shipping with high potential and hydrogen is also considered as one of the most promising sustainable fuels, especially for smaller vessels. This research contributes to three identified knowledge gaps: (1) the potential of hydrogen propulsion for high-speed craft, (2) the hybridisation of fuel cells and batteries for marine applications and (3) the characteristics of the response of a hybrid fuel cell/battery propulsion system under transient loads. The objective of this research is to analyse these aspects based on a series of time domain simulations of various operational conditions. <br/>A mathematical model of a fuel cell/battery propulsion system is developed in Matlab/Simulink. The developed model is used to analyse the energy consumption for various operational conditions of a test vessel. Based on this analysis, two configurations of fuel cell power and battery energy are selected. If the vessel sails at top speed, the fuel cell power stacks operate at maximum power and the battery operates as power booster. A strong correlation was found between the endurance at top speed and the battery size which is selected. A larger battery has a positive effect on endurance, but it also increases the displacement of the vessel significantly and, hence, required power.<br/>Fuel cells are least responsive and these should be protected against high fluctuations in a short time. A fuel cell can only follow low-frequency transient loads. The battery is required to support in high-frequency load changes. Contrary to the fuel cell, both the battery and PMSM were found to have very favourable characteristics in transient conditions. <br/>Finally, it is concluded that it is feasible to implement fuel cell/battery propulsion on high-speed craft. It is proposed that the fuel cell and hydrogen deliver the majority of the energy and use the battery as power booster and for transient support. Novel energy management strategies can deliver high system efficiencies in both full and part load and this is one of the main advantages of hybridisation. <br/>The implementation of a fuel cell/battery system does, however, come at significant costs in terms of endurance and top speed due to the low volumetric energy density of hydrogen. It should be acknowledged that the functionality of the vessel is reduced. In addition to this, the storage of hydrogen requires some deck space, so the cargo capacity in terms of crew and material is also reduced. Therefore, it is recommended to redefine the user profile of the vessel.<br","Fuel Cell; Hydrogen; Battery; high speed craft; zero emission fuels","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Marine Technology | Ship Design, Production and Operations","",""

However, it would not only make the diesel engine run in off-design condition, but its dynamic behavior due to time-varying wind and waves is still unknown. Hence, for a selected case used in this thesis, a Flettner rotor is chosen to be further evaluated on the system’s dynamic behavior under its favorable wind angle at Beaufort scale 6 and 7. <br/><br/>After modeling the wind-assisted ship propulsion system, it was linearized and normalized around its static operating point. This gives more insight into the system from a frequency-domain analysis via the Bode magnitude plots of engine speed, engine torque, and ship speed to the variation of true wind speed and wakefield induced by wave amplitude disturbance. In addition to the time-domain simulation for understanding the impact of the wind and wake disturbance on the system, the system response spectrum, which was proposed as an alternative approach for analyzing the system’s dynamic behavior, was derived by connecting wind and a derived wake spectrum to the Bode magnitude plots. Therefore, how the energy is conveyed from the marine environment to the system around its equilibrium can be tracked clearly.<br/><br/>Consequently, according to the selected case with a given controller, the results show that the fluctuation of true wind speed directly influences the ship speed, which in turn makes the engine torque be more sensitive to the variation of true wind speed in low-frequency regions. Besides, the engine speed resists to the variation of true wind speed very well due to the controller’s introduction. Although the Flettner rotor generates approximately 44% of thrust at Beaufort scale 7, the true wind speed disturbance does not result in a significant engine loading disturbance compared with the fluctuation of wakefield, which significantly influences the engine speed and torque. It was found that it is related to the frequency region where the wake spectrum overlaps with the system sensitivity function. Within this region, the controller has a relatively poor performance, and thus an engine operating cloud can be noticed in time-domain simulation. However, the ship speed is not influenced significantly by the wakefield disturbance because the frequency region of wake spectrum does not overlap with that of the transfer function where the ship speed is more sensitive to the variation of wakefield. Finally, the sensitivity study implies that a further increase of ship total mass and moment of inertia enlarge the engine speed and torque in the frequency region where the controller does not perform well. <br/><br/>In conclusion, based on the selected case under its favorable wind condition, the potential of the wind-assisted ship propulsion system is still promising. Furthermore, the linearised model is a useful additional tool, and the system response spectrum gives more insight into the system. <br","Wind assisted ship propulsion; Ship Propulsion; Flettner rotor","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-09-22","","","","Marine Technology | Ship Design, Production and Operations","",""

It has a worldwide incidence rate of approximately 0.01-0.04 %. Prompt treatment with anti-inflammatory and antiviral drugs can stimulate clinical recovery, but despite treatment, in two out of ten patients the recovery is incomplete and severe, and persistent facial paralysis occurs in 12 % of patients.<br/>In some cases, early and accurate diagnosis is a difficult task even for experienced clinicians. Currently, the only way to differentiate between facial palsy types is by clinical observation. This neurological examination however is subjective and lacks accuracy, which may result in a delayed diagnosis and adequate treatment, and related poor recovery. The current diagnostics can be improved by developing a method that is more sensitive to detect reduced facial movements and can better discriminate between palsy types. The goal of this study is to create a new technological system based on quantification of<br/>facial movements and artificial intelligence. This would have considerable relevance, both clinical and in the setting of research. With this system diagnosis will be guided in primary as well as secondary health care in order to distinguish Bell’s (peripheral) palsy, a relatively benign cause of facial paralysis, from a stroke (central palsy), which is a potentially lethal disease. To reach this ambitious goal, the system will need to be able to analyze visual data in two sequential steps to answer the following questions:<br/><br/>Step 1: Normal face or abnormal face?<br/> Step 2: Central facial palsy or peripheral facial palsy?<br/> Our system uses existing facial recognition software to identify key facial features. Using these features, some quantified measures are then defined which help us to distinguish a normal froman abnormal face and a central from a peripheral facial palsy. These measures were selected so that the best accuracy in each particular step is achieved, given some restrictions that apply in each case. The pictures that were used include healthy people with facial symmetry, patients with Bell’s palsy and patients who suffered from a stroke both of which have facial asymmetry. At the end, by manually selecting a few thresholds for our measures, and given that the landmarks are manually detected, an accuracy of 99.51 % is achieved for step 1 (99.65 % F1 score) and a 90.91 % for step 2 (93.26 % F1 score).","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-11-01","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

Current practices of waste management are not efficient as they lead to a release of emissions and a loss of value that is present in the resource, which is discarded as waste. New legislation for efficient waste management practices has been established, however, adopting them is hampered by factors, one of which is the high cost of these solutions. However, incentive-based approaches can be used to address this problem. This research explores the role of institutional incentives in the form of property rights bundles for such cases. Property rights are a set of formal and informal rules that define how resource allocation is done, while property rights bundles are the set of one or more property rights tied together. As per academic literature, a clear allocation of property rights leads to an economically efficient distribution of costs, benefits, risks and responsibilities associated with a resource. Based on these aspects, this research explores the influence of property rights bundles in the case of collective ownership of waste processing infrastructure by companies. Through collective ownership of the infrastructure, the investment cost would be distributed among those using the resource, thereby reducing the share of investment per company and addressing the challenge of high investment costs. Furthermore, in this situation of collective ownership, property rights need to be defined clearly so that there are no conflicts among the participants at later stages. The research is based on a case study of a few companies in Amsterdam, who are attempting to set up an initiative to improve the waste management practice in the region. For this purpose, they plan to invest collectively in a waste-processing infrastructure. This research thus explores the role of property rights in this regard. The literature on property rights forms the theoretical foundation of the research, along with the Theory of Planned Behaviour, which is the behavioural theory chosen to analyse the decision-making of the companies. The case study was analysed using the Institutional Analysis and Development framework. An agent-based model was built based on the insights obtained from these concepts to capture the interaction between the property rights and the characteristics of the companies, such as the amount of waste generated by them, the amount of budget they hold, etc. The influence of property rights bundles was analysed using the attributes of property rights: robustness, strength, duration and excludability. The results obtained were analysed using the defined Key Performance Indicators: Joining Ratio, Number of Participants and Number of times the initiative is started. It was found that for the case of the Amsterdam Zuidoost initiative, providing property rights bundles of claimants and proprietors as incentives leads to an increase in the number of participants that join the initiative. However, due to lack of statistical significance between the distributions, we cannot determine which of the two has a higher influence. Furthermore, the influence of the other property rights bundle could not be verified due to lack of statistical significance in the distribution. From the perspective of general results, it was concluded that maximum participants join when incentive 3 (property rights bundle of Proprietors) is provided, followed by when all incentives (all property rights bundles in an increasing order) are provided, and finally when property rights bundle of Claimants is provided. The influence of property rights bundle of Authorised Users could not be verified. However, the influence of property rights bundles for the selected model and agent parameters is unknown, and more research is required to determine this relationship. One of the foremost recommendations comes from the model outcomes that more research is required to explore the influence of property rights bundles with respect to the model parameters considered. This research does not take into account the property rights bundle of owners and it is recommended that future research includes this bundle to understand the influence of this bundle from a quantitative perspective. Furthermore, as property rights have not been studied from a quantitative perspective before, alternative approaches could be used to obtain more insights of this concept.","property rights; organic waste; Agent-based model; IAD framework; Theory of planned behaviour","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","The concept of coproduction has been explored in combined heat and power applications. It is a method of improving the efficiency of the energy generating system by utilising waste heat. In the coming years hydrogen is expected to play an important role in decarbonization as it does not emit greenhouse gas at the point of application. Hydrogen today is primarily generated from fossil fuels and the processes of producing hydrogen are energy intensive, while also emitting large quantities of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. As the amount of hydrogen generated today is limited, it has restricted the growth of industries such as the automobile industries producing fuel cell vehicles that are to use hydrogen as fuel. In this thesis report a coproduction concept using high temperature molten carbonate fuel cell has been examined. The molten carbonate fuel cells operate at very high temperature, and it is possible to utilise the waste heat for internal reforming reaction of a fuel such as natural gas to liberate hydrogen required by the fuel cell. Excess hydrogen can also be produced from such fuel cell systems when the fuel utilisation in the fuel cell is reduced. This concept has been studied with solid oxide fuel cells and a paper published in 2008 by Hemmes et al. titled ""Flexible Coproduction of Hydrogen and Power Using Internal Reforming Solid Oxide Fuel Cells System"" has served as the inspiration for this thesis report. Three modes of operations have been simulated in this thesis on the Cycle-Tempo software with varying fuel utilisations, similar to what has been shown with the solid oxide fuel cells in that paper. With molten carbonate fuel cells, overall efficiency of up to 80% was obtained in terms of electricity and hydrogen coproduction. By doing so it is also possible to produce overall power output of nearly three times than what can be achieved by conventional electricity production. The results obtained have also been compared with the solid oxide fuel cells in this report. While high coproduction efficiencies for flexibly coproducing hydrogen and power have been shown to be possible, other factors would also play important roles in the success of this technology. In this report some of those factors such as the status and expected growth of the hydrogen market, molten carbonate fuel cell market, role of actors, role of policy makers have also been examined. As this technology does rely on a fossil fuel that is natural gas, the benefits of using natural gas in hydrogen production has also been highlighted along with the positive effects these systems could have on the society.","Coproduction; Molten Carbonate Fuel Cells; Fuel Cell; Cogeneration; Trigeneration; Hydrogen production; Superwind","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The most predominant of these characteristics is the high uncertainty that Strategic Designers deal with; no clear goals, or means of achieving them.<br/>This is most applicable to the fuzzy front end; the earliest stage of an innovation project, where nothing is clear or known, questions are open ended, and results are not predetermined.<br/>In order to measure performance in highly uncertain projects, process-based metrics were identified as the most suitable option; metrics based on the process, but not limited to only productivity.<br/><br/>A concept was designed for a KPI for Strategic Design performance, based on the findings of a qualitative study. The KPI can be mostly integrated into a normal Strategic Design process.

A car restricted area in this study is distinguished as a visually car-free area, in which access to vehicles is restricted and car parking is either provided in-building, underground or at the edge of the neighbourhood, but there is no attempt to restrict car use or ownership. The preferences regarding seven variables affecting car restricted residential choice were studied: (1) walking time to the car, (2) type of car parking facility, (3) monthly parking costs, (4) type of building, (5) liveliness level, (6) amount of facilities, and (7) the degree of green areas. A stated preference (SP) survey was used to determine which characteristics affect this preference, and to what extent. The results indicate that only a few car owners are willing to move to a car restricted residential area over a conventional residential area. Overall, the walking time to car parking significantly harms to the willingness to move to a car restricted residential area, while the physical environment of a car restricted residential seems to be of less importance. This implies that the physical environment is only to a limitate extent able to compensate for distant car parking in these residential areas. However, future research may increase the understanding into car owners’ willingness to move to a car restricted residential area by scrutinising people’s underlying association towards car restricted residential areas.","Car restricted residential areas; Parking arrangements; Physical environment; Willingness to move; Stated preference","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There are many causes that can lead to back pain, but intervertebral disc (IVD) degeneration is a recognised cause. The harmful effect of whole-body vibration (WBV) environment on the human intervertebral disc has been demonstrated to have an increased relative risk of failure. One of the treatments for a degenerative disc is spinal fusion procedure, in which the human IVD is replaced by a spinal fusion cage. In this thesis, the influence of WBV on custom-made spinal fusion cages was investigated.<br/>With the advent of additive manufacturing lattice-based scaffolds were designed as spinal fusion implants and manufactured using a Polyet 3D-printer. The influence of the unit cell design on the build quality and the quasi-static mechanical properties as well as the dynamic WBV reaction was observed. Therefore, four different unit cell types were designed: body-centered cube (BC-cube), face-centered cube (FX-cube), truncated octahedron (T-octa) and negative Poisson cube (NP-cube). The influence of 3D-printing direction and scaffold porosity on print quality and mechanical properties were also investigated. <br/>The build quality was determined by measuring the nominal size, determining the beam diameter and using μCT. The quasi-static mechanical properties were determined with the compression test. The dynamic response to WBV was determined with a mechanical test setup that imitates a base excitation model. Two cylindrical bases were printed as one sample together with the scaffold. The bases were embedded and mounted in the testing cups. A constant sinusoidal displacement to the lower embedding cup was applied and the accelerations of the input and response were measured. The difference between the response and input was compared and observed at which frequency the sample broke or reached the highest gain. This was done for all samples and the influence of unit cell type, 3D-printing direction and porosity on the dynamic response was observed.<br/>The direction of 3D-printing had the greatest influence on the build quality, while the type of unit cell and porosity had a less obvious influence.<br/>The compression test provided insight into which unit cell types have a higher elastic modulus, that the 3D-printing direction perpendicular to the test direction achieved higher E values, and that higher porosity, which is desirable for implants, resulted in a lower Young's modulus.<br/>In terms of the dynamic response, the results of this work indicate that the FX cube design is the most robust and would improve the safety of the implant when exposed to WBV.<br/>For the 3D-printing direction, it may be concluded that the perpendicular direction, i.e. the layers are perpendicular to the test direction, can best withstand the dynamic forces. The increase in porosity from 50% to 70% showed a decrease in resistance to the dynamic loading, with scaffolds failing more often and at lower frequencies. Understanding how different designs and porosity of the spinal fusion scaffolds influence the resistance to WBV conditions will help to develop safe and resistant implants which replace degenerated natural IVD.<br","Spinal cage; whole body vibration; Implants; spinal fusion; 3D printing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Biomedical Engineering | Biomaterials and Tissue Biomechanics","",""

The individual characteristics and behaviours of each involved actor and their interactions define the resulting overall emergent system behaviour. Due to increased complexities in socio-technical systems traditional safety risk assessment strategies are found to become less suitable to predict, to reveal and to understand emergent system behaviour. In recent years there has therefore been a shift in the way how safety in complex socio-technical systems is perceived. The relatively new safety management paradigm called resilience engineering focusses on the ability of socio-technical systems to cope with varying conditions by applying everyday performance. Recent studies related to resilience engineering insist on the need for more structured modelling approaches for analysis and quantification of resilience in socio-technical systems. This study contributes to this need by presenting a quantitative agent-based modelling and simulation approach. The suitability of such approach for more profound analysis and quantification of resilience in socio-technical systems has been studied in the context of conventional approach operations during a sudden and unexpected bad weather disturbance. The formal agent-based model that has been developed for this resilience study especially emphasized the role of executive controllers in achieving and maintaining resilience. The adaptive strategies that are considered for this purpose are multiple vectoring strategies, the initiation of holding operations and go-arounds. The resilient capacities of conventional approach operations have been quantified using the emergent outcomes of these adaptive strategies. Considering the obtained simulation results and gained insight there can be concluded that quantitative agent-based modelling and simulation is a suitable, structured and powerful approach for more profound analysis and quantification of resilience in socio-technical systems.","Agent-Based Modelling and Simulation; Resilience; Resilience Engineering; Air Traffic Management; AnyLogic; Quantification; Complex socio-technical systems","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

This holding stack is formed above the Initial Approach Fix (IAF). Current industry standard is able to achieve an accuracy within two minutes of planned Estimated Approach Time (EAT), at which the aircraft is planned to fly over the IAF and proceed to the TMA. In this research a display tool to aid Area Controllers (ACC) in realising a more accurate delivery and improving their situational awareness is designed, called the Stack Planner (SP). The SP assists controllers with choosing an optimal holding leg time for aircraft in the holding stack to adjust their IAF flyover time. The display aims to assist ATCo by showing the possible space of their control actions as well as system constraints. In an initial proof-of-concept experiment, comparing the SP display with a baseline state of the art display, promising results are found; the SP display shows a more manageable workload with increased situational awareness that scales with scenario complexity. The new display also shows the potential to move from minute accuracy to second accuracy. Future studies would need to investigate the extent to which scenario complexity plays a role in accuracy of delivery for both baseline and SP displays.","Air Traffic Control; Display Tool; Holding procedure; Holding stack; Area control; Human Machine Interaction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

However, the gap in the understanding of the closed-loop driver-vehicle interaction often leads to reduced user acceptance. In this research, an optimal torque control law is calculated online in the Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework to guarantee continuous guidance during the steering task. The novelty lies in the integration of an extensive driver-in-the-loop model within the MPC-based haptic controller to enhance collaboration. The driver model is composed of a preview cognitive strategy based on a Linear-Quadratic-Gaussian, sensory organs, and neuromuscular dynamics, including muscle co-activation and reflex action. Moreover, an adaptive cost-function algorithm enables dynamic allocation of the control authority. Experimental data was gathered from 19 participants in a fixed-base driving simulator at Toyota Motor Europe, evaluating an MPC controller with two different cost functions against a commercial Lane Keeping Assist (LKA) system as an industry benchmark. The results demonstrate that the proposed controller fosters symbiotic driving and reduces driver-vehicle conflicts with respect to a state-of-the-art commercial system, both subjectively and objectively, while still improving path-tracking performance.

One of the promising materials to replace silicon based devices is graphene nano-ribbons (GNRs) due to its remarkable electronic properties. Theoretical models suggest that 30nm GNR structures can mimic the behaviour of basic Boolean logic gates such as inverter, buffer, or and nor gates while reducing 30x times the propagation delay and using 3000x less gate active area compared to the equivalent CMOS realization. The main goal of this thesis is to fabricate GNR devices that can be ultimately used as building blocks for Boolean logic gates, analyse the limitations of achieving sub-50nm patterns and study the edge termination of the formed GNR patterns. GNR patterns are explored using a simulation model, which can be used for complementary Boolean logic gates. The designed graphene patterns are simulated using tight binding model to calculate the electronic band structure and construct a Hamiltonian matrix. This is followed by calculation of the electronic states and Fermi energies. Non equilibrium Green function (NEGF) models the electrons and holes distribution trough the GNR pattern and the rate at which the charge carriers are transmitted from the source to the drain when they propagate through the device. The result from the NEGF function is used to calculate the charge density using 3D POISSON from which the current through the graphene surface is determined. Finally, with known gate voltages and current, the conductance is found for four different structures in 10 nm and 30 nm technology. By changing the way the structures are connected as pull-up and pull-down network, the behaviour of inverter, buffer, or, and nor gates are obtained. The patterns from the simulation model with 30 nm feature size are used to create a design for devices to be fabricated. In addition, the design includes devices with minimal dimensions from 50 nm to 200 nm, squares, hexagons and pentagons with different dimensions starting from 1 um up to 10 um. For this project, graphene grown by chemical vapour deposition (CVD) was transferred to silicon dioxide samples on which the design of the structures is fabricated. The fabrication process consist of five steps. First, the samples are spin coated with polymethyl-methacrylate (PMMA). Second, electron beam lithography (EBL) is used to pattern the structures, by exposing parts of the resist. Next, the exposed areas are developed in order to remove the resist with introduced damage from the exposure. This is followed by etching the exposed parts of the graphene using oxygen plasma or hydrogen plasma. Finally, the remaining resist is cleaned with acetone. Characterisation of the patterns is performed using Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). From the Raman measurements it was found that the edge termination is most likely random and defects are introduced to the lattice of the graphene patterns with left contaminants from the polymer. The achieved minimal feature size of the devices is 50 nm, which was confirmed using AFM and SEM. In addition to the morphological characterisation of the samples, electrical measurements are performed and from the transport characteristics, the electron and hole mobilities of mono layer graphene are derived.","GNRs; Logic gates; patterning; Characterisation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Embedded Systems","",""

The benefits of such driving are many-fold, primarily it increases the traffic throughput and also reduces fuel consumption as the result of minimized drag experienced by the vehicles. The state-of-the-art technologies to achieve platooning involve vehicle-to-vehicle communication for receiving all the events instantaneously. However, wireless channels being prone to communication losses pose risks to the platoon operation. Therefore, it is important to study how platoons operate under communication losses. Platoons being vehicular ad-hoc networks, the information dissemination is governed by Time Division Multiple Access policies known as Information Flow Topology (IFT). Platooning being sensitive to communication losses, during an emergency braking, the requirements are even more stringent as it could lead to rear-end collisions within the vehicles.<br/><br/>All the performance evaluation are done on a newly designed testbed which is both cost-effective and customizable. Several kinds of IFTs have been developed in recent years. We consider four of the predominant ones and evaluate their performance during emergency braking with temporary communication loss. Since the decrease in inter-vehicle distances is the main reason for vehicle collisions during platoon, we use it as a key performance indicator when evaluating the performance. To improve the reliability of communication in the platoon, we propose to adopt an existing methodology in wireless networking and combine it with the IFTs in platooning. We additionally show the improvement in the collision probability with this method.

The methodology and general guidelines for conducting an LCA on a Photovoltaic (PV) system are developed, within the scope of this thesis. The LCA follows a standard framework, proposed by International Organization for Standards (ISO) and International Energy Association (IEA). LCA is a technique used to understand the total environmental impact of all the processes involved in the manufacture of a particular product. It takes into account all production process stages, to check the highest impact involved in production. The results from this LCA study are obtained using the SimaPro software. These results quantify the production impact and aid in understanding where and how to improve the carbon footprint of associated production processes. The environmental impact categories from the ReCiPe 2016 assessment methods were used in this study. All the impact categories such as global warming potential, ozone depletion, photochemical ozone formation, etc. were taken into consideration. This includes all the mid point and end point categories offered by ReCiPe method. Additionally, the cumulative energy demand method was used to calculate the total renewable and non-renewable energies mix, used in the production process. Subsequently, using this information, impact categories such as energy payback time, net energy ratio and GHG emissions rate were obtained. This study is based on the data obtained from Ecoinvent LCA database, accessed through the SimaPro software. This data was then changed according to the inventory update published by IEA PVPS. PV cell data was obtained from literature. However, the remaining materials used in the X-Glass module’s manufacture were noted and their associated data was used to develop an appropriate LCA model. The model incroporated factors including transport, quantity, etc. The functional unit (FU) in this study is 1 m2 of X-Glass production. For better analysis, all the impacts caused by manufacturing 1 X-Glass module were used to compare the results. Results clearly show that the contribution of PV cells production to the environmental impact is high when mono-Si is used by the PV module. The energy requirements and geographical influence of these energy mixes that are involved in the PV cell manufacture are clearly explained. The cells for a typical X-Glass manufacture were modeled with a Chinese energy mix as the cells were produced in China. The energy payback time (EPBT) of X-Glass module installed in the Netherlands are 1.3 years with 73 g CO2/kWh GHG emission rate. The CO2 offset period was found be 3.9 years. These modules were then compared to a similar model developed for an European energy mix. The differences in results, due to the change in energy mix show that he energy payback time for manufacturing the same X-Glass module was found to be 1.3 years, with GHG emission rate of 32 g CO2 eq.

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","The overarching goal of Engineered Heart Tissues (EHTs) is to develop functional 3D heart tissues in vitro with the potential to find drug targets, identify drug toxicity and predict the effects of the drugs in the body. This 3D model of the cardiac tissue consists of a bunch of cells, self-assembled around specific anchoring points the main aim of which is to support tissue formation. Although this model is very promising, still has to overcome an important drawback which is the lack of maturation of iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (CM). This obstacle leads to limited recreation of the adult human cardiac tissue physiology. It has been shown that electrical stimulation of cardiac cells is one of the most important factors for cardiomyocyte’s maturation. Therefore, the principal goal of this thesis is to design and fabricate an electrical stimulator device and integrated electrodes in an existing EHT platform for electrical stimulation of cardiomyocytes. In the beginning, a literature study was conducted on different electrical stimulation methods and existing electrical stimulation devices for this purpose. For the first part of the thesis which was the design and fabrication of electrical stimulator, the electrical stimulation parameters that must be fulfilled by this device, were specified. Various hardware design approaches were studied in detail and compared before the design and implementation of the final idea. Simulations of the selected method using the LTSpice software tool were performed in order to study the behavior of the electrical stimulator design. The device is a 16-channel electrical stimulator that provides perfect rectangular biphasic pulses in the range of±15Vwith adjustable voltage amplitude, frequency and duty cycle. A user-friendly interface allows the user to select the desired channel of stimulation and the signal is distributed providing electrical stimulation to a total of EHT platforms. Therefore, this device was designed in a way to be connected with a second Printed Circuit Board(PCB) which hosts 16-EHT with integrated electrode chips. The 16-EHT holder (PCB)was also designed to suit in a 96-well plate, used by biologists for cardiac-cell culturing inside the incubator. The characterization of the electrical stimulator took place in the measurement room of the EKL lab. The results of the measurements verify the precision and efficiency of the electrical stimulator circuit as they are in excellent agreement with the simulations. The second part of the thesis includes the fabrication of integrated electrode-chips. The fabrication was conducted at EKL lab, in the Microelectronics Department of TUD using clean room microfabrication techniques. The selected electrode material was TiN due to its unique mechanical properties and the electrodes were fabricated on PDMS, encapsulated between two layers of polyimide. The main steps required for the integration of these electrodes in the existing EHT platform have been also carried out.","electrical stimulator; cardiomyocytes; EHT; integrated electrodes; 96-well plate; voltage-controlled voltage source; voltage-controlled current source","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-09-18","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

Aiming to reach silent patient rooms as well as reduce the alarm fatigue for nurses, an initial idea of using Augmented Reality to visualize alarms<br/>on patient window at night from outside the patient room was proposed. Through the context research and user research, it has been found that the biggest support that ICU nurses need regarding alarms is the information from other rooms when they are inside the patient rooms. Thus, the direction of project shifted from displaying alarm information from outside to inside where the idea is most beneficial for ICU nurses. The findings from expert interviews and nurse interviews lead to a clearer design goal, which is to design<br/>a display system which supports ICU nurses to check real-time alarm information from other patient rooms and respond with touchless interaction through the patient window during night shift. The design goal was divided into three sub-goals: transparent display, touchless interaction and alarm information interface. For each sub-goal, the design went through iterations separately. After an benchmarking research, projection film was chosen to use in the project; by testing with 8 participants, gestures which have the best error<br/>rate were chosen for implementation; by sending out questionnaires to nurses, the alarm interface was iterated and improved based on 11 nurses' response. In the end, three part were integrated and the final design was evaluated by 5 ICU staff (including one technician and 4 nurses) at EMC. With the final design, the nurses are able to get real-time alarm information when they are in another room and remotely deal with the alarm right away. The final design is perceived by the nurses in general as an easy to understand, attractive and practical design. However, there still remain needs from nurses that are not fulfilled and more relevant possible research topics were found out. More possibilities should be researched and tested for development. The recommendations regarding these needs and possibilities are provided at the end of the project.","Augmented Reality; Alarms; ICU","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

(mentor); Magin, T. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","Atmospheric entry is a crucial phase in planetary exploration missions. During entry, the vehicle experiences severe heating at hypersonic speeds. To ensure the survival of the payload, this heating needs to be mitigated using thermal protection systems. Ablative shielding materials dissipate the incoming heat largely by surface reactions leading to material decomposition. Accurate simulations of this flow environment are critical for the efficient design of spacecraft. The main difficulties in this analysis are due to strong shock waves and thermochemical nonequilibrium in the flow field, giving rise to chemical reactions and the excitation of the internal energy modes of the fluid particles. Under these conditions, an accurate assessment of the flow field requires detailed models for evaluating the physicochemical properties of the reacting fluid, and its interaction with the heat shield at the vehicle surface. This thesis considered the coupling of a high-fidelity flow solver with an aerothermodynamic library designed specifically for atmospheric entry applications. The flow solver is a Cartesian grid immersed boundary finite volume code capable of performing high-order accurate simulations. The coupling procedure with the external library involved four modules to extend the applicability of the flow solver to atmospheric entry flight regimes. The first one provides an accurate set of thermodynamic properties acquired from a tailored database for relevant species. The second module supplies transport properties through a rigorous calculation respecting kinetic theory as opposed to simplified models. The third module deals with the finite-rate chemical reactions occurring in the flow. The last module enables the consideration of catalytic and ablative surface reactions as boundary conditions for the flow solver. Thermal nonequilibrium is implemented to consider two temperatures for the conservation of translational-rotational and the vibrational-electronic energies. Gas-surface interactions are implemented for the first time in a conservative immersed interface method. Various test cases have been simulated for the verification and validation of each of these implementations. Good agreement with reference results are obtained. The increase in the computational cost is justified by the significant improvements in the results and the wide range of conditions made accessible for investigation. A novel framework is established, with which flow simulations that are state-of-the-art both in terms of numerical accuracy and fluid physicochemistry can be performed.","Atmospheric entry; Hypersonics; Gas-surface interactions; Thermal nonequilibrium; Immersed boundary methods; Ablation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","In the post processing of acquired wind tunnel force measurements, propeller-driven aircrafts need a preliminary correction of the propeller slipstream. Propeller slipstream effect has two major contributions to the flow field. The first one is the increase in dynamic pressure and the second is the addition of rotation in the flow field. Without a slipstream correction, standard wind tunnel corrections cannot be implemented because powering the propeller violates the underlying assumptions of the standard correction methods according to Eckert. As a result, Eckert has developed a thrust correction formula that only includes the increase of dynamic pressure. This research has been conducted to develop a novel correction to include both the increase in dynamic pressure and the effect of rotation induced by the propeller slipstream. Initially, a non-linear Surface Vorticity Panel Method (SVPM) was chosen in order to have a non-prescribed slipstream strength and shape. However, there were problems with convergence time and slipstream deformation. Therefore, the model was reduced to a linear model first suggested by Schroijen. The propeller was modeled as a mix of BEM and vortex theory. The wing and empennage was modeled by VLM. Fuselage was modeled after Multhopp’s vertical slit representation and a forced potential solution was implemented to simulate the wing root effect. The wind tunnel experiments were conducted in various angle of attacks and thrust ranges. Results show that the panel method can simulate the rotational nature of the slipstream accurately and the wing lift distribution is parallel to the literature. The new proposed correction was adequate at approximating the propeller slipstream lift and can produce closer results than the Eckert correction at some instances.","Slipstream; Wind Tunnel; Propeller; Panel Method; Simulation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Insufficient waste separation is identified as the leading cause, which is feasible to tackle in the near future. To reduce the negative environmental and financial impact of the event's waste, this thesis mainly investigates the waste management process of events held by the Dutch convention center Rai Amsterdam. Through the qualitative research conducted with exhibitors and visitors, pain points that result in a lack of ability in waste separation were identified in three aspects, lacking the support on the waste sorting facilities, difficulties in managing time during busy hours, and knowledge gaps on waste sorting. Meanwhile, exhibitors expressed their wishes to reduce the high waste management cost. Based on the problems, the thesis proposes a product-service system that focuses on stimulating the event participants' waste separation behaviors. Seizing the ""predictable"" feature of the event waste, the design collects data of waste streams before the event for further enabling targeted recycling activity. Meanwhile, the data of visitor flow will be shared with exhibitors to help them on time-management. Additionally, cost reduction from waste sorting activity is used as an incentive to enhance exhibitors' participation. In the long term, the design will gradually increase the awareness of waste sorting and form the habit among the event participants, which eventually contribute to a more sustainable event.","Waste separation; Waste reduction; Event waste management; Behavior design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

Most conventional hand prostheses are only able to combine two of these three attributes. Therefore, combining all three attributes into a single device can result in a commercially attractive hand prosthesis. Another interesting point, particularly for pneumatic prostheses, is the usage time, as historically many have run into problems here and an extended usage time makes it attractive to the user. The goal of this graduation research is, therefore, to design a pneumatically powered hand prosthesis, that combines a high grip strength, a high opening/closing speed and lightweight into a single device, whilst maintaining a reasonable usage time. A hybrid actuated hand prosthesis is designed that combines a finger design based upon the Delft Cylinder Hand, with dual-mode actuation. This dual-mode actuation increases the efficiency of the hand and consist of a CO<sub>2</sub> supply with a hydraulic transmission to the fingers. A final prototype of the dual-mode actuation transmission is fabricated and evaluated. Although there is room for improvement in the resistance and timing of the system, the hand has a relatively high pinch force of an estimated 56 N. Furthermore, a grip speed of less than a second makes the hand attractive to be used. With a mass of only 235 grams, the hand weighs less than most of its competitors and is comfortable in use. The dual-mode actuation significantly increases the efficiency of the hand and gives it a usage time of over 400 cycles.","Prosthesis; Prosthesis design; Hand; Finger; Pneumatics; Hydraulic cylinder; Delft Cylinder Hand","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In particular, mechanical vibrational energy, one of the most common energy sources, has been intensely studied. Piezoelectric materials play a crucial role in vibrational energy harvesting as they can directly convert the mechanical energy to the desired electric energy. In particular these are attractive when they are made into a cantilever form allowing the harvester to harness larger energy. This project aimed at optimizing the performance of single-layered piezoelectric cantilevers, also known as the unimorphs, from the point of view of output power and operation lifetime with the use of a stroke limit stopper. \\<br/>In this study, a cantilever beam consisting of PZT (PZT5A4) bonded to an elastic substrate (Pernifer 45) with a tip mass attached to the free end is used as the harvester. To reduce the cracks generated in the piezoelectric material and subsequently increase the lifetime, a limit stopper is introduced to constrain the deflection of the unimorph.The influence of the stroke on the lifetime and power output is shown by a series of vibration tests under different operation conditions with varied unimorph lengths, configurations, attached tip masses and stroke distances. The result confirms the possibility of the limit stopper to improve output energy of longer unimorphs in certain distance ranges. It also points out that current designs do not allow performance optimization in both output and lifetime simultaneously. One ought to choose one of the two, as the methods which increased the instant power output also resulted in a sharp reduction in lifetime as well as total power capacity.","Energy Harvesting; Vibration Energy Harvesting; Piezoelectric energy harvester (PEH)","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | BioMechanical Design","",""

Traditional methods such as sieving, flocculation, centrifugation etc. have many demerits. This has lead to an interest in unconventional separation methods that use physical properties of the particles. Acoustophoresis is one such method that has gained popularity in recent times. Acoustophoretic separation is based on the density contrast between the particles and the medium, as well as the size of the particles. A particle in a medium in which an acoustic field has been applied, experiences an acoustic force. This acoustic force is greater in standing waves than traveling waves, which is why acoustophoretic devices generally use standing wave fields. Particles with positive contrast factor are pushed to the pressure nodes; once the particles reach the nodes, they are trapped. If the medium is in flow, the particles also experience drag force. The interplay between the drag and the acoustic force forms the basis for separation. Standing wave fields can further be distinguished as static fields or dynamic acoustic fields (DAF). In a static field, the nodes are stationary, while in DAF, there is movement of the nodes, caused by variation of source frequency. Here, the tendency of different-sized particles to follow the nodal movement gives rise to separation. DAF devices seem preferable when separation needs to be done on a larger scale.In this thesis, two novel DAF devices were studied; one device works on the principle of frequency sweeping, while the other works on frequency modulation. Both devices are 3D printed, and have two inlets and two exits, with separation occurring in an acoustic chamber where the DAF acts. Both devices are multi-nodal &amp; milli-fluidic. The samples to be separated consist of polyethylene particles of a continuous size distribution between 32-106 µm, dispersed in water. The devices were tested at a total channel flow rate of 1000 mlh-1 (Reynolds number of 20). The aim was to understand how varying the flow and acoustic field parameters affect the separation/filtration performance of the devices. This was done by defining a “threshold size” or the cut-off size at which the entire particle distribution is divided into two separate distributions. Flow and acoustic field parameters were adjusted to see how the threshold size increases/decreases.The analysis for each device was done by a parametric study using Design of Experiments (DOE). First the available features (both design and operation) were studied and suitable parameters and their values were selected. The DOE was then designed, having 27 combinations of parameters known as ‘runs’. Each run of the DOE was first simulated on an available 2D COMSOL model, followed by experimental validation. The DOE was then analysed using both theoretical and actual values, to find out the parameters that had the maximum effect on the threshold size, and their respective trends.","Dynamic Acoustic Fields; millifluidics; microparticles; filtration; separation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-03-25","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

This has led to wind power becoming a major contributor to the modern electrical grids. For the grids that are still based on conventional sources of energy, integrating wind power causes a serious impact on their performance. While the Windfarm must ensure the quality of power it supplies to the grid, the wind farm should itself remain resistant from the small disturbances coming from the grid. The power electronic converters used in the integration process are often responsible for the disturbance. These disturbances include, among other issues, the generation of certain harmonics based on the high-frequency converter switching. This affects the power quality and performance of the entire system. Certain harmonics are often amplified by resonating impedance. This phenomenon of harmonic resonance has been identified as a major cause of several grid failures.<br/><br/>In this master thesis, a study is carried out to investigate the generation and propagation of harmonics in a wind farm network. A modified IEEE-13 node feeder has been considered as a network accommodating a wind farm. The suggestive wind farm consists of 10 wind turbines, with each turbine connected at a different node of the modified IEEE-13 node feeder. These wind turbines are connected with the grid using an IGBT converter and an LCL filter. The switching topology and filter tuning has been discussed in detail. All the components comprising a wind turbine including cables, Voltage Source Converters (VSCs), transformers, filters and control system have been included.<br/><br/>The modelling is carried out in MATLAB/Simulink with the necessary data taken from the literature survey. A control system governing the switching of the IGBT converter has been developed. It consists of power control and a current control scheme. A DQ transformation scheme has been selected for the current control of the wind farm. A Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) is used to synchronize the converter with the grid and a Pulse Width Modulator (PWM) is used to generate gate pulses, controlling the switching of the IGBT switches.<br/><br/>The simulations have been carried out for 5 cases: the base case, de-tuned control system, disconnection of a part of the grid, wind speed dynamics and finally, a combination of all the above contingency cases termed as ""the worst-case scenario"". Each case is designed to represent the impacts inside a real offshore wind farm. A quantitative and qualitative analysis has been carried out for the harmonic distortions at different buses of the wind farm network under each case.<br/>Results from the simulations show the harmonic orders that are common across the frequency spectrum in different cases. The base case provided relatively low voltage harmonics, but with more disturbances in the network, higher harmonic content was observed. The harmonic order corresponding (or nearest) to the switching frequency of the IGBT converter and the resonant frequency of the network, contributed the most for the Total Harmonic Distortion (THD).","Harmonics; harmonic propagation; power system dynamics; grid integration; grid control","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Electrical Power Engineering","",""

This instrument is comprised of two needles that move to cut the vitreous into small pieces before aspirating them. Vitreous cutters are complex instruments that are light and small in size to increase their accuracy. Because of their small size, and complexity, they are assembled by trained technicians with the help of a microscope. It is believed that new technologies such as additive manufacturing (AM) might be able to reduce the manufacturing complexity associated with vitreous cutters. The goal of this study was therefore; ""To create a non-assembly driving mechanism for a vitreous cutter that is designed for AM"".<b> </b>In order to achieve this goal, the functions of a vitreous cutter were identified, as well as the mechanisms that fulfil these functions in current instruments. Furthermore, the general limitations of AM were researched and listed. Extensive research was done to identify examples in the scientific literature to find linear actuators that were made by means of AM as an integrated assembly. A diaphragm actuator was selected to drive the mechanism based on the limitations of AM, the requirements, and examples found in the scientific literature. An in depth analysis of diaphragm driven vitreous cutters revealed that it would be a challenge to seal the air chamber of the instrument. A new concept was created that used one of the strengths of AM to solve this problem, by creating a compliant interface between the moving needle and the air chamber. A proof of principle prototype was created to quickly test if it would be possible to create movement by sealing the air chamber with differently sized diaphragms. Based on the concept of sealing an air chamber with flexible diaphragms, four concept variations were created. <br/>It was decided to make a series of prototypes of one of these concept variations to study its performance. In total, 9 prototypes were manufactured using material jetting, out of Agilus30 and Vero, without the need of post-assembly. The prototypes were tested by applying a range of air pressure pulses, while measuring the force, the displacement, the actuation time, and the spring properties of the mechanism. <b>W</b>ith the successful manufacturing of the prototypes, it has been shown that it is possible to produce the novel driving mechanism using current AM techniques without any assembly steps other than the sealing of a cleaning hole to remove support material.  The tests revealed that the spring force of the mechanism was not linear for all materials, and that there was hysteresis present in the mechanism.  Furthermore, it was shown that none of the samples were capable of operating at the desired speed of 8000 pulses per minute (PPM). The soft samples were seen to have the best response time during the backward motion of the mechanism. A new driving mechanism was created in this study that utilized one of the strengths associated with AM. To the knowledge of the author this mechanism is the first of its kind, and has not been previously applied in another instrument. Additional knowledge on the material properties of digital materials is needed to be able to design a diaphragm mechanism that has the appropriate performance characteristics. With additional design efforts and research it could be possible to produce vitreous cutters using AM in a non-assembly manner. This could lead to a future where surgical instruments are manufactured on site and on demand. <br","Additive Manufacturing; Non-assembly; Driving mechanism; Vitreoretinal Surgery; Vitrectome","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2025-09-25","","","","Biomedical Engineering | Medical Instruments and Medical Safety (MIMS)","",""

The increase in Green house gas emissions due to human activities has disastrous implications for earth including an increase in global mean temperatures, rise in sea level and melting of polar ice caps. Climate change has<br/>impacted all forms of human life on earth and if unchecked, poses a threat to human existence. With more than 50% of global population currently living in the cities and the upward trend of people migrating to the cities expected to increase in the next few decades, cities are one of the major contributors to climate change. Nearly 80% of global energy and 75% of global resources are consumed in cities. Thus, there is an urgent need to tackle the environmental impacts of cities. <br/>In this research, we develop a methodology to quantify and analyze the environmental impacts of cities by considering the consumption of all resources<br/>occurring in a city. The methodology is applied to the city of the Hague in the Netherlands but can be replicated for other cities as well. The research is divided into the following components: Firstly, a small literature review is conducted to identify different elements in a urban system. The literature review also assesses different models used to quantify environmental impacts of a city . Out<br/>of the three models reviewed in the study, Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is found to be the best fit for assessing environmental impacts of city. Knowledge gaps surrounding the applicability of LCA to a city are identified and based on the knowledge gap, research question is framed. Following the literature<br/>review, a top down approach is used to identify products or activities by residents of a city that have an environmental impact. Following that, a data disaggregation methodology is developed to downscale data related to resource consumption and activities from the national or European level to local level of<br/>neighbourhoods in a city. The disaggregated data is then quantified using LCA and analyzed for different geographical regions, different resource use categories and different demographic groups in a city. Finally, based on the environmental impacts, commonly implemented policies in cities around the world to reduce GHG emissions are modelled and analyzed for the case study : The Hague. This is followed by detailed discussion on results, limitations, conclusions and directions for further research. The main conclusions that can be drawn from the research are that resource use categories in which<br/>intervention by cities is possilble account for nearly 70% of Global warming potential (GWP): 45% mobility, 15% waste,10% energy. Larger households have a higher impact due to mobility whereas smaller households have higher impact due to energy. Environmental impacts are further analyzed for clusters of<br/>neighbourhoods based on their socioeconomic indicators. Finally, the policy interventions analyzed show a potential to reduce net GWP by 25% in the Hague","Sustainability; Urban Systems; LCA; Environmental impact","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","",""

Conventionally, its use is focused on providing 2D imaging using ultrasound probes. However, with the introduction of matrix probes, the acquisition of 3D scans became possible enabling the sonographer to accurately interpret the scanned anatomy without needing to build a possibly error prone 3D mental map and thus, decreasing operator-dependency. Although with this 3D imaging, volume estimation accuracy increases and surveillance becomes less difficult, matrix probes are expensive, have a limited field-of-view and produce a low contrast image. This necessitates the sonographer to still build a mental map whenever a portion of an anatomy is not fully visible in a single volumetric scan, leading to more laborious surveillance. Ultrasound stitching is investigated as a potential method to overcome these limitations by tracking multiple ultrasound scans and merging them using their position and orientation coordinates. To this end, this work uses a robotic arm as the selected tracking system for the stitching of 2D xplane ultrasound images. First, the initial clinical application for the system was derived using a combination of literature study and interviews with medical experts which led to the decision of utilizing the robotic arm for liver imaging and biopsy needle guidance. The suitability of this application was validated with the evaluation of the three required stages namely anatomy reconstruction, needle path planning and needle insertion. Two phantoms mimicking lesions and surrounding vessels were fabricated for this purpose. They were firstly reconstructed by manually segmenting the elements of interest from multiple scans, placing these segmented scans in their respective 3D positions and finally applying an alpha-shapes reconstruction algorithm. Once that the centroid of the lesions was calculated and together with the position information about the surface of the phantom obtained with the robotic arm, it was possible to evaluate all the paths that connect the surface with the centroid and subsequently select only the ones that did not pass next to a vessel within a specific distance. Finally and as an extension of using the robotic arm to track the ultrasound probe, the combined tracking of the probe with a needle holder was investigated for the needle insertion stage. The needle holder was used to maintain the needle always in plane with the ultrasound beam and it was placed at a preset distance with respect to the probe. The holder also provided insertion depth information that facilitated the representation of the needle via a line in the visualization environment whose end indicated the position of the needle tip. This position was updated in real-time with the information received from the needle holder while the needle was being inserted. The position of the needle tip was verified by overlapping real-time ultrasound images with the visualized line. Ultimately, to further illustrate the suitability of the robotic arm in a clinical setting, an ex-vivo and a clinical experiment for vessel tracking and reconstruction was performed.","Ultrasound Stitching; Robotic Arm; Ultrasound Imaging; Liver Imaging; Biopsy Needle Guidance; 3D Ultrasound","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-09-25","","","","","",""

This invasive method provides extensive information but is inherently limited in scope due to the extreme heterogeneity of paintings. In the last decade, non-invasive spot analyses and spectral imaging methods have become increasingly widespread in cultural heritage science. Two of these methods are macroscopic X-ray fluorescence imaging spectroscopy (MA-XRF) and reflectance imaging spectroscopy (RIS). These methods allow for 2D-scanning the entire surface of a painting and provide complementary information on elemental and molecular composition and distribution of the paint. However, these methods are often used only for qualitative analysis of the paint based on relative distribution maps, revealing only limited information about the paint layer stratigraphy. This thesis is an exploration of a combined approach for quantitative analysis of paint composition and layer stratigraphy using MA-XRF and RIS. The research used a set of specially prepared paint samples of mixtures and multiple layer applications based on historically relevant pigments which were scanned using MA-XRF and RIS in the visible and Near IR range (400-2500 nm). The spectral data acquired were processed and analyzed in a variety of ways, including Non-negative Matrix Factorization, Non-Linear Least Square Fitting, among other methods; in an attempt to gather quantitative compositional and stratigraphic data. In these trials, using characteristic reflectance features in the visible range together with a comparison of highly and lightly absorbed X-ray fluorescence lines allowed for the identification and quantification of surface specific compounds related to the top paint layer. Further comparison of fluorescence lines and absorption features in the Near IR range provided a potential avenue for quantification of subsurface paint layers. The results confirm that the combination of these methods allows to reveal the paint stratigraphy. The project provides samples and data sets which may serve as the basis for the development of a robust algorithm to address this issue in the future.","MA-XRF; RIS; Painting; reflectance imaging spectroscopy; macro x-ray fluorescence; XRF","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To date, clinical treatments seem to be insufficient to restore cartilage and underlying bone degeneration. Bioprinting fabrication techniques constitute a promising approach to mimic and anchor both the biological and mechanical properties of the two different tissues. Moreover, the simultaneous development and junction of an osseous and a cartilaginous compartment would be beneficial to provide mechanical fixation to the latter. Each tissue, osseous tissue and articular cartilage, presents different physical and mechanical properties. Hence, different biomaterials and bioprinting techniques are commonly used in each case. Therefore, the fusion of an osseous (HB via pneumatic-driven dispensing) and a cartilaginous (PCL1 via Melt Electro-writing) compartment was investigated in the study. Currently, pneumatic-driven dispensing systems combined with Melt Electro-writing are used to fabricate reinforced hydrogels as a cartilage equivalent. The used techniques are generating constructs using a layer by layer fashion on a flat surface. The possibility to generate the respective constructs on top of a non-smooth and concave surface, such as an osseous implant, was studied in the present work. Using two different bioprinting techniques, it was possible to fabricate clinically relevant-size bone-implants for osteochondral defects. Firstly, the osseous compartment of the implant was constructed by Fused Method Deposition (FDM) using Polycaprolactone (PCL1). Secondly, Hyperelastic “bone” (HB) was chosen based on the osteoinductive properties it shows. Inversely, the HB-implants were fabricated using a pneumatic-driven dispensing system. Apart from the superior osteoinductive properties of HB over PCL1, the bulk stiffness of the two materials was measured under uniaxial compression. Following the same protocol, HB-scaffolds with specific internal architecture were evaluated. The different groups of porous HB-scaffolds presented different design details (outer periphery loop and/or closed top layer) to evaluate the impact of each element on the final stiffness. Also, the effect of an in-vitro pre-culture period in chondrogenic differentiation medium on the stiffness of the osseous scaffolds was examined. The gross shape of the osseous compartment may contribute to the fixation of the osteochondral implant. Therefore, multiple types of osseous defects were introduced in the current work. The corresponding implants were fabricated as previously described. The size of the implants and the extent of confinement from the surrounding material were set as the parameters of the study. To evaluate the joint integrity, a Digital Light Processed ex-vivo model was fabricated. Particularly, the stifle joint of sheep was chosen as an ex-vivo model to replicate the human knee physiology and anatomy. By inserting the fabricated implants into the sites of defects and testing them under the employment of physiological loading conditions, displacement data were acquired. A Python-code that generates a G-code allowing printing in the transverse plane to that of the building plate was successfully developed. The particular Python-code creates a G-code that enables the print-head to move on top of a concave and non-smooth surface with high accuracy. The results indicate that the Young’s modulus elasticity of the osteoinductive HB is lower compared to that of the native trabecular bone. Also, neither the periphery loop nor the closed top layer of the porous HB-scaffolds seem to have a significant impact on the stiffness. The same stands for the pre-culture period in chondrogenic differentiation medium. The ex-vivo testing of the fabricated implants indicates that a width of 10 mm might be crucial for the joint integrity. Inversely, the confinement of the implant by the surrounding material seems not to affect it. Finally, the fusion of the osseous and cartilaginous compartment appears to be dependent on the material inconsistencies of the bone equivalent. However, porous structures were demonstrated on top of the osseous-surface.","Biofabrication; Osteochondral Regeneration; Convergence; Biomechanics; Ex-vivo","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2025-09-25","","","","Biomedical Engineering | Biomaterials and Tissue Biomechanics","",""

However, the extensive use of fossil fuels has led to an increase in Earth's surface temperature. To tackle rising energy demands and the increase in Earth's surface temperature, various organizations like Inter-governmental Panel for Climate Change and the European Environmental Agency have suggested the use of renewable energy as an alternative energy supply. E.g., the use of hydrogen as an alternative fuel in transportation will reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Besides, converting CO2 and N2 to fuels and industrial feedstock like CO or NH¬3 can curb the Earth's increasing surface temperature. As a result of this, in this thesis, the catalysts for the synthesis of hydrogen from water-splitting (hydrogen evolution reaction- HER), conversion of CO2 to CO via carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR), and reduction of N2 from air to NH3 (Nitrogen reduction reaction-N2RR) are studied. The conventional catalysts used for these reactions are Pt for HER, Cu for CO2RR Cu, and Ru for N2RR. Although these catalysts are active and exhibit a high yield of products, they have some disadvantages, such as the long-term availability and cost of Pt and Ru. On the other hand, Cu suffers from the low selectivity for the conversion from CO2 to CO. To overcome these disadvantages; scientists have developed a new kind of catalyst with a higher specific activity, known as the Single-Atom Catalysts (SAC). The SACs use fewer precious elements than the conventional bulk catalysts without compromising the activity. The use of binding energy (EB) as a descriptor for the reactions mentioned has been proven in the literature. Therefore, EB is used in this thesis to predict novel SACs through high-throughput DFT calculations using 3-N doped graphene as the substrate. The descriptor for HER is the EB of H atom, for CO2RR is EB of CO, and that of N2RR is EB of N on the respective catalyst surfaces. These calculated binding energies are compared against the descriptor EB on the conventional catalysts to obtain the novel SACs. With EB as the descriptor, the candidate catalysts for HER are B, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Ge, Ru, In, Sb, La, and Pb. The candidate catalysts for N2RR are Ru, Mo, and Cr. The candidate catalysts for CO2RR are Mg, Al, Ca, Zn and Se,. In addition to this, the charge dissipation of the adsorbent species on the SAC and the effect of atomic size on the EB is studied. It was seen that the computational predictions go hand in hand with the predictions of existing experiments for HER and CO2RR.","DFT; Computational Chemistry; Hydrogen evolution;; Nitrogen reduction; Graphene; CO2 Conversion; single atom catalysis; cataysts; solar fuel generation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-12-31","","","","Materials Science and Engineering","",""

Instead of requiring robots to share their intentions with each other, a model based on recurrent neural networks (RNNs) is used to predict them. This model is trained on data obtained with a centralized sequential model predictive control (MPC)-based motion planner in which intended trajectories of neighboring robots are available while planning. The learned model can be efficiently run online and provide accurate predictions for each robot in the environment based on a horizon of past observations of all robots' states. This model is then incorporated into the MPC planning framework so that it may be run in a decentralized manner. It is finally shown in simulations that the proposed approach achieves a similar level of performance to its centralized counterpart.","robotics; decentralized collision avoidance; local path planning; deep learning; recurrent neural networks; model predictive control","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

Due to low mass and power characteristics, monocular vision sensors are an attractive choice for onboard vision-based navigation systems. This work focuses on the problem of utilizing images from a monocular vision sensor for estimation of the target's state relative to the servicer spacecraft. Of special interest is the underlying problem of estimating position and attitude (pose) from a single monocular image, given the knowledge of its 3D model. Motivated by the recent advancements in computer vision and machine learning, this work investigates a learning-based approach that has the potential to enable a new paradigm of robust and accurate onboard navigation systems. <br/><br/>A novel framework is proposed for pose initialization and tracking of an uncooperative spacecraft in close-proximity using monocular images and deep learning. An approach based on the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) is investigated for its scope in enabling reliable on-orbit operations. With a monocular camera as the sole navigation sensor, the underlying problem of relative pose estimation is tackled with deep learning in CNNs to provide robustness to illumination conditions, as opposed to conventional image processing approaches. The CNNs are trained on synthetic images generated from photorealistic renderings of the target spacecraft and integrated into a navigation loop. The emphasis is put on the robustness of such a CNN-based navigation loop, as CNN models are susceptible to learning implicit data distributions that generalize poorly to reality when trained on synthetic data. The central analysis in this work focuses on the European Space Agency’s decommissioned Envisat spacecraft as the target, due to its potential debris generation risk. To that extent, a navigation framework is designed that uses two CNNs- a single-shot object detection network and a high-resolution keypoint detection network, to detect predefined surface keypoints on the target spacecraft. A heatmap representation is used for keypoint detection that provides contextual information per detection and allows indirect quantification of the observation uncertainty. The detected keypoint coordinates and the associated covariances are then used to solve the Perspective-$n$-Points (P$n$P) problem using a Maximum Likelihood P$n$P (MLP$n$P) solver. The MLP$n$P solver provides a pose estimate and the associated uncertainty, which is used by a loosely-coupled Multiplicative Extended Kalman Filter to track the state of the target spacecraft. The pose estimation pipeline in the first two stages is benchmarked and validated on the Spacecraft Pose Estimation Dataset (\textit{SPEED}) from the Stanford Rendezvous Laboratory, containing images of the Tango spacecraft from the PRISMA mission. Subsequently, the framework is evaluated for the Envisat target case, using existing Envisat synthetic image datasets. The complete navigation loop is evaluated on a simulated perturbation-free trajectory of the Envisat spacecraft tumbling along the V-bar.<br/><br/><br/>The proposed framework takes a step towards enabling real on-orbit operations by addressing critical challenges in learning-based methods for the navigation problem. The \textit{SPEED} benchmark results for the pose estimation pipeline show comparable performance with the current state-of-the-art approaches, with a desirable balance in speed and accuracy of the CNNs. The CNN models trained on synthetic images and the resulting pose estimation pipeline also demonstrates robustness to previously unseen real images. Subsequent evaluations on the existing Envisat datasets reveal their inadequacy for training and evaluation of CNNs towards the real on-orbit operation. To tackle this, a new augmented image dataset of the Envisat spacecraft is introduced, which improves over the existing datasets by modeling Earth background and common corruptions in the images. The proposed dataset provides objective improvements for training deep neural networks towards robust and reliable on-orbit operations. Finally, a preliminary navigation analysis on a simplified V-bar scenario for Envisat, reveals that the proposed loosely-coupled estimation in the navigation loop provides an accurate navigation solution.","Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs); Machine Learning; Proximity Operations; Navigation; Robust Navigation; Estimation; Space Debris; on-orbit servicing; Monocular Vision; Computer Vision; Pose estimation; Filtering","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Among the branches of bio-sensing, capacitive sensing is a promising technique and utilized widely, since it is rapid, simple, label free and inexpensive. Compared with traditional capacitance sensing front end, capacitance to frequency (CFC) based frontend can be utilized to measure the capacitance change based on the frequency shift in the output. LC voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) based CFC benefits from low power, low cost, high sensitivity, embedded wireless capability and miniaturized characterization, and it can be based on passive or active approaches. The limitation of cutting edge LC VCO based system is they are single channel. This thesis presents the design of a 3-by-3 400-MHz LC VCO based microsensor array for measuring bacteria concentration and related bio-analyte which behave capacitively in that frequency range. This would allow for high-resolution wireless capacitive sensing in a power-efficient way. The wireless capacitive microsensor array has been designed in a standard 0.18 um CMOS process. The sensor array is comprised of 3-by-3 pixels, and it is implemented by customized interdigitated capacitors. Each pixel has two customized 10.5 um * 10.5 um capacitors with 100fF capacitance value. A class-B VCO is implemented with 300fF buried metal-oxide metal (MOM) capacitor and 300nH off-chip inductor. The class-B oscillator converts the capacitance change in the sensor array into frequency shift and transmits the signal through wireless inductance link. The central frequency varies within ±3.3 MHz, with less than 1.4% RMS phase noise in process corners. By post-layout extraction, the circuit has 417 kHz/fF responsivity, 99.8% R^2 value and 1.5% RMS phase noise. Each pixel occupies and area of 30 um * 25 um area. In total, the whole front-end core circuit takes 140 um* 160 um chip area. This project contributes to further development of the multichannel LC VCO based sensing system, which could be utilized as a multi-channel low-power capacitance sensing technique in a long-term vision with combined detection and wireless transmission in the same front-end.","LC Sensor; Capacitive sensors array; Voltage controlled oscillator","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-12-31","","","","Electrical Engineering | Microelectronics","",""

The flue gas is fully contained inside the radiant tube burner and does not come into contact with the iron products inside the furnace. The burner interacts with the process side of the furnace only by heat transfer. Therefore, the investigation could be divided into a study of two separate systems: the burner and the furnace systems. In the first part, the burner system was evaluated. The impact of changing the fuel of the burners from natural gas to hydrogen on heat-, flow- and radiation of the existing burner was studied. Moreover, the NOx generation has been considered. The investigations were performed using Reynolds Average Navier Stokes (RANS), Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) approach using detailed chemistry. Natural gas combustion was simulated as the basis for comparison. The result shows that the CFD model could estimate the NOx emission of the base case well. Next, the combustion with hydrogen was compared. The result suggests that the thermal efficiency of the burner is slightly higher with hydrogen fuel. On the other hand, the NOx emission is significantly higher. A modified burner including internal flue gas recycle was proposed and studied. The result shows that the modified burner can be operated at the same power and the same level of NOx emission as the existing system. Furthermore, different burner power could be applied in order to comply with the NOx emission limit or to increase processing speed. In the second part, a heat transfer analysis of the furnace has been performed. The model agrees well with measured data of furnace atmosphere temperature. The result suggests that having a higher burner power could increase the processing speed and reduce the energy requirement per ton of iron products.","hydrogen; radiant tube burner; heat treatment; CFD modelling; heat transfer","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-03-25","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

Ambient occlusion measures how geometrically occluded each point in the scene is and modulates the ambient light accordingly. In real-time applications, screen-space ambient occlusion approximations are used, due to their great performance and visual quality. However, these screen-space approximations only take the geometry currently visible on screen into account. This results in underestimated or missing ambient occlusion when geometry is hidden from view (e.g., hidden behind other geometry). Our proposal, stochastic-depth ambient occlusion, improves upon traditional screen-space ambient occlusion techniques by including information about geometry at multiple depth layers, using a stochastic transparency based approach. This allows us to efficiently gather the missing information in order to improve upon the accuracy and spatial stability of conventional screen-space approximations, while still maintaining the real-time performance. Our approach integrates well into existing rendering pipelines and we show how it can be generalized to work with different screen-space ambient occlusion techniques and extensions (such as bent normals and cones). We also demonstrate how multi-view stochastic-depth ambient occlusion can greatly improve upon the robustness of traditional multi-view ambient occlusion techniques. Furthermore, we provide an extensive analysis of the visual quality, robustness and performance of stochastic-depth ambient occlusion compared to conventional screen-space approaches.","Computer Graphics; Real-time Rendering; Screen-Space Ambient Occlusion; Stochastic Transparency","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The fundamental power of BSDEs lies in the fact that with them one does not merely obtain the solution of the corresponding PDE but also its spatial gradient through the control process Z. Classical numerical methods tackling the system face the so-called curse of dimensionality and cannot be used to solve high-dimensional problems. In recent years, multiple approaches have been developed to overcome this computational burden, building on deep learning and showing remarkable empirical success even beyond 10 dimensions. However, such Deep BSDE methods struggle with giving accurate approximations for the Z-process throughout the whole time horizon. In this thesis we propose a novel approach aimed to give better estimations for the control problem, exploiting the natural dynamics of the Z-process given by Malliavin calculus. The proposed methods use deep learning parametrizations taking advantage of the universal approximation capability of neural networks. The Malliavin derivatives are estimated through the Malliavin chain rule. Two discrete numerical methods are developed which are called One-Step Malliavin (OSM) and Multi-Step Malliavin (MSM) schemes respectively. An error analysis is carried out proving the consistency of the algorithms and showing first-order convergence under certain assumptions. Numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate the efficiency of the Malliavin formulation compared to other Deep BSDE solvers.","backward stochastic differential equations; Deep BSDE; Malliavin calculus; deep learning; neural networks; PDE; high-dimensions; curse of dimensionality","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","In the field of radio astronomy the Ultra-Long Wavelength (f &lt; 30MHz) band is unique, it has been studied for nearly a century yet it is still almost completely uncharted. Due to the reflective properties of Earth's ionosphere this band is nearly completely inaccessible for ground-based observatories, which can only receive frequencies down to 8 MHz in ideal conditions. This band may only be explored from space, but the creation of space based observatoriesis problematic due to the large telescope sizes associated with these frequencies. The only viable solution to space-based radio observation is the use of radio interferometry, a process which combines measurements of multipleradio receivers to act as a single instrument with a larger aperture. Plans to establish these constellations have existed for some time, but have always been too expensive. With the rise of micro-satellites the concept of a radiointerferometry constellation has become economically viable. The OLFAR mission is one among the many recent radio interferometry concepts, which stands out among its peers through the application of a swarm design philosophy.The most important instrumental property of a radio interferometer is the number of available instrument pairs (baselines), and the distribution of their relative orientation in uvw space. To facilitate radio interferometry at 10MHz and lower frequencies the OLFAR swarm requires orbits which offer relative velocities below 1 m/s, while also being sufficiently stable to keep the baseline between its members below a maximum of 100 km. A minimal separationof 500 meters between satellites is used for collision safety. Early concepts for the OLFAR mission made use of Lunar orbits, where the Moon would act as a radiation shield against Earth's interference. Previous studies have shown thatsuch orbits expose the swarm to unacceptably large relative velocities, which is why alternative deployment locations are still being studied. This thesis studies the applicability of swarm orbit designs around the fourth Lagrangianpoint, denoted as L4. This point offers very promising orbital properties, but it has not been studied in detail due to the swarm's exposure to interference. As a basis for this work it is assumed that the 9dB of interference mightbe worked around through the dynamic range of hardware and longer integration times, making L4-centric orbits aviable deployment location.Particular attention is paid to developing an accurate numerical model for a perturbed orbital environment, which is necessary to provide long-term orbits of good quality. The inclusion of perturbations in this model is based on theirmaximum demonstrable effect on baselines and overall satellite positions over a year in orbit. After establishing the numerical simulation environment the satellite swarm design problem around L4 is posed as an optimisation problemfor heuristic algorithms. Based on small-scale experiments the efficiency of different algorithms and architectures is evaluated, and the best-suited solution is used to optimise swarm designs for the OLFAR missions. The resultingmethod of choice maximises the potential of multi-threading, using 32 connected differential evolution algorithms with 48 population members to perform as a single algorithm with a population of 1536 individuals.Using this method satellite swarm designs and orbits of up to 35 elements are found, which demonstrably meet all interferometry-related mission requirements for over a year in orbit while only relying on passive formation flight. These swarm designs rely on a process which is described as swarm folding to achieve this result. By distributing the swarm as a column mirrored in the barycentric z direction with uniform velocities, the swarm initially folds overitself. This folding motion is periodically repeated throughout the designed orbit after the initial fold as a result of the swarms natural orbits. The folding motion greatly enhanced long-term cohesion of the swarm, and it creates avery dynamic baseline distribution pattern for radio interferometry. It is demonstrated that these orbit designs have near-ideal baseline distributions, wherein they are only limited by the natural limitations of the Lunar orbital plane.Though the application of swarm folding these designs remain compact for long time periods, even in a perturbed environment. The demonstrated designs have feasible mission lifetimes up to 3 years in-orbit, requiring only a fewmanoeuvres during this time to enforce the 500 meter separation for collision safety. Through the application of active formation control it is expected that this can be extended to 5 years in-orbit with the right swarm orbit design. Itis also expected that using the methods in this thesis larger swarm designs might also be found, potentially ranging into 50 satellites. The largest hindrance to further extending the size of the swarm is the risk of near-collision events,which are inherent to the folding motion.","Swarm Satellite Constellation; Orbit Design; L4; Optimisation; Radio interferometry; radio astronomy; OLFAR","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

(mentor); van Beers, Cees (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","Almost 25 million people in Indonesia are still living in poverty. Most of these people are living in a rural area. Energy provision is considered as one of the first steps towards poverty alleviation. However, there are many challenges faced by the Indonesian government in providing electricity to the rural area, because most of the non-electrified villages are difficult to access by off-grid connection. Hence, renewable energy technology is widely considered as the most viable option for rural electrification that could stimulate economic growth without harming the environment. As technology provider agents, social entrepreneurs and NGOs have an essential role in technology development and knowledge transfer to people in a rural area. This highlights the importance of social entrepreneurship in supporting rural development and electrification. However, the implementation of rural renewable energy has high dependencies on charitable funding and grants. This addresses the most critical challenge for social enterprises and NGOs, that is to become financially and socially sustainable, especially after the launch of the innovation. Thus, identification and analysis of critical success factors for the commercialization phase of social innovation are needed. This study aims to identify and analyze the critical success factors influencing social innovation and entrepreneurship, particularly in the rural renewable energy field. Then, possible recommendations can be proposed to overcome the barriers. A combination of research methodologies is used in this study, combining both primary and secondary data through literature review, interview, and case study with cross-case analysis. The case study will be conducted by analyzing three social entrepreneurs focusing on rural renewable energy in Indonesia, such as Lentera Bumi Nusantara (LBN) for the wind turbine, Renewable Energy Service Company (RESCO) Sumba for solar PV, and Institut Bisnis dan Ekonomi Kerakyatan (IBEKA) for micro-hydro. The main deliverables from this study are the framework of influencing factors for social innovation in the commercialization phase and recommendations to overcome the barriers. The proposed framework and suggestions can be used as a basis for future research in other cases of social innovation, not only limited to rural development and renewable energy field. The study provides a final framework of 20 factors, which is based on these three levels: individual organization, civil society, and state. For the “individual organization” level, the factors are long-term goals and commitment, planning and targets, credibility and capability of the company, organizational culture and environment, qualified personnel, benefits for personnel, the role of company leaders, products and services, cost recovery model, natural resources, and standard procedures and practices. For the “civil society” level, the factors are target market readiness, benefits for users or community, community involvement and participation, network and partnership, financial support, and competition. For the “state” dimension, the factors are regulations and policies, administrative and bureaucratic procedures, and infrastructure.","Social innovation; Social entrepreneurship; Renewable Energy; rural development","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

At the same time, because of its size and participation in the national economies, the improvement of the construction industry could generate long-lasting benefits for the society. However, the construction industry has failed to adapt to modern societal and technological challenges. Offsite construction is being proposed as a solution to some of the structural failures that inhibit change and adaptation of the construction industry. Even though offsite construction has been long considered as a solution, its uptake remains low. Public authorities can play a large role in incentivizing offsite construction through public policy and as major clients of built environment products. In this research, we intend to answer the question of: How can public policy instruments at national and local levels help to overcome the barriers for adoption of offsite manufacturing in the construction industry of the Netherlands?”. An exploratory case study of the conditions in the Netherlands was used to determine adoption barriers and possible roles that public authorities could have in incentivizing offsite construction. We found five barriers that affect the prospect of adoption of offsite construction but also affect the general innovativeness of the construction industry, and fifteen barriers that are offsite construction technology-specific. Based on key activities derived from innovations systems and transformational approaches to innovation policy, we proposed different roles that the government could assume in the process of incentivizing the adoption of offsite construction. Six possible roles and instruments were proposed to improve the innovativeness of the construction industry; Five possible roles and instruments to improve the adoption and uptake of offsite construction and; ten roles to improve the uptake of offsite construction and the provision of housing.","Offsite construction; Innovation adoption; Innovation in the construction industry; Transformative change; Dutch construction industry","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

In this work, a strategy to implement a 3D dynamic model and a trajectory control algorithm is proposed for the DelFly Nimble by the use of a quasi-steady state framework. The design of a suitable tracking control algorithm is the essence of this task. A globally defined smooth nonlinear geometric framework of the flapping-wing vehicle’s rigid body dynamics is introduced as a basis for the analysis. This grants an unambiguous coordinate-free dynamic model in which problem of singularities are avoided. The Nimble has four inputs used to control the six translational and rotational degrees of freedom. A nonlinear tracking controller is chosen on the special Euclidean group 푆퐸(3) for the underactuated aerial vehicle, where position and yaw trajectory tracking are achieved. The full system is classified into the coupled attitude and position subsystems. Using the Lyapunov Stability theorem, the nonlinear controller is shown to achieve almost global asymptotic tracking of the attitude error dynamics of the Nimble and almost global asymptotic tracking of the position error dynamics of the center of mass of the Nimble, enabling sufficient tracking of aggressive maneuvers. Finally, the dynamic model and the controller are examined with numeric simulations. From the results can be concluded that the nonlinear control design allows for aggressive aerobatic maneuvers while maintaining stability of the closed-loop system, provided that the control inputs and damping forces remain moderate.","Autonomous vehicles; Nonlinear control systems; Lie algebra; Flapping flight; Flapping wings; Micro air vehicles; Robotics; Trajectory tracking; Geometric Control","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The problem of detecting data reliability is approached as an anomaly detection problem using statistical learning, where anomalous data is potentially unreliable. Anomaly detection is typically approached as an unsupervised learning problem, but this thesis takes an active learning approach. A key constraint on the active learning algorithm is that it should be able to function in the absence of labels and it should therefore be grounded in the unsupervised learning paradigm. The support vector data description (SVDD) is such an algorithm and we assess its performance on the data gathered by the multi-sensor network at the DWA office. Additionally, a framework is proposed that facilitates the transition from unsupervised towards supervised learning through active learning. The framework also addresses the multi-dimensional nature of the gathered data and exploits the temporal, spatial and sensorial relations in it. We show that a supervised classifier can be trained on gathered labels to achieve enhanced performance when employed in parallel with an unsupervised anomaly detector.","statistical learning; anomaly detection; multi-sensor networks; data reliability","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

By using the ceramic insulators as flexures the short- and long-term stability of the lenses are improved and the thermal transient settling time is reduced from 26 hours to below 6 hours. By opening up the geometry inside the gun lens the local vacuum at the emitter is much better, which increases its lifetime.

The OpenFOAM waves2Foam toolbox (developed by Jacobsen et al. (2012)) has been used to generate waves in the wave tank. The two phase solver interDyMFoam for moving bodies was coupled to the waveFoam solver from the waves2Foam toolbox in order to simulate a moving body under wave loads. The simulations in OpenFoam were carried out on a 1:50 scale. The potential flow model WAMIT has been used in order to obtain the response amplitude operator (RAO), added mass, damping and wave excitation forces from potential flow theory. <br/><br/>A single cylindrical column has been tested in the numerical wave tank both with and without heave plate. Firstly, a heave decay test has been carried out. As a result, the linear damping ratio and the linear and quadratic damping coefficients have been determined. Secondly, the structure was exposed to incoming waves. The response of the structure has been assessed under three different wave periods, which were selected in order to align with Rivera-Arebba (2017). The response of the structure was measured, filtered on the frequency of the incoming wave and compared with the RAO from the potential flow model. Also, the wave excitation forces of the potential flow model have been compared with wave loads from the numerical wave tank, based on simulations where heave motion of the structure was constrained. <br/><br/>It was found that both the wave excitation forces and the RAO of the potential flow model are in agreement with the CFD model results. The viscous effects included in the CFD model affect the response of the structure only very lightly. The largest differences between the potential flow and CFD model were found around the heave cancellation wave frequency. At the heave natural period of the structure, the heave plate increases the linear damping coefficient with ca. 50%. The damping at this period was dominated by viscous effects. In general, the potential flow model produces an accurate RAO, due to the fact that the system is lightly damped and the damping therefore plays a minor role in the structure's response. <br/><br/>The outcome of this work contributes to the understanding of the effects of heave plates in general and can be used to assess the added value of computational expensive CFD software in the design process of floating wind systems.","heave plates; CFD; potential flow; offshore wind energy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-09-24","","","","European Wind Energy Masters (EWEM)","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","Additive Manufacturing (AM) has been identified to be a key technology in the ‘third industrial revolution’ - a new wave of manufacturing technologies characterised by functional software, flexible robots, and a range of digitized services that addressed the limitations of traditional casting and milling based subtractive manufacturing processes. Wire and Arc Additive Manufacturing (WAAM) is one such AM technique that is used to produce metal components that are near net shape. Mechanical testing, failure analysis and microstructure investigation of the finished component is done only after it is fully built. Building defective parts increases the material usage, power consumption, build time, and overall cost of production. Thus, real time detection of process and product anomalies not only saves money and material but can also improve the mechanical properties of the printed component. One such monitoring technique is Optical Emission Spectroscopy (OES), where the electromagnetic radiation emitted by the plasma arc in the printing process is used to characterize the processing conditions of the WAAM environment. Although OES has been used for quality control in arc welding as well as powder-based AM processes, there has not been any previous study directly focused on the use of OES to study the WAAM process. Monitoring systems require a robust setup that can collect reliable and repeatable data, if it is to be used for quality control. Although OES is a feasible method to study arc radiation, there is currently no application of this technique in a reliable monitoring system for commercial application. The goal of this study was to develop an OES based monitoring system for the WAAM process. The monitoring system consisted of an experimental setup designed to collect reliable optical emission data from the plasma arc using an optic fibre attachment to the WAAM robot and a software system was designed to perform data analysis and post-processing of the collected optical spectrum. The developed monitoring system was validated by performing a series of experiments with different processing conditions (welding current, voltage, speed and surface conditions) to investigate the potential correlations among them with the detected optical spectrum. A peak characterization test was designed with different material combinations to test the reliability of the emission peak matching algorithm that was developed. It was followed by a ramping test where the heat input was incrementally increased to study the correlation with the processed OES signals. The final experiment was an anomaly detection test where the OES data was used to characterize the presence of an artificially deposited ceramic anomaly on the base plate that simulated the presence of an impurity. Secondary investigation techniques like optical microscopy, a high-frequency V-I sensor and a high-speed camera footage was used to validate the OES observations. The results of these experiments showed the feasibility of OES based monitoring systems for WAAM. However, the obtained results were not always consistent and the system requires further research before it can be used for reliable quality control of the WAAM process.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","Super-resolution microscopy methods are able to image samples with improved resolution over the diffraction limit. Single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) methods break the diffraction limit by sparsely activating fluorescent emitters. The resulting sparsity in the emission signal can be exploited by estimation algorithms, which enables localization with improved precision. Modulation enhanced SMLM (meSMLM) methods further increase the localization precision by combining SMLM techniques with patterned illumination. By using prior information to refine emitter position estimates, iterative meSMLM (imeSMLM) methods such as iterative MINFLUX are able to locally improve the resolution. For (me)SMLM methods, the Cramér-Rao lower bound (CRLB) is often used to assess the localization precision. The CRLB bounds the variance of arbitrary unbiased estimators from below. As the CRLB treats estimands as deterministic unknowns, a prior distribution on the estimands cannot be incorporated into the bound. Therefore, the effect of prior information on the localization precision of imeSMLM methods is not captured by the CRLB. The Van Trees inequality (VTI) is a Bayesian variant of the CRLB. Because it treats estimands as random variables with a known prior distribution, it is able to account for the effect of prior information on the estimator precision. It is therefore able to accurately bound the localization precision of imeSMLM methods from below. An imeSMLM method is considered, in which the positions of sinusoidal intensity patterns are controlled over the course of multiple iterations. Intensity minima of sinusoidal patterns are placed symmetrically around the current estimate of the emitter position, at a distance based on the localization precision of the previous iteration. This strategy balances the information content of signal photons with the need for robustness to estimation errors. Using the VTI, we derive a fundamental limit on the localization precision of imeSMLM methods that make use of standing wave illumination patterns. This limit shows that in the absence of background, the information content of signal photons increases exponentially as a function of the iteration count. Using Monte Carlo simulations, the maximally achievable localization precision for different illumination pattern placement control strategies was evaluated. The VTI allows to assess the performance of pattern placement control strategies and is therefore a promising method for optimal control of imeSMLM methods.","super-resolution microscopy; localization precision; van trees inequality","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","MP Motorsport is a talent educating race team participating in the classes below the Formula 1. The problem with the lower classes and therefore MP Motorsport as well is that these classes don’t get much attention and exposure. As a company run by people with passion the branding and positioning is more something that naturally emerged from this passion rather than a series of conscious decisions. This makes it fragile. A more conscious strategy and vision on how MP Motorsport needs to be branded and positioned against their competition that is more than “look how cool racing is” is needed to become more attractive for sponsoring. This report describes the process from analysis to finding the right positioning and an advise for a new brand identity and an implementation plan to help becoming more attractive for sponsoring goals. The analysis done with employees showed a unique characteristic that will help the team to position themselves against the competition; the family atmosphere. This atmosphere is what also characterises their contradictory personality. This personality is on one hand leading and ambitious and on the other hand modest and involved. Competition and stakeholder analysis have been performed to find the right combination of being unique to the competition, desirable for the stakeholders (the fans and sponsors) and builds upon the core strengths of the company. Then using the brand key model, a positioning is made with the essence: Be your best self. The belief, “in everyone hides a talent” and values like “everyone is equal” and “together we succeed” combined with the essence and the positioning resulted in a brand story that describes the feeling MP Motorsport wants to communicate. To manifestate the brand, an advise has been set up for a tone of voice and tone of image. Wrapped in a concept called “winning redefined” this advise is part of the whole implementation plan that should lead the way for the team to implement the newly created brand in short and long term actions. In 3 phases MP Motorsport is advised to start with a clear brand introduction to the target groups Gen Z and potential sponsors. The next phase revolves around creating a community to attract both Gen Z talents and subsequently sponsors to interact with the team and each other. Finally the last phase is long term focused and aims for sustainable growth. In this phase the community is established and can expect various opportunities to discover and develop a whole range of talents, sponsors and gen z are connected to each other via MP Motorsport and the team is able to finance the lower classes without the pressure of the money drivers bring along.","Branding; positioning; Motorsport","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

Another point of view to look at active learning is to consider active learning as a learning problem, where the training data is queried by the active learner. Under this perspective, an important question is inconsistency: can classifiers trained using active learning converge to the same result as using random sampling given an infinite number of data. In this paper, we discuss the possibility and potential consequences of using new sampling settings other than sampling without replacement in active learning to analyze the inconsistency problem. Moreover, a third sampling setting is defined to simulate the infinite data scenario in inconsistency. We compare the traditional setting, sampling without replacement in active learning with sampling with replacement in active learning, and true active learning. Furthermore, the two unusual sampling settings provide insight into the inconsistency problem. (1)Regularization parameter without adjustment can lead to inconsistency.

But when you’re raising a child with special needs, the level of care and stress is not just higher, it shifts the foundations of families and adds unimaginable complexities for everyone involved.” (Pinhorn, 2018, www.gottman.com)This project is developed in collaboration with The Ontzorghuis, a Dutch organisation founded to support parents of children with special needs. This assignment aims to enhance the capabilities of the CSN parents’ community to fulfill their basic psychological needs, which are essential for psychological health and well-being (Decy &amp; Ryan, 2008).Inspired by the Capability approach (Alkire &amp; Deneulin, 2009; Sen, 2004; Nussbaum, 2001) a qualitative study was conducted to evaluate the common capabilities that characterise the CSN parents’ community, as well as the individual practices or paths of success that parents come up with to deal with their challenging circumstances. The study consisted of initial desk research based on the social media expression of CSN parents and remote field research that involved 6 CSN parents who participated in a series of generative research exercises and interviews. An innovative approach for remote user research is presented. It is based on metaphorical visualization exercises that are able to engage a sensitive community with little time available into a conversation about intimate and relevant topics that are often difficult to share.The findings collected from this research narrowed down the scope of this project into the topic of future thinking. Many parents experience fear and anxiety when facing the big unknown that supposes having a life-long dependent child. Their capability to think about the future appears as a decisive factor in their wellbeing. The proposed solution, Future Journeys tool, integrates the concept of Resourcefulness (Giaccardi &amp; Nicenboim, 2018) into the context of future thinking. While the capabilities of this community are significantly reduced, the opposite may happen with their resourcefulness (ability to creatively adapt to challenges for which no commonly agreed solution was available). Future Journeys leverages the creative ways of approaching future thinking of some individuals to expand the perspective of relatable others who, although in similar circumstances, experience a negative relationship with the unknown future. The proposed tool is presented with the shape of a mobile phone application that aims to provide CSN parents with a common language to reflect and share their perspectives about future thinking. The solution promotes self-reflection through an exercise of guided metaphorical thinking and completes the experience with social interactions where the users share their perspectives to inspire others. This solution enhances the basic psychological needs of CSN parents. The impact of the tool on its users’ wellbeing was evaluated taking into account Self Determination Theory’s three fundamental needs. Furthermore, the results provided valuable insight into the potential of the tool to expand the capabilities of the CSN parents’ community and helped to draw further recommendations for the future development of the tool.","Parents of children with special needs; wellbeing; future thinking; reflection tool; social media platform; Capability approach; resourcefulness; Self Determination Theory; CSN parents; design for wellbeing; Ontzorghuis; metaphorical thinking; generative user research","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

This thesis focuses on one element of the MEDIATOR project referred to as the decision logic. It controls the level of automation the vehicle operates in, depending on the specific condition it encounters. One of the contributions of this thesis is the formalization of the decision logic as a mathematical problem; that is, it is modeled as a Markov decision process.

The feasibility of the proposed Markov decision process approach was tested by comparing it to a simpler heuristic approach.

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","A large fraction of hydrocarbons is recovered from gas condensate reservoirs. A major production challenge from gas condensate reservoirs is condensate dropout, as condensate liquid saturation will build up due to drawdown below dewpoint level. Condensate Gas Ratio (CGR) decrease during production is a clear indication of condensate dropout, which reduces well deliverability. Determining the well productivity index (PI) and methods to optimize productivity is paramount to the industry. The aim of this research is to investigate fluid phase change behavior during depletion in a hydraulically fractured well in an extremely low-permeability gas condensate reservoir. Here it is considered the case where condensate dropout occurs over a large volume of reservoir, rather than just near the fracture face (condensate banking). Reservoir simulation with local grid refinement (LGR) was used to understand this phenomenon and its impact on well PI, and to quantify pressure drop in the reservoir as a result of condensate dropout. The relationship of condensate dropout, pressure drop, gas rate and reservoir permeability are investigated by comparing conventional tight reservoirs, and very tight unconventional gas condensate reservoirs, both of which are produced with propped fracture stimulation. A commercial 3-D compositional simulator with LGR around the fracture was utilized to simulate such a reservoir with both synthetic and field data by observing the compositional changes (i.e., C1, C2, C3,..) in hydrocarbon content over time and distance from the fracture face, and the results were used in turn to generate more realistic production profiles over time. Additionally, a comprehensive discussion of the model assumptions and limitations is also included. The result shows a significant change in the composition and relative permeability to gas in the reservoir as the pressure declines during depletion. The simulation is done in two parts: synthetic and field data history matching. The results illustrate the complications in understanding the PI evolution of hydraulically fractured wells in “unconventional” gas condensate reservoirs and shows how to correctly evaluate fracture performance in such a situation. This research includes a review of several techniques and methods to calculate the occurrence of condensate at various distances from the well and fracture and includes a sensitivity analysis of the different parameters and how they affect well PI over time and ultimate recovery of gas and condensate. This findings and novel approach of this study aim to more accurately predict post-fracture performance and provide a better understanding of the hydrocarbon phase change not only near the wellbore and fracture, but also deep in the reservoir, which is critical in unconventional gas condensate reservoirs.","Gas condensate reservoir; Hydraulic fracturing; Well productivity index; condensate dropout","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Petroleum Engineering and Geo-sciences","",""

In this thesis the focus lies on the normal lay phase of the cable installation, which comprises the phase when the vessel is pulling out the cable and putting it down on the seabed following the desired cable route. In order to ensure cable integrity during cable installation, a normal cable lay analysis is executed in the dynamic analysis software Orcaflex. The aim of the cable installation analysis is to define the installation limits in terms of the sea state. However, the vessel motions of the Nexus can be measured instantaneously and accurately on board of the vessel. Therefore, an assessment into the use of vessel motions for the expression of the handling limits during cable installation is performed. The assessment is executed for a normal lay configuration with an export cable and a 50 meter water depth. The focus lies on the maximum curvature and maximum tension response of the cable. The cable dynamics result from both the vessel motions and the direct cable loads. First, the effect of these phenomena is assessed independently with the use of Orcaflex simulations. The influence of the vessel motions on the cable dynamics is found to be low for short wave periods, as the vessel hardly reacts to these kinds of waves. As a result, vessel motion limit criteria are less suitable for expressing cable installation limits at less severe sea conditions. However, the handling limits of the cable are not likely to be exceeded during these kinds of sea states, therefore this does not directly prevent the use of vessel motion limit criteria. Next, the most suitable vessel motion, measured at the chute of the vessel, for application of vessel motion limit criteria is determined based on the time lagged cross correlations between the cable response and the vessel motions. By using this method, the vessel motion which is most linearly related to the cable response is selected. In the case study, the heave acceleration and axial acceleration of the vessel are identified as most suitable candidates for application of vessel motion limit criteria. Finally, the performance of the selected vessel motion as limit parameter is compared to the use of the wave elevation, equivalent to sea state limit criteria. The performance of both is assessed by a linear regression analysis of the peaks in the limit parameter time history and the associated peaks in the cable response. This analysis led to the conclusion that in the case study higher certainty can be given to vessel motion limit criteria compared to sea state limit criteria, which eventually can lead to an increase of the workability. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis is performed to identify if the selected vessel motion for the application of vessel motion limit criteria is sensitive to changes in the normal lay configuration. The selected vessel motion and accompanied magnitude of the correlation were prone to changes in the normal lay configuration. Therefore, the applicability of vessel motion limit criteria for the base case in this thesis cannot straightforwardly be generalised for other normal lay configurations. Due to the nonlinear nature of the cable lay system, all cable installation analysis are executed using time domain simulations in Orcaflex, which are associated with large computational time. In light of reducing the computational time for normal lay analysis, the potential use of a transfer function for estimation of the maximum cable response is evaluated. The transfer function is set up based on the first order frequency response of the cable system to regular waves. Before application of the transfer function approach, the nonlinear behaviour of the system is studied on the basis of the spectral response of the cable towards regular wave simulations in Orcaflex. Especially the contribution of the higher order frequency components and the effect of the nonlinear drag term in the Morison equation are addressed. In order to check the performance of the cable response transfer function, the maximum cable response estimation of the transfer function for a three hour time duration is compared to the statistical three hour maximum resulting from non-linear Orcaflex simulations. The transfer function is found to underestimate both the curvature and the tension response of the cable, leading to the conclusion that this transfer function approach is not suitable for the prediction of the maximum cable response. The underestimation is caused by the high dynamic complexity of the normal lay system.","subsea cables; vessel motion based limits; submarine cables; cable dynamics; transfer function approach","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2025-09-23","","","","European Wind Energy Masters (EWEM)","",""

The distribution of fibres and resin is related to the ability of processing the tape with the ultrasonic tacking technology. Besides, the consistency in bond line of tacked samples was analysed, what was found to be in relation with the degree of consistency and homogeneity of the microstructure. A central composite design statistical model was utilised to study the effect of the tacking parameters to the bond strength of tacked samples.

This plaque is comprised of a lipid-rich pool containing little to no collagen covered by a collagenous ﬁbrous cap which serves as a barrier containing the plaque from rupture. Plaque rupture is an often fatal phenomenon, not yet fully understood, which can result in arterial blockage causing myocardial infarction or stroke depending on rupture location. Whether a plaque will rupture depends on many interrelated aspects; the biological composition of the plaque, the mechanical properties of these components, and how they are mechanically loaded. The collagenous matrix is the main load bearing structure of the plaque cap, therefore aﬀects plaque stability and should be further investigated. Due to the various limitations when studying ex vivo and in vivo human plaques as well as the signiﬁcant diﬀerence in plaque development in animal models, an in vitro atherosclerotic plaque cap model is necessary to systematically study plaque rupture mechanics. In this study, a simpliﬁed collagenous ﬁbrous cap model with a soft inclusion (SI) was developed. The eﬀect of intermittent uniaxial straining (IS) versus no straining (static) during culture was investigated as intermittent straining during culture is linked to an increase in alignment of collagen ﬁbers in the loading direction, which is seen in human ﬁbrous caps. The constructs were mechanically tested with two diﬀerent clamp designs (commercial and redesigned), to investigate the diﬀerences in mechanical behavior and to improve the clamping technique. The local strain patterns were studied using digital image correlation (DIC) preceding rupture. Although there was higher compaction observed in the IS constructs when compared to the static constructs, the mechanical behavior of the IS and static constructs tested in the commercial clamps were comparable. However, DIC analysis demonstrated that the static constructs in the commercial clamps showed homogeneous extension behavior, whereas the IS constructs showed a symmetric “C-shaped” compressive pattern, signifying a possible diﬀerence in microstructure. Additionally, the redesigned clamps displayed a consistent two bump rupture pattern correlating to rupture near the SI, as well as higher measured force at comparable stretch, not seen with the commercial clamps. The redesigned clamps demonstrated an improvement in the testing method when compared to the commercial clamps by exhibiting better load transmission from clamp to tissue, creating more homogeneous strain distribution within the region of interest and leading to more consistent rupture near the SI. Interestingly, high extension values were observed at the rupture location in both the redesigned and commercial clamps, possibly demonstrating a linkage between high extension behavior and rupture location. In this study, collagenous constructs with an integrated SI were successfully created exhibiting mechanical properties within the range found in literature and rupturing near the SI-tissue interface, therefore these ﬁndings can serve as a guide for future experiments in the development of an atherosclerotic plaque cap in vitro model.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-09-23","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

As a result, offshore wind turbines are increasing in mass and height and are installed at larger water depths and further away from shore. A floating vessel is not limited by water depth and soil conditions, but is sensitive to wave-induced motions. Heerema Marine Contractors developed a new installation method using a floating vessel, where the rotor nacelle assembly (RNA) of a wind turbine is assembled on an assembly tower on deck and is installed in one lift. The research objective is to gain a better understanding of the dynamic behaviour of a rotor nacelle assembly, particularly due to the wind, focusing on the horizontal motions of the RNA, when it is hanging in the crane above the tower. To examine the dynamic behaviour of the RNA, separate models are made to assess the effect of the wind and waves individually in OrcaFlex and Liftdyn. This is done to identify which motions are due to the wind, and which motions are due to the waves. Finally, the wind and waves are coupled to gain insight in the coupled response. Furthermore, a case study is performed to prove its applicability for implementing and assessing the effect of using tugger lines on mitigating horizontal motions. In the models the blade pitch angle, crane position and responses for different wind and wave conditions are examined. From the different models is observed that the response due to wind cannot be neglected. Wave-induced motions are governing, due to large crane tip motions. The governing motion is a pendulum motion of the RNA, which is larger for longer wave peak periods. For both short and long wave peak periods, the horizontal motions have to be mitigated. In the case study, tugger lines are implemented to examine the effect on the RNA motions and to assess if the model can be used for developing concepts to reduce the motions. It is shown that providing stiffness in the horizontal plane and in roll help to reduce the sideward pendulum. For long peak periods, the RNA motion has to follow the opposing motion of the crane tip. More research is required to develop a concept that can follow the crane tip for short peak periods and oppose the motion of the crane tip for long wave peak periods.","Offshore wind; Floating installation; Rotor nacelle assembly; Wind turbine","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-09-23","","","","European Wind Energy Masters (EWEM) | Offshore and dredging engineering | Bottom Founded Structures, Arctic and Wind","",""

In this work, two developments in the agricultural sector are combined: the integration of photovoltaic (PV) modules in a horticultural system and the use of light emitting diodes (LEDs) as supplemental lighting source for crops. Four greenhouse systems having different configurations of these two technologies and a plant factory are designed. The performance of these LED-based agrivoltaic systems are analysed for the crops lettuce and tomato and for three different climates: Sweden, the Netherlands and the United Arab Emirates. This study shows that the integration of a PV system and LED technology in a greenhouse system improves the crop production per unit of energy compared to conventional greenhouse systems. Furthermore, it has been found that the production of crop per piece of land can be significantly increased by the use of a plant factory.

(graduation committee); Dijkstra, Sander (graduation committee); Kaptein, Bart (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","After en bloc resection of primary pelvic bone tumours, orthopaedic oncologists usually try to perform reconstruction in order to achieve limb salvage. Reconstruction after these types of resections is challenging. Especially when the total ilium and parts of the sacrum needs to be removed. One of the reconstructive options is endoprosthetic fixation to sacral bone with the LUMiC prosthesis, but using the LUMiC prosthesis in the sacrum resulted in poor clinical results. Emerging new production techniques such as 3D printing provide for customised prostheses that could be an adequate reconstructive option in these cases and could complement the LUMiC prosthesis to enable sacral anchoring of the LUMiC prosthesis. One of the challenges of customised prostheses is that they are not ‘off the shelf’ and therefore are all different in terms of geometry and, thus, performance. Therefore, these implants cannot be subjected to stringent regulations and registrations used in conventional arthroplasty. In order to ensure maximal safety of these implants we must perform biomechanical testing before implantation. Unfortunately, the bone models for biomechanical testing currently available are not validated on implant fixation and thus unreliable for prosthesis testing. Therefore, in this thesis a new prosthesis that enables sacral anchoring of the cup of the LUMiC prosthesis is designed and two strategies are developed in order to mechanically evaluate this newly designed prosthesis for the sacral anchoring of the LUMiC cup. First strategy is using Finite element modelling to develop a model of the sacrum with implanted prosthesis. Second strategy is the development of 3D bone models of the sacrum using 3D printing together with performing experiments to mechanically evaluate the newly designed prosthesis. Four different mechanical bone models with different shell thickness and infill density were developed and compared to the FE model. Results showed that the new prosthesis design performed better in terms of micromotions between implant and bone compared to the use of the old LUMiC stem in the FE model. Furthermore, a 3D printed mechanical bone model with shell thickness of 1mm and infill structure of 20% showed most comparable results in terms of micromotions between implant and bone compared to the developed FE model. There could be concluded that the FE model and the development of 3D printed mechanical bone models together with the experiments are good starting points in the development of a protocol to in vitro evaluate newly designed 3D printed patient specific prosthesis for the sacrum after tumour resection. The mechanical bone model with shell thickness 1mm and infill structure 20% is the best option in terms of mimicking real bone. Furthermore, the newly designed prosthesis for sacral anchoring of the LUMiC cup showed promising results and could be considered as a improved alternative for the old LUMiC prosthesis stem. In future research cadaver tests should be performed to further validate the found results.","Prosthesis design; Bone models; FEM; sacrum","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(mentor); Wang, M. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","Truck platooning refers to coordinating a group of heavy-duty vehicles at a close inter-vehicle distance to reduce overall fuel consumption. This coordination between trucks is traditionally achieved by adjusting the schedule, velocity, and routines to increase the platooning chances, and thus improve the overall fuel efficiency. However, the data model built for the coordination problem is typically integer-constrained, making it generally hard to solve. On the other hand, the interaction among self-interested fleets that are operated by different companies is not well-studied. This thesis aims to build a distributed framework for multi-fleet truck platooning coordination to enable the coordination without a third-party service provider. The interaction among fleets is considered a non-cooperative finite game, for which we propose the best response search method, which essentially requires to solve a cooperative truck platooning optimization problem iteratively. We refer to the optimization problem as a best-response problem, which is formulated as a mixed-integer linear problem with relaxation skills. To achieve a feasible time complexity for the best-response subproblem, we propose a decentralized algorithm, distributing the computational load to connected automated vehicles within the fleet. The proposed method is examined under a real-world featured demand set to compare the performance in optimality and time complexity with previous studies. The result suggests that the decentralized algorithm delivers the optimal objective value in this case, while the best-response search does not deliver extra benefits as the dominating time costs in the cost functions eliminate the potential for improvement.","truck platooning; distributed optimization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Circuits and Systems","",""

(mentor); Eral, H.B. (mentor); Kamis, Y.E. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","A cylindrical column of fluid breaks into drops under the action of surface tension when other forces are relatively small. This phenomenon is called the capillary break-up. Since the introduction of the seminal theory of inertial-capillary jet instability by Rayleigh in the late 19th century, this phenomenon has seen a rich influx of academic research and industrial interests over the past few decades. The theory suggests that out of all the unstable wavelengths only the most unstable wavelength determines the drop size. But in reality, random background perturbations and non-linear pinch-off dynamics result in bi-modal drop size distribution. The two peaks in the bi-modal distribution correspond to the formation of main drops and satellite drops. The main drops are the desired product of the industry and the satellite drops are relatively smaller in size and are discarded by post-production processes like sieving. To reduce post-production processes and ensure repeatability, the industrial demand is to have a ""narrow uni-modal"" drop size distribution. Meaning, elimination of satellite drops and having uniform-sized main drops. Narrow distribution is achieved by employing finite-amplitude perturbation on the jet. This way the jet is not affected by the random background perturbation as the finite-amplitude perturbation dominates the break-up process. But this does not ensure satellite drop elimination. Uni-modality is achieved when the satellite drops merge with the main drops. Merging happens when the satellite and the main drop have different velocities and follow the same trajectory. The amplitude of the sinusoidal perturbation can be tuned to have this merging condition. The externally perturbed jet finds its application in a plethora of industrial processes such as powder production, combustion, micro-encapsulation, extreme ultraviolet rays (EUV) and, laser-plasma production (LPP), ink-jet printing, etc. The focus of this thesis is the production of crystalline fertilizer pellets from the capillary break-up of a spiralling jet of molten fertilizer. This process is called rotary prilling. Experimental studies in spiraling jets without external perturbation also shows bi-modal distribution of drops. The fine satellite drops produced in prilling process are a potential safety hazard as they can cause dust explosions which can be detrimental to air quality. Expensive filters and wet scrubbers are placed inside the prilling tower to remove the fine satellite drops. Hence uni-modal drop size distribution in prilling is highly beneficial for both economic and environmental reasons. As perturbed spiralling jets are not studied in detail in the existing literature, this thesis employs sinusoidal perturbations on spiraling water jets and aims to achieve uni-modal drop size distribution. While the straight jets have a nearly constant base flow, the spiraling jets have a base flow that accelerates due to the centrifugal and Coriolis forces in the downstream direction. As a result of mass conservation the accelerating base flow results in jet stretching in the downstream direction. The evolution of perturbations on such a stretched jet not only depends on surface tension and inertial forces of the local jet radius, but also on the wavelength that is excited initially. Hence the evolution of perturbations on straight jets with constant base flow is an eigen-value problem whereas, on a stretched jet it is an initial value problem. When the stretching rate is faster than the capillary growth rate damping of the surface perturbations will occur. For the process parameters investigated in this thesis, the capillary growth rate is faster resulting in negligible damping. The other effect of jet stretching is that the wavelengths are also stretched, that is the wavelength that is excited initially becomes longer in the downstream direction, thus the wavenumber decreases. The linear spatial instability theory for spiraling jets is experimentally validated in this thesis. For the set of non-dimensional numbers chosen in this thesis, uni-modal distribution of drops is achieved by tuning the frequency and amplitude of the sinusoidal perturbation. Uni-modality is observed when the non-dimensional wavenumber near break-up is approximately 0.7 and the amplitude is tuned accordingly. As the wavenumber decreases in downstream direction the wavenumber excited at the nozzle should be greater than 0.7.","break-up; fluid instabilities; spiralling jets; prilling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

By design they carry a strong relational inductive bias, which is a set of assumptions that makes the algorithm prioritize some solutions over another, independent of observed data. This makes the method especially interesting for applications to problems, that are naturally relation-centric, or in which local interactions between features are the main value of interest. The presented research case, aims to explore GNN potential in application to an Ocean Acoustics problem. Using the geometric ray-tracing algorithm, BELLHOP, a large number of underwater sound propagation scenarios was simulated. Each scenario is described by a limited set of parameters and a Sound Speed Profile function. The latter, acting as a guideline for estimating paths of rays travelling through a water column, has a critical impact on sound propagation mode. For the data-driven model to effectively capture the acoustic phenomena, requires a mean of representing interactions in very scarce feature space and especially with respect to the nonlinear function representation of the sound speed. First, the solution of the problem is approached with a traditional Machine Learning model, a decision-tree algorithm XGBoost. In effect, some important characteristics of the collected data sample are revealed. Moreover, by testing inference capacity of the database with a reliable algorithm, gives an estimate of the properties of the Sound Speed Profile that have the biggest impact on sound propagation. It is proven, that with carefully engineered features, that include a degree of added expert knowledge, a standard model can achieve good accuracy of prediction. Secondly, a Knowledge Graph is designed to represent the whole context of explicitly stated expert knowledge, using concepts from Hydroacoustics. They are encoded in a form of relational structure connecting actual features of the data into logical categories. In this representation it can be used by the Knowledge Graph Convolutional Network model designed for the problem. A range of tests performed on KGCN proves that using a Graph Neural Network can be feasible to solve the problem, however it also reveals a range of issues regarding model's capability to handle the complexity of problem statement.","graph neural networks; deep learning; machine learning; acoustics modeling; Knowledge Engineering","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

Currently operations on few qubits can be done, these arecommonly controlled with room temperature equipment. However as the number ofqubits becomes larger, scalable and integrated electronics is required toreduce the interconnect. This has promoted research in cryogenic electronicsthat can be located close to the qubits. This thesis presents a low power,scalable cryogenic DC biasing solution for the biasing of spin qubits. Thepresented DC-DAC has been implemented in the Intel 22-nm finFET process. Unlikeconventional DACs, the designed DC-DAC periodically generates all possiblevoltages in the full scale output voltage range, and drives a multiplexer thatconnects a sample and hold capacitors when the right bias voltage for theelectrode has been generated. The DAC is able to achieve a high resolution of 16bits with low noise performance by using an offset-compensated switched capacitorintegrator. By offering a DC input to the integrator the full scale outputvoltage range can be generated, while using the offset-compensated switchedcapacitor integrator allows reduction of offset and 1/f noise which are expectedto degrade at cryogenic temperatures. The DC-DAC is designed to meet a largevoltage output range of 3 V, which breaks compliance with the nominal 1.8 Vcompliance of the thick oxide transistors in the process. While it is possibleto put larger voltages over the transistors, it is currently unknown how thiswill affect the reliability and behavior of the thick oxide transistors.Therefore, a two-stage amplifier has been implemented where the second stageuses a supply of 3.6 V. The voltage compliance in the second stage isguaranteed through cascode transistors that are dynamically biased byadditional DACs.

These functions include providing stable land for the construction of buildings, roads, and the safe movement of people on land. On the waterside, quay walls are needed for containing surface water networks, flood management, and transportation functions. Quay walls are therefore an essential infrastructure in waterfront cities with river and canal networks such as Amsterdam, capital city of the Netherlands. The ongoing renovation of 200 kilometres of Amsterdam’s quay walls is an example of how age and other urban processes combine, creating a resource intensive challenge for cities to address. <br/>The renovation of Amsterdam’s quay walls will change the waterfront spaces that are so ubiquitous in the city and as the renovation continues, it is clear that there is an opportunity to also integrate new functions into the city’s waterfront spaces. This thesis proposes that the renovation of quay wall structures in Amsterdam can benefit from being combined with efforts to make urban waterfront spaces more adaptive to climate change. The processes underlying quay wall renovation and climate change are analysed using three spatial scales: the city, the neighbourhood, and the waterfront. These three scales reveal how the city’s waterfront spaces contain processes that take place in urban ecosystems and how “Nature-based Solutions” concepts of “Green Infrastructure” and “Ecosystem-based Adaptation” can be used to propose a solutions at the city and waterfront scale. <br/>The results of this are combined into a list of functional requirements that are used to propose ways to improve resilience in Amsterdam’s waterfront spaces. With over 90% of Amsterdam’s neighbourhoods containing quay wall waterfront spaces, implementing measures to increase climate resilience alongside the walls due for renovation has the potential to reach 448 neighbourhoods and is therefore a promising way to support existing climate adaptation programmes in the city. <br/>To demonstrate this, seven sites in the city are used to visualise how climate adaptation measures can be applied alongside the renovation of Amsterdam’s quay walls to increase climate resilience. These scenarios show how measures are adapted to all stages of the quay wall renovation process and can used in a range of urban waterfront spaces in the city. Furthermore, the results show that within the different renovation types, the basic functions of waterfront spaces can be retained while increasing the provision of ecosystem services. <br/>The strategy proposed in this thesis shows that at a minimum there is an opportunity to add 300 square kilometres of climate resilient spaces along the waterfronts of Amsterdam and in doing so increase and improve the social and ecological functions of the city now and in future. The results of this thesis show that the renovation of Amsterdam’s quay wall waterfront spaces can be a vehicle for implementing a city-wide climate adaptation programme that serves two long term objectives: making the city more resilient to climate change, and extending the service lifetime of walls already built in the city. <br","quay wall renovation; waterfront spaces; climate change resilience; Nature-based Solutions; urban ecosystems","en","master thesis","","","","","","Joint Master of Science in Metropolitan Analysis, Design and Engineering at Delft University of Technology and Wageningen University & Research.","","","","","","Metropolitan Analysis, Design and Engineering (MADE)","",""

Accurate forecasting models that can predict the power generation of these wind parks could help grid operators to keep the energy grid stable and reduce the re-dispatch of energy. Therefore the objective of this thesis was to find how to make an accurate power forecasting model for an offshore wind turbine park. To find the most suitable model, five different models were made. The first model tested was a physical model which calculates the power output through a deterministic approach. Four other models were made through the use of machine learning algorithms. A Gradient Boosting model, a support vector regressor, a feed-forward neural network, and a recurrent neural network were built to find out which one was most suitable. The next aspect looked at was what input data could be beneficial to make the power predictions, the numerical weather prediction model ICON-EU was chosen as input data. The support vector regressor algorithm showed the best results with a score of relative mean absolute error 14.35\%, which is the product of the mean absolute error divided by the difference between the minimum and maximum power production of the period in question. Since the performance of the model met the requirements it can be concluded that the forecasting model can be beneficial for the grid operator to reduce the amount of re-dispatched energy.","Machine Learning; Forecasting; Renewable Energy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-10-22","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

The dynamics of these networks are determined by single-frequency vibrations of the entire network called normal modes. We study the behavior of the nor- mal modes when the network is coupled to a thermodynamical heat bath by looking at the Lindblad Master Equation of the system. From this equation, we determine the rate at which the normal modes decay. Certain normal modes decay very slowly, and some do not decay at all. These normal modes are called quasi-noiseless and noiseless clusters respectively. We determine what happens to the noiseless clusters when the network pa- rameters are very slightly perturbed. We have found that two distinct types of noiseless clusters can be identified. The first type disappears with even the slightest perturbation, making it useless in practice. The second type instead be- comes quasi-noiseless, making it a viable candidate for applications. We show how to determine the degree to which these noiseless clusters become quasi- noiseless by looking at the other normal modes of the network. We also explain how a network of oscillators, including an optional heat bath, can be simulated with an optical setup as described in [3]. We suggest this setup can be used to verify our findings.","Quantum Mechanics; Harmonic oscillator; Complex Networks; Perturbation","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics | Applied Physics","",""

AF is a common arrhythmia occurring in millions of people every year, which could lead to blood clots, stroke or even heart failure. When AF is occurring, the P waves are often absent and RR intervals are often irregular. <br/><br/>This thesis proposes a new Poincaré plot based feature that exploits the distribution and position information of the plot. The Poincaré plot can visually analyze the nonlinear aspects of the heart rate dynamics both qualitatively and quantitatively. In this thesis, the Poincaré plot values are first quantized into small bins, which represent whether corresponding states are visited by the system or not, by setting ones or zeros. The bins are then given weights by the masks based on the probability of each state being visited by the system, and the relative position between the bins and the center of the plot. By calculating the element-wise multiplication and summation between the quantized Poincaré plot and the masks, the expected value of the matrix of the quantized Poincaré plot is computed, and the outliers in the plot are emphasized. Therefore, the proposed feature is assumed to have a higher value for the AF rhythms and a lower value for the Normal rhythm. <br/><br/>Instead of RR intervals, the Poincaré plot used in this thesis is also generated from the peak intervals in the autocorrelation function of both ECG and prediction error. The autocorrelation function aims to evaluate the self-similarity of the ECG signals and thus extracts the irregularity of the AF signals. <br/><br/>The dataset used in this thesis comes from the Physionet Challenge 2017, containing 5076 Normal recordings and 758 AF recordings. In total, 21 Poincaré plot based features are used to train the SVM and random forest models, which yields the F1 score of 0.80 and 0.85, respectively. When using features from the same intervals, RR intervals generate the highest F1 score of 0.77 and 0.81, followed by the peak intervals in the autocorrelation of prediction error with the F1 score of 0.74 and 0.78, followed by the peak intervals in the autocorrelation error of ECG with the F1 score of 0.63 and 0.68. Using the minimum redundancy maximum relevance algorithm, eleven features are selected based on their importance. Training the SVM and RF models with these features reaches the F1 score of 0.78 and 0.84, respectively.","Atrial Fibrillation; ECG; machine learning; Poincaré plot","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, the focus is on reusing waste heat. Heat pumps have the potential to drastically reduce energy requirements in the industry and in that way reduce emissions (Kiss and Infante Ferreira, 2017). van de Bor et al. (2015) compared different heat pump technologies and for industrial applications where there is a temperature glide of the heat source and/or sink compression-resorption heat pumps (CRHP) utilizing wet compression can achieve a higher coefficient of performance (COP) than alternative technologies. However, an isentropic efficiency of 70% for the compressor was assumed. If this limit is not reached there might be no advantage of wet compression compared to the traditionally used vapour compression heat pump (VCHP) as pointed out by several authors (Itard and Machielsen (1994), and Zaytsev (2003)). This study consists of experimental and modelling aspects. The compressor model is experimentally validated in this thesis. Deep knowledge about relevant topics like wet compression, compressor specifications, thermodynamic and geometrical models is developed before starting off with the experiments. The experiments are carried out for four rotational speeds: 10320 rpm, 12910 rpm, 14205 rpm and 15500 rpm, taking system constraints into account. Two approaches are considered here: the homogeneous approach and the heterogeneous approach. In the homogeneous approach, the concentration of ammonia is constant across the compressor and the process medium is treated as a single entity. In the heterogeneous approach, an assumption is made: only the vapour is compressed whereas the liquid exchanges heat with the vapour leading to partial evaporation. The model developed is updated. The experimental and model results are then validated and conclusions are drawn.","Wet compression; twin screw compressor; Experimental; Heat pump; compressor","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The relative humidity is one of the most crucial parameters in this management process, and it is controlled by passive design and active design approaches. In the renovation of museums, it is preferable to optimize the passive design and minimize the use of the active design that results in substantial energy consumption and high cost. The application of hygroscopic materials is one of the most effective passive design strategies, and some of them are already used on construction, such as wood and plaster. Nevertheless, silica gel, as a kind of hygroscopic materials with higher moisture capacity, is only used in the display case currently. So, the goal of this thesis is to study its application in the exhibition room and evaluate its effect on the stabilization of relative humidity, reduction in ventilation flow rate, and decrease in energy demand. The research is also combined with a case study, which is the renovation of the National Holocaust Museum in Amsterdam, and the aim of clients is to achieve climate class A1 in the exhibition room. Model 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0 with different complexity are created in Matlab/Simulink, which forms a schematic study of modeling. With the validation implemented in Design Builder, the accuracy of model 3.0 is proved, and it is determined as the main simulation tool. Model 3.0 consists of the thermal part, the hygric part, and the air handling unit part. In terms of simulation, it is based on the renovation plan of the National Holocaust Museum. A series of scenarios are defined at first, and the variables are the presence or absence of silica gel, the number of visitors, the ventilation flow rate, and the setpoint of humidity control. The simulation is done on two scales: one exhibition room and the whole building. With the amount of silica gel equal to 0.1% of the volume of the simulated object, the fluctuation of relative humidity reduces by a factor of 2 on the level of both room and building. Furthermore, 18.9% of energy for humidification and dehumidification can be saved. There is a possibility of decreasing the ventilation flow rate from 12 L/s per person to 6 L/s per person with almost 90% data meeting the A1 requirements at the same time.<br/>The study shows the silica gel is capable of stabilizing the relative humidity fluctuation significantly with the additional benefits of energy savings and reduction in ventilation flow rate. It is recommended to apply this concept in practice as a trial, and further research about its hygrothermal performance can be done in the future.","Relative Humidity; Passive Design; Hygroscopic materials; Climate in museums","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-09-21","","","","Civil Engineering | Building Engineering","",""

The disaster management in this state is response-centric and the 2018 floods indicated the need for a transition from a response-centric approach to a resilient flood risk management (FRM) approach. According to Vincent Ostrom, multi-level governance (MLG) is required for the effective provision of a public good or service and when considering FRM to be a public good/service, it can be inferred that MLG is required for the effective provision of FRM. Kochi, the largest urban agglomeration in Kerala and the location of interest for this research, has a MLG structure and yet does not have an effective resilient FRM system due to the governance issues within FRM. This research is aimed towards adding an additional layer to the existing researches within the domain linking MLG and FRM by taking a data-driven modelling perspective. In order to achieve this, the existing system is viewed as a complex adaptive system (CAS). The existing flood risk governance arrangements (FRGA) were modelled with the help of MAIA (Modelling Agent Systems based on Institutional Analysis) metamodel and Agent-Based Model (ABM) to derive insights about the characteristics of MLG relevant to the governance issues faced by the resilient FRM in Kochi. The results revealed that the existing power distribution among the State, District and Local authorities must be changed to ensure a better resilient FRM system. Furthermore, the results revealed that the network formation among local communities, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) must be encouraged. The research enabled to propose certain policy recommendations - the existing structure must acknowledge and incorporate the need for monitoring the implementation stage of the policies developed. The existing structure must acknowledge and accommodate the need for a better clarity on the responsibilities of decision-makers. The positive influence of networks is higher than the negative influence of the opportunistic behaviour shown by stakeholders. It is thus recommended to encourage network formation among community members, NGOs and government authorities. This encouragement can be provided through “triggering” events. This research looked into environmental damage which can be referred to as a negative “triggering” event. However, positive “triggering” events must be explored. With respect to the power allocation aspect of decentralization, the research gives three recommendations - when considering the definition of resilience to be the ability of system to absorb shocks and show the least fluctuations, the recommendation is to ensure a power distribution set up where the District authority has the highest power followed by the Local authority and State authority. When considering resilient FRM cycle to involve distinct phases, the recommendation is to adopt “policy switching” which is defined in this research as the approach of considering a combination of policies in terms of power distribution such that the requirement of each phase is addressed. In general, the District and Local authorities must be more involved in the decision-making within resilient FRM cycle.<br/><br","Multi-level governance; Flood risk management; Resilience","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","",""

Therefore in this research, the feasibility of different in-situ, data-driven probabilistic models is studied for prognostics on carbon fibre reinforced polymer (CFRP) specimens under VAF. Fatigue data with recorded acoustic emissions (AEs) is available from an earlier performed experimental campaign. Three models were selected: a statistical model to be used as a baseline comparison, a Gaussian process (GP) regression using cumulative AE energy, and a recurrent neural network (RNN) using all available AE features and load data. <br/>The models were compared for performance of remaining useful life (RUL) predictions on specimen under VAF loading for three different cases; when trained on CAF, VAF, and the combination of these two. Seven performance metrics were used to quantify their performance, as well as a qualitative comparison.<br/>The statistical method's performance varied per test specimen and can, therefore, only be used in practical applications when used very conservatively. It did not perform better in any of the three training cases as compared to the others. <br/>The GP regression was deemed not feasible due to high variability in its RUL predictions, high uncertainty due to the setting of a failure threshold as probability distribution based on other specimens, and high computational costs. The performance differed per test specimen as well. <br/>Finally, the performance of the RNN increased when trained on VAF data as compared to training on solely CAF data. It increased further when including both CAF and VAF in the training data. It is not yet feasible to be used in practice, due to variability in its predictions, and the inability to handle outliers. The latter is an issue for the other two models as well.<br/>The RNN outperformed the other two models when trained on VAF, and CAF and VAF data. Due to the definition of the failure threshold in the GP, the GP did not perform better than the statistical model. In the case of CAF training data, there was not a clear distinction between the performance of the statistical model and the RNN, except for one performance metric related to the precision of predictions. <br/>During this research, AE data from glass fibre reinforced polymer specimens tested on tension-tension fatigue under different load levels became available. In a case study, the feasibility of a RNN, trained on AE data, was analysed for prognostics on this data-set. Due to large differences in the life-times between the specimens in this data-set, this was not feasible. Extending this RNN with a feedforward neural network which uses load data as well as input, provided worse predictions.<br/>The main conclusion drawn in this thesis is that with the current implementation of the used models, in-situ, data-driven prognostics on composite specimens under VAF is not yet feasible.","prognostics; composites; fatigue; remaining useful life; probabilistic model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","European Wind Energy Masters (EWEM) | Rotor Design Track","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","Elastic neutral stability involves elastic deformation without stiffness or loads. It is a remarkable appearance, since the deformation of materials is normally associated with an increase of potential energy and a resulting opposing reaction force or moment. Neutrally stable mechanisms can be used to overcome unnecessary actuation which makes them an interesting topic for the aerospace industry, space exploration and the development of wearable assistive devices. This last group benefits from the use of spatially-curved thin-walled elastic structures, called compliant shell mechanisms. A literature review aims to give an overview of occurrences of elastic neutral stability and aims to find methods for creating neutrally stable compliant shell mechanisms. Single element mechanisms are herein further emphasized and a division between the application of pre-stress and the application of geometrical boundary conditions is proposed. So far, all neutrally stable (shell) mechanisms require either of the two conditions to be imposed. A new type of compliant shell structure, featuring a neutrally stable deformation mode without requiring one of the aforementioned conditions, is presented. The structure is composed of two initially flat compliant facets that are connected via a curved crease. It can be reconfigured into a second zero-energy state without apparent effort via propagation of a transition region. Both the structure’s local width and the local crease curvature turn out to be effective parameters for tuning the behavior regarding stability during transition. This structure shows potential for combining geometric simplicity with complex and highly tune-able behavior. However, its discontinuity obstructs physical realization. Therefore, a monolithic variant of this structure is investigated. The transition of a double-curved distributed compliant shell towards its second equilibrium configuration forms the basis of this investigation. A varying material thickness profile, described by an ideal set of design parameters, is obtained using an optimization procedure. Numerical analysis of the resulting optimized shell structure predicts a significant region of near-constant energy and associated near-zero loads within this unique deformation mode. Prototypes are manufactured using a 3D-printing process and demonstrate the validity of the modelled results by featuring a continuous equilibrium within a significant range of motion. These results lay the foundation for compliant beam elements with an internal statically balanced bending degree of freedom. Finally, a different deformation mode, involving crease actuation of the same type of structure, is examined. Curved creases are characterized by the coupled facet deformation upon actuation. The forces exerted by the facets can be used to oppose the effects of crease stiffness during actuation to achieve an overall stiffness decrease. An analytical approach, based on a combination of a pseudo-rigid-body model (PRBM) and plate theory, predicts the potential for constant-force actuation around its second stable, or ‘inverted’ state. The accuracy of the model is validated by numerical simulations. However, due to prototype inaccuracies, the experimental results do not feature the desired constant force behavior. Nevertheless, a stiffness decrease, or ‘softening’ is experienced, verifying the concept and marking a first step towards statically balanced curved creases.","Compliant Shell Mechanisms; Neutral stability; Static balance; Zero stiffness; Curved crease; Multi stability; Compliant mechanisms","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-09-21","","","","","Shell skeletons",""

The assessment is vital to determine whether a building must be strengthened or not. Different assessment approaches have been followed in recent years. First, the Non Linear Time-History analyses (NLTHA) were initially the only approach used for the seismic assessment. They are still overall the most accurate type of assessment, but they are also the most time-consuming one. Nowadays, NLPO analyses are more frequently used. This assessment procedure presents some limitations of application and may be less accurate for complex structures but it requires less computational time. The NLPO analyses can be performed by means of different tools, such as analyses based on the finite element method (FEM), equivalent frame (EF) or macro-element based analyses and, eventually, also analytical mechanism based analyses. The SLaMA method belongs to this last category: this method is an analytical approach already tested and validated in New Zealand for RC structures. <br/>This research aims to answer the following research question:<br/>• How is the in-plane behaviour of single-storey URM wall facades affected in simplified calculation methods compared to FEM when geometrical irregularities are present? <br/>The walls have been modelled in 2D with three different methods: FEM, EF and SLaMA. Material properties and modelling assumptions were maintained as consistent as possible within the three different methods. For researching the influence of the geometrical irregularities on the accuracy of EF and SLaMA when compared to FEM, the variation of geometrical irregularities, each quantified by an index value, have been studied. The influence of these indices on the accuracy of the calculation methods has been researched with a sensitivity analysis.<br/>The objective has been pursued by looking into single-floor URM façades, and the conclusions of this research can be applied to this typology of walls in Groningen made of solid clay brick masonry (pre 1945). The study focuses specifically on the base shear capacity of the walls.<br/>The differences observed when comparing the in-plane behaviour of a wall analysed with 3MURI and DIANA are not significantly affected by the presence of geometrical irregularities. The ratio between the base shear capacity computed with the two approaches and the predicted failure mechanisms remains consistent for all geometrical irregularities defined in this report. <br/>Similarly, the differences observed when comparing the in-plane behaviour of a wall analysed with SLaMA and DIANA are not largely affected by the presence of geometrical irregularities, since the base shear computed according to SLaMA is consistently lower than that obtained with DIANA. However, the base shear capacity obtained with SLaMA showed large variations between 0.34 and 0.75 with respect to DIANA when implementing geometrical irregularities. The largest variation is obtained when more than a single pier is considered, due to the inability of SLaMA to define the re-distribution of the vertical axial forces in the piers, nor correct boundary conditions at the top of the piers since the constraining action of the spandrel appear underestimate. This affected also the prediction of the failure modes, which differed for the two methods. However, in most of cases flexural failure mode was obtained, and the study should be extended to consider also geometries and loading conditions that cause also the shear failure of the walls.<br","SLaMa; Unreinforced masonry wall; Seismic assessment; Groningen; Earthquake","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the last years, Nevesbu has developed power plant optimization and sizing models to be able to select the best power plant configuration for a certain design.

Design support tools will be developed to support the designer during the design of the battery and auxiliary systems. The associated main research question is:<br/>How can a designer be supported, in an early design stage of an entirely lithium-ion battery powered submarine, when trying to determine the size, weight and energy consumption of systems that, among others, support the safe implementation of the new batteries?<br/>For this thesis, the safe implementation of lithium-ion batteries in an entirely battery powered submarine is studied. This type of battery has the risk of thermal runaway, which is a cascading process in which the battery releases all its stored energy, generating a lot heat and toxic gases, causing an increased risk on an explosion. Research has shown that a foam injection system could be used to mitigate the risk on thermal runaway and such system is also capable of extinguishing other types of fires inside the submarine, creating a safer working environment for the crew members. A foam injection system requires pressurized air, but the amount does not have a significant impact on the pressurized air storage.<br/>The increased endurance of the entirely lithium-ion battery powered submarine requires a reevaluation of the environmental control systems. The amount of chalkholders as CO2 absorbers and oxygen candles to generate oxygen increases due to the increased endurance. The additional weight and volume of these consumables are undesirable. A regenerative CO2 absorption system is introduced which is smaller and lighter, but requires a significant amount of the installed battery capacity, causing a reduction in endurance. <br/>To support a designer in an early design stage, several design support tools are developed: for the lithium-ion battery system, the foam injection system and the pressurized air system. These tools estimate main parameters such as weight, volume and heat load based on system designs and input parameters such as size and weight of components and the pressure hull radius and length. The tools show the designer the consequences of design decisions and provides important information about knock-on effects on other systems. Furthermore, the tools can be used to optimize the weight and volume of the battery system and foam injection system.<br/>A case study, based on a concept design of an entirely battery powered submarine showed the usability of the tools, quantified the effect of these systems on the overall concept design and the importance of the results in an early design stage. The number of crew members had to be reduced with seven to implement the regenerative CO2 absorber and LOX tank. The required pressurized air storage did not change due to the implementation of the foam injection system, but the overall submarine became safer. After changing the concept design, the weight and stability still satisfied all requirements. Taking the output of the tools into account during an early design stage can prevent large design modifications.","Submarine; Lithium-ion; Design support tool","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-09-21","","","","","",""

In these patients, a balanced hepatic blood flow distribution (HFD) towards both lungs is important, since a lack of “hepatic factor” has been associated with the formation of pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (PAVMs). With imaging modalities and computational fluid dynamics (CFD), the hepatic blood flow distribution can be studied. Recent CFD studies indirectly quantify HFD to both lungs by tracking ‘hepatic flow’ particles that are uniformly seeded in the Fontan tunnel and analyzing the distribution of these particles towards both lungs (conventional approach). However, this approach is based on the unvalidated assumption that there is a uniform distribution of hepatic blood flow in the Fontan tunnel. Aside from CFD modeling, previous clinical imaging studies showed that respiration has a tremendous impact on the hepatic blood flow in Fontan patients; however, these studies only used Doppler Ultrasound because the resolution of real-time phase-contrast magnetic imaging resonance (PC-MRI) is not yet good enough for direct hepatic flow quantification. Objectives: this study aimed to investigate the distribution of hepatic blood flow in the Fontan tunnel using CFD simulations. Another objective was to quantify the HFD towards both lungs using particle tracking directly from the inlets of the hepatic veins (novel approach) and compare these HFD results to the conventional approach. Furthermore, we performed an in-depth flow analysis and developed a new method to indirectly quantify the hepatic flow in the hepatic veins and the respiratory effects on it using real-time PC-MRI. Methods: Unsteady CFD modeling was used to assess the mixing of hepatic blood flow within the Fontan tunnel and the different HFD quantification methods. Therefore, we created three-dimensional reconstructions of the patient-derived Fontan anatomies based on MRI imaging that included the geometry of the hepatic veins in the computational fluid domain. We created two types of CFD models: 1. CFD models that only included the cardiac effects on blood flow, and 2. CFD models that considered both the cardiac and respiratory effects on blood flow. For the in-depth flow analysis using real-time PC-MRI, we first measured the blood flow in the Fontan tunnel, just above the entrance of the hepatic veins. Second, we derived the IVC blood flow below the hepatic veins. By subtracting these flows, we indirectly quantified the hepatic blood flow. Results and conclusion: The main findings were that hepatic blood flow was non-uniformly distributed within the Fontan tunnel and substantial differences in HFD between the conventional approach and novel approach were found in both types of CFD models that either ignored or considered respiration. Additionally, we showed that it was feasible to indirectly measure hepatic blood flow in Fontan patients while using real-time PC-MRI. These derived flow parameters extracted from real-time PC-MRI acquisitions confirmed what previously has been described that the hepatic blood flow in Fontan patients was heavily influenced by respiration.","Fontan patients; hepatic flow distribution; computational fluid dynamics; phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging; respiration","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-09-25","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","Background Inter- and intra patient morphological differences and absence of visual feedback make the placement of pedicle screws technically very demanding. As the spine is surrounded by neurovascular tissue, complications can have severe consequences, including paralysis. Guidance techniques are often very expensive and can overexpose surgeons to radiation, while there is a high variability in reported accuracy rates. Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) is a technique that allows for real-time tissue discrimination using an optical fiber which can e.g. be placed in a K-wire. It can detect difference in fat fraction between cortical and cancellous bone. Purpose This master thesis aims at investigating the capability of the DRS equipped K-wire to anticipate cortical breach by measuring a decrease in fat fraction, while being oscillated with a power hammering tool. Mechanical experiments investigate the amount of control over penetration depth during powered hammering insertion of a K-wire. Methods This thesis contains three experiments. Two focus on mechanical properties and one on optical properties. In the mechanical experiments, a 1.6 X 60 mm trocar tip K-wire without integrated optical fibers is used. In the first experiment, the K-wire and its oscillator are attached to a carriage on a horizontal guide rail. A mechanical bone phantom is placed at the end of the rail and is penetrated at varying oscillation frequencies (0 – 50 Hz). To move the carriage towards the bone phantom, masses are attached in discrete steps of 250 grams. Penetration depth is measured as insertion mass increases at constant oscillation frequency. In the second mechanical experiment, the same K-wire and K-wire oscillator are attached to a vertical linear stage. The K-wire penetrates the mechanical bone phantom at an oscillation frequency of 0 Hz or 35 Hz. Feed rates are varied (0.5 – 2.5 mm/s) and force on the bone phantom is continuously measured. For the optical experiment, a 1.6 X 300 mm fiber-optic K-wire is used with fiber distance equalling 1.22 mm. The K-wire with the oscillator are attached to a linear stage, and lowered at constant feed rate (0.5 mm/s) into an optical bone phantom. NIR spectra are acquired with a sampling frequency of 1.6 Hz. The effect of varying oscillation frequency (0 – 50 Hz) on measured fat fractions is quantified. Results The first mechanical experiment showed that for every oscillation frequency, penetration started at the first weight increment (0.1 kg). Without oscillations, phantom penetration initiated at a mass of 1.85 Kg. Regression analysis proved the penetration depth depends on the square root of applied axial force. In the mass range of 0 – 1.6 kg, 45 Hz led to the largest penetration depth (25 mm), with a relatively narrow 95% confidence interval (17 – 33 mm). The second mechanical experiment showed that measured mean force is lower when oscillating the K-wire (1.4 – 5.8 N vs. 9.5 – 12.3 N, p&lt;0.0001). Effect of feed rate on measured mean force is found not significant (p=0.15 for oscillating and p=0.61 for not oscillating). In the optical test, it was found that look ahead distance (LAD) increases with increasing oscillation frequency and amplitude. 50 Hz was the only frequency where the LAD was larger than its oscillation amplitude (1.22 mm and 0.5 mm, respectively). Conclusion Powered hammering of a K-wire requires a lower axial force for penetration and therefore allows for more control over penetration depth. From the tested range, this effect is most significant for oscillations with high frequencies, adequate forces and low amplitudes. It is possible to measure a decrease in fat fraction with a fiber-optic k-wire during penetration. High oscillation frequencies with low amplitudes allow for earliest anticipation. An adequate sized sampling frequency is required to allow for breach anticipation.","Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy; K-wire; Hammering; Pedicle; Optical probe","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2025-08-09","","","","Mechanical Engineering | BioMechanical Design","",""

The flow cases with different flow directions, including perpendicular and parallel to the shoreline directions, are selected by analyzing the New Europe Wind Atlas (NEWA) reanalysis data. After the cases are determined, high-resolution Weather Research and Forecasting Model (WRF) are performed under Yonsei University (YSU) Planetary Boundary Layer (PBL) scheme with ERA5 forcing data. The results are validated against the measurements from long-range wind scanner WindCube 400S. The validated data is analyzed for quantifying the orthogonal wind speed gradient over the study domain. As a result, the WRF, being a mesoscale modelling tool, it captures the orthogonal coastal wind speed gradients reasonably accurate within a 6km range compared with observations. Generally, WRF performs better in the alongshore flow cases, especially in the flow case 2018-10-08 when the stable condition occurs most frequently during the case. The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) for this case is 0.9m/s. However, the simulation results lost correlations with the observational data in some epochs when the fluctuation of wind speed occurs frequently. To be concrete, during flow case 2018-12-10 when the flow direction is around 330◦ advecting onshore, the WRF simulation can predict the fluctuations correct in magnitude but with shifting in time. For the coastal wind speed gradient, WRF predicts an absolute wind speed difference of 0.5 m/s daily averaged at the typical hub-height over a 1.4km distance for the alongshore flow cases. This difference can enlarge to 1m/s or higher while the low-level jets take place. The long-range wind scanning LiDAR provides a great possibility for observing the flow condition over a wind farm sized domain. Especially for the nearshore wind farm, it compensates for lack of observations on the water.","Wind energy; Mesoscale modelling; WRF; LiDAR; Coastal meteorology","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geoscience and Remote Sensing","",""

Yet as it is a form of nuclear energy it is controversial, and TMSR research is underfunded. In an effort to combat the controversy, a communication strategy for TMSR research is developed. This communication strategy is focussed on Dutch governmental organisations and political parties. The central question in this thesis is: How could TMSR be communicated by nuclear scientists, in order to improve the quality of discussion about TMSR at the relevant governmental organisations in the Netherlands? This was researched creating an overview of all relevant governmental organisations and interviewing several of them. Several factors that influence the attitude were hereby questioned, such as their values as an organisation, the frame by which they view nuclear energy in general, their approach to climate change, and their focus in energy policy. The relevant governmental organisations were identified as: ministry of economic affairs and climate, the social economic council, PBL Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency, and the political parties PvdA, VVD, D66, GL, and CDA. The consensus focussed Dutch political system, coupled with preference for a democratic approach to climate change, leads to a communication strategy based on negotiation. This negotiation must be done in a constructive way that acknowledges the needs of all attending parties. Thorium is explicitly not to be presented as a substitution to wind, solar, and the climate agreement, but as an addition to it. The creation of a Platform Energy Innovation as a discussion form is recommended. This platform is to facilitate discussion with all the above-mentioned organisations and several other supporting ones. The use of integrative negotiation has the potential to create the desired positive attitude without creating enemies and thereby secure a more stable future for TMSR research in the context of the Dutch energy transition.","TMSR; Communication; Framing; Science Communication; Thorium","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Sciences | Science Education and Communication","",""

Supply chains have become global, resulting in complex networks. With access to more information customers have access and have become more demanding on issues such as quality or sustainability. This has led to an increased interest among different companies in improving their traceability capabilities. As this requires companies to collect data across their entire supply chain, new technologies are being explored to make this change happen. One of these new technologies is blockchain. It rose to fame in the financial industry, but it is certainly a topic of current interest in supply chain management as well. Blockchain is a way to store and share data in an immutable ledger by decentralizing consensus, without a central record-keeping authority. This thesis is about the use of blockchain in supply chain traceability use cases and the comparison between blockchain-enabled traceability systems and traditional, centralized systems. Through literature review and a case study, which involved expert interviews and a survey, the main research questions from this thesis was answered: Which food supply chain traceability use cases are suitable for the application of blockchain-enabled systems? In order to answer the main question, the following sub-questions were addressed: • What drives the demand for traceability in food supply chains? • How do traceability systems based on blockchain compare to centralized systems? • Which criteria make a use case suitable for blockchain technology? • Which challenges exist for successful traceability system implementation? Based on the literature review, many studies suggests that food safety and quality are the primary drivers for an increased attention to traceability. However these suggestions were not found in this study. The needs for traceability at Heineken are mainly related to consumer demands and operational efficiency. Sustainable or local sourcing and decreasing costs related to mismatched information between Heineken and its suppliers or customers are dominant elements in the case study. In these situations, trust in data integrity is critical, which leads to certain managers looking to increase their traceability capabilities. Next, blockchain traceability systems were compared against traditional, centralized systems to answer research the second research question. Blockchain systems outperform centralized systems on Transparency and Integrity, Trust and Data Quality. Although technologically the two implementations are distinct, it was found that in its usage the two are not that different. It was never mentioned that blockchain systems could fulfill use cases that traditional systems could not handle with regards to supply chain traceability. This study found that blockchain use cases in supply chains should adhere to the following criteria: • The network is decentralized, meaning it involves multi-tier suppliers and/or distributors. • A high degree of proof of integrity is required. • There is a desire to obtain a single view / version of the state of the system. • Data sovereignty is essential. These criteria were found to be most applicable to Product Provenance, Sustainable Sourcing or Product Recall use cases. This research focused on understanding the differences between centralized and blockchain-based traceability systems. It has shown that blockchain can provide value to modern supply chains, and that in its usage, it is not radically different from centralized systems. The research presents criteria to decision makers, which provide support in judging the need for blockchain in their applications and reviews the areas where these needs could be and which challenges this presents.","Blockchain; Supply Chain; Traceability","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

(mentor); Abspoel, R. (graduation committee); Pasterkamp, S. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","A transition towards a circular economy is proposed by initiators like the Ellen MacArthur Foundation and architect Thomas Rau, in order to preserve and enhance natural capital, optimise resource yields, and minimise system risks. A circular economy seeks to ultimately decouple global economic development from the consumption of non-renewable resources, and will eventually result in an economy of services. In this transition, the construction sector plays a major role because it is responsible for 50% of the total resource use, 40% of demolition waste and 35% of CO2 emissions.<br/>The design of the façade system of a building which is offered as a service is essential. Assembly and disassembly of components of such a building occurs more often compared to traditional buildings, so the components and elements have to be designed so that they can facilitate this. This is especially true for the components of the façade which, due to the relatively short lifespan of a façade have to be flexible. To help incorporate circular principles in the design, a new method or tool is needed to help making design decisions and compare different alternatives. The main objective of this master thesis is to investigate the suitability of cold-formed steel components for circular façade design and to develop an assessment method to measure the degree of circularity of façades. Current assessment methods for determining the circularity of products either focus on the environmental impact or the flow of materials and protecting existing value, and not on the degree of circularity related to certain design options. Also, there is no method which focusses specifically on façades.<br/>A circular economy is restorative and regenerative, and aims to keep products, components, and materials at their highest utility and value at all times. This is achieved by controlling finite stocks and balancing renewable resource flows, circulating products, components, and materials, and designing out negative externalities. Circular design criteria are derived from the design strategies Design for Disassembly, Design for Adaptability and Modular Design. Currently used façade systems do have the potential to be used in a circular economy, provided that the design criteria for circular use are met.<br/>During the Case Study two designs are proposed: a traditional façade system which uses sandwich panels, and a façade system which uses façade panels designed based on a concept for roof panels developed by CFP Engineering (two alternatives). The aim of this case study is to investigate the suitability of the newly developed façade element for circular façade design. Additionally, it will serve as input for the assessment method which is illustrated later in this thesis, and set boundary conditions for the comparison of the life cycle costs and level of circularity.<br/>The most important design parameters to determine the circularity of a façade system are: the amount of materials used, the possibility for reassembly, the environmental impact of the system, the amount of reused and renewable materials, the availability of information and the amount of toxic materials. These parameters can be measured by calculating the Façade Circularity Indicator which, as the name suggests, cannot be considered an exact value. The Façade Circularity Indicator originates by combining an existing method (Material Circularity Indicator, developed by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation) with research on Design for Disassembly (Durmisevic, 2016). A prerequisite of this method is a Life Cycle Assessment calculation. The method can be used during the design phase to help making design decisions. Based on the Life Cycle Assessment, the environmental costs of the traditional façade system are 22% higher than the environmental costs of the case study alternatives, which makes the traditional façade system less suitable for use in a circular economy. When the mass of the components is used as a weight variable, the Façade Circularity Indicator of the traditional façade system is 9 to 12% lower than that of the case study alternatives. When environmental costs are used as a weight variable, the Façade Circularity Indicator of the traditional façade system is 54 to 60% lower than that of the case study alternatives. This also indicates that the traditional façade system less suitable for use in a circular economy.<br/>As an overall conclusion, it can be stated that cold-formed components are suitable for use in circular façade design because of their relatively low weight, low life cycle costs and the possibility to (dis)assemble them with relative ease. Furthermore, an indication of level of circularity of façades can be given based on a combination of the Material Circularity Indicator and Design for Disassembly factors.<br","Circular economy; Facade; Design for Disassembly; Assessment method","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-09-18","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

(mentor); Hendrikse, H. (mentor); Kleute, B.J. (mentor); Posthuma, Andrys (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC) has been heavily researched and developed over the last decade. However, no commercial scale for OTEC has been reached yet. OTEC is a clean and renewable source of energy which utilizes the seawater temperature difference between the upper and deep ocean layers to generate electricity. The heat exchangers and the cold water pipe design are considered to be the most challenging part. The cold water pipe is often stated to be the largest risk. The installation of the cold water pipe, the high investment costs of the cold water pipe and the large forces acting upon the cold water pipe are crucial factors for the future success of OTEC. In this thesis, a new kind of cold water pipe concept is introduced. The FLEX-hose concept consists of a thin sheet of nylon, supported by concrete rings and polyester cables. The total length of the foldable concept design is 1000 m. The nylon sheet is attached to the concrete rings and the cables are attached to the concrete rings. The cables run through the concrete rings and can be used during installation to lower the pipe. Deployment of the foldable pipe is expected to be relatively easy thereby lowering the installation costs. The Multi Criteria Analysis performed in this thesis show the FLEX-hose foldable concept to be attractive compared to a foldable spiral concept, a flexible composite concept, a rigid composite pipe and a HDPE pipe. However, the inclination angle occurring while pumping may not become significant, meaning above 7.5 degrees, since this will lead to lower energy efficiency. In addition, no current design is available on the market, meaning heavy research and development is needed for the foldable concept to succeed. Possible challenges for the FLEX-hose concept that have been established through this research include instability occurring due to buckling and a pressure drop becoming larger than 0.6 bar, thereby significantly reducing the net power of the OTEC plant. The maximum allowed angle of inclination of the sheet to stay below 0.6 bar is calculated to be 7.5 degrees at a flow speed of 2 m/s. During pumping a discharge of 20.000 kg/s is pumped through a thin walled pipe with a diameter of 3.5 m, which leads to a radial displacement of the nylon sheet. Collapse and too significant deformations of the thin walled sheet are prevented by applying 10 MN of pre-tension in the thin walled sheet. However, in order for the nylon sheet to stay in the linear elastic regime, the calculated wall thickness is 0.04 m, thereby making foldability questionable. A total of 200 concrete rings is present in the design, one every 5 m over the total length of 1000 m of the pipe. In addition, a large clump weight of 12 MN is needed at the bottom of the pipe. The total system weight of the foldable pipe with concrete rings is calculated to be 1840 mT, which could be installed by an offshore installation vessel. Finally, creep has also been established to be a challenge due to the life-time of 30 years for the cold water pipe. A synthetic plastic material such as nylon experiences relaxation of the material when stressed for a longer period of time, leading to large deformations.","Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion; Cold water pipe; Concept design; Flexible materials; Foldable concept","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-09-08","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

This is one of the main factors slowing down the transition to a more sustainable energy model. Long-term energy storage solutions are expected to alleviate these issues. The technologies currently available for this application (PHS and CAES) have a limited sustainable deployment potential which makes power-to-gas (P2G) technology, the only long-term strategy that can ensure decarbonization of the future global economy. Green hydrogen, a fundamental part of this concept, is the critical energy technology that can catalyze a paradigm shift in the existing energy markets. Yet, a widescale deployment of this technology is currently limited by several factors including low overall conversion efficiency, poor scalability and operational unreliability of fuel cell technology, high overall costs, absence of necessary infrastructure etc. This research project aims to propose a highly efficient combustion-based power cycle that can address several issues commonly associated with H2-based power generation application of the fuel-cell technology. Preliminary analysis identified that the s-CO2 Brayton cycle was the most suitable candidate for this application and thus, a thermodynamic analysis was conducted to determine the feasibility for this solution. This report documents the work completed in this project and proposes a novel oxy-combustion based green H2 fuelled s-CO2 power cycle concept as an alternative to the existing H2-based distributed power generation systems.","s-CO2 power cycle; energy transition; Zero-emission power cycle","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-09-01","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Equipped with a single instrument, namely, the Advanced Topographic Laser Altimeter System (ATLAS), ICESat-2 is able to acquire the along track vertical profiles of its laser footprints. While satellite based land classification has traditionally been performed with the use of multi-spectral data, which doesn't consider the vertical structure of the surface in question, the three-dimensional Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) product provided by ATLAS allows for the observation of the vertical structure of the illuminated surface. This provides information for the discrimination of surfaces that are only distinctly different from one another in this dimension, such as different types of vegetative species. Moreover, a greater understanding of how the signal interacts with different land types will benefit current and future users of the data. This study presents a first look at the potential of the base scientific data set provided by ATLAS, ""ATL03"", as a means of land type classification. Features extracted from ATL03 vertical profiles are used to classify multiple land types in The Netherlands, namely, ""Artificial Surfaces"", ""Agricultural Areas"", ""Forest and Semi-Natural Areas"", ""Wetlands"" and ""Water Bodies"". 100m grid cells were classified and validated with the CORINE land cover database. The overall classification accuracy was 71.2%, however, after a visual inspection of the misclassification errors it was found that that the actual accuracy was a minimum of 5.5% higher, that is, 76.7%. 51 features were created to discriminate between land classes and their importance per class was analysed. In general, simple statistical parameters, such as the standard deviation and percentile ranges worked well in distinguishing between classes. For the classes with a greater vertical range, such as ""Artificial Surfaces"", features that described the height and prominence of its scattering surfaces were most important. <br/><br/><br/><br","ICESat-2; LIDAR; CORINE; Laser; Earth observation; Land Type Classification; Random Forest","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Investments in these assets represent long-term commitments (e.g. 40 years ahead) from civil society, governmental institutions and capital investors. For the latter, traditional long-term investment models and their assumptions have been proven to be sufficiently accurate for decision making. Two core assumptions in these models are that electric demand profiles have recognizable patterns and that the generation side is able to fully follow them.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, with the introduction of the aforementioned technologies in the energy mix, these assumptions may become obsolete. For instance, renewable energy sources are intermittent, storage flattens peaks and valleys of demand curves and demand response introduces randomness in electric consumption. In comparison to long-term investments, however, these operations are much shorter in time (e.g. minutes, hours, days) and they are thus captured by the so-called power system models or short-term operations models.<br/><br/>In this context, this thesis evaluates possible effects that short-term operations may have on long-term investment decisions. To this end, this works first covers the models and computational tools typically used to define long-term investments and short-term operations in the electricity sector. Subsequently, a thorough research is conducted to explore possible methods that allow long-term investment models and short-term operations models to exchange relevant information to achieve a specific target. Among these methods, this work advocates for the bidirectional softlinking (BSL) due to the flexibility it offers to both models to be individually expanded and the ability to keep them apart, as independent entities. This thesis hence shows the potential of BSL, the challenges to adopt this mechanism and the guidelines for future research endeavors that could scale up the applicability of the method to actual power system planning with the inclusion of the aforesaid new technologies.","Power System Planning; Energy System Model; Energy System Optimization Model; Power System Model; Unit Commitment and Economic Dispatch Model; Model Coupling; Co-optimization; Unidirectional Softlinking; Bidirectional Softlinking","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-09-18","","","","Electrical Engineering","",""

It will further increase driven by The Trans-European Transport Network (TEN-T) and sustainability initiatives. As electricity consumption by railway networks increases, quantification of rail transport’s actual energy consumption is essential. Currently, railways’ energy consumption is measured at the supply side, i.e., the grid, which includes the network’s losses. This measurement does not give actual energy consumption. The European Union demanded an on-board energy measurement system for railways from 2019 onward.<br/><br/>The existing energy measurement systems designed for transmission and distribution networks are not suitable for railway applications due to the harsh conditions. The voltage and current signals are highly distorted and need a more sophisticated measurement system. The energy measurement can be divided into current measurement, voltage measurement, and energy calculation. This thesis project is part of the ongoing research in the current measurement for the on-board energy measurement system focusing on the DC current measurement.<br/><br/>The primary objective is to measure the energy dissipated during braking of the train. Therefore, we need to measure the current flowing through the braking rheostat during the braking of the train.

The test setup is modified to eliminate distortions and achieve the project requirement of 600 A current measurement. Intermediate tests are performed during the modification to analyze the components’ performance. Finally, the modified setup is tested up to load current of 600 A, and uncertainty calculation performed on the measurement results.","Chopped waveform; Braking rheostat; Current measurement; Zero-flux current sensor","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-09-14","","","","Electrical Engineering | Electrical Power Engineering","",""

Implementing a separation mechanism for security domains can prevent incorrect or malicious code to leak sensitive data from one security domain to another. This work presents a separation mechanism based on labeling security domains with a label in tagged memory, at word-level granularity, called color labeling.<br/><br/>Utilizing a tagged architecture based on the RISC-V architecture, color labeling assigns colors (denoting a security domain) to individual memory words, cache lines, registers and peripherals. Using a simple set of hardware enforced policies, data protection is ensured. Control flow integrity is maintained with the<br/>help of additional tag bits that denote code and valid jump addresses. New instructions have been added for functions that handle data residing in multiple security domains.<br/><br/>Software support is implemented in the Rust compiler. The compiler is enhanced with macros to support the coloring concept via source level annotations. Incorrect use of labels is reported during compilation. An external tool is used to generate tag information and generate a security report with information on<br/>variable coloring and special function use and construction. Using the external tool keeps the changes to the compiler minimal, thereby reducing the maintenance burden and the required trust in the compiler as well. The report can be used in a security audit.<br/><br/>The concept is implemented on an instruction set architecture simulator. The toolchain modifications and the concept itself have been tested on this simulator. Testing showed the concept can prevent cross-security domain information leaks under several common attack patterns. The overhead due to the execution of additional instructions in the executable code depends on the actual code. Tests with the typical target application OpenVPN-NL showed a less than 5% increase in instruction count for the most commonly called functions.<br/><br/>By designing or redesigning software specifically for color labeling, this overhead can possibly be further reduced. Further testing, specifically on an actual hardware implementation is recommended.<br/><br/>Due to timing constraints, the concept has not been implemented in hardware. However, the hardware performance costs are estimated to be negligible. The area requirements are substantial: implementing the concept in the RISC-V softcore requires double the external memory capacity and FPGA resource utilization is estimated to require 14% more ALMs and 74% more internal memory blocks.","coloring; labeling; tagged memory; security domain separation; hardware enforced; Rust; compiler; toolchain; RISC-V; ISA simulator; security","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

With the expected rise in global population to ten billion eating people by 2050, the environmental outcomes of food systems can be devastating. This conclusion fuels the necessity for society to modify these local consumption and production patterns that are currently unsustainable (UNEP, 2016): the preservation of ecosystems and the future wellbeing of the human population are all centrally dependent on a structural transformation of the food system to a sustainable and resilient state. The client organization for this project is HelloFresh Benelux, the market leader in the mealbox industry in the Netherlands. HelloFresh intends to contribute to the food systems’ sustainability. Therefore this thesis aims to discover how HelloFresh can design for the sustainable development of the Dutch food industry. This thesis adopts a systemic design approach to capture the complexity of food systems. The approach lies in the middle of a field spanning from design practice to systems practice. It helps designers to deal with complex problems by engaging with the value conflicts between stakeholders to develop a broader and more holistic frame of reference. Knowledge was primarily obtained through interviews with actors along the value chain, with experts on the topic and with client employees. Three critical strategies for the sustainable development of Western food systems are established: improving production, reducing food waste and changing diets. Issues and obstacles in the current system were identified, clustered and connected to reveal three key factors accounting for the systems’ inertia. These are: i) Retailers lack the need for sustainability and for efforts outside of their operations, ii) Consumption patterns are unsustainable and the demand for sustainable products is generally low, and iii) the lack of a shared vision on sustainability along the supply chain. It was concluded that the final solution should establish interactions that stimulate sustainable choices in the digital choice environment, and that it should foster interactions favouring a chain approach and cooperation. This led to the final solution, ‘Together Towards Better’, a solution-oriented strategy for HelloFresh to work towards a greener value chain. Five symbols representing the diversity of food sustainability are the cornerstone of the strategy. The symbols are designed for simplicity and to radiate positivity. They allow for telling the story behind ingredients and celebrating independent sustainability achievements. The first phase of the strategy focuses on facilitating and stimulating sustainable consumption behaviour by the integration of the symbols in digital choice environments. The sustainability tags serve as focal points for customers, creating a hierarchy between ingredients and recipes, functioning as feedback mechanisms and rewarding people for making the green choice. Gamification and personal feedback are employed to stimulate customers' sustainable actions. The second phase aims to build long-term and sustainable relationships along the value chain to assist actors in their sustainability journey. The tags can convey the objectives of the strategy to supply chain partners and to communicate shared achievements to consumers. The final solution is supported by a communication strategy and an implementation roadmap. Finally, validation of the concept took place with consumers, an expert and a supplier to evaluate its desirability, feasibility and impact. The validation study led to recommendations for the implementation of the concept. The contributions of this thesis have the aim to demonstrate how mealboxes can contribute to the sustainability transition of the Dutch food industry.","Systemic Design; Sustainability; Food industry; Mealbox; HelloFresh","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","Master Thesis",""

Cities need to be able to deal with the adverse effects due to more frequent and heavier rainfall. This implies the need for sustainable urban drainage systems (SUDS) that can deal with these challenges. SUDS can be seen as designs that can improve both, the quantitative as well as qualitative characteristics of stormwater. The study area in the south of Amsterdam will be equipped with a SUDS, namely a SediSubstrator L by Fränkische Rohrwerke. The objective is to remove particles from stormwater discharge to prevent clogging of the infiltration facility (AquaBASE) installed in sequence. Additionally, it can remove harmful pollutants which are adsorbed to the fine particles. <br/>This research aims to investigate the characteristics of the sediments in stormwater in theory and develop an appropriate sampling strategy to monitor the relevant parameters in the field. The long-term objective hereby is to determine the removal efficiency of the SediSubstrator L using a finite amount of parameters. To do so, a threefold approach composed by a detailed literature review, stormwater sediment sampling as well as a model simulation was used. <br/>Based on the identified parameters to be assessed, a specific monitoring and sampling setup is proposed to determine the removal efficiency of stormwater sediments in the study area. Along with the efficiency, the volume of sediments that are caught by the facility can be approximated. The latter needs to be removed once the entire storage volume of the sedimentation facility is filled. It is recommended that Waternet uses measured stormwater data to improve the model, while monitoring the efficiency under field conditions. Once the results of the model and the actual field measurements match, the model can be used to simulate the sediment removal for long time series. In this way the cleaning intervals can be predicted, while avoiding expensive long-term measurements to do so. <br","stormwater treatment; SUDS; SediSubstrator; sedimentation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Water Management | Urban Water Engineering","",""

Since they are intermittent in nature, they cannot serve the energy demand as stand alone sources without the help of storage technologies or stable energy sources. As the RES, especially the Photo Voltaic generation units are often connected in the distribution system, their intermittent nature may result in a sudden rise or fall in overall generation. Hence the voltage has to be kept within limits to prevent the failure of the system. Storage technologies plays an important role in keeping the voltage levels under control. From the consumer perspective, the usage of electric vehicles is steadily increasing and most of the vehicles are connected to public charging stations to charge the vehicle battery. Hence there is an interaction between the EVs and distribution grids, which is utilized as a storage option here. In this research, the voltage changes due to the penetration of renewable energy sources in the distribution system is regulated by using the electric vehicles as a storage option. This thesis tries to give an understanding on the strategy applied towards regulation of voltage in the distribution system using electric vehicles. The strategy will serve as a platform for regulating voltage using electric vehicles and it can be adapted to any such distribution network. This strategy takes into account the size and capacity of the battery, battery state of charge and the availability of electric vehicles for a given day. Consensus algorithm serves as the communication platform for information interchange between the electric vehicles connected in the network. Average consensus algorithm estimates the average state of charge of the electric vehicles connected in the distributed network and that has been used to ensure equitable contribution of power among the electric vehicles. Markov model is used to simulate the travel pattern of the electric vehicles. This provides a more realistic and accurate pattern of travel. Markov model is implemented with and without considering time of occurrence and the results shows that the pattern is more accurate when time is considered as a parameter. Considering the generated travel pattern, voltage level of the buses in the network and the output from the consensus algorithm, the voltage has been regulated. The Electric vehicles are used for regulating the voltage when the voltage level is beyond the tolerance limits, and during other times, the electric vehicles charge their batteries. This is executed by controlling the charging and discharging cycles of the electric vehicles. The results are discussed based on different cases and the advantages and limitations of each case is explained in detail. The simulation is not robust since the availability of electric vehicles is uncertain. To make it more robust, monte carlo simulations are used. The probability of occurrence of several events has been estimated using monte carlo simulations and through the results, the availability is predicted to a certain extent. Different cases are implemented and analysed and the results shows that the availability depends on the bus, the location of the bus and the travel behaviour of the electric vehicles. Each case is discussed separately and the degree of uncertainty is reduced at the end.","Voltage regulation; Distribution Network; Electric Vehicles; Uncertainty Analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

The chromate conversion coatings (CCCs) have been used as the efficient anti-corrosion protection for aluminium alloys.

This research first investigated the effect of magnetite on the treatment of synthetic <i>p</i>-cresol (a relative abundant compound in phenolic wastewater) wastewater in a lab-scale AnMBR. Magnetite increased the reactor stability, permitted higher <i>p</i>-cresol loading rate in the AnMBR, and reduced the fouling potential of supernatant of the mixed liquor. Activities of dehydrogenase and F420 were significantly increased and this may have contributed to the enhanced reactor performance. Magnetite supplement did not have a substantial influence on the soluble microbial products (SMPs) concentration compared to the stage without magnetite whereas extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) concentration significantly increased with magnetite supplement. Reduced fouling potential of the supernatant of the mixed liquor may be attributed to the decrease of protein content in SMPs in the stage with magnetite supplement. Second, the effect of magnetite on the methanogenic degradation pathway of <i>p</i>-cresol was studied, in which the rate limiting step was the conversion of intermediate compound benzoate. Moreover, magnetite increased the maximum substrate degradation rate of all the chosen intermediates as well as the accumulative methane production. Batch test using inoculum adapted to magnetite failed to yield faster substrate degradation rate in comparison with the batch test using non-adapted inoculum. This may be ascribed to the loss of biomass when magnetite was removed from the collected sludge because magnetite and DIET-based microorganisms were closely associated and shaking manually was not sufficient for microorganisms to detach from the magnetite. Since magnetite nanoparticles enhanced reactor performance and stability as well as reduced fouling potential of the supernatant of the mixed liquor, potential commercial application of magnetite nanoparticles in AnMBR may permit shorter hydraulic retention time (HRT) and higher flux, which can lead to higher treatment capacity and lower operational costs. Further research should investigate the effect of potential magnetite corrosion on the reactor performance, the effect of magnetite on fouling potential of the mixed liquor, and likely loss of biomass in case of magnetite removal and methods to remove magnetite with as little loss of biomass as possible.","AnMBR; magnetite nanoparticles; DIET; p-cresol","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

There are multiple reasons for this, but the main one is the need to transition to a low carbon energy system to tackle climate change and decrease our dependency on non-renewable energy sources. Next to this consumers become active consumers (prosumers) and increasingly take control over their local (energy) situation. As a result this transition creates a multitude of challenges and demands a re-design of the energy system. Stedin, the Netherlands 3rd largest Distribution System Operator (DSO), set out to find a solution to the challenges posed by the energy transition. The concept they came up with was a design for a Layered Energy System (LES). By running two pilots LES is fully developed and almost ready to be made available for the larger public in the form of a re-branding of LES to Lokaal Energy Flexibel (LEF). However, how LEF should be made available remains unknown. So in order for LEF to be launched to a larger public a new service needs to be designed. A service that sets out to communicate the information which is needed to start your own Local Energy Community (LEC) and collaboratively with Stedin and a service provider of choice set up a LEC. Designing this service is the task set out to solve in this project. One other task is determining what the role of Stedin should be in this process of setting up a LEC. The dilemma is Stedin wants to facilitate LECs and the market but on the other hand should not in turn take over responsibilities of the market. The methodology used to solve the aforementioned problem is service design. A concept service design is made that sets out to help communities explore how to set up a LEC. The design is centered around a community dashboard that shows the current energy situation within a community. All the data found in this dashboard can then also be used in a community configurator to create an ideal design for the local situation and community vision. This design is then communicated to Stedin in the form of a project sketch. Stedin can give feedback or a ‘go’ on the project sketch. This ends the explore phase, after which a LEC can turn to the market for materializing the design. The concept service is communicated with a future service scenario and a service blueprint. Out of this service blueprint the LEF landing page and the community configurator are prototyped and tested with potential users. After testing the solution and direction proved to be in the right direction. However a ‘dumb’ configurator as tested was found challenging for the typical community leader. This result vouches for a more data driven and automated configurator as proposed in the future service scenario. The thesis is concluded with a roadmap for implementation and advice on how to create an MVP as the first step towards implementing the service design.","Collaboration; prosumers; Stedin; Local Energy Communities; Layered Energy System; Energy transition; Service Design; Communication; Energy Community Formation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

From a single full-scale prototype off the Norwegian coast in 2009, now to double digit rated capacity floating wind turbines to be commissioned by the end of 2022 and tens of gigawatts of installed capacity expected to be switched-on globally over the next decades. This can lead to fundamental changes in related industries and society, and the floating wind turbine is therefore considered a breakthrough technology. However, several designs of floating wind turbines have been invented, introduced and to some extent diffused in the floating wind market, while a dominant design has yet to emerge. The pattern of development and diffusion by Ortt &amp; Schoormans (2004) is a widely adopted procedure that reveals how such a breakthrough technology may surpass consecutive phases that are characterized by distinct milestones prior to large-sale diffusion. This development and diffusion process may take on a lengthy and chaotic character in which large-scale diffusion of the breakthrough technology is blocked by barriers. Therefore, Ortt &amp; Kamp (2019) developed a theoretical framework of core and influencing factors that serve as a prerequisite for large-scale diffusion of breakthrough technologies. To overcome or circumvent these barriers, the innovating company may adopt a niche strategy during the innovation phase to commercialize the technology, or to reintroduce the technology to the market after changing the physical aspects or the business model in order to better align the technology to the market during the market adaptation phase (Ortt, Langley, &amp; Nico, 2013). Furthermore, niche strategies may be adopted to increase the knowledge and resources within the company, or to influence the broader technological innovation system by changing the behavior, opinion or perception of Suppliers, Customers or Institutions to gradually create or shape the niche market (Schulz, 2019). Thereby, the companies that developed the alternative designs of a floating wind turbine are well-guided in assessing the market and selecting a niche strategy accordingly. IHC IQIP is a supplier of equipment for the installation of reliable foundations and moorings in the offshore wind market and hence offers a unique set of knowledge, skills and competences to developed Complementary Products and Services – one of the core factors for large-scale diffusion - for the emerging floating wind market. Nevertheless, the perspective of a supplier of Complementary Products and Services and its strategic impact on the development and diffusion process has been largely neglected in the management and innovation literature. The theoretical objective of this thesis was therefore to create a better understanding about the mechanisms that drive market formation in a niche market where alternative designs of a breakthrough technology compete to achieve large-scale diffusion from the perspective of a so-called Complementor. In turn, the managerial objective was to develop a theoretical framework that aids managers in selecting a niche strategy to develop and diffuse Complementary Products and Services that are tailored to one or more designs in such a niche market.","Pattern of development and diffusion; large-scale diffusion; framework of core and influencing factors; niche strategies; floating wind","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2025-09-17","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

Due to the inconsistent supply of such energy, a more efficient energy storage method is in need. Among many options, lithium-ion battery stands out due to its lightweight, high energy density, and high discharge potential. Currently, the most commonly adapted anode materials in lithium-ion batteries are carbon-based, most often graphite. It shows a layered structure that can be used to store Li+ ions based on the intercalation and de-intercalation mechanism. Although this material is stable and successfully commercialized, due to its low specific capacity efforts have been put into searching other potential anode materials. Potential materials are aluminum, tin, and silicon. Among them, silicon shows an ultra-high (theoretical) specific capacity that is 12 times higher than that of carbon. However, the volume taken up by the material increases by about 300% upon lithiation and de-lithiation. Hence, silicon anodes show a poor capacity retention ability comparing to its graphite counterpart. In this work, by using a silicon alloy, we aim to alleviate the effects of volume expansion of Si by introducing alloying species and by providing a porous structure. In this work it is demonstrated that this material structure is able to absorb the expansion, while still rendering a high specific capacity. Silicon alloy samples over a wide range of alloy concentration and porosity were synthesized using PECVD. Samples were assembled into pouch-cells and coin-cells and tests were performed to compare the battery performance of each sample. A FEM model was built, enabling more investigation opportunities. Together with the experiments, they revealed how alloy concentration and porosity influence the specific capacity and cycling ability of the anode.","Silicon alloy anode; Li-ion battery","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-09-16","","","","Materials Science and Engineering","",""

This paper explores the application of different fuel cell types (LT-PEMFC, HT-PEMFC and SOFC) in combination with different fuels (LH2, LNG,MeOH and NH3) in expedition cruise ships. An impact model is developed for the first design phase. The goal of this paper is to evaluate the impact of the combination of fuel cell system implementation and operational profile on expedition cruise vessels. Impact is expressed in ship size, capital cost, operational cost and emissions. The model takes into account: fuel storage, on-board fuel processing, fuel cell system characteristics, balance of plant components, fuel cost over operational lifetime and all onboard emissions. In the research, seven different fuel cell systems and three different hybridization strategies are considered. For the six best performing combinations of fuel cell system and hybridization strategy, the range, endurance and capacity requirements are systematically varied to determine whether the best performing option depends on these requirements. Finally, hybrid option 2 (using diesel generators to support during long transits) combined with a methanol fueled LT-PEMFC system results in the lowest newbuild price. This option does comply with emission regulations and CO2 goals for 2030. Hybrid option 2 combined with an LNG fueled LT-PEMFC system results in the lowest total cost (newbuild price and fuel cost). This option does comply with emission regulations, but does not meet CO2 goals for 2030. When it is desired to reach this CO2 target, hybrid option 2 with methanol fueled LT-PEMFC is also recommended from a total cost perspective.","Fuel cell; Expedition cuise ship; Ship design; Sustainability","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-09-17","","","","Marine Technology","",""

The LECs were produced based on the semiconducting polymer MEH-PPV, ZnO and CdSe/CdS/ZnS quantum dots. Furthermore, drift-diffusion simulations were performed to discover general trends in LECs. MEH-PPV devices performed as expected. ZnO QDs were found to be unsuitable for LECs due to their high intrinsic conductivity and low luminescence efficiency, while CdSe/CdS/ZnS QDs were identified as promising candidates. Results from the drift-diffusion simulations suggested that unlike in LEDs, the type of electrode material has little effect on device operation. Charge carrier mobility was identified as the limiting parameter for luminescence intensity. It is thus suggested that improving carrier mobility in QD films is the most important step towards QD-based LECs.","Light-emitting electrochemical cells; Colloidal quantum dots; Numerical modelling; CdSe; Electrochemical doping","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Materials Science and Engineering","",""

From March 2020, strict measures were taken by the government to prevent the spread of the virus; The Dutch population was under quarantine. This caused many changes in the everyday life of families. Using an exploratory process with six families, research was conducted over six months into what families could learn from this quarantine time. Remote Context Mapping, a Corona-proof co-creation session, Zoom-interviews and iterative prototype tests ultimately led to a design which incorporates the lesson learned. The exploration with the families showed the quarantine made the worlds of the families smaller. As the world became smaller, families began to appreciate other things; the little things in life. This was because there were fewer possibilities, creating new standards. Comparing yourself to others became harder, so they were more satisfied with their own lives. Finally, less pressure was experienced from others and themselves, therefore the families were living more in the moment. As the worlds of the families were experienced as smaller, the relation between parent and child changed. The lesson families have learned from the Corona times is that we must continue to give valuable meaning to the moments of being physically together at home. The defined design goal from the conducted exploratory research is: To make family members aware of the moments of togetherness and spend those moments in a valuable way, even if rhythms and routines are less synchronized and when living less in the moment. Based on the interviews and prototype tests the PIN Light is designed. The PIN Light is designed to consciously experience the moments of togetherness and to use these moments in a valuable way, despite the busy lives which will return. It helps families to stay abreast of each other’s lives, it allows families to appreciate the moments together and it connects family members by creating a “moment of light”. The PIN Light can be implemented within a broader context as well. It could be implemented in social work, within family homes and it could help to connect blended families. Therefore the learned lesson from daily routines during Corona times adds value in an even broader context than traditional families only.","Corona times; Daily family routines; Exploratory research; Remote context mapping; User Centered Design; COVID-19","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

The aim of this graduation project is to provide interested designers with guidelines on the cultivation and perpetuation of bioluminescent organisms when integrated into a consumer product. The first step is to gather information on two bioluminescent organisms, P. fusiformis and P. phosphoreum, in an extensive literature research. This results in design insights which compare both organisms on the challenges and potential when integrated in a consumer product. The second step continues with the most promising organism, P. phosphoreum. This organism is used within experiments further researching the bioluminescent and perpetuation characteristics, relating them to usage and storage possibilities. The experiment results are translated into design insights. The third step is to combine the design insights from both the literature research and the conducted experiments into guidelines which will help and inspire interested designers in the creation of products with integrated bioluminescent organisms. The guidelines are applied within a future scenario which will act as an example on how P. phosphoreum could be integrated within a design.","Bioluminescence; Growing Design; Material Driven Design; Emerging Materials","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

Under drying conditions, desiccation cracks can form in clay soil, which is often used as dyke cover and in some cases also for the core of the dyke. These desiccation cracks have a potential impact on the stability of dykes. The main objective of this study is to gain a better insight into the potential influence of desiccation cracks on the macro-stability of Dutch river dykes. With the help of PLAXIS 2D software, a numerical model is used to study the hydraulic response and stability of a dyke with desiccation cracks. It is chosen to simulate the effect of cracks by adjusting soil parameters of the cracked layer. Steady-state scenarios as well as time-dependent scenarios, where high water events are simulated, are studied. The influence of precipitation is also taken into account. For the steady-state case, a maximum decrease of the factor of safety of 5.6% is found. In the time-dependent scenarios, the factor of safety decreases up to 10.8% if a cracked zone with a depth of 2 meters is present. The magnitude of this decrease is mainly depending on the hydraulic conditions and the crack parameters chosen to simulate the effect of cracks. Both inner and outers slope failure is observed. The largest difference between the factor of safety of the cracked and the uncracked dyke occurs when the dyke fails due to outer slope instability as the factor of safety decreased most in the case of a rapid drawdown. From these results it follows that cracks can have a negative impact on the macro-stability of a dyke, but the difference is not unambiguous. Precaution is advised if significant cracks develop at dykes, but smaller cracks are not likely to lead to failure immediately.","Desiccation cracks; Dyke stability; Droughts; Plaxis 2D; Safety Assessment","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geo-Engineering","",""

Currently, to take goal priorities into account a dynamic asset allocation is created. We focus on incorporating goal priorities by ensuring goal cash flows reflect investors' preferences, no matter the asset allocation. No money should be spent on less important goals if it jeopardises achieving more important goals. With such a goal cash flow strategy, an investor gains valuable insight into the feasibility of her goals. We build such a framework in two ways. First, we use utility theory. With utility theory, we can quantify an investor's satisfaction with the goal cash flows. For that purpose, we create a total utility function that takes into account goal priorities. Then, we optimise over the goal cash flows such that it results in the highest expected total utility. Second, we use conditional expectations. With conditional expectations, we determine the relationship between earlier wealth and future goal achievability. Therefore, we create a framework with a spending rule based on the conditional expectation. We implement conditional goal cash flows. With conditional cash flows, we create a goal based planning framework that takes into account goal priorities for multi-goal investors.","Goal based planning; Goal priorities; Utility theory; Conditional expectations","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics","",""

To power these machines however, the position of the rotor magnets is required to be able to inject currents which generate the desired torque and speed. This magnet position is traditionally obtained by the use of an expensive shaft encoder which introduces an extra failure mode to the drive set-up. In this thesis, the process of designing a control scheme which uses position observers instead of an encoder is worked out from theory till lab verification. First, the basic magnetic and electromechanical working principles of the used machines are described. This is followed by building the models for these machines and verifying these in the lab. These models will form the backbone of the position estimation algorithm. Moving on, the principles of Field Oriented Control and Space Vector Pulse Width Modulation are covered together with the design of the speed and current controllers. Using this control scheme combined with the machine models, a controller without an encoder is designed. The design of this sensorless controller is carried out for both back-EMF observers as for a reduced-order flux-observer. Algebraic derivations for both the observers themselves and for the phase locked loops used for obtaining the estimated speed are provided; these derivations are then used for tuning the performance of these observers. This performance is verified by intensive simulation and lab-testing. The results of the different observers are compared, analyzed and used to improve the controller. The result is a sensorless control scheme which can drive the permanent magnet machine from 0 to 39 rpm in open-loop and from 39 to 6000 rpm in closed-loop mode.","Permanent Magnet Machine; Sensorless; Control; observer; back-EMF; Flux","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","Body-powered prosthetic hands used by below-elbow amputees function in two phases. There is the opening and closing motion of the hand (Motion Phase) and the phase when the hand is in contact with an object, and the fingers apply a pinching force (Pinching Phase). Each phase requires a different set of dynamics to properly function. In the Motion Phase, a small amount of applied force must result in a large translation of the fingers, in the Pinching Phase a small amount of force must result in a large pinching force and a small translation. The problem is that body-powered prostheses have fast motion given a low force input during the motion phase but cannot achieve a high pinching force with a low force input during the pinching phase. The goal of the project is to design a mechanism that passively switches between the dynamics of the motion phase and pinching phase for body-powered active closing hook prostheses. In the motion phase a small force input must result in a large output translation and in the pinching phase a small force input must result in a larger force output and a small output translation. In the motion phase a minimum cable force of 10 N is required and in the pinching phase a pinching force of 30 N must be achieved with an input force of 40 N or less The prototype consists of a hydraulic telemanipulation system with a master (shoulder), operated by the shoulder harness, and slave (hand), operates the hand prosthesis, cylinder connected to each other via a booster mechanism. The booster is inactive in the motion phase and active in the pinching phase. The results show that in the motion phase an input force of 5 N can perform the full translation of the prosthesis. If the hand is met with resistance the input 5 N input can increase up to 24 N until the pinching phase activates. The translation in the pinching phase is too small to observe any change. The pinching phase activates at a pinching force of 12 N and an input force of 24 N. In the pinching phase the pinching force reaches 35 N with an input force of 32 N input force. The dynamics of the phases show to be unaffected by different object stiffnesses and lowering the activation force of the pinching phase only shifts the pinching phase along the motion phase. In conclusion the 5 N minimum input force is too low. An input force below 10 N result in inferior control for the user. In the pinching phase an input force of 32 N can reach a pinching force of 35 N, which meets the set requirements of 30 N pinching force with an input force of 40 N or less. A larger translation is required in the pinching phase to compare the translation dynamics between the motion and pinching phase. More research is required to properly define the desired activation force, how much translation is required in the pinching phase, and to find optimal spring properties for the return springs in the hydraulic cylinders.","Prosthetics; upper limb; body-powered","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

Stimulated by their sustainable image and due to large investments in the charging infrastructure, the electric automobile has gained popularity in the field of research. Many papers are written on a variety of power converters inside the cars to interface between batteries, chargers and motors. Usually, these converters are made as universal as possible, in order to suit the needs of many different vehicles. As a result, they are capable of operating at wide voltage and power ranges, often at the cost of weight or efficiency. The Dutch electric car startup Lightyear aims at a completely different strategy. Their car with integrated solar panels is designed with one goal: increasing efficiency. For that reason, all components have been reconsidered and, if sufficient gains in efficiency can be achieved, completely redesigned. One of these components is an isolated bidirectional DC-DC converter that ensures power transfer from the solar panels to the main battery. In this thesis that DC-DC converter is developed. Special focus is put on maximizing the efficiency to ensure as much energy from the solar panels can be used to power the car. First, all possible topologies that meet the requirements are investigated and the best option is selected. Then, a script is developed that configures the power stage of the converter using a provided list of components. The implementation with the highest average efficiency over the operating range is automatically selected. After that, alternative modulation strategies are investigated, aimed at reducing the conduction losses of the converter. Finally, a controller is created and validated for the designed converter.

(mentor); Mackay, Laurens (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","The optimal power flow (OPF) problem is a classic and widely-studied topic in the field of power systems.Its purpose is to minimize the running costs of a power system by determining the optimal operating points,while respecting a set of physical constraints. While most power systems are currently controlled by a centralcoordinator, there is significant interest in the research of decentralized schemes. By eliminating the need fora central coordinator, fully decentralized algorithms eliminate the single point of failure, thereby enhancingthe reliability of the overall system. Moreover, as communication and telemetry play a progressively vital rolein the power grid of the future, decentralized methods reduce the strain on the data infrastructure. In otherwords, the computational and communication load on the central computer is decreased, as it no longer hasto gather and process large amounts of information from all the nodes in the system. As a result, although newchallenges are introduced with distributed algorithms, the OPF becomes more scalable in some regards. Onefully decentralized method for performing OPF calculations is Consensus+Innovation (C+I). The C+I methodis based on the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) Conditions class of optimization, where the solution is founditeratively using an update strategy. Moreover, communication is only required between directly connectednodes, or neighbors. This method has been applied in the cases of AC systems as well as unipolar DC systems,reporting promising results. However, until now, no decentralized algorithm existed for bipolar DC systems.Bipolar topologies, while they are more complex to model and optimize, possess numerous advantages overunipolar ones. By providing two voltage levels, larger loads can be connected directly between the two polesin order to provide double the power. This increased voltage level allows for the current to be halved for thesame amount of power, thereby significantly reducing the conductive losses. On the other hand, smaller loadsare connected between one of the poles and the neutral, meaning that power electronic devices with lowerratings can be used. Furthermore, generators and loads can be connected in parallel at the same location.This means that they must be modelled as controlled current sources which are connected between twophysical nodes. In other words, the optimization variables are altered from nodal voltages and powers tonode voltages and source currents. However, these changes in the modelling, optimization, and control of thegrid mean that the single line diagram (SLD) equivalent circuit, used by the algorithms for unipolar systems,is no longer valid for bipolar ones. Thus, the objective of this thesis was to develop a fully decentralized OPFalgorithm for bipolar DC grids. The algorithm is based on online optimization, meaning that measurementsfrom the physical grid are taken and used in every iteration of the OPF. Moreover, the algorithm is based onbipolar DC grids wherein the power electronic converters follow a droop control scheme, the effect of whichis directly accounted for in the newly developed update strategy. The algorithm is tested on four differentsimulated case studies with varying operational scenarios. These test cases include both fixed and variable-power loads and controllable generators. Furthermore, the algorithm is demonstrated to successfully achieveline congestion management using demand response. Finally, a case with unbalanced loading is simulatedsuccessfully, while respecting all of the physical limits of the system.","Smart grids; Decentralized; Optimal power flow; Online optimization; bipolar; DC grid; Congestion management; Demand response; Consensus and Innovation; Droop Control","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-09-16","","","","Electrical Engineering | Electrical Power Engineering","",""

(mentor); Sprecher, Benjamin (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","The Dutch government aims to become fully circular in 2050 and to reduce the virgin material demand by 50% in 2030 (Rijksoverheid, 2016). For a country that has relied on a linear economy for centuries, this will prove to be a major challenge (Circle Economy, 2020; Rijksoverheid, 2016). Simultaneously, due to urbanization, the Dutch government intends to build one million dwellings between 2016 and 2030 (Ministerie van Binnenlandse Zaken, 2020). These two goals conflict because the first one aims to reduce material demand, whereas the second indirectly increases it. So far no study has paid attention to the impact of different circular construction solutions on the abiotic material demand. This is the gap that this thesis aims to fill, using the city of Leiden as a use case. <br/>To help solve this problem, three steps were taken: 1) create a baseline of the total material demand for the residential sector, starting from the assumption that we continue to build in a linear way; 2) examine the views on circular solutions among experts; and 3) quantify the impact of certain circular solutions on the baseline in order to assess whether the goals defined by the government can be reached. The main aim of this thesis is to create a model that enables us to quantify the impact of five solutions in six different scenarios. In the first scenario the research on the potential of urban mining materials from Verhagen et al. (2020) is expanded and followed up by a second scenario in which the loadbearing structure was replaced by a (partly) wooden alternative. Thirdly, other elements of the building (e.g. facade and interior walls) were replaced by a biobased variant. In the fourth scenario the floor area of the apartments is decreased and in the fifth scenario the basements commonly built under high-rise apartment buildings are removed, whereas in the sixth, and last, scenario the first five are combined. From the analysis results that the two goals mentioned above are only achievable through a combination of multiple solutions. The total virgin abiotic material demand for an average year between 2020 and 2030 would be around 155,000-tons in the business-as-usual scenario. The biggest impact came from switching the concrete loadbearing structure to a wooden (CLT) alternative, which leads to a reduction of 46% of the virgin abiotic material demand. The second largest impact resulted from converting the low- and high-rise apartments into micro-apartments in combination with downsizing the single-family dwelling size by a quarter, which leads to a reduction of 27% of the virgin abiotic material demand. Similar to this solution is excluding basements for parking under high-rise apartment buildings, which gives a 24% reduction. This is followed by the Urban Mining scenario, in which the released circular demolition waste is recycled/reused. This scenario had an impact of 19% on the total virgin abiotic material demand but is less difficult to implement compared to downsizing living space or parking spots. The scenario with the lowest impact was replacing abiotic material in the fit-out of a building, which only yields 7% of the virgin abiotic material demand. All solutions combined the total reduction was 91%, which clearly transcends the absolute goal of 69%. The results of the quantitative part of this thesis were in line with the results from the interviews, where changing the structure was mentioned as “the biggest fish” and changing the fit-out “rumbling in the margins”.","Circular; Construction; Leiden; circular economy (CE); Urban mining; wooden structure","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Industrial Ecology","",""

The motivation of this project was to understand how the Design for Transitions team, a part of VanBerlo, can start to apply Systemic design within their design practice. This team addresses societal and transition challenges that often present multi stakeholder, fuzzy contexts. Systemic design and its applicability in dealing with complex, multi-stakeholder, open and fuzzy problems could offer value to the DfT teams approach. First, two explorative research questions were posed. One, was to find out how DfT conducts their design activities and what is their current design approach. This was established through interviews with DfT designers and by studying past projects. Alongside, a second exploration was conducted on the field of systemic design and a key practice in it: visualization. By studying scientific publications, exploring resources such as yearly conferences and events, theoretical knowledge on this field was established. Additionally, designers who are systemic design practitioners were interviewed to learn from their experience on how they applied this field into practice. The resulting outcome was a set of principles and practices that were evident in professional systemic design practice. By combining insights from the two streams of explorations, four opportunity areas were determined where DfT’s design process could benefit from systemic design. The opportunity areas were: Frame the brief as a complex systemic design challenge, study human insights in the form of relationships, conduct the synthesis of data and knowledge in relationships and lastly, apply visualization for sense making and sense sharing. These four opportunity areas outlined techniques, tools and methods that could be further explored. To establish the context in which these opportunity areas could be explored, two design challenges addressed by DfT were taken up. The resulting solutions were a set of tools and templates that were informed by the opportunity areas. These solutions were applied in the design process of each of the two challenges and an evaluation could be conducted with internal designers from DfT. The resulting insights were useful to learn what solutions worked and to determine the feasibility of systemic design overall for VanBerlo. In order to achieve the goal of the project, that is to help the DfT team apply systemic design into their practice, the revised tools and templates were gathered into a resource named The Systemic Design Toolbox. This toolbox introduced the very first steps for how DfT and the studio at large could begin to explore systemic design. Each tool is presented with a guide to illustrate what value the use of it offers, what outputs can be expected and instructions plus templates that support the use of the tool. Overall, the outcomes of this graduation were very well received by VanBerlo and indicate promise to become the path, in not only applying systemic design, but sensitizing the studio on the changing landscape of design and the need for adopting new skills as designers.","Systemic Design; Design Thinking; design practice","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","Master Thesis",""

Traditionally, hard engineering techniques were used for shoreline protection. However, due to the negative side effects at adjacent beaches, a switch was made to more sustainable soft solutions, such as nearshore berm nourishments. Although several manuals are available describing the preliminary design of nearshore berm nourishments, most of them are based on expert judgment and not on quantitative predictions, which potentially leads to design flaws and, therefore, to unnecessary costs. To overcome this problem, this research aims to increase the understanding of the development of nearshore berm nourishments in relation with the corresponding shoreline evolution by analyzing a shallow concentrated placement at New Smyrna Beach. It is found that the theoretical Feeder and Leeside effects played an important role in shoreline dynamics. The Feeding effect is characterized by shoreward propagating accretionary waves (SPAWs) while the Leeside effect is depicted by shoreline erosion patters downdrift of the nourishment induced shadow zone. Contrary<br/>to most nearshore berm nourishments, the placement at New Smyrna Beach resulted in a significant increase of 45.000 m2 of the sub-aerial beach.

Since flight delays and cancellations are occasional and infrequent events, operational on-time performance data is inherently imbalanced. This is especially the case for cancellations, as on average 1.6% of flights are cancelled, while about 33% of the flights is delayed. For this research, flight operational data is combined with weather data to predict flight delays and cancellations on prediction horizons of hours to months before the flight, by means of Neural Network and Random Forest machine learning algorithms. Since these algorithms naturally tend towards the usage of balanced data, the need exists to find a systematic approach to deal with the imbalance issues, in order to make accurate predictions. Hence, an imbalanced data approach is proposed, which analyses model performance with indicators such as precision and F1-score on varying data imbalance ratios. The imbalance ratios are obtained through the use of sampling techniques such as Synthetic Minority Oversampling and Random Undersampling. It is concluded that the highest precision is found without any sampling while for the highest F1-score sampling is essential. Additionally, the research confirms that severely imbalanced data, like the cancellation data, yields the worst performance when compared to medium imbalanced data, like the delay data.","Imbalanced data; machine learning; flight delays; flight cancellations; prediction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

A TCS is a type of safety-critical software that allows train controllers to correctly set the tracks for a train to pass. The goal of this research is to process the majority of log files generated by such a system, detect anomalies that have occurred and represent that data in human-readable reports that explain anomalous incidents. The reports are generated by making use of NLG techniques, namely data-to-text. We design an NLG pipeline that incorporates novel graphical components. We perform all steps of the report generation process, which is the processing of data, anomaly detection and representing the data in natural language. To process the data we incorporate complex domain-specific rules which require extensive work to accommodate five separate types of event log files. Analyzing logs and detecting anomalous incidents proved complex due to the complicated structure of logs and the ill-defined relationships between different log file types. The log data explained with the NLG pipeline is more extensive than we have seen in literature, as it needs to be linked using complex domain-specific rules and includes temporal and geographical aspects of the railway system. Furthermore, the detected anomalies are very diverse and thus it is unclear what aspects should be included in a report for each anomalous case. We research whether a purely textual presentation or a combination of modalities provides higher information quality. The product of the NLG system are three presentation versions of incident reports, Text, TimeText and RailText. Each version focuses on different important aspects of the nature of the data, to explain anomalous incidents. Due to the diverse properties of the anomalous cases detected, we implement a Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) system to predict the appropriate presentation to explain each incident. We evaluate our work in two expert-based evaluation phases. The first phase evaluates the quality of the different report presentations. The second phase evaluates the feasibility of the CBR system and the quality of the reports chosen by CBR. The work in this thesis is significant as we manage to translate complex data into human-readable reports that are well received by experts and help in understanding anomalous cases. We learn that there is a difference in what presentation format provides the highest information quality of reports depending on the anomalous case being explained. Therefore we conclude that the properties of anomalous cases should be taken into account when generating anomalous reports in a TCS to ensure the highest perceived information quality of the reports. CBR is shown to perform that task well. Furthermore, we find that data familiarity of experts effects their preferences for report presentations.","Natural Language Generation; Log mining; Anomaly detection; Anomaly explanation; Case-Based Reasoning; Railway domain","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science | Data Science and Technology","",""

TI is believed to be an important statistical parameter of the wind speed that can be extracted from the signals recorded by the dedicated sensors in the wind energy area. Despite the limitations of the mast-mounted sensors, they are probably more popular than LIDARs in wind energy applications. Although the sonic anemometers are reference tools in measuring turbulent features of wind, they are expensive instruments to be employed in a large-scale. In this regard, the cup anemometers appear to be the most commonly used instruments in the wind energy community. Accordingly, it would be tremendously advantageous if the 1-Hz cup anemometer data can be employed with the synthetic down-scaling idea to build the turbulence-like velocity signal fields. In this research, small-scale fluctuations are constructed via the Fractal Interpolation (FI) technique. In addition, this study aims to assess the compatibility of the FI technique in enhancing the cup anemometer data. The analysis has been carried out for the data collected in September 2018. Through this analysis, it is deduced that the cup anemometer data can be improved using the FI method.

Much research has been done in this field, however, most of it is applied on small to medium scale codebases. In addition, the quality of solutions implied by this research is often not properly validated. This thesis aims to apply an existing approach to an enterprise-level codebase, namely that of Adyen, and validating the results with developers experienced with the code. We achieve this by taking a graph-based approach, applying the NSGA-II algorithm, and introducing a new metric called the Estimated Build Cost of module Cache Breaks. We evaluate the approach in two ways. First, we performed a controlled experiment exploring the feasibility of the approach on larger scale codebases. For this experiment, we apply the approach to the Adyen codebase. The results show that the approach is scalable and shows a significant improvement of code quality in terms of the metrics used. We then performed a user study where we explore the feasibility of these results in practice. For this study, solutions generated during the experiment are split up and filtered to form groups with less than 10 changes, which are reviewed by developers that have changed that code recently or are a senior with experience in that specific area of the code. The results show that the algorithm is successful in identifying flaws in the codebase.

Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (TAVI) is a treatment that aims to reduce symptoms of Aortic Valve Stenosis (AOS). Most TAVI patients are in the above-75 population. The project brief is to improve TAVI patient's experience using sensor data.<br/>To understand the context of TAVI care pathway, a literature review and stakeholders interviews were done, resulting in a comprehensive understanding of the care pathway. The opportunity to improve the period after TAVI was addressed. To understand the underlying problem among patients in the post-TAVI period, text analysis from the literature was done, followed by coding, categorizing and framework creation. The framework was iterated in a series of 5 co-reflection sessions with the stakeholders. The result is that TAVI patients are managing confrontations throughout the care pathway, which prevent/ limit them from doing enough physical activity. The proposed vision is a continuous and collaborative goal setting system using sensor data. A concept ideation was done, followed by concept testing sessions that resulted in the list of concept requirements. The final proposed product-service system concept is called LIVEsense, a continuous and collaborative goal setting system using sensor data and voice-based conversational agent. LIVEsense consists of three main steps: baseline collection, collaborative goal setting and monitored goal pursuit. Patient wears the sensor and interacting with the voice assistant during the monitored goal pursuit. The sensor collects and compares patient's heart rate and activity data. The proposed product-service system was validated in a co-reflection session with stakeholders. LIVEsense satisfied all elements of the Quadruple Aim (Bodenheimer &amp; Sinksky, 2014) and it brings most value for the period right after TAVI.

Electrification of the industry with power-to-X (PtX) technologies is one of the most promising ways to increase energy system flexibility since industry accounts for the largest share of the world’s total energy demand. However, flexibilities provided by power-to-X models can be concealed in the simulation results due to modelling approximations. Therefore, PtX modelling must be analyzed with respect to the requirements of flexibility analysis. Additionally, the planning and operation of such multi-energy system (MES) needs to be coordinated to use the available resources (RES &amp; PtX) optimally. Thus, a comprehensive energy management approach must be provided for MES.This study investigates the impact of model fidelity of PtX devices in flexibility analysis. Additionally, impact of hierarchical energy management system to optimally control the flexibility dispatch is investigated. First, a realistic case study is developed for multi-energy system to investigate energy system flexibility. Secondly, power-to-gas and power-to-heat models are developed in OpenModelica, and the effect of operational temperature simplifications of PtX models on flexibility analysis is investigated. Lastly, using co-simulation, PtX models are combined with Pandapower optimal power flow solver for the optimal deployment of flexibility.The findings of this study have provided a deeper insight into multi-energy system flexibility. The investigation of hidden flexibility has revealed that precision of flexibility analysis is bounded by the efficiency characterization of PtX, and correct efficiency characterization of PtX highly depends on operating temperature conditions. The study also shown that, a comprehensive control approach can be achieved by agent-based hierarchical energy management system and this new understanding may help to improve predictions for the optimum operation point of MES.","Multi-energy system; energy flexibility; power-to-X; hierarchical control; optimal power flow; co-simulation; electrolyser; heat pump","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Electrical Power Engineering","",""

To answer this question, a refined Heat Transition Policy Making (HeTPoM) DSS framework is made based on a functional visual design method to cater to the needs of DSS creation in the context of municipal heat transition policy-making in the Netherlands. The refined HeTPoM DSS framework is designed to support policy-makers to create a systematic municipal heat transition policy by supporting the process of policy design, assessment, and evaluation. Furthermore, the refined HeTPoM DSS framework can potentially be used as a base to create a computerised municipal heat transition policy-making DSS. This then leads into two types of future research recommendations that need to be done in series. First is the HeTPoM DSS framework components mechanism study (i.e. the interaction between municipal heat transition influencing factors and the policy-making process). Which then can be followed by digital architecture of the DSS system to support the development of municipal heat transition DSS.","Heat Transition; policy-making; Municipality; Case Study Research; Design Science Research; Data driven; Governance; Decision Support System; Framework","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","Aardgasvrij Wijken Zoetermeer",""

Vendors active on darknet markets invest in security mechanisms to compromise the availability or usefulness of evidence to Law Enforcement Agencies. Therefore, difficulties arise in linking identities or machines to cybercrimes facilitated by darknet markets. As a result, many cybercrime investigations are ineffective. This thesis consists of an exploratory case study based on the full administration of the Hansa Market. The Hansa Market (2015-2017) was infiltrated and eventually taken over and shut down by the Dutch Police. The data used in this thesis originates from the server that hosted the market and is made available by the Dutch National High Tech Crime Unit (NHTCU) and the Fiscal Information and Investigation Service (FIOD). This data is used to answer the research question: “Which factors influence the security behaviour of darknet market vendors active on Hansa Market?”. To answer this question, vendors that are similar regarding a) their experience, b) the activity on other markets, c) the amount of physical items sold, e.g. drugs and d) the amount of digital items sold, e.g. stolen credit card information, are clustered into five `vendor types' using Latent Profile Analysis. It is researched whether these clusters of vendors differ in terms of the following security behaviours observed: a) authentication related security practices (password strength, password uniqueness and two-factor authentication usage), b) encryption of communication, in the form of PGP-adoption and PGP-key strengths used, c) the linkability of a vendors' pseudonym through PGP-key matching and d) a vendors' choice of Online Financial Service Providers within the bitcoin ecosystem, measured by querying a service that provides contextual information on bitcoin transactions and addresses. The findings indicate that approximately causal relationships may be inferred between on the one hand vendor types, that represent a combination of business success in terms of physical and digital sales, experience and activity on other markets and on the other hand security behaviour. Vendors offering digital items tend to behave less securely than vendors selling large amounts of drugs. This thesis explains the observed (differences in) suboptimal security behaviours by arguing that vendors on Hansa Market conduct subjective risk assessments. This implies that the probability of being targeted by LEA and the value of the vendors' assets that are at stake (e.g. informational assets containing incriminating evidence or `years of freedom') are of influence on security behaviour. Lastly, recommendations to Law Enforcement Agencies include to exploit the subjectiveness in cybercriminals' risk assessments and to consider focusing on vendors transacting digital items. Academics are recommended to extend this research by investigating cybercriminal security behaviours through improved measurement methodologies in larger and more recent datasets.","Darknet; Market; Security; Cybercrime","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

Today’s prosthesis research is limited to assessing a users’ performance to perform tasks in a controlled environment. Therefore, these studies cannot wholly assess how the prosthesis is used in the daily lives of amputees. Purpose: The purpose of this thesis project is to create, test, and examine the performance of methods that can be used to enhance prostheses' research and evaluation. Results: We have created several enhancements and extensions regarding prosthesis research and evaluation for three sensor scenarios. In the first scenario, we only use an accelerometer, which allowed us to create a new method for creating a vector magnitude (VM) that can show us what type of arm movement is made; additionally, we created a novel scoring system to determine the intensity of movements that are performed. In our second scenario, we used an additional gyroscope, which opened up possibilities for using more advanced Sensor Fusion (SF) techniques. We created an accurate tilt estimation algorithm that remains robust against high levels of gyroscope noise, accelerometer outliers, and measurement model violations. With the gyroscope, we were also able to create a VM from rotational velocity, which displays information about the arms’ rotational movement. Additionally, we created a novel scoring system that also shows the intensity of the performed movements. Our last scenario considers the use of two Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs); we present a novel algorithm for estimating the relative sensor orientation. This algorithm uses a joint kinematic estimation method that incorporates the connection between adjacent segments within a SF algorithm that remains accurate in the vicinity of common real-world disturbances, among which are; high levels of gyroscope noise, accelerometer outliers, and Soft-Tissue-Artifacts (STA). Conclusion: The best way to enhance the analysis for prostheses research and evaluation is to start incorporating gyroscopes into the research process. This can either be in the form of the single sensor case or the double sensor system. The additional gyroscope(s) will enable the use the SF techniques and methods as discussed in this report.","Prostheses; Relative sensor orientation estimation; Joint kinematics; Tilt estimation; Movement Visualization; Accelerometer; Gyroscope; Inertial Measurement Unit; Sensor Fusion; Sensor; Fusion; Soft-Tissue-Artifacts; STA; disturbance; Magnetometer-free; Orientation Estimation; Orientation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-09-01","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

An attractive way to reduce the CO2 emissions by transport is by changing the fuel used. Hydrogen is expected to play a key role in a clean, secure and affordable energy future (IEA). However, a clean, widespread use of hydrogen in global energy transitions faces several challenges. Currently, the global hydrogen production is approximately 7.2 EJ per year, 96% of which comes from fossil fuels. To harness the potential of hydrogen on the way to a clean energy future requires the capture of CO2 from hydrogen production from fossil fuels and greater supplies of hydrogen from renewable energy sources. This study focuses on assessing the techno-economic potential of the membrane technology coupled with carbon capture technology, to produce decentralized bio-hydrogen in realizing a low carbon society in The Netherlands. A literature survey was performed to determine the performance of the membrane reactor &amp; cryogenic capture technologies and expected technological advancements. With the information obtained,a basic process of membrane reforming with carbon capture was modeled in Aspen Plus. Different configurations of the basic process were developed. In the first stage, thermodynamic key performance indicators were used to compare the performance of the different configurations developed. Secondly, one promising configuration was chosen and the levelized cost of hydrogen was used to optimize the process parameters like sweep ratio, permeate pressure, feed pressure etc. Finally, the optimum configuration was used to determine its economic and CO2 emissions potential compared to the conventional steam methane reforming process. Exergy analysis for the optimum configuration was also performed.The optimum levelized cost of hydrogen of the decentralized hydrogen production system developed in this work is calculated to be 4.19 €/kg H2. The levelized cost of hydrogen for the equivalent centralized steam methane reforming system is 5.98 €/kg H2. Therefore, the decentralized system developed is more attractive than the centralized system. The higher costs of the centralized system are due to the hydrogen transportation costs. Furthermore, the carbon capture unit costs 0.68  €/kg H2 and an additional dehydration unit at 0.4 €/kg H2 is required to meet the PEM fuel-cell hydrogen specifications. The efficiency and carbon capture rate of the developed configuration is 66.07% and 72.13% respectively,higher than the conventional process. The exergy efficiency of the developed process is 65.1%. The CO2 emissions for the decentralized system across the value chain are calculated to be 1.4 kg CO2/kg H2. Future scenarios with renewable energy in the electricity mix result in negative CO2 emissions, making the system attractive to limit the climate change and also benefit financially from the EU-ETS. The CO2 emissions of the centralized system are 5.45 kg CO2/kg H2 with post-combustion carbon capture and 10.14 kg CO2/kg H2 with state-of-the-art reforming. With a carbon tax to be implemented soon,the costs of this system will rise making the decentralized system even more attractive. However, uncertainties in the development of an integrated hydrogen transport infrastructure, fuel-grade hydrogen demand, technological advancements in membrane reactors etc. may affect the comparative attractiveness of the systems.","Hydrogen; Fuel Cell Electric Vehicle; Carbon capture","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-09-14","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

A data collection trial is completed during this development, identifying difficulties in the data collection and calculation process as well as generating some emission results. A tool is designed from the results of this trial. It is based on life cycle analysis, while also including emission factors calculated from sector carbon disclosures. Differences from either one of these carbon emission calculation methods are evaluated and if possible, compared. A final selection of calculation methods for each process is selected and used in the tool. The tool is capable of both internally monitoring carbon emissions over different time periods and comparing emission results with other hospitals. Both these functions can be used to identify emission hotspots, inspire improvements and monitor changes in emissions. Sensitivity of the model to different characterization methods and scope definitions is tested. Ultimately, this tool is aimed to aid in reducing CO2-eq emissions within operation rooms.

(mentor); Kruijff, Michiel (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","Airborne wind energy (AWE) is a new generation of wind energy technology which uses tethered kites to reach the stronger and steadier high altitude wind resource. Research and development of AWE has been accelerated in the last two decades. Around 40 institutions around the world are working on their own concepts and architectures of the technology. This research has been collaborated with Ampyx Power B.V, a Dutch company involved in development of one of the concepts of AWE. No company has yet been able to prove the commercial viability of their technology. A successful market diffusion is possible when there is a perfect product market fit i.e. the technology development should be aligned with the market requirements. Economies of scale and maturing of technology is continuously reducing the cost of utility scale variable renewable energy sources (VRES) like wind and solar PV. Anticipating a subsidy free future, utility scale VRES will be dependent on the day-ahead electricity market (DAM) for their revenue generation. The electricity prices from the market are dynamic and are dependent on the supply and demand characteristics of the country. Higher influx of VRES in the grid depress the DAM prices, this effect is known as the merit-order effect of VRES. Therefore, the value of electricity depends on the time at which it is produced. This indicates to investigate if there is a need to shift from cost driven system design to value driven system design for VRES.<br/><br/>Energy production and revenue generation of AWE at a certain time, depends on the wind speed and the energy price at that particular time. A data driven statistical model has been developed in MATLAB environment to identify and quantify the merit order effect of wind power by estimating the correlation of DAM prices and wind speeds. A decision support tool for the system design of AWE is developed by integrating the correlation model with a revenue model and the existing cost model of Ampyx Power. Correlation model results for different locations in Europe confirms that there exists a negative correlation between the DAM prices and wind speeds. Among the tested locations, the German DAM prices drop by around 1.2€/MWh, the Danish by around 0.9€/MWh, and the Dutch by around 0.6€/MWh per 1m/s increase in wind speed. Different locations in different European markets have different strengths of the correlation depending on their wind climate and their energy mix. A case study based on three different locations in Germany has been analyzed using the developed tool to understand the influence of the merit order effect on the system design of AWE. The results show that in a DAM based revenue generation scenario, value driven optimization leads to a different system configuration than cost driven optimization. It leads to systems which perform better at lower wind speeds.<br/><br/><br","Airborne wind energy; AWE; AWES; Merit order effect; European electricity market; Day ahead market; Economic analysis; optimal sizing; Correlation analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","In the recent years, the circular economy (CE) has emerged as an alternative to current linear economic models with prospects of achieving the decoupling of environmental impacts from economic growth. To this end, CE models focus on the permanence of products, materials, and value in the economy, eliminating as much waste as possible. In waste management policy making, traditional indicators, such as recycling rates, are still the norm as demonstrated by the latest binding goals for plastic packaging recycling set by the EU in the Packaging Waste or the Single Use Plastics Directives. However, these have been criticized for overlooking qualitative aspects that are fundamental in the CE. Consequently, several indicators have been proposed as an alternative to monitor this new economic paradigm. Among these are value-based metrics. Economic value contains information about both the quality and the quantity of the specific material or product. In addition, value can be altered using economic instruments, such as taxes, to align value with other relevant environmental or social interests.<br/>The validity of using value-based metrics to evaluate the performance of waste management systems was analysed. Several scenarios for possible configurations of the Dutch post-consumer plastic packaging waste (PCPPW) management network were defined and assessed in terms of technical, economic, and environmental performance. Two technical metrics, intermediate recycling rates (iRR) and recycling rates (RR), and one value-based metric, the circular economy index (CEI), were compared to the environmental and economic performance of the scenarios. The CEI showed a better alignment with all the environmental impact categories than the mass-based metrics. Most importantly, the value-based metric proved capable of capturing the significance of the quality of the recycled plastics in the displacement of primary raw materials, thus fostering high quality recycling over downcycling. However, no correlation was found between the economic performance and the presented indicators. There are multiple business models that achieve good economic performances with diverse environmental, technical, or value-recovery performances. This suggests that current policies are unable to successfully align economic and environmental strategies. More research should be put in defining holistic policies that promote environmental and economically sustainable practices.","circular economy; indicators; post-consumer waste; plastic packaging; recycling; industrial ecology","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Case studies and research on demand response with EVs has been increasing over the last years in an attempt to reduce this load impact. This thesis aims to explore how the charging load of a large EV fleet impacts the distribution grid of the capital region in Iceland and how it can be minimised with demand response strategies. A load model was created for the distribution grid and the results indicate that large-scale EV penetration can have a huge load impact.

The complete socket is also subjected to strength tests which resulted in a maximum manageable force of 100 N, attached to the prosthetic hand. However, the socket has not been evaluated by patients, which means that real-life wearing conditions are not achieved. Therefore, it would be a recommendation for future research to examine the socket on patients.

As bottom-fixed wind turbines are limited to shallow water depths, floating wind structures are the next frontier to unlock the vast potential of wind energy. Despite many techno-economic challenges, several full-scale floating wind structures have been successfully deployed and have shown the potential for floating offshore wind. One project near completion is the 3.6 MW TetraSpar demonstrator developed by Stiesdal Offshore Technologies, Shell and Innogy. With its tetrahedral shaped base and suspended counterweight keel, developed with the focus on ease of fabrication and installation, this spar concept is expected to offer a competitive package for floating wind using future, larger 10 MW+ wind turbines. The goal of this research is to investigate the capability of the TetraSpar platform to accommodate significantly larger wind turbines and to identify challenges in an early stage of development. Since technology upscaling of floating wind substructures has not been done before, this thesis first develops a novel design methodology for upscaling and then is applies it to the TetraSpar as case study. This work builds on academic efforts thus far but focusses on the key design drivers in for upscaling of floating wind, namely the fundamental equilibria in vertical and rotational direction: the structure’s weight is equal to its buoyancy, and the restoring moment equals the maximum overturning moment by wind. Specific emphasis is put on correctly capturing these equilibria, as they generally apply for floating wind substructure technologies, including the TetraSpar. First a design basis is created with functional requirements and design criteria for floating wind structures in general, and specifics to the TetraSpar. Also, key specifications of future 10 MW, 15 MW and 20 MW wind turbine types are explored. Secondly, a model is developed for upscaling based on physical modelling of hydrodynamic stability (water and waves) and aerodynamic thrust (wind). Based on these inputs, the substructure is upscaled using the future turbine type wind thrusts. The model employs an algorithm to find a new equilibrium design point and computes key properties for upscaled substructures. The resulting design concepts are then evaluated for first order wave-structure interactions using a diffraction/radiation solver (WAMIT). Key evaluation aspects are free-floating hydrodynamics, including hydrodynamic coefficients, wave forces and response amplitude operators. Fourth, selected structural elements of the upscaled design concepts are evaluated for structural strength. The fifth and final step assesses the extent to which the now evaluated upscaled design concepts still meet on the functional requirements and design criteria. The thesis concludes that the developed, first-order design methodology is suitable to explore upscaled design concepts of floating offshore wind turbines. By computing an estimation of the physical dimensions and behaviour of the substructure, this allows for the evaluation of the technical and economic feasibility. Key findings of the physical modelling are the linear trends for structure mass over power rating of the wind turbine, sensitivities in design choices for maximum allowable heel angle due to wind, and keel draught for the TetraSpar specifically. Compared to other technologies, it is found that found that the TetraSpar concept offers a relatively lightweight platform for future wind turbines up to 15 – 20 MW. No fundamental technical showstoppers are identified for upscaling, but it is found that as the structure progresses to larger wind turbines, aspects like in-port water depth, physical dimensions of structural elements, and installability of the TetraSpar at sea will become more challenging. It is expected that at some stage in the development towards large-scale floating wind structures, trade-offs will have to be made to arrive at an improved design. For this, the methodology developed for this thesis can be applied, for example by exploring a lighter, wider TetraSpar design with more slender structural elements. Furthermore, it is recommended to further investigate the mooring design, fabrication capacity and deployment procedures of larger floating wind substructures in general, and upscaled TetraSpar designs in particular.","Floating offshore wind turbine; Upscaling; Design methodology; Wind turbine generator; Hydromechanics; Diffraction/radiation model; WAMIT; TetraSpar; Offshore engineering","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2025-09-11","","","","","",""

(mentor); Lomas, J.D. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","When building online systems designers have to make many decisions that impact user experience. One of said choices is whether certain interactions are automated or remain human. To make matters more complicated, they can also decide to make certain interactions seem automated or human. Making the right decision has increased in importance as more of our interactions are taking place online. Context The aim of this thesis is to discover if guidelines can be developed to facilitate designers when making these decisions. It does so by taking a new dating app called Breeze as a use case. This dating app is different compared to existing dating apps because it automates the date arrangement process. Instead of being able to swipe through profiles and chat with matches, users receive two profiles per day and directly fill in a date picker when matched. Breeze then arranges the date and lets the match know where to be at what time. The app faces the problem that many of the dates get canceled because users stop responding during the date arrangement process. User research reveals that, by having limited online interaction, this process has become impersonal, anonymous and inflexible which makes it easy to dehumanize your match. Dehumanization leads to loss of commitment when arranging a date. This leads to the research question: What would the impact on commitment and the overall user experience when this process would instead be humanized? And how can these learnings help designers of other online systems decide when and how to humanize interaction? Theory To answer these questions, this thesis first elaborates why dehumanization is inevitable when interaction is mediated by technology. Dehumanization can be mitigated by humanizing interaction. However simply humanizing interaction is not the solution because, apart from its advantages it too has disadvantages. The ideal balance between dehumanization and humanization depends on the type of platform in question. Findings Through conducting two Build-Measure-Learn loops, this thesis finds that the ideal balance does not only differ between platforms but also differs within the customer journey of one platform. Within each step of the journey, users have different interaction needs, which not only depends on why they decided to interact with the system in the first place, but also with whom they are interacting at that point. Additionally the companies that build these systems also have conflicting needs, which depend on their strategy and available resources. Result In order to find this ideal balance between humanization and dehumanization, this thesis proposes the Framework for humanized interaction. This framework is validated through conducting expert interviews, a pilot with an external company and by applying it to the use case. The latter results in new concepts and recommendations suitable for implementation by Breeze.","HCI; Humanization; Dehumanization; Human behavior; Online systems","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

Confirming previous findings, striatal dopamine depletion was not found to cause tremor, nor its injection to affect tremor severity.

Furthermore, both the GPi and the GPe present enhanced maximal activity coherent with muscular co-contraction onsets showing evidence of abnormal basal ganglia firing during re-emergent tremor.

However, a shortage of installation vessels could influence this growth in offshore wind industry. Commonly, wind turbines are installed in components using a jack-up vessel. Occasionally, wind turbines are installed fully assembled. The center of gravity of a fully assembled wind turbine is relatively low and thus lifting above the wind turbine is not necessarily for fully assembled wind turbine installation. Wind turbines can be installed fully assembled using cranes in twin lift configuration to reduce required lifting capacities. The flexibility and scalability of the vessel depends on the location of the cranes on the vessel. Different vessels can install wind turbines with their advantages and disadvantages. To identify these solutions, principles are proposed and compared with state-of-the-art vessels for wind turbine installations. A morphological analysis is used to identify promising solutions for fully assembled wind turbine installation. Eight concepts are compared in a scenario comparison with varying distance between nearby marshalling ports and the wind turbine park location. Several solutions show subsequent improvement in installation rates. One new concept, the PWT installation vessel, shows overall improvement in installation rates. This solution, developed by the author of this report, is proposed for flexible and scalable fully assembled wind turbine installation.","Offshore wind turbine; Wind Turbine Installation; PWT installation vessel; Offshore wind farm; Crane vessel; Semi-submersible","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-09-11","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Transport Engineering and Logistics","",""

One idea is to develop a device that women could use at home to perform a regular self-check. Ultrasound is a safe, radiation-free technology that could be used for this device. Ultrasound systems (B-mode) that are typically used in a hospital however, are too expensive for the general population. The older ultrasound technology called A-mode, could be repurposed for this device as it costs a lot less. A-mode scans are seldom used at the present time, as B-mode scans have proven to be much more powerful for use in medical diagnostics. However, the costs of manufacturing a B-mode probe is a lot higher than an A-mode probe. This is especially important in the development of a portable ultrasound probe where costs are constrained. This study attempts to investigate how an ultrasound probe that comprises multiple A-mode transducers could be used together for breast cancer detection. Specifically, the aim of this study is to characterize and verify an ultrasound probe that comprises multiple A-mode transducers. To this end, a simulation environment is developed in MATLAB using the k-Wave toolbox, where an ultrasound probe is described through a set of input parameters and outputs its response when placed on the skin of breast tissue. The breast phantom models are generated from software in the Virtual Imaging Clinical Trial for Regulatory Evaluation (VICTRE) trial and have four different levels of density as defined in BI-RADS. Two masses, one of benign and the other malignant nature were examined. The input parameters distance between the transducers, input frequency, and number of transducers, are investigated by comparing their responses in terms of contrast ratio around a breast mass. Towards the end, comparison to B-mode imaging are also made. Based on the results, the distance between transducers yields better performance with a higher value, as long as it does not go beyond the size of the mass. Higher input frequency also contributed to a better contrast ratio value. The number of transducers did not seem to have a correlation to the performance, with respect to contrast ratio values. However, when converted to a pseudo (very narrow) B-mode image, a higher number of transducers seem to very slightly mimic what might appear in a B-mode image. Upsampling it to account for the distance between the transducers, as well as to create a wider image seemed to improve the results.","Ultrasound; Breast cancer; Breast ultrasound; A-mode; k-Wave; MATLAB","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Training estimators with standard loss functions like mean squared error and cross-entropy provides no guarantees that their predictions aid the optimizer in this aim. A number of approaches have been suggested over the past few years on how to most effectively tackle the PnO-setting, such as Smart ""Predict, then Optimize"" (SPO) and the Quadratic Programming Task Loss (QPTL). We investigate an experiment of the paper that introduced QPTL, and find that an estimator used as baseline approach was set back by two factors: a class imbalance, and a training duration that was too short. However, QPTL still outperforms the baseline approach. We consider the use of the Gumbel-Softmax Straight-Through Estimator for SPO and QPTL when training neural networks on a multi-class classification dataset (MNIST) in a PnO-setting. We compare the results for SPO and QPTL for different<br/>output activation functions (linear output, sigmoid output, gumbel-softmax output) when predicting the objective parameters in 0-1 unweighted Knapsack problems and Bipartite Matching problems using this dataset. We find that neural networks trained via SPO with a linear output tend to show best performance, and that neural networks trained via QPTL are relatively unaffected by the output activation function of choice. Finally we find that PnO approaches, SPO in particular, can see large performance increases by constructing a large number of optimisation problems from a small pool of training data.<br","Machine Learning; Integer Programming; Combinatorial Optimization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science | Software Technology","",""

The gradual shift from offline to online shopping comes with its own set of unique challenges for brands and business operations. Consumers are almost effortlessly able to compare different competitors that offer the same product or service. “The result is fierce price competition and vanishing brand loyalty.” Kuttner (1998). This is also a problem that Home Design Shops encounters as an e-commerce company in the living/home-goods sector.

To maintain this sustainable growth while at the same time distinguishing themselves from their competitors, there was the need for a new long-lasting strategy. Therefore, the goal of this graduation project was to develop a strategy that would result in an increase in brand loyalty combined with growth on the long run. The foundation of the strategy has been developed by performing an extensive internal analysis of the company and an external analysis consisting of a consumer, competitor market and trend analysis.

Since each node in a WASN has its own clock, clock offsets and clock skews between the nodes are inevitable. Clock offsets and clock skew can be detrimental to the beamformer performance. In this thesis we focus on the effect of clock skew on the beamformer performance. Existing methods for clock skew compensation for the speech enhancement application do this explicitly. In this thesis we investigate the possibility to formulate the beamformer such that explicit clock skew compensation is not necessary. Instead, we propose an algorithm for implicit clock skew compensation, which takes advantage of the Generalized Eigenvalue Decomposition (GEVD) to construct beamformers (e.g. Minimum Variance Distortionless Response (MVDR)), recently proposed in the literature. Using the GEVD, no explicit compensation has to be applied to the received data. Compared to the state-of-the-art, where clock skew estimation/compensation algorithms are used, this reduces the computational complexity for beamformer processing. The algorithm depends on exact knowledge of the noisy correlation matrix across the microphones. In practice, this matrix is unknown and estimation will reduce the performance of the proposed algorithm. We therefore quantify the error made in the estimation of the correlation matrix using the standard Welch method and also look at a recursive smoothing based method for correlation matrix estimation. Compared to a selected state-of-the-art algorithm, the proposed algorithm shows similar or better performance using this recursive smoothing method. For future work on this subject, more study can be done on correlation matrix estimation methods, as these play a key role in clock skew invariant beamforming.","Wireless Acoustic Sensor Networks; clock synchronization; beamforming","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Circuits and Systems","",""

Sometimes, ship structures are pushed beyond their limits with the possibility of significant negative economic and environmental impact or, in the worst case, impact on human life. This makes it explicitly clear why the development of accurate methods and models is still required to predict if a design can withstand the expected loads during its operations. In the past two decades, Machine Learning (ML) has been applied in the field of structural design. Still, the amount of research regarding the scalability and generalizability of ML within structural design is limited. This research aims to investigate the use, scalability, and generalizability of ML to predict the ultimate strength of stiffened panels. A large dataset of stiffened panels loaded under longitudinal uni-axial compression and lateral pressure is generated. This set is based on a representative geometrical parameter set in shipbuilding obtained by the optimization of an analytical buckling model for stiffened panels. This model incorporates several nonlinearities such as initial deflection, large deflection theory, and residual stress. Finite Element Analysis (FEA) is used to obtain the ultimate strength and stress distribution at the moment of failure for every stiffened panel. This data is used to train two Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to predict the ultimate strength and stress distribution at the moment of failure. Overall, the CNNs are an excellent tool for these predictions when sufficient data is available, the data shows substantial geometrical similarity to the training data, and when the data is within the scope of training. When predicting the ultimate strength of the stiffened panels in this research, it is required to have at least 4000 data samples to obtain a well-trained network. The scalability of the ultimate strength predictions produces acceptable results within the 5% margin of the training scope. Unstable prediction behavior is observed when predicting stress distributions. Both the ultimate strength and stress predicting models are also trained on stiffened panels curved in the transverse direction to test the generalizability of the CNNs. Poor predictive capabilities were observed when predicting the ultimate strength and stress distributions of the curved plates. The use of ML in structural engineering proves a useful concept and provides multiple opportunities for further research.","Buckling; Machine Learning; Convolutional Neural Networks; Stiffened panel; Scalability; Generalizability; Stress Distribution","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Marine Technology","",""

(mentor); Popovich, V. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","Back pain and back instability affect close to 80% of the population at some point during their life. One solution is to insert a spinal cage, which results in spinal fusion, meaning two vertebrae fuse together to create one big vertebra. This study focuses on the investigation of both the processing aspects as the design aspects of producing a functional spinal cage. The spinal cage investigated is made of 3D printed Ti6Al4V using selective laser melting (SLM). The original design showed some undesirable qualities, which are a higher apparent Young's modulus compared to the surrounding bone, causing stress shielding; and the creation of high stress concentrations due to the implant design, which reduces the fatigue life. A new design is created and tested using a combination of FEM software and mechanical testing. Comparing the new spinal cage to the original spinal cage it was found that the Young's modulus is 4 times lower; the yield strength 27% lower, but does not yield when a force of 4 kN is applied as required; and the fatigue life 2.2 times higher. Currently, implants are post treated using hot isostatic pressing (HIP), which is an expensive procedure. One of the objectives of this research is to investigate the effectiveness of a vacuum oven as an alternative heat treatment method. This is done with SLM 3D printed Ti6Al4V samples with a porosity of 59%, which are heat treated at 850 and 1050 degrees Celsius for 2 hours. When comparing the vacuum heat treatment performed at 1050 with 850 degrees Celsius, the alpha grain thickness is increased 2.8 times, the Young's modulus with 13% and the yield strength with 7%. The vacuum heat treatments increase the fatigue life with 20% due to the removal of residual stresses and the transformation of the 'alpha-martensite to an alpha + beta microstructure as is required. Between the two heat treatments no significant difference in fatigue life is found. Comparing the fatigue life of the vacuum heat treatments with HIP at 920 degrees Celsius for 2 hours, it was observed that at 10,000 cycles the fatigue life of HIP is 20% better and at 1,000,000 cycles 1% worse. The main difference between the heat treatments is the reduction of internal pore size after HIP. The internal porosity affects the fatigue life. However, the effect of internal porosity will reduce faster compared to the effect of surface quality resulting in a similar fatigue life at high cycle fatigue. For spinal cages high cycle fatigue is more interesting to look at. Finally, commercial spinal implants are universally designed based on the requirements and life-style of a 30 year old male. In order to improve the success-rate of spinal fusion, more patient-specific implants can be designed and produced using additive manufacturing. In this research five different patient specific groups are defined based on expected load and bone density. Using these requirements five different spinal cages are designed based on different porosities. Using FEM software the minimum apparent Young's modulus which can be achieved for every patient group is found. The apparent Young's modulus found for every group ranges between 1.40 and 3.17 GPa. Finally, the fatigue graph and apparent Young's modulus obtained from the mechanical tests are used to validate the simulation. The simulated fatigue life was around three times lower compared to the actual fatigue life and the apparent Young's modulus was 6.3% higher compared to the actual apparent Young's modulus. These findings are used to correct the simulations and the new apparent Young's modulus for every patient group lies between 1.32 and 2.98 GPa which is even closer to the Young's modulus of the surrounding bone.","Ti6Al4V; Spinal cage; fatigue","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The primary domain researched in this project is the domain of sexual exploration. Initially, the research started by exploring the uneasiness of sexual exploration. Firstly, the aim was to understand what sexual exploration is and how people sexually explore in the current world. A combination of different DFI specific methods was used. In the first phase, the ViP method was used to understand the context of the domain, the influencing factors, and to, later on, create a coherent story. Underlying mechanisms of human sexuality and additional topics were necessary to understand in this phase as well, on which later design criteria were developed. The project was done with an external client, Ink - a design studio based in Amsterdam, whose previous research in the domain was resourceful as well. Besides the mentioned methods, a continuous process of user interviews, creative sessions and discussions were held as well. The chosen method provided valuable knowledge and necessary factors in order to create an overview of the current world in the context of the researched domain. Moreover, it supported the additional conclusions of how to approach the found issue and what is required for future world creation. Following the methodological steps in this research, three design iteration cycles were performed as well. Each design concept in those cycles focused on different aspects of uneasy sexual exploration. After their detailed evaluation, the created concepts served as a learning moment to better understand what exactly the final concept should be. After marking down the potential directions and evaluating design opportunities, it was decided the focus of the final concept should be on sexual scripts - societally created guidelines on sexual behaviour and their influence on people’s sexual exploration. Based on the findings and evaluation, a suitable vision statement was proposed as an essential part of the ViP method - encouraging people to be freer in their sexual exploration, by showing them the ridiculousness of sexual scripts. The mechanism and the intended effect of the statement were tested on several occasions, based on which final concept was then created. This thesis, therefore, aims to propose a suitable design solution in the domain of sexual exploration. Specifically, the focus of the created concept is on the people who currently feel limited by the sexual scripts they encounter and require additional support in sexually exploring beyond them. The final concept of this research project is an Instagram profile which aims to raise awareness of sexual scripts in the society by ridiculing them, in order to support people to be freer in their sexual exploration. By using a combination of satirical illustrations and text, the profile serves as a type of an online catalogue of sexual scripts where users have a clear overview, but also as a safe space where alternative ideas can be found. The name of this concept and consequently, the Instagram profile, is The Script Bible, where additional ridicule is present as well, to mock how blindly people sometimes follow mentioned sexual scripts. The final concept was validated with five potential users, which were selected based on the intended target group - people who sometimes experience a limitation in their sex lives caused by sexual scripts. Furthermore, the validation of the concept focused on a few parts - the directness and understanding, confrontation with personal attitudes, the overall moment of first interaction and the visual language of the concept. Additionally, a comparison with the created product qualities was also validated. Illustrations were tested separately and then with the overall Instagram profile as well. In conclusion, while this concept only focuses on the first layer of defeating the sexual scripts - the awareness, the validation and reflection both indicate the chosen direction is a suitable one. Moreover, the created concept shows the chosen mechanism is also fitting for this approach and can result in a more open discussion about sexual exploration, breaking the uncomfortableness of the topic and spark further interest in the topic itself.","Sexual Exploration; Illustration; Interaction Design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

(graduation committee); Taale, Henk (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","In this thesis an investigation is performed into the effect of different speed limits on freeway capacity. From literature, much is known about the variety of factors that affect capacity, but the exact effect of the speed limit on capacity is not yet clear. In recent years, several speed limits changes have taken place at multiple two-lane freeway bottlenecks throughout The Netherlands, which makes it possible to compare effects of different speed limits at the same location. To evaluate the effect of the speed limit on capacity, the Product Limit Method has been applied to identify breakdown flows and generate capacity distributions, which could subsequently be compared for different limits. In the comparison of capacity distributions under different speed limits, it was found that significant changes in capacity had occurred, but that no uniform direction of the effect could be found. Subsequently, to control for location specific factors and other variables, Fixed Effects regression has been used to determine the effect of the speed limit on the breakdown flow. It was found that the breakdown flow under the 120 km/h limit was significantly higher than under the 130 km/h limit (in the range of 60 to 190 vehicles per hour) and that the breakdown flow under the 100 km/h limit was, in some cases, also higher than under the 130 km/h limit. In addition to this, it was found that a significant positive relation exists between the height of the speed limit and the fraction of flow in the passing lane. Moreover, it was shown that the relation between the fraction of flow in the passing lane and the level of breakdown flow was best represented by a quadratic relation, which could indicate that an “optimal” distribution of flows may exist. Given the results of this thesis, it is posed that a change in the speed limit is likely to affect capacity primarily through altering the lane flow distribution and that it will depend on the layout of a freeway location what the optimal lane flow distribution is and which speed limit leads to this optimal lane flow distribution.","Speed Limits; Capacity Research; Breakdown Flow; Product Limit Method; Fixed Effects Regression; Two-Lane Freeway; Traffic Flow Theory; Lane Flow Distribution; Bottleneck Identification; Capacity Distribution","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(mentor); van Beusekom, Dennis (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","The increasingly important availability of online services is constantly threatened by malicious software such as botnets. Attackers have gained power through devices that are part of the rising Internet of Things (IoT), mostly through infections caused by Mirai. The botnets created by Mirai are used for the purpose of DDoS attacks, which can take away the availability of an online service. Although Mirai can be detected relatively easily due to its superficial signature, the remediation process of Mirai infected IoT devices runs far from smoothly.<br/>As end-users often do not notice the presence of Mirai and manufacturers lack incentives to invest in better security or support, ISPs like KPN are amongst the few viable actors that could defend against botnets like Mirai. As ISPs are able to link infection feeds to their customers, they are able to send out notifications accompanied by protocols that can resolve Mirai infections when executed properly. Although research exists on the remediation rates, it is not clear what processes take place at end-users homes during the remediation process and what critical points of error exist throughout the phases of the anti-botnet cycle. As the remediation rate of Mirai infections is currently only 60 – 76 percent, it can be worth looking into the remediation processes to see where they could be improved.<br/>The main research question is the following: “What do we learn about how and to what extent Internet Service Providers can improve the remediation process of malware infected Internet of Things devices by monitoring end-users while they are cleaning their Mirai infections?”. To answer this question, we have closely followed 17 Mirai infected end-users over a period of 7 weeks, at the KPN Abuse Desk, after a 1 week pilot phase to test our email notification and think aloud protocol. We have prepared and analyzed all steps from identification of a Mirai infection until successful remediation took place. The lion’s share of this experiment is about a virtual visit; a phone call with an option to upgrade to a video conference, in which infected end-users get advanced support in performing the 5 cleaning steps stated in the protocol they received. As the end-users thought aloud during the calls, we were able to follow them closely and pinpoint arising issues. Using a thematic content analysis, we synthesized the personal stories that end-users shared.<br/>During the 7 week experiment, we saw 37 unique IP addresses infected with Mirai, of which 12 were excluded due to the ISP policy of not providing support during the weekends. Of the 25 remaining IP addresses, 3 could not be notified due to technical issues within KPN, 2 did not pick up the phone after being notified and 3 were not willing to take part in the experiment due to trust issues.<br/>16 out of 17 participants that were responsible for the internet security were male, but their varying household sizes shows that this does not relate to men becoming infected more often. The age of the end-users was normally distributed between 21 and 80 and we found a household size of 1 to 6, excluding 3 small business locations that became victim of Mirai. End-users can often only identify 1 or 2 IoT devices in their network (13 out of 17) and are almost always able to pinpoint the infected device (16 out of 17). Many issues arose during the virtual visits, such as a lack of trust, not willing to spend effort, a lack of support by the manufacturer, or the idea that regular protection measures should have protected against Mirai.<br/>Only 6 out of 17 end-users were able to perform all steps successfully. In most cases end-users failed to change the password of their device or performed a regular reset on their router instead of a factory reset. This caused 3 failing remediation efforts and 5 reinfections during the experiment phase. The remediation process has barriers in each phase that could be addressed. The biggest improvement can be made in the awareness of end-users, which would lead to higher prevention of infections. Prevention would keep the many potential issues in the remediation process from arising altogether.","Mirai; IoT; Think Aloud Protocol; End-user behaviour; Computer security","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","","52.2424326, 5.1648462"

(mentor); Ozcan Vieira, E. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","Admission to the intensive care unit often has long lasting eﬀects on patients’ further life. Not only can the reason for their admission leave several problems, but also mechanical ventilation, physical inactivity, sedation and delirium are only some of the factors that contribute to the problems left after ICU stay. Over 80,000 people are annually admitted to the intensive care units of the Dutch hospitals alone and, due to technical advancements, a rising number of patients survives critical illness. Post intensive care syndrome is the overarching name that combines all the physical and mental problems related to intensive care unit stay. It has been well established that rehabilitation and early mobilisation are eﬀective counter measures against post intensive care syndrome. It has also been shown that interactive video gaming can play a useful role in rehabilitation as an addition to conventional therapy. Evidence has shown that the use of visual feedback improves performance and adherence to the therapy in comparison to regular of physical therapy. This design study is meant to create a new interactive video gaming device that allows ICU patients that are at least semi mobile and semi cooperative, to play video games with the aim to help them leave the ICU in the best physical and cognitive state as possible. To come up with the right design, a literature study on the relevant subjects has been done. Also, expert interviews with intensive care unit care-giving staﬀ have been conducted and experience has been gained on the intensive care unit of the Erasmus medical center Rotterdam to make sure the design is done in the right context. Based on the outcomes of this research the decision was made to aim the design to help in activities of daily living. From this aim a speciﬁc goal was formulated: The goal is to create an interactive video game controlling system that allows ICU patients, that are at least semi mobile and semi cooperative, to play video games that simultaneously helps in increasing muscle strength, delivers distraction from the daily routine in the ICU and stimulates patients cognitively. Together with physiotherapists and intensivists from the Erasmus medical center Rotterdam a list of requirements for the ﬁnal designs was created. As during activities of daily living hand grip is one of the most important aspects, the decision was made to use sub-maximal grip force control as the desired training form. Because of this two diﬀerent versions of grip strength trainers were proposed. The ﬁrst concept uses the medium wrap grasp as input movement and the second concept uses the power-sphere grasps. These are two of the most frequently used grasp types in daily life. The concepts are designed in a way that the force exerted on the device can be used to control a video game. Internal force sensing resistors, connected to an Arduino, translate the force to a useful signal to control the game. Ten prototypes were created to get to the ﬁnal designs, which were then tested with patients on the ICU. As result of testing and iterating the concepts, two ﬁnal designs were delivered, fulﬁlling the list of requirements. Feasibility tests of these designs were done on the ICU of the Erasmus medical center Rotterdam and were promising. ICU patients participating in the tests understood the game well, were capable of performing the required movements to play the game and delivered feedback on the design and the gaming experience. This paper has lead up to a ﬁnal prototype that has gone through basic testing to check for feasibility and has proven to work. Further scientiﬁc research on a larger scale should be the next step to review the clinical eﬀects of the device.","ICU, Rehabilitation, Exergaming","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

Errors are introduced in a variety of ways: when operational conditions deviate from calibration, due to flow distortion and as a result of the mechanical properties of an instrument changing during its lifetime. Specific investigations on the latter source of errors have resulted in means to detect such damages, e.g. icing and bearing degradation. These methods, however, often require impractical measurement set-ups. A data-driven approach using expert knowledge of cup nemometer performance that uses two operational anemometers at the same altitude is suggested as a novel means of anomaly detection. The proposed anomaly detection model uses regression to predict the next residual between both instruments. Evaluation between measurements and predictions through confidence intervals reveal whether or not a flag is placed on the measurements. Data is obtained at the Light Mast North (LMN) in Østerild National Test Centre for Large Wind Turbines, Denmark. Wind speed measurements are taken at 10Hz from 2016-02-10 15:00 (UTC+2) until 2020-01-29 00:00 (UTC+2). The training set, used to develop the regression models, is comprised of normal data. The collocated cups show high correlation after designated filters, at both a 10-min and 10Hz scale, have removed the errors described above. Measurements of wind direction are required as well, since the residual between both instruments is dependent on where the wind is coming from. Directions where either cup is downstream of the mast are removed as well, since correlation becomes lower in these regions. Three regression models of increasing complexity are trained on a subset of data. A comparison is made between a Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), ARIMA and MultiLayer Perceptron (MLP) model. The MLP performed best in terms of false positive rate and mean squared error on a test set due to its adaptive confidence intervals and ability to model non-linearities. The trained MLP model is employed on regular time series and validation sets that contain periods of icing and structural damage. The former reveals that the number of flags is sensitive and proportional to the wind speed. At high wind speeds, the limitation of the model become clear, as it reflected a large rise in supposed anomalies. Large prediction uncertainties made it harder to detect failure at lower wind speeds, but sharp increases in the number of flags right before and after cup anemometers froze over were observed. Periods where structural damage affected the measurements stood out from normal behaviour, in terms of density of anomalies and extremeness. The promising capabilities of the MLP model are evident in that faulty events were labelled correctly, but its dependency on the magnitude of wind speed under normal operation indicates that sound user judgement is still required to interpret whether or not certain data can be deemed anomalous.","Wind Energy; Cup anemometer; Wind speed measurements; Anomaly detection; Machine learning; Data analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","European Wind Energy Masters (EWEM) | Rotor Design Track","",""

The newest generation AGVs moves efficiently and flexibly without guiding rails or fixed paths. All of these extra ingredients are causing the factory to become more complex and less transparent in the face of high demands for safety and efficiency. Humans and their robotic colleagues are in dire need of enhanced methods for information exchange. Augmented Reality (AR) is an excellent tool to provide this exchange because of its inert ability to curate visual information and untangle complexity. The goal is to improve situation awareness and safety in the factory. Analysis The Magna Steyr factory in Graz was visited so to better understand the context. Literature research provided the necessary insights into the state of the art of the smart factory and AGVs as well as the human factors involved. Design &amp; iteration To work towards the design of a solution an explorative approach was first adopted by matching different AR methodologies to different roles within the factory. This created a matrix of possible solutions. The following idea was selected: to place a projector on top of the AGV to provide visual cues to the factory worker by projecting the intention of the robot on the factory floor. An iterative approach was then adopted to develop a solution that could be mounted on top of an AGV. Validation In order to validate the presumed positive effects of this design, a between-groups study was conducted. A questionnaire research was devised in which a test-group and a control-group were shown videos of an AGV approaching the participant. The test-group videos included projected arrows while the control-group videos included no indication of the direction the AGV would take. Multiple realistic scenarios were tested to measure the response of the participants. Apart from the response of the participants, the experienced task load and situation awareness were also measured. Results &amp; conclusion It was concluded that the projection of arrows in front of an AGV improves the perceived safety of workers as well as their assessment of the robot's future actions. Participants that were shown the projected arrows had a far greater chance of executing the desired response toward the robot. Improvement with regards to the situation awareness was measured in some scenarios. Additional research and design opportunities are identified and presented in chapters 12 and 13. This project proposes a framework for future AR projects in the smart factory environment and also provides insights into the merits of using (spatial) augmented reality to facilitate communication between robots and people in the smart factory. It shows that the use of Spatial Augmented Reality can make factories safer and more efficient, paving the way for more industries to adopt AGV systems and take the next step toward the factory 4.0 paradigm.","Autonomous vehicles; Augmented Reality; Spatial Augmented Reality; Situation Awareness; smart factory; Industry 4.0; operator 4.0","en","master thesis","","","","","","https://vimeo.com/454346222","","","","","","Design for Interaction","EIT CoCoAs",""

The most important ones include the wind climate (wind speed and wind direction probability distributions), the wave climate (wave height and wave direction as well as peak frequencies of the waves, and water levels) and the soil conditions. These data in combination with the operational data of the wind turbine, such as the rotor speeds, pitch angle and yaw angle are used in dynamic simulations to determine the loads on the structure. Combining all these data correctly ensures that the support structure design, which is subject to large dynamic loads, is fitting for each specific location of the WTG. In particular, the environmental conditions should not coincide too much/often with the support structure natural frequencies, as that may result in resonance, thereby increasing fatigue life consumption. The dynamic behavior of these offshore support structures is of eminent importance. During the operation of WTGs, the actual dynamical properties of the WTG can be compared to the design. There are several reasons behind the goal of this comparison, for example verifying if the loading assumptions in the design were correct, assessing whether the life time can be extended or even whether the structure can be optimized (e.g. better foundations). Typically, this is done by comparing acceleration measurements of the WTG during idling (e.g. non-operational) conditions and applying Operational Modal Analysis algorithms. Given the high availability of modern wind turbines (e.g. &gt;95% of time in operation) such measurements cannot be done as often as desired for this purpose. Therefore, the question arises to what extent the dynamical properties of WTGs can be estimated using measurement data obtained during operational (operational) conditions. This research explores the applicability of OMA algorithms in estimating the dynamical properties: the natural frequencies, the mode shapes and modal damping for operational conditions of offshore wind turbines on monopile foundations, using the Luchterduinen offshore wind park as a case study. The OMA technique explored in this thesis is Eigensystem Realization Algorithm. Test cases were used to confirm the performance of ERA for the estimation of the dynamic parameters. Stability diagrams were used to identify poles for stable modes (frequencies) in the frequency spectrum of data samples and to estimate a correct size of the Hankel matrices. It is concluded that this preprocessing and pre-analysis of the results is important to confirm the performance of ERA to correctly identify stable modes of support structures of operational offshore WTGs.Overall, it is concluded that ERA can yield useful results in estimating the natural frequencies for both ON and OFF, provided that an automated analysis is combined with a visual analysis. Even then, the accuracy and the consistency of the identified frequencies is moderate. ERA does not perform well for estimating the mode shapes, yielding inaccurate and inconsistent results. Based on the results of this work, ERA is found not to be capable of estimating modal damping ratios. The consistency for the mode shapes is not in all cases good and further study is recommended for both the mode shapes and the modal damping ratio. Another recommendation is to further study the size of Hankel matrices for this application. Furthermore, it is advised to also investigate the use of more advanced Operational Modal Analysis algorithms. The results of this study may be used to explore differences between wind turbines with and without scour protection and also to compare identified dynamic parameters to values used in the design.","Applicability; ERA; modal parameters; operational; offshore; wind turbines","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering","",""

The Just-In-Time concept allows vessels to optimize their speed during the voyage. If a vessel earlier knows at which time it is requested to arrive at the pilot boarding place, the vessel can adapt its speed to arrive when the berth, nautical services and the fairway are available. Besides environmental reasons, shipping companies as MSC consider the Just-In-Time initiative as a major port call process optimization. It has obvious advantages for MSC since this concept aims to minimise unnecessary ad hoc waiting times and reduces fuel consumption per mile steamed. In the past, it has become clear it is extremely complicated to implement this initiative. Research is required in order to find out what needs to be improved to enable Just-In-Time arrivals and services. The current port call processes must be analysed. As start point, a case study is conducted on the port call processes of the world’s second largest shipping company in the biggest port of Europe. In this study, the current port call processes of MSC container shipping in the Port of Rotterdam are identified and improved in order to enable Just-In-Time arrivals and services. First, an actor-stakeholder analysis is conducted to understand the incentives and relations between actors involved in a port call. Subsequently, this information is used in the process analysis. In this study, the port call processes are analysed by both qualitative and quantitative research. The research has emphasized the complexity of the port call business processes. Actors primarily act on the basis of their own incentives. In order to enable Just-In-Time arrivals and services, collaboration is required among the involved actors. Today, most actors see the benefits of this concept. However, some actors are not willing to share data about their processes since this is considered as sensitive information. In case actors are willing to share data, it can be concluded that the information is not exchanged frequently enough or does often not meet any data standards. As last, this study shows that adaptations are required to the current business process of a port call in the Port of Rotterdam in order to enable Just-In-Time arrivals and services.","Port call optimization; Just-In-Time arrivals and services; MSC; Port of Rotterdam; Container shipping","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-09-10","","","","Marine Technology | Ship Design, Production and Operations | Shipping Management","",""

The extraction and processing of these resources lead to an increasing amount of greenhouse gas emissions which are warming the planet day by day. In 2016 the European Union signed the Paris-agreement. This agreement aims to avoid this dangerous climate change by limiting global warming to 1.5°C (EU, 2016). To accomplish, the Dutch government (Rijksoverheid), introduced the Klimaatakkoord. Among other things, the Klimaatakkord acknowledges the transition to a circular economy as an essential strategy to accomplish the EU goals. By 2050, the Netherlands aims to be a circular economy where products and materials are reused in endless loops. This thesis focuses on the disposal of bulky waste, such as household goods or private construction materials. These type of products are usually discarded at the municipal recycling facility. The assignment explores on behalf of de BUCH (Bergen, Uitgeest, Castricum, Heiloo) municipalities alternatives for bulky waste disposal. The project takes off at the idea of a circular centre; a concept developed by Rijkswaterstaat. Circular centres are municipal recycling facilities, where not only waste is processed but also various recycling alternatives are offered. The role of the residents living in de BUCH area is identified as key-enabler in the transition towards a local circular economy. The plans for a circular centre in de BUCH also describes the active involvement and contributions of residents as an essential success factor. Currently, only a limited amount of people is actively engaged in circular activities. To make the circular centre a broadly supported success, it requires a different attitude and behaviour towards used materials for many residents. This project investigates how resident participation in circular initiatives can be encouraged in various ways. Literature on behavioural change has been consulted and models developed by Fogg (2009), Tromp (2013) and van Lieren (2018) were practised. The current attitude and the behaviour of residents regarding product disposal was obtained through interviews and a questionnaire. New roles for the residents has been established according to this data. The roles were held against Fischer’s model for richer ecologies of participation (2011). The obtained knowledge was translated into concepts and discussed with residents. A research-through-design approach was practised to identify barriers for participation and apply universal behavioural strategies in more tangible ways. These concepts were assessed by the residents using video prototypes. The following interviews provided insight into the barriers for participation and the possible strategies that could lower them. Based on these insights and insights from earlier phases, a toolkit has been developed which helps the municipality to design initiatives together with its residents. The toolkit aims to design interventions that overcome the barriers for participation and enhance resident participation at higher levels. A number of the barriers and behavioural strategies have been evaluated through an intervention at the municipal recycling facility. The toolkit consists of 3 design canvasses poster and a card set. During the use of the toolkit, interventions are created by means of a user journey. The user journey provides an easy way to identify the barriers for participation. The included cards present a set of common barriers. The barrier cards link to strategies that can be applied to overcome them. The strategy cards can be used as an inspiration during the enhancement of new participatory circular initiatives.","Design for Participation; Behaviour Change; Circular economy; Circular behaviour; De BUCH gemeenten; Circulair Centrum De BUCH; Delft Design Labs; Participatory City Making","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

As a result, container terminals became an important part of a lot of ports worldwide while new technology was developed to encounter the increasing requirements for the operation of container terminals. A container terminal has a quite complicated operation as different kind of equipment and people need to cooperate under a strict timeline that does not tolerate mistakes. The optimisation of a container terminal can be achieved by adjusting different parameters concerning different areas or equipment of the terminal. In this project, the arrangement of the yard layout is analysed focusing on a straddle carrier operation. The comparison criterion is the mean maximum travelling distance that a straddle carrier needs to travel for a seaside job cycle, serving the quay cranes. Considering a rectangular layout, making reasonable assumptions and using simple mathematical relations, the travelling distance of straddle carriers from stacking blocks to the quay is modelled and a proposition to minimise this distance is developed. Then, assuming the speed of straddle carriers for the different areas they move, the mean maximum travelling time for a job cycle is determined. The theory is applied for the container terminal of the port of Thessaloniki in Greece and a rearrangement for its layout is proposed. Using simple mathematics, for a simple yard layout, it is possible to propose changes that, for the port of Thessaloniki, can decrease the travelling time of straddle carriers up to 10%. This result is very sensitive to the assumptions of the driving strategy that straddle carriers follow and to the pooling strategy that is applied for the stacking yard operation.","Container terminal; Yard layout; Thessaloniki; Stacking yard","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","CIE5050-09",""

Due to climate change these extremes will intensify in the future. As mankind continues to cluster in economic centre points, housing areas as well as infrastructure increases. This situation forces the water to run off rather than infiltrate. Inundated areas place a threat to health and mankind will be forced to increase the resilience in urban areas. Adaptation to more extreme weather situation on private terrain is necessary as private space contributes 50% of the area. In order to stimulate inhabitants to adapt different measures it is essential to get an idea of their receptivity. The receptivity model of Jeffrey and Seaton (2009) offers a framework to understand with which of the 4 A’s (Awareness, Association, Acquisition and Application) residents are struggling most. A sequential mixed method of combining questionnaires and focus groups was used to collect data on residents’ receptivity and perceived effectiveness of potential rainproof measures. Additionally, the hydrologic expected effectiveness of selected rainproof measures was analysed with help of the Adaptation Support Tool and compared to the perceived effectiveness. Although residents are developing all 4 A’s simultaneously to different extend and speed, it appears that residents are struggling with Awareness. Their experience with flooding and water damage reveals awareness of the issue itself; however, hesitation to implement countermeasures was noticed. The awareness of solutions is missing for more than half of the respondents. The association with their own agenda and recognising the benefits is not yet widespread among residents. The acquisition requirement of receptivity – the knowledge about implementation, operation and maintenance – is missing. It is evident that the application requirement cannot be accomplished as acquisition is absent. Residents demand additional information. The development of the 4 A’s, specifically Association and Acquisition, require more attention. Residents recognise their own responsibility for the private lot, but also shared responsibility and thus community actions are expected. Residents insist that the municipality and Waternet fulfil their tasks within their responsibilities. Transparency and communication with residents are important features, whereby provision of tailor-made advice has high importance. Recognising responsibilities and also dependencies between different stakeholders as well as knowledge requests reveal lacking receptivity and further encouragement is required. Frontrunners can hereby play an important role. The effectiveness of countermeasures is an important consideration for increasing resilience. Evidently respondents indicated rainwater barrels as possible measure to temporarily store water. Green roofs were also well known. The perceived effectiveness scored relatively high for all temporary water storage measures. The Adaptation Support Tool (AST ) calculated effectiveness between 2% and 42%, where this is a percentage of a 60mm precipitation storage target. The highest effectiveness of 42% is achieved by intensive green roofs, whereas the costs are relatively high. A rainwater pond on the other hand has low investment and maintenance costs and scored an effectiveness of 22%. Green gardens reveal higher costs, but also greater effectiveness. It is expected that all gardens already have some green spaces and a simple intervention as reducing tiles could contribute up to 30% of the target. The calculations demonstrate that none of the measures could achieve the target alone. A combination is required, whereby the order of implementation can be guided by their effectiveness and costs. For improving receptivity of residents, several points should be considered. First of all connect residents with similar issues, they possibly motivate each other and develop an urge to action. Tailor-made information improves information distribution. Residents are reluctant due to unfamiliarity with alternatives for their specific situation. It is also important that residents are aware of the effectiveness and the costs of measures for when they need to chose. The AST calculations give insight in the effectiveness and costs of measures. Transparency of tasks, responsibilities and choices of the municipality, Waternet and Amsterdam Rainproof could provide a positive mindset towards the implementation of rainproof measures. Communication about (possible) barriers might be helpful in order to prepare residents. It is important that the municipality promotes climate adaptation throughout the entire legal and organisational levels.","Receptivity; Rainproof; Climate Adaptation; Private Terrain; Resilience; Amsterdam; Awareness; Adaptation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Water Management","","52.368430, 4.857049"

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","class=""MsoNormal"">The rootzone storage capacity (Sr) is a crucial part of the hydrological cycle. This storage provides water access for vegetation, in order to meet the atmospheric water demand through transpiration. The spatio-temporal variability of Sr is not well represented in current hydrological and climate models. The root zone storage capacity receives rapidly increasing interest from scientists. Recent studies developed a climate-based method to determine Sr. This method is based on the insight that ecosystems efficiently adapt their rootzone storage capacity to survive a drought with a certain return period. However, this method requires a vast amount of data. Long hydrological time-series with a rather fine temporal resolution are required. These time-series are not always available for many poorly gauged catchments. Therefore, it is important to explore what is exactly controlling this Sr, and if we can eventually predict it.  This study aims to describe the spatial and temporal variability of Sr with a combination of climate and land cover variables in Austria for the study period 1982 - 2008. To anticipate on expected snowfall, a snowfall module is included and calibrated with the use of a MODIS satellite snow cover product. The most important climate and land cover variables are identified, using multiple linear regression analysis. The best performing regression models are selected with a diverse combination of variables. This is done by comparing 21 catchments across the central and eastern part of Austria. Additionally, a stationary time-series split method is used to explore how Sr is changing in time. Subsequently, another multiple linear regression analysis is performed to explore the controls of the dynamics of Sr for these catchments.  According to this study, the Run-off coefficient describes Sr best in all studied regression models. A multiple linear regression model compiled out of the Run-off coefficient and the seasonality index performed best with an R2adj of 0.8. The seasonality index seems to be specific for this study since the highest fraction of precipitation and evaporation coincides in summer.  Land cover seems of less importance for the estimation of Sr. However, no conclusion could be drawn for the importance of land cover types in the regression analysis considering the disputable applicability of the land cover data. Furthermore, the relations of fractional cropland cover and fractional forest cover with Sr are in contradiction with current literature.  Apart from the spatial relationships, it is discovered that on average increased from the year 1992 onwards. However, no indisputable explanation is encountered (R2adj 0.55). The decreasing Run-off coefficient explains most of the increase in Sr. No conclusions could be drawn on the influence of land cover change on Sr, caused by an irregular land cover time-series.  Since the catchments in this study are rather humid and have similar seasonal patterns, it would be interesting to investigate if the discovered relationships are also valid for more arid and seasonal varying catchments. Also, it would be useful to investigate the unexpected relationship between land cover and Sr further.","Rootzone; Hydrology; Austria","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Water Management","",""

The dissolution of AgNPs is an important property that has a direct impact on human health and the natural environment. Understanding the dissolution behaviour of nanoparticles in liquid suspensions is essential for predicting their potential toxic effect in organisms, ranging from viruses and bacteria to humans. Moreover, the dissolution rate of nanoparticles can explain some of their disinfecting properties, which are important for sanitation. The objective of this study is to determine the dissolution behaviour of AgNPs in pure water and to improve our understanding of its most fundamental principles. Dissolution constants of AgNPs found in literature span over a wide range, indicating that improvement of the measuring method is needed. AgNPs in this study were produced in a principally impurity-free way, from the gas phase, after which they were transferred into liquid solutions. The purity of the particles produced in this study is in principle higher compared to those used until now, which allows for higher precision in determining the dissolution constant. Measuring the silver ion concentration in the resulting liquid solutions (i.e., after introducing the AgNPs in the solution) with an ICP-MS at specific time intervals gave direct information on the dissolution kinetics. The experiments were repeated with particles having diameters from 7 to 12 nm and, as expected, dissolution kinetics were found to be highly dependent on particle size. The determined dissolution constants are in the same order of magnitude as the values reported in literature. To further improve the reliability of the measurements, the experiment needs to be repeated using different methods for transferring the particles into the liquid, given that the used bubbling method showed deficiencies.","Nanoparticles; Silver; Dissolution; Toxicity; Solubility; Kinetics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Environmental Engineering","",""

Noise pollution continues to increase while it is accompanied by direct, as well as cumulative adverse health effects. In addition, prolonged exposure to excessive noise levels also has a negative economic impact. The incorporation of numerical tools in the design process could counter this problem. However, traditional models are not widely available or often simplified. This illustrates the complexity of the matter, as noise is influenced by a variety of acoustic propagation effects. Moreover, the focus is predominantly on noise from railways and roads or for indoor settings. Little information is available about the dispersion of sound around buildings emitted by overhead sound sources, i.e. aircraft. This means that most numerical models neglect or simplify meteorological effects, which may result in misinterpretation of the urban noise situation. This graduation thesis addresses the question whether the design of the build environment can yield a reduction in aircraft induced noise, including the presence of a downward refracting atmosphere. The outcome may assist architects and urban designers to improve the soundscape quality in areas affected by aircraft noise. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the application of a self-made low turbulence wind tunnel is explored to perform scale model measurements that could be extended towards a full-size experiment in future studies. The wind tunnel was able to generate a uniform velocity profile which was suited to be used in this experiment. However, limitations were observed considering higher order wind tunnel reflections and masking of sound by the fan. In addition, a CFD study was performed to get insights into the interference between geometric configurations and flow patterns inside the wind tunnel. The building geometry influences the sound pressure level near the façade without a line of sight towards the sound source. The differences between the geometries studied in this thesis increased for decreasing grazing angles. The results also suggest the independency of canyon width on the shielding performance in case of treated canyon facades (covered with sound absorbing material), obstructed sound paths and absence of wind. In the presence of wind, sound pressure levels were further reduced for smaller treated canyons. Moreover, the results demonstrate a strong downward refracting atmospheric effect which increases the sound pressure levels inside shielded canyons. Flat roofs reduce wind effects which means that the effects of a downward refracting atmosphere are less intense compared more common typologies containing e.g. gabled roof tops.","acoustics; urban acoustics; aircraft induced sound; downward refracting atmosphere; scale model test; wind tunnel; CFD; urban design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Building Engineering","",""

Treatment for the most frequently diagnosed forms of osteoarthritis, knee and hip respectively, involves the removal of damaged tissue and placing an artificial total joint replacement (TJR), restoring partial mobility and relieving pain.

During this study, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) bioreactor model was adjusted to fit these PEO + AgNPs implants and test them in conditions of bacterial adherence. Robustness and bacterial adherence were optimized for this adjusted method, where despite thorough troubleshooting inconsistent behaviour was found in the bacterial concentrations in the reactor media in an illogical manner. Dynamic conditions of this reactor caused by the fluid flow were analysed by simulation, this resulted in a calculated shear stress of 0.0058 dynes/cm2, akin to the lower limit magnitude of shear stresses caused by interstitial fluid.

Presently, solar PV systems are not modelled in detail in the current dynamic grid model of TenneT. However, due to the flourishing of solar PV systems and lessening of synchronous generators, the role of solar PV systems on the dynamic behaviour of power systems keeps increasing hence an increased need for detailed modelling is necessary. In this thesis report, solar PV systems i.e. large-scale solar PV systems and aggregation of distributed solar PV systems, are modelled according to the requirements of the Dutch gridcode (netcode) and the European 'Requirements for Generators'. Additionally, a standard modelling approach, including proper selection of models and a default parameter set, for representation of large-scale and aggregated PV systems is developed. Following this, the analysis of transient- and voltage stability is firstly conducted on an IEEE 9 bus network with different PV penetration levels.

Stability tests require the minimisation of the tangent plane distance, which is derived from the excess Gibbs Energy. The VLE problem and stability tests have been approached from a viewpoint based in mathematical optimisation, not one based in thermodynamics. As such, this work provides a slightly different description of flash calculations and stability tests, and can serve as both an introduction to the problems, as well as an approach to the problem in a different way than is traditionally done. In this report, the tangent plane distance function has been studied and applied to an example to gain intuition on the problem, and different optimisation methods were considered for minimising this function. A stochastic- and a deterministic method were applied to the stability problem to gain a better understanding of which type of method will work better for minimising the tangent plane distance. Both methods seem sufficient, but the scalability to higher dimensions is lacking, especially in the deterministic case.","Flash Calculation; Stability Test; Nonlinear Optimisation; Thermodynamics; Mathematics; Vapor-liquid phase equilibrium","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-09-09","","","","Applied Mathematics","",""

One of its main limitations is the relatively long imaging times, to overcome this issue and speed up the data acquisition, several techniques such as Parallel Imaging or PI have been developed. These techniques require advanced hardware and software to be able to decrease the acquisition time. On the hardware side, a highly efficient insert gradient coil has been designed and built at the University Medical Center Utrecht. Specialized software has to be implemented to optimally make use of this hardware. One of the recently proposed PI methods called Wave-CAIPI has been proved to achieve a ninth fold acceleration factor without compromising image quality. This project aims to investigate the time gain that can be achieved when combing the insert gradient coil with a Wave-CAIPI strategy. Two main aspects are reviewed. The first one is the maximum achievable under-sampling factor that does not compromise image quality. The second one is the decrease in acquisition time that can be obtained when using the insert gradient coil compared to conventional gradient systems while maintaining image quality. To do so, the strategy has been implemented and extensive simulations have been performed to optimize the MR acquisition parameters. To prove the results from the simulations, the Wave-CAIPI sequence was implemented in a 7T scanner at the UMCU, where the acquired data was retrospectively under-sampled, obtaining the wave image to be further reconstructed. Limitations of previous works on Wave-CAIPI have been the gradient specifications, which can be overcome by the high-efficiency coil. It has been concluded that shorter acquisition times without compromising image quality are possible when using the insert coil compared with conventional systems. The time gain can be up to a factor of five, and sixteen fold under-sampling factors could be possible. The time gain can be especially useful for Echo Planar Imaging sequences, where switching faster gradients allows to acquire more signals in less time. The next steps for this research are to prospectively under-sample the data in a Wave-CAIPI fashion with a sixteen under-sampling factor and corroborate if sequences such as Echo Planar Imaging can be benefited with the time gain.","MRI; Parallel Imaging; Wave-CAIPI; Image processing; Insert gradient coil","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Circuits and Systems","",""

For that reason, structural mitigation measures were built, including floodwalls along the channel and a pumping station at the outlet. However, no operational rules were available for operating the river outlet structures and inundation was still common. To prevent or reduce flooding by improving the operational management of the outlet pumping system, an early warning system was required. The objective of this research was to assess whether informed decision-making resulted in an operational pumping strategy that prevents or reduces fluvial flooding. First, the question was asked whether water level monitoring could result in a timely and reliable warning service for an early warning system. The second question was whether timely operation of the outlet pumping station prevented fluvial flooding. For the fulfillment of the data requirements in this thesis, a fieldwork trip was organized first. During a short period of dedicated data survey, water level time series and river geometries were obtained. Water levels from three gauging stations were statistically tested as precursors for fluvial flooding in Tub Ma. Consequently, a hydraulic model was built to assess the flood mitigation capabilities of the outlet pumping station. Lastly, synthetic flood design hydrographs were run through the model for different pumping station operation strategies, with and without notification from a flood early warning system. The results from this thesis demonstrated that monitoring water levels in the upstream tributaries of Tub Ma was a useful information source for an early warning system that forecasts flood waves. This water level based early warning enabled a maximum potential lead time of 13-15 hours for flood mitigation. Nevertheless, connecting flood early warning to the operation of the pumping station did not reduce or prevent flooding. The Tub Ma river had a flow regime of limited baseflow and rapidly rising discharge, and as a result, the discharge capacity of the pumping station ahead of flood waves was physically limited by water level and inflow. Therefore, improved operation of the pumping station was not the solution for preventing or reducing fluvial flooding. On the basis of the results from this research, structural measures were suggested for flood mitigation, like temporary storage, a bypass channel, and measures that slow down the run-off processes. Also, it was recommended to examine the value of a flood early warning system by using 13-15 hours of lead time within a broader scope of disaster risk reduction in Tub Ma.","Urban watermanagement; Flood early warning; Pumping station control; Fluvial floods; Urbanisation; Thailand; Rayong","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Water Management | Hydrology","",""

It is a caisson-like structure, which houses a water column in an enclosed chamber with an inlet at the bottom. Waves enter the device, exciting the water column. The trapped air above is forced out through a turbine, generating electricity. The technology is relatively young compared to other sources of renewable energy, such as solar or wind energy. This makes the produced energy expensive, expressed in the Levelised Cost of Energy (LCOE). Integrating devices into breakwaters already resulted in a large reduction of the costs, as they now can be shared. During the design of such devices, main attention is given to the geometrical design. This should be based on local wave conditions to ensure the largest energy production. Having the eigenperiod match with the incident wave period enhances the resonance effect in the chamber. This research explores the potential to reduce the costs of OWC devices integrated in breakwaters through means of structural optimisation. The structural are built quite robust, leaving the thought there is room for improvement. The device in Civitavecchia, Italy was used as a case study. A new method was adopted to investigate the potential. A numerical model was constructed in STAR-CCM+, including both a fluid domain and a solid domain. The two are one-way coupled, from water to structure. The exerted wave pressures are mapped on the structure directly, resulting in a stress state in the OWC structure. Due to the transient nature of the simulations, all results are available through time. It was found, the main walls shaping the OWC device could be built with 35% less material. Variants of the original geometry were tested as well to see how these influence the results. Furthermore, the structural behaviour was investigated. Clear trends were found in position and timing of governing load combinations in the different walls. One of the most important findings was that the governing load case always was in the direction of the transverse width. The walls were found to behave more like beams in this direction. The bending moments could therefore easily be calculated using standard beam equations and the net horizontal pressure on the wall as load. This leads to the beginning of a new simplified design method where the full numerical structural analysis is not required anymore.","Oscillating Water Column (OWC); Structural Optimization; Structural Behavior; Numerical modelling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering | Hydraulic Structures","",""

Currently a major tool used to detect and diagnose the glioma is MRI scan. To better analyze the medical image, segmentation is usually conducted as a basic step for further processing, which partitions an integrate image into multiple physically meaningful regions by annotating objects and boundaries. Deep learning based segmentation methods have attracted significant interest due to their high efficiency and strong generalization ability. With the increasing demands of high-quality segmentation of bio-tissues in medical region, plenty of innovative approaches were proposed to expand the boundary of segmentation capability of deep learning models by taking the spatial or temporal constraints of bio-structure into consideration. Although longitudinal segmentation in 2D natural image sequences has made a lot of success, the potential of deep learning network in segmenting a series of chronological 3DMRI images in terms of improving consistency remains unclear. This thesis aims to investigate whether deep learning models are able to increase segmentation accuracy as well as consistency in longitudinal 3D images, specifically focusing on introducing Recurrent Neural Network(RNN) to 3D Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) for 4D segmentation. In addition to the implementation of several U-Net variants as CNN backbone, three types of longitudinal connection strategies are proposed. A hierarchical workflow is followed to create the optimal version of longitudinal network based on combining multiple CNN variants and connection strategies. The evaluation of the 4D network shows that segmentation accuracy of the longitudinal model is limited by its CNN backbone and temporal information can partially improve the segmentation consistency with regard to maintaining the highest proportion of normal tissue unchangeable over time.","4D segmentation; segmentation consistency; brain tumor segmentation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Biomechanical Design - BioRobotics","",""

The 2D axisymmetric nacelle is parameterised and analysed for the cruise and take-off conditions using an Euler solver to find the optimum Pareto front. Several test cases were optimised, where every case analysed 700 geometries within two days. It was found that a higher and rounder lip, and more forward maximum diameter at the fan cowl improve the performance in both conditions. Longer and steeper bypass ducts improve the pressure force in take-off. The test cases did not converge completely due to the randomly generated initial population. Especially the stricter hot &amp; high take-off condition converged to a local Pareto front. A better and larger initial population with lower crossover and mutation operators are recommended to speed up the convergence.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering | Flight Performance and Propulsion","",""

Famous furniture seller IKEA, being no different. IKEA is currently active in 52 countries and is still growing strongly, so more and more people of different cultures are coming together because of it. IKEA’s culture has been formed through out the years and has the potential to help achieve great things. However, the IKEA sales coworkers do not have an incentive, nor the time to deepen their knowledge about the IKEA culture and its values. They therefore do not identify with it and do not use it in their every workday actions. This is bad for the IKEA brand and reduces the chances of company success. The IKEA culture is designed at the inter IKEA office, but has a different result on the actual work-floor. In order to bridge that gap, this report takes a unique bottom up-approach, while at the same time maintaining a top-down view. This is achieved by creating solutions for and together with the IKEA sales employees, while keeping the global view of the IKEA office in mind, and is supported by the fact that I (the author) am one of the very few coworkers at IKEA, that has worked in the store and at the office at the same time. Providing me with the opportunity to take the role of both main stakeholders; the end-users (the store coworkers) and the client (the IKEA franchisor). A work-culture is the result of employees living the company's key values in combination with their personal values. It is shaped by stories, artefacts, routines, rituals and symbols. All of which are researched through out this project. After the research grounded in literature, a lot of field research was also done. The main conclusions being that the current knowledge of culture was lacking among IKEA coworkers (for example; only 12 out of the 85 participants could say how many key values IKEA has), that the introduction of new coworkers would be the moment of intervention and lastly, that the intervention can have the biggest impact on sales employees. To support the bottom-up approach a thorough co-creation process took place. Lots of ideas were created in this session. They were clustered and detailed and eventually formed the inspiration behind three concepts; a strategic monthly intervention that addresses all key values, a board game that introduces those values and strategically designed ritual of introducing new coworkers to the IKEA culture. The concepts were presented to IKEA and all of the reactions were very positive, so a final concept was detailed. The final intervention revolves around the moment the new coworker receives his/her coworker uniform and consists of four parts: 1. the story the manager will tell the new coworker, 2. a key values box, 3. the new design of the IKEA clothing, with the key values printed on the inside, 4. a letter for inside the box. For each part a list of design criteria and design examples were given. The intervention can be tested at IKEA Delft, but has the potential to scale up to international levels. It has the opportunity to bring people from all over the world together under a common goal and to, in the end, create a better everyday life for the many people.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

Microflow plays a vital role in OOC applications, thus a microfluidic platform that can generate high-quality flow is always needed. However, the existing OOC systems contain bulky peripheral components, incompact design and low-quality fluid flow (bubbles and fluctuations). To deal with these issues, a portable and integrated OOC flow control platform system has been developed. The platform is designed for three kinds of popular Organ-On-Chip models: Lung-On-Chip, Gut-On-Chip and Tissue-On-Chip,and is able to change the fluid (both liquid and gas) automatically and control their flow rate on the chip. The fluid actuation is based on a stable vacuum tank and therefore can create high-quality flow without fluctuations. PID flow controllers are used to maintain the desired flow rate under a constant pressure difference created by the vacuum pump. By integrating with other predetermined off-the-shelf components with small footprints, the platform realized is 290mm long, 240mm wide and 220mm tall, and weighs 4.8 kg in total. The system is highly modular with capability to exchange the necessary components, and can be placed under the optical microscope (upright or inverted) to monitor inside the microfludic chip without having to disconnect. It can also be placed inside an incubator for continuous controlled fluid flow in the OOC. The system works on a rechargeable battery that can be easily changed to support long-term cell culture. The setup consumes a minimum of 7.2W and a maximum of 11.5W power.","OOC platform; fluid handling; portable; off-the-shelf components","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-02-10","","","","","",""

The earthquakes cause damage to the buildings situated in the Groningen area, and they constitute a potential danger for the safety of the residents. These buildings are typically unreinforced masonry structures which are designed without knowledge of the presence of seismic activity in this area. <br/><br/>It is therefore essential develop and use assessment methods that are on one end reliable and accurate, but on the other hand allow to perform a large number of assessments of the vulnerability of the buildings in a short time. In other words, the assessment of all the buildings requires a quick and reliable assessment method. Such an assessment method should offer a strong understanding of the occurring failure mechanism during an earthquake, an acceptable prediction of the ground acceleration at which the collapse of the building may occur (maximum base shear force) and the displacement capacity of unreinforced masonry (URM) building. <br/><br/>The NPR9998 recommends four seismic assessment approaches, which differ in complexity and assessment time needed to be performed. The most comprehensive and time-consuming assessment method is the NLTHA (nonlinear time history analysis), which includes both the dynamic and nonlinear effects. In practice, this method is used only in special cases, such as in the case of monumental buildings. A simpler approach is the NLPO (nonlinear pushover) analysis, which is static and considers the nonlinear properties of the structure. An NLPO is less time consuming than an NLTHA, even when the finite element method (FEM) is considered. <br/><br/>A more simplified approach is the Simple Lateral Mechanism Analysis (SLaMA). This method is a simplified mechanism-based analytical approach. If the SLaMA method predicts realistically conservative global capacities, it could serve as an effective alternative assessment method for URM buildings, and especially to the NLPO FEM analysis. This study focusses on the comparison between the SLaMA method and the NLPO FEM analysis. Therefore, this study aims to answer the following research question: <br/><br/>Could the SLaMA method be a realistically conservative and effective alternative to the NLPO FEM analysis in making a seismic assessment for two-storey unreinforced masonry buildings? <br/><br/>In conclusion, the SLaMA method could be a realistically conservative and effective alternative to the NLPO FEM analysis in predicting the maximum base shear force. The displacement capacity predicted using the SLaMA method is validated only for buildings with RC floors. This predicted SLaMA method was realistically conservative compared with the ultimate displacement achieved using the NLPO FEM analysis. The SLaMA method is overall suitable for obtaining a quick understanding of the behaviour of an URM building. However, it requires a proper evaluation of the analyses to identify properly the type and the location of the failure mechanisms. For this reason, this method could be valuable to be applied before using a more complex assessment method.<br","SLaMa; Unreinforce masonry structures; seismic analysis; Groningen; Groningen earthquakes; Nonlinear finite element analysis; Pushover analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

When designing a CLT core, significantly larger core sections will be needed than when designing a stabilizing core in concrete. This is for one part due to the limited stiffness of the CLT compared to concrete. For another part it is due to the limited stiffness of connectors in CLT. Sliding and uplift can occur in connections in CLT loaded in tension and shear respectively. The CLT panels behave like rigid bodies, with most of the displacement occurring at the connections. In addition, cooperation between flange and web may be limited, depending on the stiffness of the corner connection and the occurrence of shear lag. Post-tensioning is suggested as a solution to diminish uplift and sliding in the connectors. In this way, with the same core section, a taller building may be realized compared to the non-post-tensioned case. In the thesis also the long-term effects on the prestress level is assessed, as estimating these effects is important for the safety of the system.<br/>This thesis adds to the body of knowledge on post-tensioned CLT structures. Firstly, previous studies on post-tensioned CLT focus on individual shear walls and on seismic design situations. This thesis explores how beneficial post-tensioning is from the perspective of serviceability limit state governed design. Furthermore, though post-tensioning as a prestressing method has been applied often in concrete structures, prestressing of CLT is a novel research subject. Especially the estimation of long-term force loss is a topic that still requires research. This thesis provides the designer with a straightforward calculation method (using python) for estimation of prestress force loss in the long-term.<br/>The research was carried out with a literature study and a case-study. The literature research comprised of studies on structural design with CLT loaded in-plane; the effective flange of a CLT core; stiffness of connections in CLT; prestressing of CLT; a design approach for post-tensioning; time dependent losses in post-tensioned CLT. The case study was based on a fictitious floorplan including a “minimal core”, and at expressing the benefit of post-tensioning in terms of height gain.<br/>The degree to which the flange and the web cooperate showed highly dependent on the connection between flange and web and the core height. In the case study, the effective flange width showed to depend highly on the height of the core and the stiffness of the connection between flange and web.<br/>In the case-study, without post-tensioning, approximately half of the displacements could be attributed to the connections. With post-tensioning, the uplift and sliding displacements in the horizontal joints was eliminated. Consequently, the attainable height was significantly increased: from 5 storeys in the un-post-tensioned case, to 8 storeys in the post-tensioned case. Long-term effects on the prestress loss were considerable. In the case-study, approximately 40% loss of post-tension force in the lifetime of the building was predicted and included in the design. Largest causeof force loss was due to changes of moisture content during construction. The remaining lateral displacements after post-tensioning were due to bending and shear.<br/>Post-tensioning of CLT cores is a powerful method for reducing lateral displacements in cases where uplift and sliding are dominant contributors to the lateral displacements. This is especially the case in light-weight buildings. Uplift and sliding displacements can be eliminated altogether with post-tensioning. The designer should realize that post-tensioning does not increase the bending and shear stiffness of the core. The thesis also concludes that with the post-tensioning of CLT walls, the compressive strength of the CLT in the so-called “compression-toe” might be exceeded. It is an important check in design. Furthermore, depending on the decision to re-tighten the rods at some point or not, the post-tension force loss should be calculated and included in finding the right prestress level. For this estimation of the moisture level of the CLT proved to be an important but difficult step. It is likely that the 40% force loss in the case-study is on the conservative side, since a large change in moisture content has been assumed. In practice, the moisture content can be measured on site. This can help verify the assumptions on the moisture content used in force loss calculations. This can help in assuring the structure is safe in the long-term.<br","Cross laminated Timber; stability system; Prestressed; Prestress loss; effective flange; shear lag; post-tensioning; creep; shrinkage","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering","",""

In order to set up proper assessment methods that result in an economicaland ecological policy for renovation or replacement of these structures the Port of Rotterdamhas asked Delft University of Technology to assist them. This thesis focusses onthe elements perhaps most prone to decay and hardest to inspect: the timber foundationsimplemented in quay walls with relieving platforms from the late 19th and early20th century. The main research question of this thesis is What is the (remaining) capacityof the timber foundation of a quay wall with relieving platform? and focusses onthe Maaskade case. The aim is the provision of a structural analysis and appointmentof weakspots on a representative quay section build-up using measured material characteristics.This quay has partially collapsed and has been replaced as of May 2020. 45Timber piles from the site have been investigated in the Rotterdam harbour to derivedensity and (dynamic) Young’s modulus measured by a Timber Grader MTG. A selectionof these piles was then further tested in pieces (21) at the TU Delft structural laboratory(Stevin II) to derive the Young’s modulus and compressive strength. Using the correlationfound between the compressive strength parallel to the fibre ( fc,0) and the dynamicYoung’s modulus parallel to the fibre (E0) the compressive strength values of the entire45 pile group have been derived. This results in fc,0,k = 12.64 MPa and E0,mean = 11.3GPa under 50% moisture content, the saturated state the wood is expected to be in inthe quay. The resulting design strength fc,0,d = 10.7MPa is very much in line with the advisedstrength of 10.8 MPa in NEN 8707 . Missing characteristics necessary for structuralassessment are used from bending class C22 (sawn timber) from EN 338 . A FEMmodel of section 4-1 of theMaaskade under different historical build ups has been set upin Plaxis 2D, and an Ultimate Limit State computation has been carried out on the finalbuild-up before replacement under four load cases. The found normative location thatcan be seen as the weakspot is the joint between the raking pile and the adjacent cappingbeam. A structural assessment based on sectional forces results in a negative outcome ofthe structure even on the self weight governed loadcase as unity checks &gt; 3 are given for thecapping beam. These results do have the shortcomings due to simplifications from 3D to2D and a modelling with linear elements with no volume in the model and no allowancefor further load distribution beyond elasticity. A definite answer on the capacity in termsof additional external loads cannot be given and the need for a model that incorporatesthe exact lay out and positioning of the loads is stressed. Further recommendations forpractice are to find out if the capping beam- pile connections are expected to be able totake tension and to name their state after an inspection.","Timber Piles; Quay walls; Timber Foundation; Historical Quay Walls; Maaskade Rotterdam","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Building Engineering - Structural Design","","51.912278, 4.490778"

Nowadays, 44% of young adults, say that money is their main reason for suffering from stress (Pew Research Center, 2020). Most of the young adults (62%) don't feel financially stable and about two-thirds state that they are living short on money, from pay-day to pay-day (CNBC, 2019). They usually have student debt, a harder time getting a mortgage and a permanent contract and on average fewer earnings than previous generations. <br/><br/>The problem of money and young adults is very common and could be scalable all over the world.

A lack of motivation and trust in financial services and of tools to create better money behaviour with a focus on the long-term goals for millennials was found. <br/><br/>This graduation project has the goal of helping young adults with low financial capabilities that are in the contemplation stage (Prochaska 1979; Prochaska and DiClemente 1983) to change their current financial behaviour for one that improves their financial health in the future by offering tailored solutions.<br/><br/>The whole project followed a double-diamond process (TU Delft, 2019) and was performed following a user-centred design and strategic design approach. For this project Research consisted of user and context research. Including activities like literature analysis, user and expert interviews, online surveys, benchmark analysis of competitors, creative sessions and desk analysis. These activities were useful to understand the Target group on a deeper level. The research phase studied the young adult's ambitions, problems, goals, values and needs about finances, as well as their behavioural, financial, demographical and cultural context. The user research insights combined with the contextual research insights were analysed and combined with a result of a problem definition and a design direction.<br/><br/>The design direction looked into the use of Artificial Intelligence and social features to support people to create better money behaviour. The design direction was framed together with the design goal and vision. As a design vision, the financial journey was compared to a car journey and the solution of a navigation app indicated inspiring qualities and affordances to use as a starting point in the new phase of the project: ideation. The ideation phase consisted of a creative session, a definition of the key experiences and a creation of several concepts that after being tested and iterated in different levels of fidelity, lead to the final design. <br/><br/>Finally, the report finishes with a definition of the final concept: SARA.AI, that supports young adults to become financially free by offering user-tailored solutions. SARA is a user-centred financial robot-advisor that is personalised and always available for the user, giving real-time information of the financial situation, and focused on improving the financial behaviour of the people. It’s about substituting the experience of having a financial advisor by a service which is user-centred designed, accessible, and smarter. SARA helps people by the use of three core experiences: Setting either spending limits or saving goals every month for the users, visualising the daily/monthly progress on a roadmap showing the future financial goals and the estimated time of arrival and using the power of social rewards and achievements to motivate users to keep improving.<br/><br/>SARA.AI means financial freedom. It is about giving the users the power to live the life that they want. To choose their goals, the way to reach them, and to take control of their lives. Not only for people with knowledge in finances but for everyone.","financial health; artificial intelligence; money management; behavioural change; fin-tech; interaction design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The understanding of the physiological and biological processes of the inside micro-climate and crop, as well as the introduction of climate control, were critical for improving both the quality and production rate. Advanced control strategies like MPC involve the application of horticultural and plant physiological knowledge using mathematical models that describe the dynamical behavior of the greenhouse and crop. An on-line control method balances the benefits of crop yield and costs of the climate control equipment. The increasing production and cultivation rate in response to the growing demand is at a point where the focus and tension is shifted to the energy input and environmental footprint of greenhouse operations. This stimulates the agricultural industry to provide sustainable solutions. An innovative greenhouse is developed by BBBLS Solutions, that uses a soap bubble cavity which improves the thermal properties and energy efficiency. The concept is in development phase and is acknowledged that there is potential for improved climate control and automation of the control of the soap bubble cavity. This research introduces a MPC strategy for controlling the greenhouse climate and the soap bubble cavity. The greenhouse processes are described by a mechanistic model, which simulates the inside climate variables as a function of the greenhouse structure, outside environmental conditions and climate control equipment. The dynamics of the soap bubble cavity and the corresponding thermal varying properties were then augmented in the climate model. The augmented model is used as a predictor for the future dynamics of the greenhouse climate, for which the optimizer generates a control input sequence for the climate control equipment and soap bubble generators inside the cavity. The MPC implementation results demonstrate that the greenhouse temperature can be controlled within the pre-defined bounds and that the filling of the soap bubble cavity is with respect to outside conditions and priorities. Furthermore, the MPC strategy supports real-time control as the CPU time can be less than the time between control instances. The proposed methodology is an initial attempt but proves to be a promising concept for further development.","MPC; Greenhouse; Climate; Control","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-09-01","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

The scope of the project is to generate new knowledge on the challenges that organizations face to engage business customers into their internal innovation processes. Research shows that, in B2B settings, customer involvement is one of the critical success factors for meaningful service innovation. Structuring such engagements bring to less uncertain results.<br/>In collaboration with the Innovation Labs of ING Bank, the project applies a service-centred design approach to understand the barriers for smooth customer involvement in innovation, defining a new process to structure the early stages of development taking into account the experiences of the stakeholders involved. Different research activities were conducted within the case study in collaboration with innovators, service designers, and front office professionals to explore the problem areas and define the most important challenges as experienced by professionals working on new service development in the context of B2B corporate finance. The research, both in literature and in the case study, has provided a picture of the intrinsic complexity of these processes, especially in the fuzzy front end, which is usually experimental, chaotic, difficult to plan and unpredictable. The challenges highlighted from the research are linked to a current barrier present between innovation Labs and the front office department of the bank, which is the one directly involved in customer-facing activities. This barrier prevents the smooth involvement of customers in new service development practices. Focusing on the challenges and using an iterative design approach, I have developed a new process and the tools needed to structure collaboration between the front office department and the innovation Labs to ultimately support customer-centricity in the fuzzy front end of innovation.The concept proposed specifically focuses on the role of Relationship Managers as key elements to facilitate and sensitize clients on collaborative solution development. By creating a new way of working based on trust and transparency, relationship managers will be enabled to have a proactive approach towards innovation, supporting internal projects in reaching out to the bank’s clients base for co-creation. The final proposal is centred on three main points: Providing a structure and a way of working to facilitate collaboration between the innovation Labs and colleagues working in the front office with client-facing roles.Providing tools to support the new role of RMs as a facilitator of innovation practices and mediator between customers and initiatives. Providing a customer-centric approach to solution ideation that focuses on real contextual understanding of the client’s problems to define solutions that bring real value to customers. The tools presented in the process have been tested with front office professionals in the case study through digital prototype testing.The results of the test show that the introduction of a common way of working between innovation and the front office department will greatly enhance trust in the innovation process and collaboration between the two areas of the organization. ","Service Design; New service Development; Innovation; B2B","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","Atolls and coral islands in and around the Pacific and Atlantic Ocean largely rely on coral reefs for their coastal protection. On these reefs a large roughness is created by different coral species. The dissipative character of these species reduces the incident wave height, thereby reducing the amount of run-up on the coast. In our current society we are confronted with large issues due to climate change such as global sea level rise and temperature rise. Because of these issues, coral reefs are more prone to bleaching and degradation. Research has also shown that the wave climate will intensify due to sea level rise. As the sea level will rise globally, the water level above the rough coral elements will increase leading to less wave dissipation and more extreme wave conditions at the coast. It is therefore of vast importance to gather more knowledge about the dissipative character of corals to quantify the risks coral reef islands and atolls will face in the coming decades due to climate change. <br/><br/>For this master thesis, an experimental study was performed in the wave flume of the Fluid Mechanics Laboratory of the Technical University of Delft, investigating dissipation rates due to complex corals. 384 corals were reproduced and exposed to 21 different wave conditions. It was found that the presence of corals significantly enhanced dissipation rates. Shallower water depths, higher wave frequencies, and higher wave heights positively influenced the dissipation rates due to the corals. By increasing the amount of corals in flumewise direction and over the cross section, rates also increased. <br/><br/>Lowe et al. (2005b) and Lowe et al. (2007) developed a canopy model that is able to estimate in-canopy flow velocities and dissipation rates due to coral canopies. In the final part of this thesis, this canopy model was assessed and its output was compared with the experimental results. In general, the model predictions were in good agreement with the experimental results. <br/><br/>The research presented in this thesis is a contribution to the understanding of hydrodynamic processes around coral reefs. The good performance of the analytical model of Lowe et al. (2005b) and Lowe et al. (2007) can be of value for quantifying risks atolls and coral reef islands will face in the coming decades. The model can also be used to estimate the impact of coral restoration projects, when coastal protection is of the essence.<br","Coral; Reef; Wave dissipation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(mentor); Langeveld, J.G. (graduation committee); Winsemius, H.C. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","Continuous functioning of sewer systems and water distribution networks is crucial for liveability, public health and economic prosperity in urban areas. Progressive deterioration of these underground water infrastructures leads to an increased probability of failure. Maintenance is needed to ensure a desired level of functioning. For municipalities and drinking water companies as asset owners, the trend is to develop risk-based asset management. A risk-based asset management strategy links the likelihood of failure with the consequences. Hence, knowledge is needed on the condition of the underground water infrastructure and the consequences in case of failure. Within this strategy, a risk assessment should be performed to prioritise the maintenance and renewal of underground water infrastructure. Based on their criticality, resources can be applied appropriately. The more critical a conduit segment, the more important it is to perform maintenance. To contribute to risk-based asset management, this study investigates the consequences of failure in sewer systems and water distribution networks. In this research, a methodology is developed for mapping consequences of underground water infrastructure failure to guide asset management. Including the consequences of underground water infrastructure failure in the risk determination may lead to a different prioritisation of maintenance activities. Three failure mechanisms are considered: structural sewer failure, hydraulic sewer failure and water distribution network failure. Structural sewer failure leads to partial or complete loss of the load-carrying capacity, whereas hydraulic sewer failure occurs when a system does not meet serviceability requirements for system performance. For water distribution networks, it is assumed that hydraulic failure (caused by overpressure) and structural failure occur simultaneously. Hence, no distinction is made between failure mechanisms in water distribution networks. Using a screening method, the consequences of underground water infrastructure failure are mapped. The consequences of failure are expressed as the affected area and the characteristics of the built environment. The affected area consists of the sinkhole area and the flood zone. The characteristics of the built environment are displayed by means of consequence categories. Within this study, five different consequence categories are taken into account, using hydraulic modelling and (open) classified data. The consequence categories are: 1) Damage to buildings 2) Traffic obstruction 3) Impact on human health 4) Costs of conduit reconstruction 5) Drinking water supply outage. A flat, typical Dutch study area in Tuindorp (Utrecht) is used to test the methodology. For these five consequence categories, findings are illustrated and compared with the results of the hydraulic network functioning according to the Graph Theory method (GTM). This GTM determines the effects of failure of individual conduits on the functioning of a system as a whole, based on a simplified network structure using links and nodes. Results of the analyses show a positive relation between the individual consequences in case of hydraulic sewer failure. For example, critical conduits in the category `damage to buildings', are critical for `impact on human health' as well. Besides, there is a positive relation between the consequence categories and the hydraulic network functioning. Conduits with large diameters are stated as critical for both methods, yet dead-end segments are only critical for hydraulic network functioning. Contradictory, individual consequences are uncorrelated for structural sewer failure and water distribution network failure. The consequences are independent and can not be linked. Besides, there is no relation between the hydraulic network functioning and the individual consequences of structural sewer failure and water distribution network failure.","sewer network; Water Distribution Network; Asset management; Consequences of failure; risk assessment","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Water Management","",""

(graduation committee); Song, Y. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","A problem at the VUmc hospital in Amsterdam is that some patients become unrecognizable after the surgery. It is hard for surgeons to explain during the consultation how and how much the patients will change due to the surgery. Partly, because the surgeons cannot predict if the patient will become unrecognizable. Therefore, they tell them that there is a possibility they change drastically, and with this information, the patients do not know what they can expect. Even if the outcome of the surgery is optimal according to aesthetic and functional guidelines, the mismatching expectations with the outcomes can dissatisfy the patient. Some patients cannot get used to their new changes and do not recover emotionally, resulting in mental problems. Therefore, there is a need for a tool in the consultation room to predict changes in facial recognition per patient and which helps the surgeon to communicate this to the patient.<br/><br/>The changes in facial recognition were noticed at the VUmc, but there was no proof that the orthognathic surgeries actually influenced facial recognition, because no research in the topic was done before this project. This project proves that orthognathic surgeries can influence facial recognition which creates a new field of research. The research in this project shows that not all patients become unrecognizable, it depends on the specific face of the patient and the type of surgery the patient undergoes. <br/><br/>Facial recognition is complex since it depends on who is trying to recognize the patient, how familiar the patient is to this person, and a persons ability to recognize someone can differ per day and is therefore variable. Therefore, a test has been done to analyse the influence of orthognathic surgeries on facial recognition within a familiar group.<br/><br/>Testing a larger dataset would be too time-consuming to test among humans and, therefore, a landmark-based computer recognition method has been used to analyse a dataset of 75 pre- and post-surgical patient pictures. Both tests show that some regions of the face influence facial recognition more than others, as well as specific landmark movements which simulate orthognathic surgeries. Also, facial recognition depends on the face of the patient. Therefore, a concept of a tailored tool was created, called Fraos, showing the predictable changes in facial recognition per patient and helping the surgeon to communicate this to the patient. It also supports the patient in emotionally recovering from the facial changes.","Orthognathic surgery; Facial recognition; Prediction; Communication; VUmc; Tool","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Half of the country is situated below sea level and in an estuary. Previous measures of the Dutch against the threat of inundation have resulted in the closure of estuary branches, decrease in the length of primal flood defences and the world-renowned Delta Works. The Nieuwe Waterweg is kept open for economic reasons, in order to provide unhindered access to the port of Rotterdam, the largest deep sea port in Europe. However, the rise in sea level poses a threat to the accessibility of the port. <br/><br/>Sea-level rise adaptation scenarios for the Netherlands<br/>There are various scenarios conceivable for the Netherlands to adapt to sea-level rise. The main scenarios are 'Open protection', 'Closed protection', 'Seaward' and a 'Retreat' scenario. Each scenario brings its own set of challenges and benefits. There are many strategies to implement these scenarios for future landscape and sea-level rise adaptations.<br/><br/><br/>Currently, there are around ~180 sea-level rise adaptation strategies for the Netherlands, as collected by Deltares. Only a handful actually include the effects on modality networks, port activities and shipping. Furthermore, all strategies use the same method which uses multiple models and has a lead time which stretches over multiple weeks to determine the effects on waterborne supply chains. Moreover, this method is not compatible for the retreat scenario. This forms the knowledge gap of the thesis. <br/><br/><br/>Proposed method &amp; model<br/>This thesis therefore sets out to mitigate that gap by developing a first-order method to quantify the consequences of large sea-level rise projections, landscape changes and hinterland modality network changes of a deep sea port and to provide the results in a comprehensive manner.<br/><br/>Therefore, we propose and create a method and a model to quantify the consequences on spatial sea-level rise adaptation strategies on hinterland container port competition, by enforcing modality network changes and being able to easily adjust boundary conditions of the model. This thesis brings forth the method and model and subsequently applies it to the Netherlands and the port of Rotterdam as a case study. The ports of Antwerp and Hamburg are additionally taken into account to model the port competition. The method and model can account for any number of deep sea ports and countries. <br/><br/>Conclusions &amp; recommendations<br/><br/>- This thesis shows that currently, the majority of the sea-level rise adaptation strategies do not take their effects on waterborne transport and port activities into account. Furthermore, the strategies that do currently all use the same method, which cannot account for a retreat scenario. Furthermore, this existing method uses four models which results in a total cycle time in the order of weeks. These existing models cannot account for landscape or network changes.<br/><br/>- The proposed method shows that current port operations for Rotterdam are no longer viable at +3 m sea-level rise and a retreat scenario. Two options for are suggested for the port of Rotterdam: relocate the port to the new coastline or transform the current port in a deep sea terminal in combination with inland terminals at the new coastline. <br/> \item The proposed method further shows that Belgium and Germany experience less inundation at +3 sea-level rise and a retreat scenario. Moreover, the ports of Hamburg and Antwerp are less susceptible to the inundation and do not have to resort to the extreme measures as the port of Rotterdam. <br/> \item The model shows that by locating the port more inland and in close proximity to (current) modality networks, the competitive position of the port of Rotterdam increases, whilst losing the advantages the port presently enjoys over Antwerp and Hamburg, as the modalities are now closer to the hinterland destinations. This is most notable for the road modality.<br/> \item Following the model, it can be concluded that new port locations have to be chosen with care as the results suggest a large decrease of hinterland areas for two locations (-51% and -88%), whilst the (other) two locations only show a slight increase in hinterland port areas (+3% and +16%). The model suggests that the most promising new port location is Tiel.<br/> - The proposed model only accounts for the container commodity, other commodities, such as dry bulk and liquid bulk, could give different results and it is therefore recommended that further research is done based on the other commodities. <br/> - It is further recommended to improve the model by adding a common starting point, China for example. Currently, the model starts at the quay, when the containers are unloaded from the deep sea vessels. This would give the option to add (dis)advantages of ports, such as increased relative distances, a tidal window, or container dwell times. <br","sea level rise; retreat; inundation; flooding; port competition; container; Port of Rotterdam Authority; Port of Rotterdam","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","",""

(graduation committee); van Genderen, A.J. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","The accelerating growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) has led to the development of many technologies for homes like a wireless lighting system. Unlike traditional lighting systems, these can be operated remotely using mobile devices and even with the help of a smart assistant, such as Amazon Alexa or Google Assistant. Zigbee is used as the standard of communication between the wireless lighting system whereas other Wi-Fi applications are also extensively used in homes. A common problem for wireless radios such as Wi-Fi and Zigbee is that they have to share the ISM band which could lead to coexistence issues. Zigbee has lower power and longer channel sense times than Wi-Fi which makes it more vulnerable to interference. Bandwidth hungry Wi-Fi applications such as multimedia streaming cause adverse effects on Zigbee’s performance and the system can become temporarily out of reach as the nodes cannot gain access to the channel. This results in inconvenience to the user as the system might not respond in such situations. As these standards are fundamentally different and it is almost impossible to operate on a non-overlapping channel especially with the wide deployment of Wi-Fi networks, a new centralized approach is proposed in this work to coordi- nate between the two heterogeneous networks. The Wi-Fi router which serves as a gateway for both networks in a home is utilized as a coordinator for these networks. By performing various experiments, we examine the lowest data rate for Wi-Fi at which Zigbee can transmit its packet in a reliable manner. We propose a system design that effectively converts a high Wi-Fi interference environment to a transient low interference environment during Zigbee transmission. By combining the packet detection capabilities of the Linux router firewall and a custom queueing setup, we show we can provide reliability to the wireless lighting system with zero to a minimum loss for Wi-Fi transmission. We detect the Zigbee packet well in advance which enables us to adopt a preventive approach rather than a reactive one. Our system design results in a decrease of Zigbee packet loss from 67% to 7% while maintaining an average RTT of 35 ms at every load. We keep the complexity of the system design low by only making software changes to the router and not introducing a new node for synchronization between the two networks. The performance analysis of the system design is done using a test bed consisting of multiple Zigbee and Wi-Fi nodes, with the Wi-Fi router acting as a central controller for both of these networks.","Wireless lighting; Wi-Fi Zigbee coexistence; Centralized network; Rate-limiting","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-11-18","","","","Electrical Engineering | Embedded Systems","",""

A relatively new application of geogrids is the anchorage of sheet pile walls, in which one or more layers of geogrid are attached to the sheet pile wall. This type of anchorage is particularly suitable for projects with sufficient space behind the sheet pile wall. This anchorage system has some mayor advantages in comparison to conventional sheet pile wall anchors as it is cost-effective and requires less steel. Moreover, prestressing is possible during construction and pile foundations can be installed through the geogrids. An analytical design calculation method for this type of anchorage is not yet available in the Dutch design guideline for the design of sheet pile walls (CUR166). The demand for short anchorage systems because of the commonly limited space behind sheet pile walls, shifts the focus of the design to the minimum required length of the geogrid-anchorage. <br/>This report makes a first step into the formulation of a design-calculation for the mobilised anchor resistance as a function of the length of the geogrid(s) at ultimate limit state. By means of a 1g small-scale physical model and a 2D finite element model (PLAXIS) of the small-scale physical model, the global failure mechanism and soil-geogrid interaction have been analysed. In a series of these experiments, an 18 cm long geogrid anchor was connected to a 30 cm high sheet pile wall and installed in sand in a small transparent test box and loaded with a strip footing load. In addition, experiments were conducted while varying several features, among which the number and length of the geogrid anchors and the location of the slip footing load.","geosynthetics; geogrid; sheet pile wall anchorage; 1g physical model; Digital ParticleImage Velocimetry (DPIV) techniques; 2D finite elements numerical model; strip footing load; failure mechanism; mobilised tensile force; analytical design-calculation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

After collecting data, design directions began to arise. Heatwaves are invisible, people are not aware of the risks, the vulnerable groups are varied and vegetation can help bring the temperatures down. The result of this twenty weeks of work is a three step strategy to be followed by the Netherlands Red Cross. See, Share and Solve. See the heat. Urban heatwaves are dangerous because they are invisible Share the data. Show people how hot it can really get, also share solutions Solve the problem. A call to action, connect citizens and volunteers with organisations that are working with vegetation in the city. To share the data, structures across the city are proposed, cooling stations. By placing cooling stations in the city, the Red Cross can offer a temporary solution by providing shadow to the citizens but can also share information with citizens on how to cool down themselves, their homes and their neighbourhoods. Together with the Red Cross volunteers, neighbours can get involved in activities to bring vegetation on to the city in order to lower the temperatures and at the same time build strong communities with those who live next door.","Urban heatwaves, urban design, extreme heat, urban vegetation, tactical urbanism","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor); Giaccardi, E. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","Our society is facing a number of great challenges which will require all of us to significantly change our lifestyle in the coming years. To support people in those transitions, next to systemic changes, new design interventions have to be crafted that intentionally aim to redirect behaviour for the common good. As changing behaviour intentionally comes with great responsibility, social and behavioural design calls for sound and deliberate design and evaluation. However, changing behaviour is something that takes a long time to materialise durably and thus conventional qualitative user-centered approaches to evaluation may not be the most suitable. On the other hand, quantitative approaches measuring only the outcomes of the behaviour do not provide detailed insight into the performance of the intervention. This thesis investigated how integrating various sources of qualitative and quantitative data on a behavioural situation during evaluation contributes to critically assessing and anticipating the effectiveness and appropriateness of an intervention aimed at changing behaviour. Studies that investigate the effectiveness of interventions often find that the effects induced in the short-term were not sustained (Abrahamse et al., 2005). A theoretical model was developed that conceptualises the underlying mechanism of this observation as the transition of the design being efficacious (works when people receive an intervention) to being effective (works when people are offered an intervention), which is influenced by the appropriateness of the intervention to its context. This appropriateness can be further operationalised into three types: aesthetic, moral and systemic appropriateness. The relations between the effectiveness and appropriateness were experimentally explored through deploying research artefacts in the context of the end-user. In this experiment an interactive bedlight and a chatbot were evaluated on their effectiveness and appropriateness in achieving the intended effect, ‘adopting regular sleep and wake times’, while at the same time understanding their performance in relation to ‘sleeping better’ and ‘balancing sleep and other practices’. In the study several perspectives on the situation were collected and integrated: sensor data from an ecology of instrumented things, data from interviews with the participant before and after using the intervention, and data generated through the interaction with the interventions. Integrating these perspectives resulted in concurrent insight into the performance of the intervention as it is now and potential elements for improvement. Although some perspectives are more attuned to the efficacy, and others more to the appropriateness—in general the integration of perspectives contribute to a holistic understanding of the situation as the individual perspectives filled in each other’s blind spots. Through assessing the efficacy and appropriateness of the intervention the long-term effectiveness can be anticipated. This could nurture new methods for evaluation where data is informing the design process in order to assess how the mechanism in the intervention performs to decide what the right level of persuasive influence of the intervention is and assess whether the intervention is proportionate.","Effect-driven design; Design for behaviour change; Evaluation; Design experiment; Data; Data-informed; Effectiveness; Appropriateness","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

In recent years, the selective adsorption of target OMPs by zeolites have been proved efficient for OMP removal. For the potential application of zeolites in the wastewater treatment plants, zeolite granules are preferably used in order to avoid the post-filtration for zeolite powders. Therefore, the knowledge on the performance of zeolite granules for the removal of OMPs should be fully understood. In this research, BEA and MOR zeolite granules were used as adsorbents for the removal of 11 OMPs from water, which were carbamazepine, diclofenac, 1H-benzotriazole, methyl-benzotriazole, hydrochlorothiazide, sulfamethoxazole, clarithromycin, propranolol, trimethoprim, metoprolol and sotalol. The aims of this study were: (1) to investigate the adsorption capacity and kinetics of the 11 OMPs by zeolite granules in both demineralized water and wastewater (WW), in batch experiments; (2) to predict the breakthrough curve of columns packed with zeolite granules by using a mathematical model combining the parameters determined by batch experiments. It was found that the charge and hydrophobicity of OMPs were the two main factors that affected the adsorption capacity of OMPs by zeolites, while the effect of OMP size on the adsorption capacity was negligible. The OMP adsorption capacities by zeolite granules were less than OMP adsorption capacities by zeolite powders. The fittings of the IPD model to the adsorption kinetic data showed that film diffusion and intra-particle diffusion were both the rate-limiting steps in the adsorption of OMPs by zeolite granules. Furthermore, the adsorption capacity and rate of OMPs in WW were lower in comparison with OMP adsorption in demineralized water, which could be caused by the higher pH in WW and the pore-blocking effect by background organic matters. In the column experiments, it was found that OMP breakthrough percentage in the column was determined by both the adsorption capacity and kinetics of OMPs by zeolite granules. In the breakthrough model, the kinetic and isotherm constants from batch experiments overestimated the adsorption rate and capacity of zeolite granules in the columns, and the overestimated isotherm constant was the main factor that caused the deviation of the model prediction. With a lower isotherm constant, the model was able to provide good resemblance between modelled and measured breakthrough curves. Furthermore, with a known breakthrough curve at a certain EBCT, the model was able to determine a proper isotherm constant, which can be used to predict the breakthrough curve at a different EBCT.","Zeolite; Organic micro-pollutants; Breakthrough modelling; COMSOL Multiphysics; Adsorption","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Environmental Engineering","Adox",""

The implementation of systems such as ERTMS and 3kV is a lengthy process. The new systems will therefore operate alongside the old systems (ATB-EG and 1.5kV) for a long period of time. Between the old and the new system, operational transitions are required. The number of operational will therefore increase in the coming years. Some of these transitions from one system to another system turn out to be prone to failures and disruptions. When an operational transition fails, this can cause considerable delays on the railway network. Especially when multiple operational transitions are close together and occur nearly simultaneously, the risk of failures in one of these transitions is present. When operational transitions are combined, a failure in one transition can have large effects on another operational transition that is about to take place. Operational transitions are defined by two characteristics. Firstly, they are physical locations in the rail infrastructure. Secondly, operational transition require the driver to switch between two systems, or to change his/her behaviour significantly. The aim of this thesis is to investigate the effect of operational transitions on the reliability of train operations. The magnitude of the impact of operational transitions on the reliability of train operations is often unclear. This thesis contributes to scientific literature by examining a sizable number of operational transition types and providing an initial insight into the effect of these transitions on railway operations. For society in general and for ProRail in particular, the findings of this research can contribute to a better understanding of operational transitions. Using the acquired knowledge, ProRail can take measures that increase the reliability of operational transition passages, thereby increasing the punctuality of train services.","Train operators; Railway infrastructure; Human factors; Transitions; Train service disruptions; Automatic Train Protection System; Vertical track alignment; Train dispatching; Power supply systems","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Transport, Infrastructure and Logistics","",""

They can destabilize ice shelves by exerting additional loading forces due to the weight of the water concentrated on one location. However, it is possible that developed meltwater networks transport water from an ice shelf into the ocean. In this way, they prevent this destabilization. A better understanding of the development of meltwater features on an ice shelf is needed to make predictions on future ice shelf stability. This research investigates the development of meltwater features during one melting season on the Nivlisen ice shelf. The investigation consists of three elements. First, satellite imagery is used to analyse the change of meltwater area and volume. Next, a potential routing network is created to study the influence of topography on the shape of meltwater features. Finally, climate data is compared to the calculated volumes of the meltwater features. This study shows that it is possible to create a routing network that predicts the shape of meltwater features very well. It is essential that surface depressions are correctly incorporated in the flow routing algorithm. The currently available climate data underestimates the meltwater production significantly. The growth of observed meltwater features during the melting season is not reflected in the modelled melt data. To further study the development of meltwater features, the representation of hydrological processes in climate models has to be improved.","Antarctica; melt water; Ice shelves; Hydrology","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","-70.313322, 11.511457"

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","This graduation project investigates the challenges of designing a safety critical consumer product suitable for the refurbishment loop of the circular economy through a case study on child car seats. Currently when child car seats are reused or resold on the second-hand market, their safety cannot be guaranteed as it is unknown whether the child car seat has previously been involved in a car accident. When child car seats are integrated in a refurbishment system, their safety can be guaranteed and thus their lifespan of safe use can be elongated. <br/>The refurbishment of child car seats starts with determining whether the child car seat has been in a crash, for example by integrating impact sensors in the child car seat through which the history of a child car seat can be known. Subsequently, it consists of inspecting all priority parts of the product; those are the parts most relevant for refurbishment because of their functional importance, failure frequency, and economic and environmental value. Based on these aspects, the priority parts of baby car seats are determined. The parts with the highest functional priority in child car seats are the parts that fulfil a safety critical function: either the part is responsible for the absorption of the crash impact, or the part contributes to the correct installation of the child in the child car seat or of the child car seat in the car. Three existing baby car seats and ISOfix bases are assessed on their ease of disassembly following the Hotspot Mapping method and the results are visualised in a Disassembly Map showing their disassembly sequence and product architecture. Based on this analysis it can be concluded that currently not all priority parts of both baby car seats and ISOfix bases are removable and that the product architecture of these product can be further improved for ease of disassembly and thus for refurbishment. The Disassembly Depth Index is developed to illustrate the level of parallelism within a product’s disassembly sequence. A set of guidelines is established which can be used to design safety critical consumer products tailored to refurbishment. This set of guidelines firstly incorporates guidelines specifically for safety critical products and furthermore consists of guidelines for product architecture, materials, and fasteners. To illustrate these guidelines a redesign of a baby car seat and of an ISOfix base has been made. These products are improved for refurbishment through the elimination of non-priority parts, by making safety critical parts removable and bringing them to the surface, by increasing the level of parallelism in the disassembly sequence, and by substituting materials with alternatives better suited for refurbishment.","child car seats; refurbishment; circular economy; sustainability; design guidelines","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

(graduation committee); van Kester, Dennis (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","This thesis is the third study of a research line that focuses on the interface stability of a rubble mound sand retaining structure. The type of interface considered is a geometrically open granular filter because of its economical and constructional benefits. The stability of an open filter structure in which the base layer is located on top of the filter layer was investigated by the use of physical modeling. The model used was the same waterproof elongated container as used by Van de Ven (2019), after some adjustments were made. Three compartments were allocated in this model. In Compartment A, the water level was controlled by the use of a plunger. This caused water level differences between the compartments and therefore induced a hydraulic gradient (i) in the filter structure that was installed in Compartment B. The hydraulic gradient was considered as the main load parameter for erosion. The main strength parameter was the stability ratio (SR), defined as the sieve diameter for which 15% of themass of the filter material is smaller divided by the sieve diameter for which 85% of the mass of the base material is smaller. During testing, this hydraulic gradient was increased by the plunger until erosion was noted, defining the critical hydraulic gradient (icr) for the filter-base combination tested. Two loading conditions were distinguished, namely the parallel and combined set-up. Besides the SR and these loading conditions, the influence of the characteristic grain size of the base material and the filter layer height on icr was studied. During this thesis, a new phenomenon influencing the icr was observed, which was not included in the research line yet. This was the initial sand saturation of the filter layer. Therefore, the physical model results were split up into unsaturated and partly saturated tests. For the unsaturated parallel configuration, SR = 5.7, 6.7, 12.9 and 13.1 were tested. Results were found for the upper two values. For the lower SR, no erosion was detected resulting in a bottom limit of icr . The partly saturated parallel tests resulted in a reduction of icr up to a minimumof 73%. Projecting this effect into reality could have a significant influence on the stability of an inversed open granular filter in land reclamation structures. However, further research is advised. All found icr in the parallel tests were higher compared to Van de Ven (2019). Besides, it was concluded that a larger characteristic grain size of the base layer and the filter layer thickness did not influence the icr significantly. Furthermore, three unsaturated combined tests were conducted with SR = 6.7 and 12.9. No erosion was noted for SR = 6.7. Erosion was detected twice for SR = 12.9, once in the first test segment – resulting in an upper limit for (icr ) – and once in the second test segment. A reduction of 93% for icr in the combined set-up compared to the unsaturated parallel set-up was noted, implying that an additional load decreases the critical load for the considered filter structure. However, this could also be the results of model installation differences. Lastly, a new physical model was designed and constructed to facilitate the study on the influence of the superimposed load and the filter inclination on the interface stability. A newly developed numerical model has been made to plot design graphs for this new model.","Inversed geometrically open granular filter; Open filter; Granular filter; Open granular filter; Physical modelling; Land reclamation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","",""

BDD has a low background current, is robust and has a high affinity for the production of oxidizing radicals. BDD shows better degradation rates compared to competing electrode materials, and can also be used to detect trace amounts of compounds. The surface properties of BDD electrodes, such as the crystal sizes present on the electrode surface and the presence of non diamond content, influence their degradation and sensing performance. Electrochemical advanced oxidation processes using BDD electrodes are one of the methods investigated in literature to remove recalcitrant micro-pollutants from wastewater. Wastewater treatment at present faces a challenge to eliminate micro-pollutants of increasing complexity and toxicity. One of the compounds that could potentially benefit from the application of BDD electrodes in its removal from wastewater and detection in human blood and analogues is nevirapine. Nevirapine (NVP) is an antiretroviral on the World Health Organization’s list of essential medicines, used extensively in HIV treatment. NVP has been detected in wastewater in the continents where it is deployed as treatment, and has shown resistance to ordinary wastewater treatment. The removal of NVP from wastewater and the detection of NVP in human blood are current challenges considered in academic research. NVP has not been used in detection or degradation studies using BDD electrodes before. In this study, two types of electrodes were used to attempt to electrochemically degrade and detect NVP. The application of electrochemical activation in combination with micro-crystalline BDD electrodes for NVP sensing is a promising lead into new research to detect low concentrations of NVP using in-situ electrode cleaning. The results obtained indicate further research into the interaction between NVP and the surface of BDD electrodes as well as electrochemical activation could provide a stable detection method to asses NVP at levels competitive to those reported in literature. The research into degradation of NVP using BDD electrodes indicates the practical challenges the interaction between NVP and BDD surfaces poses, for the removal of NVP from wastewater using electrochemical advanced oxidation processes.","Nevirapine; Electrochemistry; Boron-doped diamond; Sensing; Advanced oxidation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-12-31","","","","","",""

A large amount of these systems is unsafe. The ultimate goal of this research is to gain knowledge on manners to improve and monitor the safety of on-site sanitation (OSS) systems. The performance and safety of OSS systems are highly dependent on the level of faecal sludge in OSS system which is largely dependent on the accumulation rate of the sludge. However, scientists have not found a simple method to assess the accumulation rate of sludge. Knowing the sludge accumulation rate and therefore, knowing how quickly a tank fills, makes it possible to the necessary time between two emptying events or, with other words, the required emptying frequency. With the research presented in this thesis, a dynamical approach to viewing and assessing the status of OSS systems is developed in the form of a model by combining sludge accumulation theory and only a small number of in-field measurements. The modelled simulation of sludge accumulation shows highly similar results to empirical sludge accumulation studies. On the basis of the model, also a user-friendly tool has been developed that allows tank owners, policymakers or regulators to get personal recommendations regarding the emptying frequency of their OSS systems. This offers a new approach and with that an improvement of the way OSS system can be safely managed and monitored. This thesis provides evidence for the feasibility of constructing a numerical model as a measure to simulate sludge accumulation in OSS systems that can lead to emptying frequency recommendations.

Diversity in news media, however, is understood as multiperspectivity and scholars generally agree that fostering diversity is the key responsibility of the press in a democratic society. Therefore, a novel viewpoint diversification method was developed, based on the reranking of recommendation lists within the topic using framing aspects. Among other results, an offline evaluation indicated that the proposed method is capable of enhancing the viewpoint diversity of recommendation lists according to a metric from literature. However, to truly enable multiperspectivity in automatic online news environments, users should also be willing to consume viewpoint diverse news recommendation. Therefore, an online study was conducted, assessing how viewpoint diverse recommendations and their presentation characteristics affect the reading behaviour of Blendle users. During a two-week experiment, two groups of 1038 users were presented a set of three recommendations below the content of two articles every day. Thereby, one group received recommendations based on relevance to the original article, while the other group received viewpoint diverse recommendations. Three implicit and one explicit measure of the reading behaviour were analysed. Additionally, the influence of the presentation characteristics of the recommendation on the reading behaviour was analysed. Generally, no major differences were found in the reading behaviour of both user groups. Only the results of the click-through rate calculated per recommendation set indicated a significant difference of 6.5% to the advantage of the baseline users. For the other measures of the reading behaviour, no significant differences were found between the baseline and diverse users. However, the results do show that multiple presentation characteristics have a significant influence on the reading behaviour. Therefore, these results suggest that future research on how recommendation can be presented is just as important as novel viewpoint diversification methods to truly achieve multiperspectivity in automated online news environments.","Viewpoint Diversity; Recommender Systems; Online News Media","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Offshore wind energy has advantages over onshore wind energy, however, the levelized cost of energy is higher. The maintenance costs are a major cost contributor. To lower these costs, research is performed on faults and its detection. Currently, little is known about fault detectability and vibration propagation in a drive train of an offshore wind turbine. Fault detection and vibration propagation in a drive train of a 10 MW floating offshore wind turbine is therefore investigated to get an insight about the effect of faults on the vibration monitoring data of a drive train. Three different faults with five different degradation levels are applied one by one on the bearings of a 10 MW drive train model. These faults are radial and axial damage in the main shaft front bearing and radial damage in the high speed shaft rear bearing. One traditional, two non-traditional and two novel fault detection methods are used to detect faults and their vibration propagation. One common and one novel fault detection method are deployed in the time domain: the Velocity Root-Mean-Square (RMS) Threshold Method and the Peeters’ Anomaly Detection Method. The Velocity RMS Threshold Method compares the RMS of the vibration velocity of non-rotating parts with a threshold proposed by ISO 10816-21. The latter method makes use of statistical indicators and is tailored for this study. Although changes after fault introduction were observable, the methods can not be used and need to be altered for usage in the wind industry. The non-traditional Angular Velocity Error Energy Method is deployed in the frequency domain. It makes use of the angular velocity measurements from the drive train’s shafts and compares the normalized energy of its spectra with a threshold. This method inspired the development of novel fault detection methods introduced in this study, being the Bearing Velocity Energy Method (making use of bearing velocity measurements and also based on the Velocity Root-Mean-Square Threshold Method) and the Shaft Vibration Energy Method (making use of the velocity and acceleration of shafts). Both methods compare the normalized energy of the spectra with a threshold. Radial damage in the main shaft front bearing could be detected using the Angular Velocity Error Energy Method, the Bearing Velocity Energy Method and the Shaft Vibration Energy Method. Damage was detectable from 15% degradation onwards. Next to a change in vibration in the main shaft and its bearings, a different vibration behaviour was observed at the planet carrier front and rear bearing, intermediate speed shaft front bearing and on the low speed shaft. Axial damage in the main shaft front bearing could only be detected using the Shaft Vibration Energy Method. It was shown that this kind of damage was detectable by monitoring the main shaft’s vibration from 50% degradation and higher. Radial damage in the high speed shaft rear bearing could be detected using the Bearing Velocity Error Method and the Shaft Vibration Energy Method. Damage could only be detected for degradation higher than 70%, by monitoring the high speed shaft and its bearings. Next to the typical measurement locations, it is recommended to place extra sensors measuring velocity on the first stage planet carrier front and rear bearing housings, intermediate speed shaft front bearing housings and on the low speed shaft. The outcome of this study contributes to the understanding of vibration propagation and fault detection in a drive train. The fault detection methods can be implemented in maintenance and monitoring methods for offshore wind turbines. Maintenance engineers can use the detected vibration propagation to check the affected gearbox components and replace them before they fail.","Wind Energy; drive train; Fault detection; Gearbox; monitoring; Offshore Wind","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","European Wind Energy Masters (EWEM)","",""

With the relatively low-price cameras and highly automated monitoring system, video and image analysis on road, highway and skies becomes realistic. The key process in the analysis is to separate the useful information such as moving foreground objects from the original video sequence where Robust Principal Component Analysis (RPCA) plays an important role in extracting the foreground objects. RPCA have been widely used in data analysis and dimension reduction with applications in image recovery, information clustering and computer vision. But one drawback of RPCA lies in the fact that it does not guarantee the nonnegativity of pixels. It is important to have nonnegative foreground object since negative pixels that are not in the range between 0 and 255 are meaningless and the foreground objects are thus not visible. State-of-the-art methods do not consider the nonnegativity of the foreground object in their algorithms. This thesis focuses on the problem of extracting foreground moving object from background scenes and guarantee the nonnegativity of foreground object. This thesis proposes a method that combines RPCA and Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF). It ensures the pixels that constitute the foreground object is nonnegative by using the basic model of RPCA and nonnegative components that NMF provides. The efficacy of the proposed algorithms is tested on publicly available dataset. Experiment shows in detail how the proposed algorithms achieve in recovering the foreground object with high true positive rate. Together with RPCA algorithm, the performance of recovery is compared and their advantages and disadvantages are discussed.","Robust Principal Component Analysis; Nonnegative Matrix Factorization; Image decomposition","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

Adaptability is the ability of a system to meet technological or functional changes without requiring structural modifications or replacements. This paper identifies factors that influence adaptability and researches critical issues for future adaptability of ERTMS. With these factors and issues, solutions are proposed that are validated in a use case and integrated in a strategy that strengthens adaptability of ERTMS for future operational needs.

In these cases, radiative heat transfer must be properly accounted for and the divergence of the radiative heat flux must be added as a source term to the energy budget of the flow. To solve the radiative transfer equation, in this thesis work, use is made of the emission reciprocity based Monte Carlo formulation. To generate spectra, for combustion problems, a routine utilising the High-Resolution Transmission Molecular Absorption database was written. For hypersonic problems, NASA’s NEQAIR was adjusted and implemented. The radiation solver was further coupled with INCA CFD and validated using 14 different simulation cases. Several techniques of solution acceleration were also proposed and tested to reduce the computational requirements of the developed solver, including smart spectral discretisation methods and the use of a multilayered grid separating the radiative and spectral solutions.","Radiation; Combustion; Hypersonics; Monte Carlo; NEQAIR; HITRAN","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

The advantage of RANS simulations is the reduced computational cost compared to other methods such as LES or DNS. This is because by solving the RANS equations one only solves for the mean flow. However, this reduction in computational cost comes at the price of uncertainty. During the derivation of the RANS equations a closure problem is introduced. The turbulence models that solve this closure model of the Reynolds stress introduce the largest level of uncertainty. In this research symbolic regression is used to augment the k-ω-SST turbulence models with corrections directly inferred from high fidelity data sources such as DES, LES or DNS. This model is augmented with a correction to the anisotropic part of the Reynolds stress and a direct correction to the turbulence production. These correction fields are calculated through the so called frozen approach, where the k- and ω-transport equations are solved using the frozen mean flow values from the high fidelity data. Symbolic regression with Pope's eddy viscosity hypothesis as a basis is used to find models for these correction fields. With these correction models the k-ω-SST is extended to a non-linear turbulence model for the prediction of the eddy viscosity. Elastic net regression forms the basis of the machine learning method and is used to promote sparsity of the correction models. The sparsity is needed for stability and to keep the computational efficiency of the RANS method. This symbolic regression method is named SpaRTA and has been successfully applied to 2D cases in literature. In this work that is extended to 3 fully 3D cases, namely a wall mounted cube, an infinite circular cylinder and an idealised rotating wheel on a road surface. This study has shown the applicability of the SpaRTA methodology to these cases, resulting in models that have the extrapolating capabilities to improve the results on all 3 test geometries.","CFD; Turbulence modeling; machine learning; k-omega sst","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-09-02","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

This will lead to large stress concentrations in the tunnel construction, giving rise to local cracking, failure of the construction, leakage, deterioration of exposed rebar, etc. Variety factors will influence it, like the consolidation process, the action time of different loads when construction, and the sub-soil condition, etc. To protect the integrity of the structure, settlements should be kept within limits. Although the immersed tunnels are generally designed to withstand buoyancy by a margin of 4%, the settlements have been observed which severely exceed the predictions in the Kiltunnel. In this case, a complicating factor is a fact that the dikes on both sides have been reconstructed after immersing the elements, but not at the same location as before the immersion trench was dredged. Consolidation (at first) and creep due to this relatively new load on the subsoil can play a role as well. These aspects contribute to the problem of the differential settlements which have resulted in leaking joints and consequently increased maintenance costs. In addition, how and to what extent uneven settlement affects the structural safety of tunnels and their users, and how to reduce the durability of tunnels are unknown. As a result, it is necessary for us to do research about the settlement in Kiltunnel.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geo-Engineering","",""

It can represent real world processes, such as demand for groceries, electricity usage and stock prices. Machine Learning (ML) models that accurately forecast these processes enable improved decision-making for reducing waste and increasing efficiency. Previous research has produced an enormous number of ML model classes, each well-performing on a different forecasting task domain, and each written in their paradigm’s mathematical language.<br/><br/>For a new forecasting task in business, the job of data scientists is to select, tune and evaluate some existing ML models. Because data scientists are scarce and expensive, many resources are spent on replacing this human job with an automated approach, referred to as AutoML. In current practice, the many existing ML models are used by tuning some of them and combining their separate forecasts. An alternative is using them by merging their intrinsic components, and tuning them all together to find a single hybrid ML model with better performance. This is possible if the ambiguous language between forecasting paradigms is consolidated into a unifying framework.<br/><br/>The first aim of this research is to introduce this framework, and thereby replacing the human job with a computational job. The complete list of instructions to create a hybrid ML model - data cleaning excluded - is presented in parameter format: a superparameter configuration. Its components are feature engineering, training set formation and hypothesis training. An example shows how superparameters from different paradigms can constitute a hybrid model. The computational job is presented as superoptimization: optimizing the superparameters for performance, applied to the task at hand. The problem of superoptimization is that it requires too much runtime on a computer.<br/><br/>The second aim of this research is to reduce the runtime of the computational job, by learning from previous tasks. This research proposes metafeatures for warmstarted Bayesian optimiza- tion. It suggests promising hypothesis training superparameters (complexity and overfitting), from previous tasks similar in size and input richness. The computational complexity reduction by 50% in the experiment, with respect to both a naïve and (proposed) coldstart benchmark method, provides evidence for the potential of the proposed method. The weight of evidence for the metafeatures is increased, by maintained performance improvement when the method is badly tuned. The open-source Python package warmstart is published as a foundation for future experiments that focus on the other superparameter components, in the pursuit of an AutoML for hybrid forecasting models.","AutoML; Forecasting; Hybrid; Warmstart; Metalearning; XGBoost","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These masks are fabricated using conventional plaster moulds, which is labour-intensive and requires an experienced orthotist or prosthetist. 3D scanning and 3D printing are promising technologies that could replace the current traditional fabrication process. The aim of this thesis is to evaluate whether 3D technology is suitable to replace the traditional fabrication method of transparent facial pressure masks; and is able to produce a mask that provides adequate pressure therapy.<br/><br/>Methods<br/>First, a systematic review was performed to identify suitable 3D scanning and 3D printing techniques for fabrication of the facial mask and to find pressure assessment tools. <br/>Subsequently, 3D scanners, 3D printers, software and pressure assessment tools were analyzed for technical feasibility and availability. <br/>Based on this analysis, a pilot study was performed in which the most optimal workflow to fabricate facial pressure masks using 3D technology was designed. The most optimal workflow was identified in terms of (1) workload (man-hours, degree of automation and need for human expertise); (2) patient comfort; (3) total time; and (4) costs;<br/>Two masks were fabricated for a healthy volunteer using two different moulds: a 3D printed mould and a conventional plaster mould. These masks were compared in terms of comfort and blanching of the skin as indirect measures for pressure distribution.<br/><br/>Results <br/>A hand-held structured light 3D scanner (Artec Eva, Artec 3D), easy-to-use CAD software (Meshmixer, Autodesk, Inc.) and Fused Deposition Modeling (Ultimaker 2+, Ultimaker) appear to be the most suitable tools for the fabrication of a facial mask. As pressure distribution cannot be assessed directly yet, due to the lack of reliable sensors, the most suitable tools to assess pressure distribution indirectly are patient comfort and blanching of the skin. <br/>The most optimal workflow to fabricate a facial mask using 3D printing techniques consists of 3D scanning and 3D printing of a positive mould followed by vacuum forming of Silon-STS® over the positive mould. This is a partly automated process that still needs human expertise. Based on an estimation of time and costs, the fabrication process is quicker and cheaper than the conventional method. Although the manipulation process during aftercare takes longer and is more expensive, the number of man-hours remains the same and patient comfort increases.<br/>The facial mask fabricated using 3D scanning and printing techniques for the moulding process causes undesirable blanching of the skin at the nasal bridge and the healthy volunteer expressed discomfort due to this pressure point. The facial mask fabricated using a conventional plaster mould causes discomfort at the cheeks. Therefore, both masks will need design adjustments to provide adequate pressure therapy. <br/><br/>Conclusion<br/>Based on our preliminary results 3D technology seems suitable to partly replace the traditional fabrication method of transparent facial pressure masks. To further optimize and validate the proposed workflow, future research should focus on digital mould modification and more objective pressure measurement tools. Future goals in a clinical setting will be to evaluate (1) cost-effectiveness; (2) long-term clinical effects in patients and (3) patient reported outcome measures.<br","Hypertrophic scarring; Face mask; 3D scanning; Computer aided design; 3D Printing; Silicones; Pressure; Pressure distribution; Skin cancer","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-11-01","","","","Technical Medicine | Imaging and Intervention","",""

When the module is partially shaded, either at least one<br/>subgroup is bypassed or the module current is limited by the current of the worst performing cell. This leads to significant and disproportionate power losses. One way to address this issue is to implement a solar module made of low reverse breakdown voltage (BDV) solar cells.<br/>A thermo-electric simulation framework was developed in MATLAB to replicate two types of commercially available low BDV solar cells: Sunpower Maxeon gen2 and gen 3 cells. Using the above model the potential and performance of solar modules in urban landscapes has been evaluated. A comparative study of solar module models built with these cells and placed on three different locations on a single rooftop having completely different irradiance profiles has been assessed. A solar module with 3 bypass diodes made of gen 3 solar cells has a better performance than module made of gen 2 cells. This accounts not only for better forward parameters of gen 3 cells but also its improved mismatch losses owing to lower reverse breakdown voltage and better temperature coefficients.<br/>The usage of low reverse breakdown solar cells is beneficial in conditions where partial shading is predominant. Other advantages of using these solar module over other technologies is there is that there is no need of any additional electronic components.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-09-01","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

This results in serious water management challenges: growing freshwater demands, declining water tables, drying of streams, and deteriorating water quality. Insufficient surface water supplies have led to increased reliance on groundwater, especially during the dry winter and pre-monsoon seasons (November - May). Despite groundwater’s importance, it is sparsely measured, poorly understood, and insufficiently managed. As it is difficult and costly to measure all groundwater extractions in the Valley, a water balance approach is an alternative method to estimate total net groundwater pumping. Therefore, the aim of this research was to develop and evaluate potential methods for quantifying total pre-monsoon baseflow supplies by extrapolating baseflow measurements of a subsample of watersheds to unmeasured watersheds. Estimated baseflow was used, together with other water balance fluxes and changes in storage, to evaluate net groundwater pumping in the Valley. Three different methods were used: (1) Spatial Analysis, (2) Regression Model, and (3) Black Box (machine learning). All methods relied on streamflow data from 2017 to 2019, collected by citizen scientists from S4W-Nepal. Based on the three methods we presented, we cautiously conclude that it is possible to determine the pre-monsoon baseflow contributions from a sub-sample of head water catchments. Total baseflow estimates for the Valley using Spatial Analysis, Regression Model, Black Box were 2.32, 2.30, 2.65 m3/s respectively. These values show orders of magnitude that correspond with expected values. By using the average baseflow values of all three methods, we were able to close the water balance and make an assumption for the net groundwater pumping in the Valley. Based on a population of 3.5 million, a net groundwater extraction of 96 L/person/day during pre-monsoon was found. This striking outcome emphasizes the need for more discharge and groundwater extraction measurements, to decrease the uncertainties and to refine the methods.","Baseflow calculation; Hydrology; Kathmandu Valley; Nepal; Machine Learning; Regression Model; Spatial Analysis","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The control points of this spline are the output of the network. In this way very few output variables can be specified by the network to achieve a smooth detailed lens shape.<br/>To give a proof of concept a one dimensional version of the Fraunhofer approximation is used. For this case the training already depends on many parameters. These are optimised for the lowest resulting loss.<br/>The Fraunhoffer approximation limits the images that can be created. If the network, however, is trained on images that can definitely be created, it is able to almost exactly predict a lens that delivers the desired image.<br/>The potential of the unsupervised training method in combination with a spline approximation should therefore be explored with other solutions of the forward problem. Namely a ray-tracing algorithm could be used, since this can create a wider variety of images. This would be computationally heavy compared to the<br/>Fraunhofer approximation.","Freeform lens; Neural Network; Fraunhofer diffraction; Inverse lens problem","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics | Applied Physics","",""
