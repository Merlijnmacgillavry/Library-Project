(mentor); De Waard, O.L. (mentor); Vrijling, J.K. (mentor); Wardenier, J. (mentor)","2001","The first platforms for oil and gas production in the North Sea have been installed around 1970. Since then about 500 platforms have been built to explore the North Sea oil and gas fields. Now, after 30 years of use, the first platforms are abandoned, creating a demand for innovative and economical removal concepts. Heerema Marine Contractors (HMC), considered to be the world market leader in the installation and transport of offshore platforms, has developed the Seesaw barge jacket removal concept. The jacket is lifted in one section or in the largest section possible (by the SSCV 'Thialf') and tilted onto a barge (the H-851-barge) in this concept. The rotation of the jacket during the removal procedure reflects the seesaw principle. Previous studies at HMC proved the Seesaw barge concept to be feasible for the removal of typical North Sea jackets. The Seesaw barge removal concept combines the capabilities and capacities of existing HMC equipment. An important aspect of the Seesaw removal barge concept is the optimal use of the jacket buoyancy during the removal procedure by submerging the stern of the H-851 barge. Other advantages are the minimum amount of sub sea operations and the possibility to re-use the jackets. The Seesaw barge removal concept consists of four phases. 1. Upending of the Extended Tilting Beams (ETB' s) 2. Mating and load transfer of the jacket 3. Rotation of jacket onto H-851 barge 4. Transportation on the barge Objectives ofthe thesis study  The primary objective of the thesis study is to design a lifting and hang-off system, compatible with the jacket configuration and strength, for jackets, that will be removed with the Seesaw barge removal concept  The secondary objective is to make the lifting and hang-off system re-usable or adjustable for jackets with different dimensions and structural configurations.","seesaw barge; jacket lifting; offshore structures","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Huele, Ruben (graduation committee); van der Voet, Ester (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2001","If Genetic Modification is to be accepted as a sustainable technological development its social, ecological and economical impacts must be understood.<br/>One important tool in determining the environmental and human risks of a technological development such as Genetical Modification (GM), is the Quantitative Risk Analysis (QRA). QRA can quantify the risks of a new technology, so that the society can make a choice whether the benefits outweigh the risks. Only if the risk of a new technological development is very small and acceptable, can it be sustainable. One of the main risks from GMOs is the spread of their genes through Gene Flow into wild populations causing genetic pollution and potentially ecosystem disruption. The current QRA is based on mass flow models. It does not consider the fact that law of conservation of mass does not hold for genes, which are essentially information. QRA also dos not take the imbedded open feedback loops present in life forms, i.e. the ability to self-amplify and reproduce, into consideration. Because of these shortcomings, the current risk assessment tools are probably inadequate to answer the question whether Genetic Modification is a sustainable technological development. Next to the lack of scientific knowledge about the impacts, there is a lack of societal acceptance of GM. Part of the reason for the lack of acceptance is the unacceptability of the tools for risk prediction. There is a need for a risk analysis tool that is both acceptable and able to describe key aspects of life. Agent Based Models (ABMs) are a candidate modeling framework for such a tool because they are isomorphic to living organisms. Furthemore, they are intuitive and easy to understand, forming a basis for societal acceptance. By defining evolutionary processes and plant entities in Agent terms an Agent Based Model called GeneScape has been developed. The model explicitly describes Plants as entities with states and interactions. Plants populate a geometry, the Field, through which the environment, The World, enforces the rules for pollen distribution, mating and genetic inheritance. The World also determines how the information content of the plant, its genome, is to be translated into a fitness, and thus power to reproduce. While there is a shortage of good experimental data for validation, GeneScape is evaluated and found to be coherent and biologically sound. It is however not a quantitative prediction tool for Gene Flow, but an explicitand graphical representation of the mental models of Darwinian selection, Gene Flow and plant ecology. Its strength lies in the fact that it allows<br/>the visualization of thought experiments on the behavior of GMO crops and the neighboring plant populations. It can serve as a basis for further development of a tool for risk assessment for GMOs. GeneScape can only be useful for answering questions about the sustainability of Genetic Modification if it is socially acceptable itself. Therefore, a societal acceptance hypothesis is formulated. The hypothesis states that GeneScape is not yet societally acceptable because it is too complex and the outcomes are open to interpretation. However, it is easily understandable and illustrative, which forms a basis for acceptance. The most important conclusion from the use of GeneScape is the insightinto the importance of the environment a GMO gene is placed in. The most important variables governing Gene Flow (Pollen spread distance, fitness increase by the GMO gene and the relatedness level of the urrounding populations) are dependent on environmental factors. Since the environment can not be controlled Genetically Modified Organisms can only be sustainable in a closed, controlled environment.","Agent based model; gene flow; Sustainability; GMO; brassica napus","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Sciences","",""

(mentor)","2001","In this study, 2D simulations were performed on the airflow in a new type of heat exchanger, the so-called Fine Wire Heat Exchanger. The heat exchanger consists of a centrifugal fan with forward curved blades and a circular set of slighly curved wirecloths that are surrounding the fan. The project was issued by Fiwihex Technology, which is developing this heat exchanger and is interested in understanding the basic phenomena behind the heat transfer. The 2D simulations on airflow through the fan are validated against experimental results from literature. The fan simulations depend on the distance between the pressure-inlet boundary and the pressure-outlet boundary and show a flow field somewhat different from that found in experiments. Increasing the performance of the fan could be realized by slightly tilting the fan blades by some 20 degrees. Two models were set up to correlate the heat transfer in the wire-cloth with the air-speed. The 2D simulations and the heat transfer models were validated with experimental results. The models provide a basis in understanding the experimental observations, such as the high heat transfer in combination with a description of the wire-cloth as a plate.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Applied Sciences","Kramers Laboratorium voor Fysische Technologie","","","",""
