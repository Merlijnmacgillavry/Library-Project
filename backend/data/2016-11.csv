(mentor); Gulamussen, N.J. (mentor)","2016","The rapid economic and population growth recently drives Maputo to become more metropolitan, with construction sector as one of the pillars to support its transformation. This progressive move is, however, hindered by one of the most crucial problems: water scarcity. Water is essentially required by construction sector, especially in concrete production. It needs a proper quantity and quality to meet the expected strength. While the quantity is determined by its ratio with cement, the quality varies for plain, structural and high-strength concrete. Drinking or tap water is commonly used in Maputo but previous experiments worldwide show that there is a possibility to use non-drinking water for concrete production. One of the emerging alternatives is treated sewage. This thesis aims to assess whether reclaimed water from the sewage can be used as a source for concrete production in Maputo in order to save tap water for domestic purposes. To determine water demand from the concrete companies, 156 concrete companies in Maputo and its surrounding, Matola and Machava, were listed and 11 of them were interviewed with the variance of locations, types of products, production methods, existing water source, number of employees, monthly water tariff, current practices and willingness to cooperate for a preliminary water reclamation project. The average amount of water consumption for 11 interviewed companies is 311 ± 36 m3/day and for the actual population of 156 companies is 4411 ± 257 m3/day. This value contributes to 12% - 14% from the total tap water use in Maputo. The water price is approximately €0.76/m3 for the small companies and €0.38/m3 for both the medium and large companies. The potential supply sources were investigated from different types, flow rates and locations, such as the outlet endpoints from houses, the wastewater treatment plant and the effluent from other industries. The influent of the wastewater treatment plant was considered the best source for the preliminary plant design with a flow rate of 5682 ± 1196 m3/day. Available standards worldwide and previous works were studied to find the safe ranges of water quality for concrete. Field and laboratory measurements were also conducted to provide preliminary information. The results were used as the basis for designing a treatment plant from the demand of 11 interviewed companies, with lower effluent quality than tap water, yet sufficient for concrete production. Recommendations of a large scale plant for all 156 companies were also presented. The system is designed as a modular scheme to provide different effluent qualities and potential changes, such as the increase of the influent flow rate, the option of combining the new system with the existing plant, etc. The system is divided into four phases. Phase 1, consisting of a coagulation tank (1 x 0.6 x 0.5 m), four flocculation tank (1.5 x 1 x 1 m) and a dissolved air flotation tank (1.6 x 1.4 x 1 m), removes fat, oil and grease, phosphorus and suspended solids. Phase 2 removes remaining suspended solids by a rapid sand filtration (1.50 m bed depth x 0.56 m diameter x 5.45 m height). Phase 3, comprising nine units of nanofiltration in one skid, removes dissolved solids to meet the demand of higher strength concrete. The last phase is disinfection which were excluded since the removal capacities from the previous phases are already sufficient. The cost of the design is divided into three packages depending on the expected effluent quality from each company. The basic package only consists of phase 1 and costs €0.30/m3. The intermediate package, comprising phase 1 and 2, costs €0.40/m3. The advanced package, consisting of phase 1 and 3, costs €0.80/m3. Only the price of the advanced package is higher than the actual tap water price. Pumps are installed before the units of rapid sand filtration and nanofiltration. Valves are incorporated to divide the flow for different treatment packages. The delivery of the effluent is performed by renting trucks since it is less expensive than constructing new pipelines. The design shows that producing concrete with reclaimed water from treated sewage is possible to be performed in Maputo and the sewage does not need to reach drinking water quality. It is the starting point to increase the availability of usable water and the opportunity of supplying tap water as much as possible for domestic purposes.","modular water treatment system; water reclamation; construction; concrete; sewage; Maputo; Mozambique","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Water Management","","","NWO Urbanizing Deltas of the World - Sustainable freshwater supply in urbanizing Maputo, Mozambique","-25.919185, 32.538649"

(mentor); Cunningham, S. (mentor); Rook, L. (mentor)","2016","Advances in technology have increased interest in indoor positioning services as they represent a high business potential. However, implementing them did not have the expected success rate for businesses because users did not see enough value in using the indoor positioning services and perceived them as being intrusive. Thus, companies have developed highly advanced technological solutions that cannot be applied to the current business world due to poor user adoption rates. This problem can be fixed by rewarding customers for sharing indoor location information that can be used by businesses to gain precious user knowledge. This creates extra utility for both businesses and customers. Customers have privacy issues when it comes to sharing private indoor location data but these are eliminated for a certain monetary reward. However, customers value their privacy differently and thus they need different amounts of compensation for the same indoor location information. Businesses consider user indoor location information valuable and are willing to pay for it. Similarly, the benefit of the businesses is variable and based on this they can afford paying a higher or lower fee for the indoor location information. There was no system that could mediate the interaction between these stakeholders and our objective was to create one. We limit our research to the retail industry, more precisely the supermarket sector and we use simulations to validate our research. The proposed system is based on any type of indoor positioning technology and is mostly applicable in United States and Western Europe We propose a platform model to mediate the interaction between businesses and customers. This mathematical model is in equilibrium for any input data set and the challenge was to find the equilibrium points. We use concepts from game theory and mechanism design and apply a method based on a three stage Stackelberg game in order to create this model. Our input variables are the benefit of the businesses and the privacy cost of the customers and based on this we want to find out the correct amount of reward offered by businesses and the correct amount indoor location information to be shared by customers. Additionally, the interactions of these stakeholders with the platform are modeled. All the three players participating in the game have a utility function modeled which is mathematically solved, such as the outcomes of the three parties are maximized. At each stage of the game we find out which businesses and customers are participating and what their best response strategy is using a MATLAB implementation. We perform simulations on a standard set of parameters and see what the impact is if players deviate from the equilibrium strategies. We validate the model through a discussion about the assumptions, how does the model fit with existing economic theories, how can results be influenced and what are real life risks of the implementation.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Management of Technology","","","",""

(mentor); Villavicencio, R. (mentor)","2016","The term Leak-Before-Break (LBB) refers to a well-established safety criterion used to assess whether cracked tanks or pipes can leak detectable amounts of fluid as a warning before catastrophic failure occurs. In this research The LBB criterion was applied to the safety assessment of spherical Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) containment systems on ships. For this type of LNG tanks, the International Code for the Construction and Equipment of Ships Carrying Liquefied Gases in Bulk (IGC) requires several fracture mechanics analyses of fatigue crack growth. Details on how these analyses should be carried out can be found in industry codes. Although these codes provide guidance on most aspects of an LBB assessment, they are not fully satisfactory with regard to their recommendations on how to calculate the growth of deep semi-elliptical surface cracks, on how to estimate the crack shape when the crack snaps through the tank wall and how to assess these through-thickness cracks in the stage right after breakthrough. The aim of this research was to more accurately simulate the development of cracks for LBB applications. To do so, a new numerical calculation model have been developed for the estimation of crack growth, crack shape development and crack propagation after wall penetration. In addition, Finite Element Models (FEM) have been developed to predict the Stress Intensity Factor (SIF), a parameter that characterises the local stress distribution in the vicinity of a crack-tip and is commonly used in fracture mechanics. Finite Element (FE) analyses were conducted to evaluate existing, approximative SIF solutions for deep, semi-elliptical surface cracks and to find a new, FE-derived SIF solution for through-thickness cracks after breakthrough. Both the new FE-derived and existing SIF solutions were used in the numerical model. The results of different SIF solutions and numerical model configurations were then compared to experimental data from the literature in order to find recommendations for the enhancement of existing LBB procedures.","leak-before-break; fracture mechanics; LNG tanks; crack propagation; rack shape development; crack growth","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","","","",""

To analyse the lack of seeding in the vortex core, a 2D numerical simulation of particle motion in vortex flow is studied. This enables to understand the dependence of trajectory of the particle on its density and diameter, in vortex flows. Thus, the numerical simulation helps to explain the reason behind the empty core with the use of micro-size smoke particles and, the completely filled core by the homogeneous distribution of HFSB in the vortex core region. Flow visualisation experiment is performed on Leading Edge Vortex of a delta-wing at a chord based Reynolds number of 2*10^5 and 4*10^5 The flow visualization experiment revealed an empty core at the center of the vortex with the use of micro-sized smoke particle as tracer. On the other hand, the use of neutrally buoyant HFSB resulted in a homogeneous distribution of particles, especially in the core region of the vortex. The vector fields obtained from stereoscopic PIV measurements with the use of micro-sized smoke as tracer particle, displays the loss of information in vortex ow particularly in axial velocity and axial vorticity fields. In contrast, the use of HFSB as tracer particle, resulted in particle filled vortex core and displays vector fields that are consistent with literature. The use of HFSB as tracer particle enabled to perform tomographic Particle Tracking Velocimetry (PTV) (3C-3D) on the Leading Edge Vortex.

(mentor)","2016","Ho Chi Minh City is flooded on a regular basis due to the lack of flood protection. Plans have been made to protect the city from flooding in the future and therefore a barrier is built at Phu Dinh. This barrier needs to fulfil three requirements. Firstly it should protect HCMC against a flood, as well resulting from tidal waves as from peak rains. Secondly during the dry season it should keep the water level above a minimum. Thirdly, while performing the first two requirements, navigation should be hindered barely. In order to find the ideal design first 3 variants were selected from 17 options with a MCA. Two of these variants were merged because of additional research. Variant A, two locks and a culvert dam, and variant B, a lock with a tidal barrier, were made into a preliminary design. These designs were compared with a new MCA and variant A was chosen as the best design. Variant A consists of a big and a small lock in order to keep the navigation possible during flood protection. When possible the big lock can be opened for free navigation due to its lift gates. The small lock will be built with double mitre gates. Between the locks a dam with culverts is built to close of the river and provide the needed conveyance area for the outflow of rain water. This design meets the requirements stated about flood protection, outflow regulation and navigation. The risks during operation are low because of the double set of doors in both locks. Because there are two locks the chances are low that the navigation will ever be totally obstructed. The estimated costs of this variant are VND 1150 billion (€ 46 million). It is recommended to look at improving the barrier by building a bridge over it. Surrounding the barrier there are no embankments present, therefore in order for the barrier to function these have to be built. Further the application of pumps in the culvert can lower the risks of a flooding due to rain, when investigating this it is important to do research on the catchment and conveyance area in the city the barrier has to deal with. During the investigation it was hard to make a good estimation about the importance of stakeholders and MCA criteria. Therefore more experience with the local environment could improve the design.","sea level rise; Phu Dinh; hydraulic structure; flood protection; Ho Chi Minh City","en","student report","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Multi Disciplinary Project","MDP214","10.710846, 106.621687"

(mentor); Ramírez-Elizondo, L.M. (mentor)","2016","The Master's programme Industrial Ecology is jointly organised by Leiden University and Delft University of Technology - There is an increasing awareness in society of the problems and risks associated with climate change. In response, a transition from fossil to renewable energy sources is taking place. Meanwhile, there is an ongoing trend of increasing electricity demand for various applications. There is a growing number of electric appliances, as well as the electrification of heating, cooling, and transportation services. These changes provide a challenge when it comes to matching electricity production and consumption. The intermittent nature of wind and solar energy, combined with the large loads of heat pumps and BEVs, reduces the flexibility and robustness of the system in the future. Solid oxide cells (SOCs) can contribute to solving the balancing problem of the electricity grid. SOCs perform electrochemical conversions and are developed for decentral energy conversion applications. A solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) uses a fuel to produce electricity, hydrogen, and heat. Solid oxide fuel-assisted electrolysis cells (SOFECs) consume electricity and a fuel while producing hydrogen and heat. Gaseous fuels like natural gas, hydrogen, and biogas can be used. SOFCs have been under investigation for decades, and are mainly applied as backup power source. SOFEC technology, on the other hand, is rather unknown. Only a dozen of articles has been published, dedicated to theoretical models and small-scale lab tests. These SOCs are seen as promising technologies, because of the high energy efficiency, flexible operation, and ability to produce hydrogen. The aim of this research is to assess whether it is feasible to introduce SOFCs and SOFECs in the (future) Dutch energy system. This research takes a broad perspective, by assessing the technological components in relation to the energy system as a whole. In addition, multiple aspects that determine the feasibility are assessed. These aspects are the technical possibilities and limitations of SOCs, their cost-effectiveness under different assumptions, the environmental implications, and societal drivers and barriers for the introduction in niche markets. Existing literature shows that the commercial competitiveness of SOCs is currently limited because of high investment costs and a limited lifetime. The manufacturing costs can be decreased by learning through research and development, and higher production volumes. To prolong the service life, degradation of the electrodes at microscopic level should be minimised. Recent research indicates that regular switching between fuel cell and (fuel assisted) electrolysis mode can also prevent degradation. It is therefore recommended to further investigate how the service life is prolonged for a SOFC that is operated regularly as SOFEC. A thermodynamic 1-D cell model was used to describe the inputs and outputs of a SOFC and a SOFEC. Based on this model, non-linear sets of equations with two degrees of freedom were derived for both technologies. These equations approximate the energy conversion by SOCs for different current densities and fuel utilisations. The level of complexity of these equations was suitable for the further analysis of the operation of the technologies. The derived equations were used to implement SOFC and SOFEC technologies in oemof, an energy system optimisation framework. The framework was then used to model the energy system of the Netherlands, including all major energy carriers, i.e. fossil fuels, electricity, heat, biomass, and hydrogen. In the model, energy production, conversion, and consumption technologies are included, as well as corresponding hour-by-hour patterns. An optimisation algorithm is used to find the optimal combination of technologies and their optimal operation that results in a system that most effectively fulfils demand. The objective is to minimise the total system costs, excluding subsidies or taxes. Costs related to GHG emissions, carbon tax or emission certificates, are included. By doing so, it is the first optimisation model of its kind for the Netherlands. Not all aspects of the real energy system are represented in the model. Most notably, energy transport and demand response are not included. The results clearly indicate that SOFCs can become an important part of the Dutch energy system if the costs decrease sufficiently and a longer lifetime of the stacks is achieved. The cost-effectiveness stems from the efficient co-production of three energy carriers and the low resource use. High GHG emission taxes are favourable for the diffusion of SOFCs. Their installation results in an emission reduction of around 5.2% (or 8 MtCO2-eq./a) compared to a system without fuel cells. No evidence was found for the influence of SOFCs on the competitiveness of renewable electricity sources. Under some conditions, SOFCs can in fact squeeze solar and wind out of the electricity market. If the costs of operating SOFCs remain high, then the installed capacity is limited to an extent for which high capacity utilisations can be achieved. The production of hydrogen is maximised to make expensive SOFCs profitable, indicating that this energy carrier is most important for a cost-effective introduction. If costs can be reduced, SOFCs prove to be a suitable technology for electricity production during periods of low renewable electricity production, while also responding to fluctuating H2 demand. It becomes viable to operate the fuel cells with more flexibility when the technology is less expensive. The influence of the demand on SOFC operation is also considerable. In a scenario with a diverse demand for both heat, hydrogen, and electricity, a wide range of settings is used. In other scenarios, different operating strategies were more optimal. Only two or three operating points were used frequently, while other settings were applied seldom. For the requirements for SOFC technology, this implies that the preferred technical specifications depend on how the energy demand will develop. The role that SOFECs can play in the Dutch energy system is much more limited than that of SOFCs. The conditions for cost-effectiveness are also stricter. A high level of renewable electricity production and/or high GHG emission taxes are required, on top of large cost reductions for SOC technology. Furthermore, its applicability is limited by the amount of biogas available. If SOFCs and SOFECs with the same costs are both available, a SOFC is often preferred, since it allows for much larger system cost reductions. The optimal operating strategy of SOFECs depends on their costs: if the technology becomes less expensive, it is cost-effective to operate at lower current densities with higher efficiency. Furthermore, SOFECs show a limited variation in the production rate over time. Unlike regular electrolysers, SOFECs are hardly operated to prevent electricity excesses. By operating almost continuously, a large fraction of biogas is utilised. A SOFEC profits from high GHG taxes, as it is (almost) carbon neutral. The societal aspects of the development and potential of SOC technology were assessed using the multi-level perspective. This framework conceptualises a niche innovation as being nested structure within a socio-technical regime and a socio-technical landscape. Within the dominant regime of energy production and consumption, there is no fully developed solution to address the challenge of increased fluctuations of electricity demand and intermittent production. Considerable research efforts in the field of SOC technology are undertaken. SOFC have received most attention, resulting in several pilot projects and growing production volumes. Few activities are taking place around SOFECs. A possible strategy is to focus on SOFC applications first, suspending efforts related to SOFECs. When lower electricity prices and lower SOC costs are achieved, it is more viable to introduce a SOFEC.Actors involved in the development of SOFCs are active, with several demonstration projects and market introductions in the area of micro-CHP applications. These dynamics could result in an uptake in the existing regime structure without exploiting and exploring the capability of SOFCs to co-produce hydrogen. Yet this study has shown the advantage of H2 production for cost-effective SOFC applications. It is deemed crucial that a user or market for the energy products of the SOFC or SOFEC is found. Therefore, the energy carrier markets for inputs and outputs form the starting point for identifying market niches, in which the SOC technology can be introduced first. Examples of identified niche applications include a farmer who uses biogas from manure digestion and supplies H2 to trucks, or a neighbourhood community that invests in a common installation. A SOC provides heat to households in a neighbourhood, while H2 is used for fuel cell vehicles or to provide electricity at peak demand. To convince potential users, these perceived barriers can be addressed or the advantages of SOCs can be emphasised. The high efficiency, low emissions, and importance for local grid balancing of SOFCs and SOFECs are arguments in favour of these technologies. In addition, the commitment of other stakeholders in pilot projects or through Green Deal agreements can stimulate the adoption. Highlights • SOC costs should decrease significantly to become an attractive addition to the (future) Dutch energy system. • Co-production of hydrogen is important for the cost-effectiveness of SOFCs. • SOFCs directly reduce GHG emissions and increase resource efficiency. • SOFCs compete with renewable electricity sources and do not facilitate their introduction. • SOFECs are economically less attractive than SOFCs, and their potential is limited by the availability of biogas. • Ideal operating strategies for SOFC and SOFEC installations in the context of an energy system were assessed, and shown to depend on the demand composition and technology costs. • Markets or consumers for heat and hydrogen are a key factor for first applications of SOC technologies.","Energy system optimization; SOFC; SOFEC","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Values Technology and Innovation","","Industrial Ecology Joint degree Leiden & Delft","",""

In this energy transition storage is one of the main bottlenecks and attracts a lot of research. In order to compensate for the intermittent character of renewable sources like solar energy, the most developed options in the field are batteries for electrical storage and hydrogen as an energy carrier for long-term energy storage. In this project, the latter has been proposed and explored as a vital solution. A sustainable way to produce hydrogen is by means of solar energy. A coupled photovoltaic-electrolysis system uses a water electrolyzer powered by a solar cell with sufficient voltage to drive the water splitting reaction. A triple junction solar cell based on hydrogenated amorphous silicon, hydrogenated nanocrystalline silicon and a silicon heterojunction solar cell has been studied. A n-type crystalline silicon wafer was used as a substrate and all thin film layers were deposited by plasma-enhanced chemical vapour deposition. The best results for a triple junction device were achieved with an intermediate layer of 6 nm n-type nc¡SiOx between top and middle cell, a 200 nm intrinsic a-Si:H layer in the top cell and a 2800 nm thick intrinsic nc-Si:H absorber layer in the middle cell. With such a structure, a STH efficiency of 2.1 % is feasible with an iridium oxide counter electrode. To further improve the device, it was shown that reducing the intrinsic a-Si:H as well as the n-a-Si:H layer in the top cell increases current density matching in the multi junction device as more light passes through to the middle cell. Furthermore, a highly doped n-a-Si:H layer in the middle cell also improved the overall performance of the triple junction.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Electrical Sustainable Energy","","Photovoltaic Materials and Devices","",""

(mentor)","2016","Confluences are special, complex elements within river systems which have been subject of much research. However, little attention has been given to the effects of density differences in confluences. The aim of this research is to see when and how density differences are important in confluences with respect to other occurring flow structures. Non-dimensional flow parameters will be linked to certain types of flow. These non-dimensional parameters can then be used to determine to some degree which flow processes can occur. Using numerical simulations of a schematized confluence the effects of density differences were identified. These effects were visible on several aerial photographs of large confluences. For one specific confluence, the Rio Negro – Solimões confluence near Manaus, Brazil, a separate model was made and run. The numerical simulations show that the denser water flowed under the lighter water. In a cross-section the shape of the interface between the two waters is very similar to the shape in a lock-exchange. In downstream direction the horizontal part of the interface moves upwards and eventually reaches the surface. This limits the distance over which the two waters can move over one another If the river downstream of the confluence is insufficiently wide, another process occurs. If the dense or light water reaches the opposite bank, it will well up or down respectively. When in a confluence a velocity difference is present between the two tributary rivers, a mixing layer is likely to develop. However, density differences can cause motion perpendicular to the main direction of flow. This motion hampers the development of a mixing layer. If density differences become too large compared to the velocity difference, the mixing layer may not develop at all. We found similarities between the flow characteristics in the numerical models and those visible on aerial photographs of several large confluences. Only aerial photographs with a colour difference between the two tributaries were used. The numerical model of the Rio Negro – Solimões confluence shows similar characteristics as those in the schematized numerical model. Aerial photographs of this confluence did not show these characteristics. The reason for this is boils of heavier Solimões water at the Rio Negro side of the river disturbed a clear surface pattern. These boils do indicate however that heavy water is present under the lighter water. Oblique photographs of this confluence often showed the absence of a mixing layer and the presence of floating foam around the interface of the two waters. These two observations can be explained by the theory derived from this research. This research shows that small density differences can have a significant impact on the hydrodynamics downstream of a confluence. It proved to be possible to link non-dimensional parameters to certain types of flow. However many aspects are still unknown and more research into these is recommended.","confluence; density difference; mixing layer; river; nummerical modelling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2017-11-30","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

The treatment of such infections requires multiple surgeries followed by long term antibiotic therapies with significant traumatic consequences to patients and high financial burden for healthcare systems. One option to increase the resistance of titanium implants to bacterial infection is to create an antimicrobial layer on the implant surface without affecting its biocompatibility. Ag based antimicrobial surfaces are currently studied with good antimicrobial activity against multidrug resistant bacteria (e.g. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus - MRSA). However silver proved to induce quite strong cytotoxic effect to host cells which may impede the osseointegration process of titanium bone implants. Recently it has been shown that Cu ions (Cu2+) seem to be suitable both to kill specific bacteria and stimulate biological responses like cell proliferation and osteogenic differentiation. Therefore incorporation of Cu nanoparticles on a TiO2 surface that can release Cu2+ at the implant-tissue interface may lead to a new generation of Ti implants with dual functionalities i.e. bactericidal and osteoconductive. Plasma electrolytic oxidation (PEO) is a surface modification technique that enables incorporation of Cu nanoparticles into a porous TiO2 layer. Furthermore, this technique is suitable to cover complex implant geometries such as hip or knee components. Cu-bearing TiO2 layers were synthesised by PEO on Ti6Al7Nb biomedical alloy and characterised by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and X‐ray diffraction (XRD). The analyses revealed that the TiO2 layers were rough, completely covered with interconnected micro pores and Cu nanoparticles had been successfully incorporated into the surface. Inductively Coupled Plasma-Optical Emission Spectrometry (ICP-OES) analysis was used to quantify the release of Cu2+ from the surface of Cu-bearing layers into phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) media. Cu2+ showed sustained release over a period of sixty days. A direct contact assay was used to assess the in vitro surface antibacterial activity of the Cu-bearing TiO2 layers against specific concentrations of S. aureus and MRSA bacterial species. Both bacterial species were completely killed after 24 hours. An agar diffusion assay was used to study the leachable antibacterial activity of the Cu-bearing TiO2 layers against S. aureus. A bacterial growth inhibition zone was observed around the sample disc indicating Cu had an at least bacteriostatic effect against bacteria-containing agar. Overall, Cu-bearing layers displayed good antibacterial activity against the pathogen which is the most common cause of bacterial infection in implants (S. aureus) and against a virulent multi-drug resistant pathogen (MRSA). The release of Cu2+ into PBS coupled with the inhibition of bacterial growth by Cu-bearing TiO2 layers suggest that a sustained antibacterial effect of Cu-bearing TiO2 layers is possible which could extend to its surroundings.","Antibacterial surfaces; Cu nanoparticles; TiO2; plasma electrolytic oxidation; Ti6Al7Nb; S. aureus; MRSA","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Biomechanical Engineering","","Biomaterials & Tissue Biomechanics","",""

(mentor)","2016","The likelihood ratio is a generally accepted measure for the strength of evidence in forensic comparison problems. These problems concern comparisons where it is investigated whether at least two items come from the same source or not, e.g. whether the DNA on the crime scene comes from the suspect or not. The use of likelihood ratios by forensic experts in practical forensic casework demands for a unified system to compute likelihood ratios. Therefore, the EU funded the ''ENFSI-LR’’ project that aims to construct software which helps forensic experts to calculate likelihood ratios based on validated scripts and harmonized models. In this thesis some problems concerning the ENFSI-LR project are addressed. Solutions to these problems are useful for unification, validation and (future) development of the software. Throughout this thesis, the emphasis is on continuous two-level feature-based models. In the literature, these underlying models have led to two likelihood ratio formulas. In this thesis it is proved that these two formulas are exactly the same. This thesis also explores several parameter estimation methods for the two-level model. Standard estimation methods are compared with estimation methods which have not been used in forensic statistics until now: a generalized weighted mean or maximum likelihood estimation. As an extension of existing feature-based models, a model is introduced that combines discrete- and continuous evidence into one likelihood ratio.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2016-11-30","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Delft Institute of Applied Mathematics","","Probability, Risk and Statistics","",""

(mentor); Savenije, H.H.H. (mentor); Mosselman, E. (mentor); McClain, M.E. (mentor)","2016","The Mara River Basin (MRB) at the boundary of Kenya and Tanzania is one of the many river basins in the world that has to cope with increasing water scarcity. The MRB supports the world-renowned Maasai Mara National Reserve and Serengeti National Park, as well as growing numbers of farmers and pastoralists. Increasing water demand, deforestation and climate change may exacerbate water in-security in the future. A hydrological model was created for this data-scarce African catchment, to predict the impact of these changes on the balance between water demand and supply at the different water sources in basin. As such, this thesis aims to contribute to water resource planning and mana-gement in the Kenyan share of the MRB. Firstly, the main water-related problems and potential solutions in the study area were identified using surveys. Water scarcity was ranked as main livelihood issue by all stakeholders in the Kenyan share of the MRB, although severity increased in southeastern direction. Deforestation and climate change were perceived to be major causes. Suggested solutions usually amounted to increased amounts or volumes of water sources. To facilitate the modelling of such interventions, literature review and sur-veys were used to estimate the water use and demand in the study area. Distinction was made between users, water sources, subbasins, years and months, showing significant variability for each factor. For the creation of a hydrological model, the semi-distributed conceptual FLEX-Topo modelling con-cept was used, adding water use and demand to the existing framework. Classification of the study area into four hydrological response units (HRUs) was based on topographical characteristics, land cover and observations. Meteorological input was distributed by the selection of ground stations for each of the seven subbasins. All parameters for water use and 8 out of 19 other parameters were esti-mated. Parameter and process constraints were applied during calibration. Although exact discharge patterns were not represented, hydrological behaviour corresponds to expectations and Nash-Sutcliffe coefficients were high. Moreover, performance improved with the inclusion of water demand. Standardization of scenario evaluation included the creation of a reference model. Furthermore, per-formance measures were established regarding the environmental flow requirements (EFRs) and the water supply to other users at each source. In the reference model, which is assumed to be representa-tive for the current situation, the EFRs exceed the mean monthly flows during three months per year in maintenance years and are critical during the same months in drought years. Moreover, the perfor-mance of water sources in the reference model is best for boreholes, followed in decreasing order by rivers, shallow wells, springs, ponds and rooftop rainwater harvesting reservoirs. Scenarios included deforestation, climate change, changes in demand at each water source and chan-ges in demand of each main user. In 20 years, climate change will probably have most impact on the performance regarding EFRs and the water availability for other users. The effects are most likely po-sitive, but rainfall predictions are very uncertain. Furthermore, clearance of the northern forests would increase the peakedness. Increased water demand at the cleared land would significantly amplify these effects. Clearance of shrublands may have similar effects and would reduce the water availability at springs. However, the potential impacts of increased water use are greater. Planned large-scale irriga-tion projects will probably contribute most to these impacts, followed by livestock and inhabitants. Increased use from rivers and springs would have most negative impacts on performance regarding EFRs, followed by shallow wells. The impacts of ponds and rooftop rainwater harvesting on the other hand are insignificant and enhanced borehole water use might even be positive. The Sand subbasin is the most recommended target area for water management interventions. To re-duce water scarcity, recommended interventions throughout the MMC are increasing storage sizes of rooftop rainwater harvesting tanks and ponds in all subbasins but the Sand. Prevention of deforestation is also advisable. For boreholes, further research should confirm the recharge origin and potential of the aquifer. Lastly, the uncertainty of the model results may be reduced in further research, for instan-ce by improving the hydrometeorologial input of the model. Moreover, the model may be expanded with for instance other planned projects or water quality and erosion.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Water Management","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","Waste heat recovery is essential to reduce energy consumption in industry. A heat pump can be used to upgrade waste heat to a temperature level that is suitable for process heat. This study concerns a compression-resorption heat pump. The goal is to optimise the heat pump energetically, while keeping the investment attractive. Entropy production is a measure for energy dissipation and therefore this will be used to quantify the exergetic losses of the cycle. To minimise entropy production is equivalent to optimising the energetic performance. A literature study is performed and two models are developed and applied to an example case from industry. For the example case the calculations showed that the COP can be increased by 26 % with respect to the currently installed pentane vapour-compression heat pump. The theory of non-equilibrium thermodynamics is applied to find the local entropy production distribution in the resorber. The calculations showed that especially in the beginning of the process the entropy production rate is high. Together the models are used to evaluate the economic performance of the system. To reduce the payback period new configurations of the heat exchanging process in the resorber are investigated using the criterion of equipartition of entropy production. These investigations show that distributing the inlet mass flow over the length of the heat exchanger does not decrease the required heat transfer area. Decreasing the cross-sectional area for the flow however, does cause a reduction of the heat transfer area.","heat exchanger; Heat pump; energy efficiency; ammonia-water; non-equilibrium thermodynamics; entropy production; waste heat","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Process and Energy","","","",""

(mentor); Menenti, M. (mentor); Gard, W.F. (mentor)","2016","Laser scanning technique is an upcoming technique for many engineering purposes. Terrestrial laser scanners have become widely accessible for companies, universities and research centres in the last decade. A green-wavelength terrestrial laser scanning device is available for scan projects at the Delft University of Technology. Green-wavelength terrestrial laser scanners have successfully been used in many scan projects. Specifically, because its laser light is green and able to scan through the water surface, the scanner may also be used in through water scan applications. In this graduation thesis the possibilities and limitations of a green-wavelength terrestrial laser scanner in underwater scan applications are explored. Recommendations of the laboratory experiments will lead to experimental set ups of field experiments. The latter will provide recommendations for future research goals in the field. In this research project various targets have been scanned through the water. Basic laboratory experiments have been set up to discover the required and preferred scan settings. Various scan targets have been scanned both dry and under water to determine the scan prospects. Also a design for the field experiments was created based on the experiments that simulated outdoor environments. The underwater targets were chosen specifically for their presence in the outdoor environment. Two case studies were set up that represented real life situations. The first case study concerned the scanning of mooring poles for marine structure inspection purposes. The second case study was set up for both bathymetry and ecological studies as it consisted of mapping the bottom of a water body and the underwater vegetation. Even though the terrestrial laser scanner in question, the Leica C10 ScanStation, is not especially designed for underwater scan applications, the scanner is able to detect underwater objects. The main limitation is induced by the laser scanning device itself. For the most part, scans of underwater targets by a terrestrial laser scanner require a downward scan angle. The field of view limitation that applies to the vertical downward scan angle of the Leica C10 makes adjustment to the experimental set up necessary. The scan possibilities are defined by three dominating factors: the scan target, the water conditions and the power and wavelength of the light that the laser scanning device omits. Experience learns that under certain water conditions some scan targets will provide sufficient returns and others may not. As the characteristics of the laser scanning device are fixed, the combination of the reflectance spectra of the target and water depth and turbidity will determine whether the scan is successful. Before scanning in the field the surroundings and target should be investigated thoroughly before conducting the experiment. After the environment is explored and the project goals are clear it is advised to make an informed choice for the type of laser scanning device and to draw an experimental design. One of the deliverables of this thesis is a 'how to scan with the Leica C10' manual that is attached as an appendix. With this manual a new user should be able to operate the Leica C10 in a variety of scan projects. A mind map is created to support the conclusions of this research project. The mind map summarises all of the findings and can be used as a guideline for further research studies.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience and Remote Sensing","","Optical and Laser Remote Sensing","",""

Vaak wordt een gerichte graaf afgebeeld als een multi-level graaf. We bekijken een voorbeeld van een gerichte graaf: de stamboom van TU Delft medewerkers bij de afdeling Toegepaste Wiskunde, die ontwikkeld is door Kees Roos. In deze stamboom zitten veel kruisingen waardoor de graaf niet heel goed leesbaar is. Door het aantal kruisingen te minimaliseren zal dit verbeterd worden. Dit doen we door de knopen in nieuwe horizontale levels te verdelen en de knopen in de levels in een andere volgorde te zetten. Om een ordening van de knopen in de levels te vinden waardoor het aantal kruisingen minimaal is, zullen we het probleem omschrijven als een semi-definiet programma (SDP). Maar voordat we zover zijn stellen we eerst een integer lineair programma (ILP) op waarop onze SDP is gebaseerd. Voor het SDP moeten we een kostenmatrix defini ëren die het aantal kruisingen tussen twee levels weergeeft. Daarnaast moeten we voorwaarden opstellen zodat de ordening in de levels ook toegelaten is. Omdat het SDP erg moeilijk op te lossen is, gaan we kijken naar een relaxatie. Deze relaxatie is nog erg zwak en zullen we versterken met meer voorwaarden. Uiteindelijk krijgen we een relaxatie die sterker is dan de lineaire relaxatie van het ILP. Na het vinden van de sterke SDP-relaxatie willen we het probleem natuurlijk oplossen. We gebruiken hierbij twee verschillende oplossingsmethoden om alle voorwaarden mee te kunnen nemen. Ten slotte wordt dit allemaal gebruikt om de stamboom beter leesbaar te maken.","","nl","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Delft Institute of Applied Mathematics (DIAM)","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","A hollow cantilever is used in place of a conventional cantilever to dispense and aspirate liquids in the femto-litre (10^−15 L) volume range in an atomic force microscope (AFM) set up. Unlike a conventional AFM cantilever, these cantilevers are made hollow with an on-chip reservoir. Fluid is dispensed through a micro/nanometer scale aperture on the AFM tip. Dispensed (or aspirated) liquid volume is a function of tip contact time, applied pressure in the reservoir, surface energy of the substrate, surface energy of the tip, and surface tension of the liquid. In a conventional AFM, these parameters are usually not taken into consideration, but these factors will influence the dispense (aspirate) process of the hollow cantilever. To control the dispensing and aspiration process of a hollow cantilever, the influence of various factors needs to be analyzed and a dynamic model should be developed. In the present thesis, initial experimental results on the dispensing process and an analytical dynamic model describing the process are reported. The model is based on the relation between the Laplace pressure and volume of the liquid bridge connecting the cantilever tip and the substrate. The model developed could describe the dispensing process with variance accounted for (VAF) larger than 90%. Based on the model, four different controllers are designed : series PID controller, parallel PI controller, combination of feedback linearization and iterative learning control and model reference controller. It was found the combination of feedback linearization and iterative learning control can control the system to dispense desired liquid much fast without any overshoot, and model reference controller can control the system without using system identification.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2017-11-29","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","DCSC","","","",""

(mentor); Pourquie, M.J.B.M. (mentor); van Zuijlen, A.H. (mentor)","2016","Flow induced vibrations (FIV) is a known problem in nuclear reactors. The interaction between the turbulent flow of the coolants and the fuel rod bundles generates vibrations which are undesirable. These vibrations can be a major cause of fatigue failures, stress corrosion cracking and fretting wear of materials, which lead to stand-still costs. Analytical models for FIV are not feasible for complex geometries. This is especially true, when a strong interaction between fluid and structure forces is involved. The dynamic nature and a strong coupling between the two phase generates a need to study FIV by the use of numerical approaches. To take into account the interaction between the fluid and the structure one has to couple the solvers for both the phases. Coupling is achieved by mapping the forces and displacements between the interfaces of fluid and structure domains; also known as the Partitioned coupling. Recent works have made it possible to reduce the coupling errors and make them more efficient through the use of better algorithms. Due to the wide range of the scales involved, vibrations due to turbulent fluctuations of the flow are particularly challenging to solve. A common approach to this problem is to use high fidelity solvers for fluids such as DNS or LES which are computationally expensive for long and complex domains. Attempts have been made for use of cheaper URANS models to capture the modes of the resulting structural vibration by providing an initial perturbation to the structure. However, URANS models compute the time averaged velocity and pressures. The models do not calculate the effect of pressure fluctuations due to turbulent flow fluctuations on the structure. As a result, URANS does not provide information on the amplitudes of the vibrations of the structure due to turbulent fluctuations. In the current study, the primary objective is to reduce computational costs, and to still capture the complete dynamic behavior of the structure through the use of URANS models. This is performed by the modeling of pressure fluctuations from the turbulent kinetic energy calculated from the URANS models. The modelled pressure fluctuations (p0) are added to the mean pressure (p), which are then mapped over to the fluid structure interface to generate these vibrations. The method is applied to several test cases related to the field of nuclear energy production and results compared to DNS results and experimental results. The results obtained show that the method is capable of simulating FIV caused due to random pressure fluctuations in a turbulent flow. Form the test cases it was concluded that the method has an advantage of lower cost than LES/DNS, but still has the potential of modelling the amplitude of vibrations by turbulent pressure fluctuations.","Fluid-Structure Interaction; Turbulent flows; Flow Induced Vibrations; Pressure Fluctuation Modelling; Nuclear Reactors; URANS","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2017-11-29","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Process and Energy","","","",""

With the current linear system valuable resources are lost. In addition, a circular system can contribute to the processing of the expected increasing intensity of precipitation. The consequences for the spatial quality, when a circular concept is applied to the urban water system are however still unknown. This research is therefore aimed to determine these consequences with a focus on storm water handling, and recommend suitable storm water handling strategies. The question is how a transition to circular storm water management influences the quality of public spaces in residential areas in the Netherlands? This research is meant for designers, planners, and policy makers whose difficult task it is to make trade‐offs between entangled interests, a wide variety of conditions and measures with different positive and negative consequences. Due to the complexity of the problem it is difficult to sensibly evaluate different alternatives. Therefore the Multi Criteria Decision Making framework has been applied throughout this research. This methodology can be structured in four steps following the decision analytic theory from Keeney (1992). (1) Structuring of the decision problem, (2) Assessment of the impact of alternatives, (3) Determine the preferences of decision‐makers, and (4) Evaluation and comparison of alternatives.","","; en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Management in the Built Environment","","Industrial Ecology","",""

(mentor); Gibo, T.L. (mentor)","2016","Elastic joints endow robots with advantages including energy-efficiency, safety and performance. To optimally actuate such joints, robotic tasks are formulated as optimal control problems with task objectives and their solutions provide the optimal control policies. However, two general challenges while solving these problems exist. They include the mathematical formulation of a task objective, due to a lack of verifiable criteria and the computation of the optimal solutions due to nonlinearities, state constraints, multiple degrees of freedom, etc. Now, since humans are considered to be optimizing agents with their innate constraints, a systematic analysis of their movement behavior might provide clues to tackle these two issues. Therefore, we propose a novel approach where humans can be beneficially employed. We provide such an analysis through experiments during which, subjects learned to manipulate virtual objects which represent elastic joints to perform two control tasks. In the first control task of maximizing the object’s terminal velocity, a cost functional can be easily formulated but the control policy computation is difficult. Humans while performing this task, showed that they are capable of approaching optimal task execution. Their apparent control strategies can be used as initial guesses to reduce the computational difficulties in finding optimal solutions. In the second control task of displacing an elastic object in the shortest time, finding a criterion that can represent a cost function is not straightforward. The control costs that were optimized by humans when deciphered, provided insights about the relative weighting of the dominant costs including hand acceleration, hand and object distance. These findings favour the exploration and utilization of human control policies for actuating elastic joints in future research.","Optimal control; elastic joints; movement strategies; control policies","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-11-29","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","Musculoskeletal modeling and dynamics simulations are common tools used to analyse gait in patients with Cerebral Palsy (CP). These musculoskeletal models are usually generic models based on anatomical measurements obtained from cadavers, hence no subject characteristics are included. It is important to understand the accuracy of using a generic musculoskeletal model when analysing impaired gait to better comprehend the outcome which can lead to enhanced gait analysis for CP. The purpose of this study was to determine if and how a musculoskeletal model, including femoral anteversion and tibial torsion, will improve a simulation of CP gait. Deformed musculoskeletal models including femoral anteversion and/or tibial torsion and a generic musculoskeletal model were applied to artificial datasets representing the same deformation as in the deformed model. The model outputs that were studied are marker tracking errors, simulated joint angles, muscle-tendon length and moment arms of the psoas, gluteus medius, gastrocnemius and tibialis anterior in a static pose and during simulation of gait. The models were also tested with gait data for five CP subjects. A generic and a deformed model were applied to gait data for each the subjects. The same model outputs were analysed and compared between the models as for the artificial datasets. Effects of fitting a generic musculoskeletal model on data including bone deformations was demonstrated with the artificial data. Although, fitting the generic model and the deformed model to the five CP subjects did show the same effects as for the artificial data we can not conclude that including femoral anteversion and tibial torsion in a musculoskeletal model will improve simulation of CP gait since these effect were on a small scale and could be due to other factors than the bone deformations.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Biomechanical Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Brandt, L. (mentor); Breugem, W.P. (mentor)","2016","Direct numerical simulations of the fully developed turbulent flow through a porous channel show the appearance of short span-wise rollers at the fluid-porous interface along with the streaky structures of wall-bounded turbulence near the upper wall of the channel. The scope of the present research project is to investigate the instabilities in porous channel flow by means of local linear stability analysis in order to elucidate their physical origin and underlying mechanisms. The numerical approach for the problem consists of framing an eigenvalue problem using primitive variable approach to model the porous channel flows. The Volume Averaged Navier-Stokes (VANS) equations are used for modeling the flow through a porous channel with a porosity distribution function varying along the wall-normal direction separating the homogeneous fluid region and the homogeneous porous region by an interface region with smooth transition of porosity. The linearized VANS equations are discretized using 4th order dispersion-relation preserving finite-differences schemes, in order to reduce the computational resources in terms of memory and time. The modal stability analysis is performed to identify the linearly unstable region based on the critical flow parameters (critical Reynolds number and critical wavenumber). Reynold-Orr analysis is carried out to identify the contribution of different terms of the perturbation kinetic energy in the flow. A scaling approach is done to identify and distinguish between the different physical mechanisms governing the instabilities in the flow at different ranges of porosity. Non-modal analysis is carried out to understand the mechanism responsible for optimal energy amplification in the sub-critical regime and the wavenumbers over which maximum energy growth takes place. Non-modal analysis for turbulent porous channel flow is also carried out to get better insight into the underlying mechanisms governing the instabilities in the flow. It is seen that the 4th order dispersion relation preserving scheme is well able to capture the physics of the flow through porous channel. Initial analysis about the linearly unstable region shows that the Squire transformation holds for porous channel flows and hence the modal stability analysis is performed using two dimensional perturbations. The eigenspectrum and the shape of the eigenmode shows the evolution of viscid instability from fluid region at low values of porosity. At high values of porosity, the eigenmode shows strong flow reversal at the interface due to weakening of wall-blocking and wall induced viscous effects. Energy analysis shows the dominance of viscous dissipation at lower values of porosity while the porous dissipation becomes significant at higher values of porosity. The physical origin of the instability is identified by the scaling analysis. It is seen that at lower values of porosity, the instability stems from the viscous fluid region (TS instability) while the primary source of instability at higher values of porosity is a TS instability wave modified by the drag from porous region. Non-modal analysis shows the optimal mechanism of energy amplification over different ranges of porosity is the Lift-up effect due to the streaky structures. However the non-normal energy growth becomes insignificant at extremely high values of porosity. The turbulent flow analysis provides a better understanding of the perturbation kinetic energy gain as seen from the direct numerical simulations. The optimal mechanism responsible for the energy growth is due to the streaky structures for different values of porosity. However at extremely high values of porosity there is energy gain due to the span-wise rollers as well but energy gain due to streaks still dominates.","Resolvent norm; Porous channel flow; Volume-averaged Navier-Stokes; Dispersion relation preserving schemes; Local stability analysis; Modal stability; Reynolds-Orr analysis; Non-modal stability; Transient growth","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Process and Energy","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","Intentional or friendly acquisitions as argued in existing research are being practiced increasingly for past couple of decades, and yet the focus towards the selling company’s perspectives is observed to be relatively low compared to that of acquirers. Moreover, sellers’ position in acquisitions is often perceived as an action to counteract unforeseen/unplanned activities, whereas the recent trends of such acquisitions don’t abide by this assumption. Sellers are increasingly practicing strategically planned exits and within this narrow field of seller-initiated acquisitions, sellers that involve a broker to facilitate the acquisition transactions are put under perspective in this report. Within this novel field of research, this thesis explores the impact of selling firm’s legitimacy & broker’s impact on acquisition transactions that eventually lead to realization of higher returns to the seller. In order to achieve the research aim, systematic approach that consisted of two underlying approaches, theoretical and technical, was conducted. In the first, theoretical, phase of the research, selective literature on selling company’s underlying legitimacy aspects and broker’s orientation/type, functionalities, and driving incentives was surveyed. Precisely, the factors that were perceived as controlling factors in valuation of the seller by the acquirer were collectedly put in a framework. Observed factors in the first phase of the research lacked the literature that observed the interconnections and relationships among such underlying factors, therefore relevant justification to conduct a further technical research of acquisitions was in order. Further, in the second aspect of the methodology, an attempt was made to extend the proposed framework from the theoretical approach. A systematic approach was undertaken in order to conduct a total of four case studies categorized under two brokers and further into brokers individual cases of one early and a late maturity stage seller. Following the individual case analysis, comparative case analyses (among late-late and early-early sellers), and a cross-case analysis across the four sellers was conducted. The results of such comparative analysis provided grounds for the build up of patterns among late and early stage sellers, whereas the cross-case analysis provides the overlap of such patterns throughout the cases, which in turn are the propositions and generalized findings of the overall research. Besides such patterns and propositions, additional underlying factors to firm’s internal & external legitimacy, and broker were observed and incorporated in the afore-established framework. Both aspects of research approaches, when aligned together, reveal the importance of high impacting (1) development phase of the seller, (2) sellers formed alliances, its (3) socio-political legitimacy, (4) exit strategy planning, (5) involved broker’s incentives, (6) broker's human capital, and (7) broker initiated competitive negotiations on the over all acquisition transaction. Besides, the high impacting underlying factors, five propositions are formulated that show the impact and how such underlying factors can compensate each other when a seller’s undergoing acquisition. Further, besides the general findings, results from comparative case analyses reveal the findings precisely valid in the late or early maturity stages of the selling company. These findings are discussed further as patterns that were observed in both early and late maturity stage sellers. Relevance of this research is highly valuable in terms of the attempt it makes to bridge the observed academic gap in the field of seller-initiated acquisitions. On the other hand, the practical relevance of this study is the general findings and the maturity stage specific findings that provide an entrepreneur/manager to formulate a high impacting exit strategy that maximizes seller’s returns in the acquisition transactions by involving brokers.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Values Technology and Innovation","","Management of Technology (MOT)","",""

(mentor)","2016","In the last years, the country of Greece is striving to overcome the severe financial consequences of the European debt crisis, that hindered its economic growth and downgraded the quality of life of its citizens. The difficult economic state of Greece as well as the long-existing global problem of energy resources depletion constitute the two fundamental concerns, which triggered the conduction of this graduation report. The impending shortage of fossil fuels coupled with the ever increasing demand for energy consumption led to the rapid development of renewable energy sources (RES), which is evident nowadays. But although RES are the answer to environmental sustainability, their contribution to the overall energy utilization for various countries is still minor. In an effort to support the deployment of renewable technologies, many nations, including Greece, have enforced national and international agreements binding them on their renewable energy targets over the years. With a rich renewable energy potential, Greece has set its RES goals up to the year 2020, internationally via the Renewable Energy Directive 2009/28/EC and nationally via the National Renewable Energy Action Plan (NREAP), which were both realized in 2009, just before the burst of the economic turmoil. In the years following the crisis and despite all economic adversities troubling Greece, the only RES that continued its fast development and even reached occasionally the committed targets of 2020 was the solar photovoltaic (PV) energy. Consequently, the thesis focuses on investigating the financial and socio-economic impact of a potential solar PV transition in Greece by addressing the following main research question: how could the fulfillment of the national RES target for solar PV energy by 2020 contribute to the improvement of the Greek people’s welfare during the period of the crisis. In this context, the report studies and evaluates the implementation of large-scale solar PV power plants in Greece with respect to the country’s national and European energy commitments by 2020, through the conduction of a Social Cost Benefit Analysis (SCBA). The aforementioned analysis is executed in two distinctive parts, depending on the perspective of the people with standing for each part: the financial part considering only private investors’ costs and benefits, and the socio-economic part taking into account the whole society. Based on the positive outcome of both parts, the analysis concludes that undertaking the proposed venture would benefit not only private investors but also the Greek society as a whole, assisting at the same time in overcoming the economic recession. Concluding, it is worth highlighting the apparent scientific value of this graduation report. Despite the limited relevant literature available on the subject and the restrains of the SCBA methodology itself, the current thesis constitutes the first complete SCBA attempt to evaluate an actual national solar energy target according to the European Commission’s guidelines and under the unfavorable socio-economic conditions of an economic crisis. In the last part of the report, all barriers that occurred in the course of this work are discussed in detail and specific suggestions for the enhancement of future research along with relevant policy recommendations are given. Finally, reflections on the research performed, related to its strong points, its difficulties and its novelties are presented.","Solar Energy; Social Cost Benefit Analysis (SCBA); Greece; Greek Debt Crisis; European Directives; Photo-voltaic Technology","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Values Technology and Innovation","","Sustainable Energy Technology (SET)","",""

(mentor)","2016","The thesis is focused on the current state-of-the-art of modeling turbulent single-phase and turbulent two-phase stratified flows. This report is meant to identify and validate the most suitable candidate model for inclusion in the multiphase flow models that are being developed in the Scientific Computing group of the Delft Institute for Applied Mathematics. For that reason, as an initial step the results of single phase turbulent pipe flows which are simulated using DNS and LES methods are compared with the results of Eggels. In two-phase flows, if the gas phase is turbulent the liquid phase will become turbulent as well. If the transition occurs from stratified flow to stratified-wavy flow, the interfacial momentum transfer varies due to the existence of waves at the interface. This process makes modeling of the momentum transfer complicated. In general, when the effects of surface tension are negligible the equations for the two-phase flow and for the single-phase flow are identical, the only differences between two-phase and single phase flow equations are the variable density and viscosity. Therefore, the influence of the interface and the momentum transfer between both phases can be ignored and a simple single-phase flow model combined with an interface model can be used as an initial approximation while concentrating on modeling the turbulence in both phases away from the interface. For this reason, the one-fluid model needs to be introduced (refer to Appendix \ref{App:s62}) in order to obtain results for multiphase flows using classical single-phase flow models. In this project, two different types of numerical techniques, namely DNS and LES are chosen to estimate the computational resources of a turbulent single-phase pipe flow test case with a friction Reynolds number of $Re_*=360$. Accordingly, computational complexities of different techniques are analyzed in detail. The estimation procedure of the problem complexity (i.e., the required number of total grid cells) for turbulent single-phase flows gives an underestimate for the number of unknowns of turbulent two-phase flows. The comparison of computational costs showed that Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) is possible for turbulent two-phase stratified pipe flows only for low Reynolds numbers. For high Reynolds number flows, DNS is not feasible because the current implementation of the algorithm is not parallelized and the computational resources of the Scientific Computing group are limited. Because of these reasons, large eddy simulation (LES) is considered to be the promising technique as the computational resources required for DNS become excessive for higher Reynolds number the serial code. Therefore, LES needs to be investigated elaborately for turbulent two-phase stratified pipe flows in future. At this point, several numerical simulations are performed to take first steps towards simulation of turbulent two-phase flows using the one-fluid model. However, it is due to limitations in time, turbulent two-phase flow simulations are not performed and only turbulent single-phase flows are considered in this thesis. The numerical results for the Poiseuille flow are obtained both in Cartesian and cylindrical coordinates to verify the variable viscosity formulation before analyzing turbulent flows. The algorithm developed in the Scientific Computing group is improved with necessary periodic boundary conditions for the discretization of the equations that describe turbulent single-phase flow in a circular pipe geometry. First, these boundary conditions are introduced into the algorithm and then results of numerical simulations in 2D (channel flow) and 3D (axisymmetric pipe flow) are validated by comparing them with theoretical values in Section 5. Then, the variable viscosity formulation is incorporated into the algorithm to take a step towards LES computations. In addition to this, the subgrid scale (SGS) parametrization and the Smagorinsky model are utilized for treatment of SGS turbulence which constitutes the basis of LES. The present numerical results for both DNS and LES illustrate that they are in agreement with the results of Eggels. Moreover, both methods are capable of simulating the problem within a reasonable amount of time and accuracy. It is also shown that choosing a relatively smaller pipe length (because of the restrictions imposed by the serial code) than the one chosen by Eggels has no significant effect on the resulting velocity profiles.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2016-11-28","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Applied Mathematics","","","",""

The sargassum mostly consists of Sargassum Natans and Sargassum Fluitans. Old studies concluded that the sargassum came from the Sargasso Sea, however the most recent massive tide of sargassum (named as golden tide) came from an area north of the Amazon river delta. Texas A&M University of Galveston and the University of Florida developed detection systems in cooperation with NASAs satellite images. With the detection system it is possible to track, trace and make forecasts of sargassum landings. Hereby it is possible to act a few days before the sargassum washes ashore, instead of reacting when it landed on the beach already. Most of the problems occur when the massive influxes of sargassum are washed ashore. Currently, the most used harvesting methods on the beach are by use of rakes and wheelbarrows or by using mechanical equipment like a cane loaders and front-end loaders. The beach cleaning methods causes beach erosion and endangers local wildlife. Therefore, harvesting methods at sea are under development. Sargassum is an organic material and can be an useful source for processing. The most used processing methods of sargassum are burying at the beach or using it as a fertiliser. One of the challenges in processing sargassum is working with the unpredictable appearing character of sargassum. The known detection methods have been critically analysed and the most favourable method is developed by Texas A&M University Galveston. This system is applicable on other areas as well and it makes forecasts of sargassum landings. The harvesting methods have also been critically analysed and it can be concluded that the most recommended harvesting method has to be done at sea in combination with a floating barrier. Most of the problems are avoided in this manner. For processing multiple opportunities have been pointed out. Biofuel and bioplastics are having large potential. For the mean time using sargassum as a fertiliser is a su cient solution. The uneven appearances can be solved by drying the sargassum. Finally, an implementation plan is developed for Quintana Roo to overcome the sargassum problems. It is a step-by-step approach which can be conducted by a party who is willing to take the lead. In this approach the detection system of Texas can be used and new harvesting methods have to be developed. For processing, dry facilities have to be built in order to solve the uneven appearances.","","en","student report","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","","","","Multidisciplinary project",""

(mentor); Metrikine, A. (mentor)","2016","First Year Ice ridge loads are often the design loads for offshore structures in Arctic regions. Based on the field observation data for Confederation bridge, the calculated upper limit for the ice ridge loads according to ISO 19906 Standard were quite high when compared to the measured loads. There is a need to obtain an improved description of the internal structure of the ice ridge to understand its mechanical behavior. Finite Element (FE) thermodynamic analysis on a large ridge in 3 dimensions is computationally expensive due to the large number of elements required to accurately capture the phase change process occurring in the pores. Thus, the aim of this thesis has been to analyze the thermodynamic consolidation process on an ice ridge composed of 2-dimensional ice bodies, construct the analytical function to predict increase in boundaries of the ice bodies and then finally obtain a consolidated ice ridge geometry. Firstly, a ridge formation model was created to obtain the arrangement of the ice bodies within the ridge internal structure. The bodies were allowed to interact with each other under the influence of buoyancy and gravity and the contacts between the loose ice bodies were resolved using impulses calculated using Non-smooth discrete element method (NDEM). Finite Element (FE) thermodynamic analysis was carried out on the ice body arrangement based on constant temperature boundary conditions to model the consolidation process and obtain the temperature distribution within the ridge. The proposed consolidation model was validated by comparing with results from Stefan’s Law predictions for growth in level ice thickness. Analytical functions to predict the increase in dimension of the ice bodies were based on simplified heat transfer processes within the ridge. One dimensional heat conduction was used to model the influence of the initial temperature of the ice body at each corner point. The influence of the cold ambient air was modelled using Stefan’s Law expression. In this case, average thermal conductivity of the area directly above the ice body was used to model the heat flux. Non-linear regression analysis was then performed using the results from the FE analysis to fit the function to the dataset. The functions were then used to predict the expansion of the ice bodies after a given time duration and the boundaries were merged to give the final ridge geometry. Finally, a comparison was made with the FE results. It was concluded that the major increase at the top of the ridge is caused by the contribution from ‘ambient temperature’ and the depth of the ice body below the waterline was the major variable for this case. The major variable for the ice bodies in the lower part of the keel, was the corner point temperature. Some deviations from the FE model results were observed due to the fact that deterioration of ridge keel due to surrounding water is not included in the regression model and thus the blocks near the bottom of the ridge keel do not show the expected decrease in boundaries. Overall, the modelling work presented in this thesis provides a good framework to approximate the FE consolidation results and the analytical functions can be improved to include more variables that are involved in consolidation process.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Offshore & Dredging Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Lourens, E. (mentor); Van der Male, P. (mentor); Smid, E. (mentor); Van der Meulen, M. (mentor)","2016","Project Code: OE54015, OE54030. The potential of offshore wind is enormous. The wind resource offshore is generally much greater than onshore, especially at bigger water depths. Expanding prudently into the sea leads to bigger support structures for the wind turbine. Therefore, the need for optimized designs, which will establish the wind energy as a low-cost solution, emerges. Structural optimization requires insight in the critical loads to which the wind turbines are subjected. The complex systems of variable loads render fatigue determinant for the life-span of the structure. However, a fatigue assessment requires computationally expensive time-domain simulations, which are the main obstacle for the optimization process. In conjunction with established work, this thesis aims at determining the accuracy of a fast frequency-domain model for fatigue loads estimation. The overall goal of this thesis is to calculate the structural response to combined wind and wave loads in the frequency domain. The modeling of the wind loads and, more specifically, the modeling of the thrust force constituted the main scope of the current research. In order to calculate the response of the structure in terms of internal loads, a linear structural model with a lumped mass is used. A first qualitative assessment is made on the basis of power spectral densities. Dirlik's approach is used to translate the information hold in the PSDs into damage equivalent loads. Finally, the accuracy of the developed model was compared to relevant results derived with the time-domain aeroelastic software BHawC. The developed model for wind loads calculation is incorporated into an existing frequency-domain tool for the estimation of the structural response to the wave loads. The accuracy of the response to wave loads only is satisfactory, with few sea states introducing errors in the range of 15%-20%. Less accuracy is demonstrated for the wave loads combined with a steady wind. Based on this case, some initial observations are made regarding the coupled dynamics of the offshore wind turbine which highlight the importance of the aerodynamic damping and the controller's action. Regarding the main goal of this study, a rotationally sampled turbulence spectrum is modeled. It is shown that a complete frequency domain based method proves to be cumbersome for the calculation of the thrust force. The highly non-linear dynamic effects introduced by the controller's action is a proven limitation according to existing literature. Based on this fact, a quasi-static approach is used which considers unstalled conditions and assumes the pitch angle to be constant in a turbulent environment. As a result, errors up to almost 60% for the fatigue moments at the foundation are introduced, compared to results obtained with the time-domain simulations. Finally, the response to the combined loads are examined. The lower elevations of a monopile structure are wave driven while the wind loads are dominating at elevations closer to the hub. As a matter of fact, for aligned wind and waves, an accuracy of almost 82% is attained at the mudline due to the reliable wave model while the errors are considerably increased for higher elevations.","Fatigue; Frequency Domain Analysis; Wind Loads; Wave Loads; Power Spectral Density; Dirlik; Damage Equivalent Load","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-11-28","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","This thesis work is a starting point for the Flettner-rotor field of the wind-assisted ship propulsion research of TU Delft and POLIMI. During the development of this project, the flow around a bare spinning cylinder is investigated, introducing the Flettner-rotor without its end plate. The simulations were carried out in 2D and 3D with the commercial CFD package FLUENT 15. The main assumptions for the simulation are: the flow in the transcritical regime, a Reynolds number of 140 000, keeping the ratio between the cylinder’s peripheral velocity and the incoming flow velocity in a value of 2. As part of this project, comparisons among several turbulence models are performed. The models chosen are: the Smagorinsky-Lilly, the Wall-Adapting Local Eddy-Viscosity (WALE), the k−✏, the SST k−! and the RSM stress−!. As a consequence of the rotational speed set for the simulation, the vortex shedding in the wake of the cylinder is suppressed, thus with the RANS models steady runs were also performed. In high Reynolds number shear flows better accuracy is expected from the LES approach. In the first part of the project, an accurate LES run is sought. Afterwards, during the second part of the project, the evaluation of the RANS runs is based on the comparison with the reference LES results. A new concept of the boundary layer around the spinning cylinder is introduced. This concept subdivides the boundary layer to an inner portion and to an outer portion. The inner portion moves bonded to the surface of the cylinder, while the outer portion flows in the direction of the free stream. The WALE analysis will show that only the outer portion should be turbulent. Contrary, the Smagorinsky-Lilly model produces a fully turbulent inner layer. The main difference between these two models is the lack of an appropriate damping in the near wall region for the subgrid viscosity in the case of the Smagorinsky-Lilly model. As an outcome of the simulations, it is shown that the turbulent boundary layer is significantly thicker. The thickness of the inner layer influences the pressure distribution around the cylinder, leading to differences in the aerodynamic forces for the two subgrid models. A comparison between the RANS results and reference WALE is executed, based on the aerodynamic coefficients and the velocities in the wake. As a result of the simulations and comparison, the 2D steady SST k − ! model due to its prominent cost-accuracy ratio and the 3D unsteady RSM stress − ! model because of its accuracy are suggested for further work.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Marine and Transport Technology","","Ship Hydromechanics and Structures","",""

(mentor); van den Berg, M.A. (mentor); Løset, S. (mentor)","2016","This thesis analyses the loads that occurred during an ice ridge ramming experiment with the icebreaker Oden. Sea ice ridges are formed due to breaking and deformation of the ice cover. Wind, current, thermal expansion and Coriolis forces induce compression and shear forces onto level ice which can break the ice into rubble. The blocks of ice rubble are pushed together, forming a wall of broken ice in hydrostatic equilibrium. This wall of broken ice forced up by pressure is defined as an ice ridge. In general ice ridges are long, nonsymmetrical, curvilinear features with a wide variability of sizes and shapes. In Arctic regions, sea ice ridges are often used to calculate the design load in the absence of icebergs. Ice ridges also play a major role in icebreaker efficiency, since an icebreaker might need several ‘rams’ to break through an ice ridge. Ice ridge actions on icebreakers are not completely understood. Complex ice behavior under rapidly applied stress, and the complex geometries of the bodies in contact makes it a challenging research topic. The dynamic behavior of the vessel during the ramming can be used to make an estimate of the ice loads that occurred. This thesis analyses the ice load that occurred during a ridge ramming experiment that was performed with icebreaker Oden during the ODEN AT research cruise project in 2013. To advance our understanding in the global ice ridge ramming loads, twomodels were developed: 1) a simulationmodel using the Specific Energy Absorption (SEA) of mechanical crushing of ice to calculate the global ice loads, 2) a load identification model using full-scale data to determine the global ice loads. The simulation model was developed to enhance the understanding of relevant physical phenomena and parameters. During this process, specific energy principles of crushing of ice were identified as a promising although relatively unknown method for impact dynamics into ice. The Specific Energy Absorption (SEA) of mechanical crushing of ice is defined as the energy per unit mass of crushed ice, necessary to turn solid ice into crushed (pulverized) material. Besides the SEA value, the penetration velocity, density of ice, and volume of crushed ice, are required to calculate the ice load. A contact model was developed to determine the load location and direction on the hull. The icebreaker Oden is represented by a nonlinear mass-damper-spring system. Maneuvering theory is applied, which means that the hydrodynamic variables are estimated at one frequency of oscillation. In the simulation model, a known thrust force is applied on the vessel, making it move forward in open water, and then penetrate the ice ridge. The simulation model calculates the ice loads and vessel’s motions (i.e. accelerations, velocity, and displacement). The load identification model combines the Kalman filter and a joint input-state estimate algorithm to estimate the state- and excitation vector from acceleration, velocity and displacement data in 3DOF (i.e. surge, heave, pitch). The joint input-state estimate algorithm combines measured data with an estimate of the state of the system in a way that minimizes the error. The full-scale data analyzed in this thesis includes a profile of amulti-year ice ridge, vessel characteristics, acceleration data from a motion reference unit (MRU), GPS data, and propulsion data. From the results of the load identification model, we conclude that the current combination of model and data does not provide sufficient information to estimate the global ridge ramming loads with high reliability. The main reasons for this are the absence of additional MRU(s), the low sample frequency of the MRU, the data uncertainty, and the simplified hydromechanics. However, the suggested approach to calculate the global ice loads is reliable as long as the data is valid. This is verified by recalculating the ice loads from the data (i.e. motions), generated by the simulation model. Results indicate that the specific energy approach can be used to simulate an impact of a vessel into an ice ridge, under assumption that the ice fails purely due to crushing. This assumption is only valid during the beginning of the impact, as other failure modes often start to dominate as the penetration of the vessel into the ridge increases.","ice ridges; global ice loads; specific energy; load identification; full-scale data","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","An increasing number of robots are performing tasks worldwide, each unit consuming electrical energy even for simple repetitive tasks. Because of this, a strong demand arises for having energy-safe robots. At the Delft University of Technology a three degree of freedom robot arm is designed which is not connected to the electricity network, so no electrical energy is used at all. Various sub-projects are combined to ful ll the demand of a working three degree of freedom plugless robot arm. The robot arm is supplied of energy by picking a package from an height and placing it on a lower position. Once the package is dropped, the robot should pick another package. Thus energy released from the package drop, has to be stored and used to return to the pick position. This way, energy used for deceleration is recuperated for acceleration. Recuperation is performed by a spring-mechanisms, and the design of it is the main goal of this Thesis. First part of this Thesis is about nding the spring mechanism characteristic and demands for which least energy is used to perform one pick and place cycle. This is done by performing constrained optimizations, such that most ideal characteristic is known. Multiple mechanism-con gurations are compared to each other, which leads to the demand for an separate mechanism for each degree of freedom. The mechanism should be adjustable to let the robot function while placing the package at multiple positions. Second part of this thesis about a mechanical solution for the desired spring characteristic. Since the spring mechanisms obtained are of a non-linear multi-functional form, the manufacturability is regarded. It was seen that for both rst and third degree of freedom, the characteristic is ful lled by implementing existing mechanisms. However second degree of freedom characteristic is of a more complicated form, resulting in the design of a cam-mechanism to ful ll the demands. The result is, each calculated spring-characteristic is manufacturable, with satisfactory mechanism e?ciencies. Total outcome of this Thesis is that with the help of constructible spring mechanisms, an external power supply is not needed. On top of this, other sub-projects account for even higher performance, resulting in a reliable plugless robot arm.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Delft Center for Systems and Control","","Biomechanical design, Biorobotics","",""

(mentor); Rijnsburger, S. (mentor)","2016","Additional thesis - The Rhine river outflow has a major impact on the North Sea in front of the Dutch coast. It creates the Rhine ROFI (region of freshwater influence), a very complex three-dimensional volume of water with a relatively low salinity. Many researches have been conducted on this phenomenon. Now another complex factor is added: a non-straight coastline. The specific case of the Sand Engine, a sandbar-shaped peninsula in front of the Holland coast, is studied. The objective is to identify changes in the Rhine ROFI caused by the Sand Engine and their possible causes. Simpson (Simpson, et al., 1993) and De Boer (2008) have identified several mechanisms influencing the shape and size of the Rhine ROFI. The major ones are: the deflection of the fresh water jet from the river Rhine through the Coriolis force towards the north forming a ‘coastal river’ of fresh water, advection due to tidal propagation, density currents as a consequence of horizontal density gradients, tidal straining and tidal mixing. Fortnightly and semidiurnal variations of velocities and stratification can be expected within the Rhine ROFI. Signell (1989) has had major contributions to the understanding of tidal propagation around coastal headlands. In his work a categorization is made for different combinations of tidal conditions and headland shapes. Within this categorization the Sand Engine is seen as a rather small and streamlined headland. Flow separation may be expected with a stagnant lee-side eddy forming each tidal period. These researches cover the main domain of interest of this thesis. An extension is made by exploring the baroclinic effects of the perturbation of the coast to the Rhine ROFI. For this purpose a numerical model was set up. In essence the original model De Boer used in his dissertation was applied. The Sand Engine was added as a blunt rectangular shape at the same distance from the river mouth as in reality. No numerical problems were found after adapting the model. The performance of the model was successfully verified by comparing time-averaged salinity distributions to figures in De Boer’s work. The Rhine ROFI and the ‘coastal river’ remain largely unchanged, comparing outcomes of the models with and without the Sand Engine. On a more detailed scale some interesting phenomena can be distinguished. During both neap and spring tide a fresh water feature forms ahead of high tide at the location of the Sand Engine. The offset of the fresh water feature has a barotropic origin, being generated by a strong current at the southwest corner of the Sand Engine. Under neap tide conditions this fresh water feature grows in the offshore direction, whereas this does not occur for spring tide conditions. This offshore advection is a baroclinic effect as such widespread offshore velocities involved with the offshore advection of fresh water were not found under barotropic conditions. A possible explanation of the offshore velocities is the strength of the tidal straining effect, being enforced by the stronger vertical density gradient when the fresh water is located at the Sand Engine. Tidal mixing is larger under spring conditions, preventing tidal straining from happening, explaining why offshore-directed velocities and subsequent offshore fresh water advection are not found in the results. In this thesis a simplified approach has been applied. Therefore the results must be treated with care under the likely possibility that flow mechanisms have been altered, enhanced or ruled out. However, the results do show the likely importance of baroclinic effects. These effects may have large consequences on the hydrodynamics in the area surrounding the Sand Engine. Therefore it is recommended to perform additional research on this topic.","Rhine ROFI; Delft3d; fresh water buoyancy; stratification","en","student report","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","CIE5050-09","",""

Only 5% of the amputees own a prosthesis because there are distribution and maintenance problems, as well as cultural issues surrounding the reputation of amputees, therefore only a few of the available devices are used. It is very important to have a prosthetic hand that resemble the real human hand to avoid discrimination and exclusion from the society. This is especially an issue for children due to the fast changing anatomy. The aim of the project is \textit{to develop a generalized 3D printable body-powered prosthetic hand design for children in developing countries that allows parametric design}. The advantages of parametric design is that it can be personalized for every user and every child can be fitted with a prosthesis that most resembles the size of his/her sound hand. A statistical analysis has been conducted to understand which parameters are the best choice for a parametric design. Starting from 8 parameters, only four were found important to draw a prosthetic hand (grip circumference, palm breadth, thumb breadth and palm length), while the others can be connected to the main ones. It was possible to connect all the parameters, including the four main ones, to a single parameter (palm breadth). The design was done in Solidwork and it was connected to an external file that allows to change and adapt the design without needs to open the CAD file. The hand is body powered and it is activated with a lever that, when pushed, closes the fingers. Elastic bands reopen the hand when the tension on the lever is released. The connection between the moving part (fingers) and the fixed part (palm and thumb) is a sliding curved joint, considered the best option due to the easiness of printing and similarity with a human hand. It was found that the best printing strategy is to print the device into 3 parts and then connecting it with glue and elastic bends. The prosthesis was successfully 3D printed and it fulfilled all the requirements concerning price, weight and hand shape. The device is required to support a pinch force of 10 N and mechanical tests proved that it is able to provide force up to 35 N for a child of 13 years old. User testing showed that the hand is as functional as already existing devices and that it can perform daily activities. The main problem of the hand is the durability, which needs to be improved with studies regarding support and printing strategies. Future work is needed to design a 3D printable wrist and socket.","hand prosthesis; 3D printing; parametric design; children; developing countries","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Biomechanical Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","In the field of building physics the performance of the building envelope is a highly studied topic. Heat, light, sound and humidity are common topics to include in design requirements. Air tightness is becoming increasingly common in this list, but it still lacks for detailed information on performance requirements or calculation methods. When communicating on air tightness, a large variability in units is used. Flow rates are expressed in liters or cubic meters, per second or per hour. Reference pressure ranges from 4 to 50 Pa or higher and for some regulations a correction to building volume is applied. Lastly there are some publications that provide in air tightness coefficients for common building joints, to calculate on expected flow losses. These coefficients are given per meter, square meter, or per product. No wonder engineers get lost when working on this subject. This Master’s thesis is intended to draft a uniform calculation method for determination of the air permeability in the design phase of a building. Next to providing in an overview of the above mentioned standards and regulations, research has been performed on calculation methods that are currently used for determination of air tightness. These can be identified as the power law (𝑞𝑣 = 𝐶 ∙𝛥𝑃𝑛) which is most common in practice, the quadratic formula ( 𝛥𝑃= 𝐴𝑄+𝐵𝑄2) and formulas which determine the volumetric air flow by geometric proportions of the opening, using the Reynolds number and loss coefficients analogue with ducts and material properties of air. The literature study showed that most documents in use are based on the power law formula, using a standard value for the flow exponent originating from an old dataset, whose collector did not mean to provide in a mean value. The flow exponent is an indication for the development of turbulent or laminar flow and has a great influence on the calculated volumetric air flow when using the power law. In order to test this standard value and to gain more insight in the development of turbulence through openings, a measurement setup is made. Different shaped openings, cross sections, diameters and flow lengths have been tested. Unfortunately the equipment used appeared to be insufficiently precise. Therefor the absolute values of the results cannot be used to base any sounds conclusions on, but some trends have been made visible. Most importantly it is proven that the assumed standard value for the flow exponent is too high and extrapolation of air tightness data outside of the measured range induces large deviations from real occurring flows. Lastly the influence of edge effects on the measurements is tested by the use of a numerical model using CFD. Due to difficulties with the mesh that could not be resolved within the program available, the absolute values of these results are questionable too, but it is shown that the effect of sharp edges cannot be ignored. Therefor the results of the physical measurements cannot be corrected with this model to base conclusions on the geometries tested.","Air tightness; Luchtdoorlatendheid; Building envelope; Ventilation; Infiltration; Exfiltration; Leakage area; Power law; Flow exponent; Blowerdoor","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","Building Engineering / Specialisation: Building Technology & Physics","",""

(mentor)","2016","The overall objective of this master thesis is how to create a customizable system of everyday objects that empower the elderly to live independently and resourcefully. Ageing is a natural and inevitable process that everyone will experience. It is predicted that in the coming thirty years, the number of elderly people is projected to account for an increasing share of the population. Therefore, this graduation project is concerned with determining what everyday objects can do for aging people when implemented in an Internet of Things network. The project explores what and how the IoT can support and help elderly people ageing resourcefully while living independently at home through everyday objects. Literature about the ageing, age-related cognitive decline and the role technology has for older people was reviewed. Through the literature review we gained insightful knowledge about our user. Most often, elderly individuals are seen as technologically incompetent; as a result, products are developed with clear boundaries to avoid any margin of error. However, it is not the user that is not able to use and interact with a product or service, but rather that the product or service was not developed with the right user in mind. However, in order to articulate and include the needs of the users, better understand existing practices and identify a design opportunity to work for, we must answer our main research question: ""How can everyday use objects help older people with age-related memory changes while ageing independently at home?"". The user research involved five participants aged between 64 and 91 years old. The findings gathered with this iteration show how becoming forgetful is common with ageing. One gets less mentally flexible and needs more time to remember, process, and learn new information. Moreover, when the house is cluttered, it is more likely he or she will misplace things. A more organized home results in a reduction of stress and frustration levels while searching for things. In order to translate the findings of the literature and user research into concrete concepts, it was necessary to frame and define the design goal: “Create a customizable system of everyday use objects able to communicate to each other so to empower the elderly to live independently and resourcefully”. The design goal together with the design challenges, problem definition and requirements provided input for the brain writing session with seven designers in Philips Design. The session led to creating a broad number of ideas and, after skimming and clustering them, three main concept were developed further. The concepts were discussed with experts on the subject of ageing and cognitive decline from TU Delft and Philips and lastly, these concepts were evaluated using a Harris profile with five major criteria. Although all the concepts seemed to have interesting qualities and points of strength, Reminder Beads was choosen because it provides flexibility of use, adaptability and innovativeness. The chosen concept was unanimously selected as the one that better matched the design goal and was the one with more potential for further iterations. Therefore, the details, interactions and functionality of the concept were elaborated further in order to create a concept as close as possible to the reality. The system, called Cùes, allows maximum customization of use and it is composed of both physical and digital elements that work together to provide the best and most innovative result. Cùes is linked to activities that the user wants to keep track of over time or to objects that he does not want to misplace or forget. For each of these activities, an environmental node and a variable number of object nodes are used. Through these elements, which are attached by the user on everyday objects, Cùes is capable of collecting data about user daily patterns. After that the data is parsed and machine learning is applied to cluster the findings according to different uses and moments of use. In this way, the system will understand the objects that the user needs during different situations.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor)","2016","Coastal protection in the Mekong Delta is of paramount importance. The low-lying coastal area has always been vulnerable to flooding by extreme events, but the coastal erosion and consequent land losses have increased to alarming magnitude in the most recent years. This MSc thesis aims to pro- vide insight in the optimal protection strategy for each situation, through investigating the wave load and overtopping of sea dikes, as function of the location of the dike in the cross-section, for different foreshore geometries. The Mekong Delta coast can be classified into three categories, based on the erosion rate: a stable coastline, an accreting coastline and an eroding coastline. For each category, several coastal protec- tion scenarios have been developed. In case of a stable coastline, a simple coastal protection strategy consisting of a sea dike in combination with its foreshore will be most appropriate. The same strategy can be applied to an accreting shoreline, however optimising details may increase the benefits. In the last category, the foreshore erodes. The first strategy is to accept the erosion, and simply place the dike more inland, this is called managed retreat. The second strategy uses the mangrove forest on the foreshore to slow down the erosion. The third strategy stops the erosion by nourishing the foreshore, restoring the sediment balance, and the fourth strategy fights the erosion by constructing a structure that can withstand the erosion and extreme wave loads. In order to be able to numerically model each scenario, boundary conditions are required. Since the Mekong Delta is an extremely varied region, one set of boundary conditions cannot represent the entire Delta, therefore a range of boundary conditions has been set up. Three bathymetric profiles and four vegetation settings have been defined. Further, as the Dutch and Vietnamese approach with respect to the choice of lifetime and return period differs significantly, also 12 combinations of return period and lifetime will be modelled. The numerical models used for this project are SWAN and SWASH. SWAN will translate the offshore boundary conditions into nearshore conditions, and SWASH will use these conditions as input in order to calculate the wave transformation up to the shoreline. During the project, it was discovered that wave transformation on these extremely gentle slopes (in the order of 1:1000) has never been researched, and in combination with the total lack of measurements, the numerical models could not be validated. However, by comparing the model results to theory, and analysing each single source term in the en- ergy balance, some improvements have been made to the model. Thus, sufficient confidence in the model was built up to model the design storm conditions in the Mekong Delta for each scenario. For each situation, all scenarios have been evaluated with a cost-benefit analysis in order to determine the optimal strategy. When the coastline is stable, the cost-benefit analysis showed that there is a direct reduction in net costs as the dike is placed further inland. Further, the additional costs for designing a dike with a longer lifetime or a dike that can withstand a longer return period, are significantly smaller than both the additional benefits and the initial costs. Finally, the construction costs can be reduced significantly by allowing a limited amount of overtopping. In case of accretion, the best coastal protection strategy proved to be a dike with a long lifetime, in combination with alternative use of the foreshore, for example for extensive aquaculture. In case of erosion, managed retreat turned out to be the optimal strategy, however in practice there are often limitations imposed on the distance the dike can be retreated. Mangrove reforestation could only be applied in case of erosion that was limited both in duration and in strength. The other two strategies (nourishment and strong structures) appeared to be extremely expensive, and can therefore only be justified in case the value of the hinterland is high, which is not yet the case in the Mekong Delta. How- ever, the Delta is rapidly developing, therefore it is recommended in the case of erosion to design for a short lifetime and re-evaluate the situation in the near future.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Erasmus Mundus Mobility with Asia (EMMA)","",""

(mentor)","2016","All harbours require frequent dredging to cope with sedimentation. In certain cases the deposited sediment/silt forms a weak soil layer referred to as fluid mud. The top layer is often used as nautical bottom, while its presence is not necessarily harmful to the vessel. This could lead to the conclusion that the safety margin underneath a vessel (i.e., Under Keel Clearance (UKC)) is too large/safe and can be reduced. Research indicates that the UKC can be decreased to smaller (<10%) or negative (0 to -10%) values. Reducing the UKC leads to less dredging and allowance of higher draught vessels. This can create economic benefits for the port authority and, depending on the chosen strategy, shipping company. Less dredging is also likely to reduce the amount of sediment that is re-suspended and could thus assist the system in reducing turbidity. Altered vessel behaviour by a smaller UKC and the possible resulting safety impairments create application challenges. These effects are caused by undulations in the water-mud interface (when sailing close to the fluid mud) or a too strong mud layer (when sailing through the mud). A discussion is instigated as the result of different end-user objectives: navigational safety versus optimal port profit. Extensive knowledge from various scientific fields is required to make a sound consideration between safety and benefits. Within this thesis, the alignment between end-users and required scientific topics is studied using a Decision Support Model (DSM). The DSM is based on a Frame of Reference approach by van Koningsveld [2003] which is meant to improve communication and aid decision making. For conceiving the DSM, various objectives from end-users are categorized into three management context: economy, ecology and safety. In reducing the UKC the benefits (economy and ecology) are opposed by the potential downsides (safety). Knowledge from literature led to relevant topics in each management context. Three strategies where used for quantification: draught increase, dredging decrease or draught increase with maintaining the current UKC requirement. The general DSM was applied to the case of Delfzijl where fluid mud and UKC reduction are topics of discussion. Weighing the strategies results in a dredging reduction being optimal. Relative small visiting vessels and high turbidity in the area cause this outcome. Difficulties in quantifying sub-elements are the result of knowledge gaps which might be resolved by further research. After addressing the topics of research, a sound decision on application can be made. The complete DSM and the outcomes where presented to port authority, harbour masters and pilot at Delfzijl. Based on the DSM, these end-users where able to point out topics of concern and provide additional feedback. These topics, mainly regarding safety, where subsequently assessed with a probabilistic tidal window model as proposed by Bouw [2005]. The model copes with the request for extra safety and can be easily extended when new knowledge on survey error and vessel velocity is obtained. From this thesis it was apparent that the main challenge for an UKC reduction is the absence of a means to designate the strength based nautical bottom. Port authorities have no means of assessing the strength of the bottom and corresponding effects on vessel behaviour. This affects the decision whether to start experimentally reducing the UKC for visiting vessels. Resulting in no possibilities to gain experience in the concept. In addition, the port authority is not able to determine the depth contour change induced by an envisioned dredging reduction.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","Oil-filled terminations for high voltage XLPE insulated cables have been used for four decades in the Netherlands with a good service record. Prysmian would like to gain better insight into the effects of water contamination in insulating oil, to further extend the in-house experience and potential related failure mechanisms. High voltage termination is contained within a bushing that is filled with insulating cable oil. The insulating cable oil is a containment medium for the electric field lines and should have low dielectric losses, chemical inertness against the construction material, non-flammability and stable electrical property during prolong heating. The insulating oil is also self-healing, leaving no permanent conductive path in the fluid. The containment should be well-sealed to prevent any forms of leakage from the surroundings. The initial stages of the thesis seeks to inventory and address a few topics, mainly regarding water polluting oil. Studies will be done into the phenomena surrounding water within oil, the influence of water particles on the electrical performance of the oil, movement of water within the termination during temperature gradients and movement of water within the termination during electrical gradients. The next step is to inventory the current on-line and off-line tools available for measurements of water contents in oil. They would be AC voltage breakdown test, dielectric loss measurement, partial discharge detection, permittivity measurement and humidity check. Finally, the last phase would look to find mitigation techniques integrating the given inventories and observations, so as to formulate non-intrusive diagnostic methods to ascertain polluted terminations.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-11-25","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Electrical Sustainable Energy","","DC systems, Energy conversion & Storage","",""

(mentor)","2016","Airline Industry has seen constant growth in the passenger aviation sector over the years. The profits though, have not risen much because the competition has stiffened and fluctuating oil prices have been a cause of concern as well. Price wars have been a short-term strategy for the airlines to gain a bigger market share and retain customers. For any airline organisation to be competitive it needs to have a long-term strategy with a firm focus on its customers. Airline ground services have been an area where airlines lose revenues and customers. However, now airlines have shifted their focus from price wars to customer centric service to maintain. This research is focused on understanding customer preferences for airline ground services mainly for passengers from China, USA, countries of European Union, Indonesia and India. To understand the customers preference for airline ground services, this research takes place in 3 steps. First step consists of literature review and theoretical background. The theoretical background looks into the types of service quality measurement models. The literature discusses specially between Grönroos model and SERVQUAL model, as these are most widely used models. The theoretical background looks into the baggage handling process and security aspects so that the attributes to the research model can be built. Second, step consists of semi-structured interviews with passengers who fly frequently. The interviews with the passengers helped verify and validate the research model. Finally, through a survey the data was gathered and using Best Worst Method (BWM) the preferred main criteria and sub-criteria were calculated in the excel solver. It was found that reliability and responsiveness were the two most important criteria while assurance was the least important criteria. To understand preferences as per nationality one-way ANOVA test was done. the One-Way ANOVA results for comparison between various nationalities showed that the output was significant for responsiveness criteria, and Word of Mouth. Cluster analysis was done to group respondents on their similarities. The results of the study are important for airline managers, airport managers and academians. This model will help the managers find a model on which they can build on in the future. A study can be done by managers to understand the service delivery of their organisation based on which with help of these results airlines should be able to successfully guide strategic initiatives for airline ground services. Furthermore, this research model can be used for markets other than airline markets. On the other hand for academians, BWM is used for the first time with SERVQUAL model for airline ground services. This combination of BWM with SERVQUAL can be used by academians for future study for any other market. Furthermore, this research model with attributes can be used for future studies of airline ground services.","Airlines; Customer Satisfaction; Service Quality; SERVQUAL model; MCDM; Best Worst Method (BWM); One-Way ANOVA; Cluster Analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Engineering, Systems and Services","","MSc.

A relative advantage of such analytical methods is that they provide physical interpretations and do not require much computation time. Designs based on FORM/SORM are usually performed using commercial software packages in which the underlying concept of the Reliability method is hidden. Also, the available literature is not easy to read and the basic concept is buried in complex mathematical equations. This document aims to give a comprehensive understanding of First Order Reliability Methods. In this document, practical application of FORM is demonstrated with a retaining wall and slope stability problem, both analysed using a spreadsheet model developed by Low (2003). Both applications presented are existing examples by Low (2003, 2005). These are briefly explained, and later modified to understand the efficiency of the model, and to investigate the effect of geometrical uncertainties in a slope’s stability. Additional Graduation Thesis - The efficiency of spreadsheet model is investigated by considering uncertainty of geometrical parameters. Taking advantage of FORM’s ability to reflect sensitivity of the parameters, a sensitivity interpretation of the parameters involved in the slope stability problem is made. The influence of uncertainty of soil layering on the stability of the slope is analysed. Additional investigation on the effect of one dimensional spatial variation on the outcome of slope reliability is made. The spreadsheet model uses intuitive First Order Reliability approach and MS Excels’s inbuilt solver with constrained optimisation to compute Reliability index and probability of failure. It was found to be relatively less user friendly when compared to the existing commercial software packages but it serves as a very efficient tool to understand the concepts of FORM better. The major disadvantage of Monte Carlo regarding its high computational cost has triggered the need to find better alternatives. In most applications, FORM only needs a small number of iterations for convergence, making it more computationally efficient than MCS. This is particularly so when the failure probabilities are low. With the limited research here, it is safe to say that FORM could serve as a first step in Reliability based design to study the relative importance of parameters.","","en","student report","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience and Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Van der Zwaag, S. (mentor)","2016","Thermal barrier coatings (TBC) are often applied to hot components of modern turbojet engines. These coatings increase the performance of the engine and enhance the lifetime of its structural components. Thus, improving the TBC lifetime is related with a reduction of maintenance costs and increased reliability. As an alternative to conventional design approaches, a self-healing mechanism is implemented in the TBC material. To this end, alumina encapsulated MoSi2B-based YSZ composites were prepared via spark plasma sintering. First, a qualitative study of the crack healing behaviour was conducted using an indentation technique. In most of the cases, indentation cracks fracture the particles in line with the crack path. Then, a sufficient particle-matrix interface strength exists. Upon oxidation at 1100 ºC for 1, 4 and 16 h in laboratory air, the fractured particles oxidize and form glassy SiO2, that filled the crack. It has been observed that the SiO2 further reacts with the YSZ matrix and forms a well-bonded healing product, ZrSiO4. As a second step, a quantitative characterization of the recovery of load bearing capability for the self-healing TBC was performed. For this purpose, two novel mechanical test methods were developed to create a controlled crack that can be stopped, healed and re-tested. This enables to measure in the same specimen the virginal, residual and healed strength of the material. These two set-ups are the Brazilian Disc (BD) test and the Wedge-Loaded Double Cantilever Beam (WL-DCB) test. The application of both the WL-DCB and BD test to the self-healing TBC material was successful because the growth of a crack could be controlled in the brittle material. The WL-DCB test is potentially more suitable for quantification of recovery of load bearing capability. The BD test is more straightforward for determining strength of the material. Application of this BD test to benchmark YSZ material gave a strength value of around 550 MPa, which is accordance with previously reported values for this material. Following the successful achievement of controlled cracking with both methods, the quantification of load bearing capability in the healed material remains an issue of future work.","self-healing; thermal barrier coatings; mechanical characterization; strength and fracture testing; crack healing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2016-12-31","Aerospace Engineering","Aerospace Structures and Materials","","","",""

This research focusses on the comparison of the noise predictions of empirical and semi-empirical models. The noise predictions of NIROS, an empirical noise prediction model used by Deutsche Flugsicherung (the German air traffic control), are compared with the noise predictions of the DLR model PANAM. Both models are assessed on their use, applicability and limitations using a simulation case. Three major difference were found during the initial research i.e. the use of Noise-Power-Distance tables in empirical noise modelling and noise source modelling in semi-empirical noise models, the differences in noise propagation methods applied for ground reflection and atmospheric absorption and the differences in the construction of the flight path. A simulation case was constructed to further examine the differences in the noise predictions of both models. In PANAM and NIROS an A319 was used to simulate the noise for observers located on the ground. The results of the simulations showed higher noise levels in PANAM than in NIROS. Furthermore the difference in flight path and the applied ground reflection method had the biggest influence on the simulation results. Better understanding of the differences between the models can be used to make improvements to the fully empirical method.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2016-11-25","Aerospace Engineering","Control & Operations","","Aircraft Noise and Climate Effects (ANCE)","",""

The Hybrid Combustion System is a novel propulsion system developed to reduce the environmental impact of aviation. The system consists of dual combustors in sequence. The first combustor, positioned between the compressor and the turbine, burns a cryogenic fuel and the second combustor, positioned between the high and low pressure turbine, burns kerosene. The cryogenic fuel can either be hydrogen or natural gas, resulting in either a LH2-kerosene configuration or a LNG-kerosene configuration. In order to obtain low emissions, the first combustor has a lean-premixed combustion, and the second combustor ought to operate in the Flameless Combustion mode. The CRN model developed for the first combustor shows to be a good representation in comparison with the experimental results. The NOx pathways during the experiments are depended on the flame temperature obtained in the combustor. With an increase of flame temperature the NOx emissions formed shows an exponential increase. This is predominately due to thermal pathway, which becomes active for flame temperature above 1800 $K$. Furthermore, for the desired lean design equivalence ratio, the N2O-intermediate pathway and the NNH pathway show to contribute significantly to the NOx formation. For these conditions the NOx obtained is below 10 $ppm$. For the second combustor of the Hybrid Combustion System, the development of a CRN model resulted in two relevant models. The ""Simple"" model, where the fuel and oxidizer are assumed to mix perfectly, and the ""Enhanced"" model, which follows from the ""Simple"" model. In the ""Enhanced"" model, the unmixedness of the fuel and oxidizer is included. The latter model is able to capture the trend for a varying equivalence ratio and nitrogen addition. However, with respect to water addition the result obtained differs from the experimental results. Using this CRN model the NOx pathways in the second combustor are investigated.. The CRN model shows that the prompt pathway dictates the NOx formation in the second combustor. In order to represent the Hybrid Combustion System, the previously mentioned model are extrapolated to represent the combustors in cruise operating conditions. Consequently, the CRN models were coupled to represent the Hybrid Combustion System, resulting in the Hybrid CRN model. The Hybrid CRN model is used to investigate the effect of varying energy fraction over both combustors, for same thrust levels. Included is the effect of the oxidizer split to the combustion and dilution zones of the combustors, which alters the local equivalence ratios of the combustors. The results show that low NOx emission can be achieved, less than 20 $ppm$, if beneficial local equivalence ratios are considered. Furthermore, the NOx pathways are analysed which show that the NOx pathways contributions are a combination of the pathways of the first and second combustor. Due to the increased pressure, the N2O-intermediate pathway is one of the main contributors of the total NOx emissions. In addition, the thermal pathway shows to be a significant contributor to the NOx emissions. Due to the temperature effect on the thermal pathway, the NOx can be kept low by having beneficial local equivalence ratio as the peak temperatures obtained can therefore be minimized. Therefore, in order to control the NOx emissions for the Hybrid Combustion System, the local equivalence ratios of the combustion zones are important design parameters of the Hybrid Combustion System. However, the limited volume available for the second combustor is an important design constraint. With increasing fuel flow in the second combustor, the volume required for a preferred local equivalence ratio increases. Furthermore, as the Flameless Combustion is desired in the second combustor, the first combustor should improve the conditions to make Flameless Combustion viable in the second combustor. Thus, the energy fraction has a high influence on the design of the Hybrid Combustion System. Concluding, in order to optimize the design of the Hybrid Combustion System, the full aircraft should be taken into account. The energy fraction between the dual combustors, together with the desired local equivalence ratios and the available volumes in the Hybrid engine determine the feasibility of the engine. In this thesis it is predicted that when low emissions are desired, most energy should be inserted in the first combustor. The second combustor should be a supplement in adding extra thrust to the combustor to keep the range of the aircraft high. When comparing the emissions of a B787-8 Dreamliner with two GEnX-64b engine mounted with a similar aircraft mounted two Hybrid engines, the Hybrid engine aircraft shows to reduce the \ce{NOx} emission up to 90\%. In addition, the CO emissions are show to be very low, with a reduction of more than 95\%. Furthermore, the \ce{CO2} emission show a reduction of 70 \% for the LH2-kerosene configuration and a reduction of 18 \% for the LNG-kerosene configuration, when the energy division is set to 71\% in the first combustor and 30\% in the second combustor. The study showed the potential gain of the Hybrid Combustion System that could be achieved in gas turbine engines for aviation. Both the LH2-kerosene and the LNG-kerosene configuration show that the Hybrid Combustion System produces low emissions and could be a leap forward in the development of aircraft engines. Especially the LNG-kerosene configuration, due to the smaller fuel storage challenge, may be the next step in a more sustainable aviation.","AHEAD; Hybrid Combustion System","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-11-25","Aerospace Engineering","Aerodynamics, Wind Energy & Propulsion","","Flight Performance and Propulsion","",""

(mentor)","2016",": Tooth extraction is one of the most common procedures in oral surgery. However, it is complicated as well as not fully understood. Different teeth have different structures and strengths. Even teeth of the same type differ depending on ages, genders, races, and other reasons affecting its integrity. During the procedure, the properties of the reaction force from the tooth is changing due to broken fibers and the operations are different between individuals. The wrench and pose in the human demonstrations are collected by a recently introduced measurement setup. The purpose of the analysis is to obtain a good model for the reaction force and the effective control policy that can extract the tooth without complications such as fractures of the jaw bone. We introduce a framework called Interactive Analysis to deal with the uncertain information in the demonstration. The framework consists of two parts, the application part and the analysis part. The model from the analysis part is used in the application for a tooth simulation algorithm. This algorithm can be applied on a robotic setup for the education and training. As for the analysis, we propose the Factor-Controlled Experiment where the uncertain information are translated into the hypotheses and are tested on a robot reproduction system. Since the robot can reproduce the same trajectory over and over again, it can keep the components in the control policies unchanged and test the hypothesis. Both components are implemented by Programming by Demonstration (PbD) which is a machine learning algorithm that encodes the control policy from the human demonstrations. The simulation is for the scenario where a robot extracts a tooth. Those two components in the framework can render an output that is similar to the demonstrations. The Factor-Controlled Experiment is performed based on the hypothesis that we derived for the plastic jaws by a robot. We found out in the experiment that the vertical force is important for loosening the tooth and settled some uncertainties about the reaction force of the tooth. However, all of the experiments are carried out on plastic jaws. We need to perform the experiment on more representative jaws in the future.","Tooth Extraction; Programming by Demonstration; Gaussian Mixture Model; Interactive Analysis; Hypothesis Testing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-11-25","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Delft Center for Systems and Control","","System and Control","",""

(mentor); Keller, A.I. (mentor)","2016","Influencing interpersonal touch can be done by responsive audio design. Multiple designers have done this by creating interactive installations. Experimenting with these installations requires more time spend on programming and technology then on experimenting with users to investigate the possibilities of directed influence. A toolbox has been created to help designers measure interpersonal touch and map the measurements to musical instrumentation faster. A proposed methodology is presented to guide the use of the toolbox for influencing interpersonal touch towards a desired interaction quality. When the project started there was no clear design method for creating interactive installations. The main pitfall is to start with technological experimentation right after the concept is stated and designers tend to get stuck in a loop where technical possibilities are endless, which takes away the time to experiment with users. The proposed design method has a more focused approach for making an interactive audio installation that influences touch. The Responsive Composition Mapping Tool (RCMT) helps the designer to program, but before, a plan is formulated according to a preceding envisioning session. This helps the designer generate responsive compositions towards a scenario with a certain mood and desired interaction quality. With these extra steps, the validation of tests and redesign becomes more consistent and prominent within the design process. Testing the compositions that were build with the use of the proposed method and the RCMT resulted in an overview of how various factors influence the interaction quality. Several guidelines were derived from the test as well. The mapping can be designed in such a way that the composition gains complexity and remains clarity.","interactive audio design; interpersonal touch","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor); van de Ven, F.H.M. (mentor); Hrachowitz, M. (mentor); Bonné, P. (mentor)","2016","The stress on water supply systems is increasing, among others due to pollution, increasing demands, source depletion and climate change. More sustainable solutions with respect to water supply will decrease the stress. Rainwater harvesting can be one of these sustainable solutions. Depending on the characteristics of the rainwater harvesting system it can increase water availability and limit urban flooding and erosion by water retention. Furthermore it can limit subsidence by limiting groundwater extraction or by increasing infiltration. Finally rainwater is a relatively clean and free water source. This research investigates the possibilities for domestic rainwater harvesting in an off-grid urban area in Serang (Indonesia). Current water infrastructure in this area is found insufficient. Technical, economical, legal, social and cultural aspects are tackled in this research. This is done by conducting semi-structured interviews, creating a conceptual model of a rainwater harvesting system, and by doing water quality measurements, cost calculations and literature research. While rainwater harvesting is not preferred socially, use is accepted in the case study area. Also, no relevant restrictions are present regarding rainwater use on national level. In the analysed existing rainwater harvesting tanks the water quality meet the WHO guidelines for all measured parameters, except microbial contamination. Suggested treatment steps include first flush, cloth filtration and boiling. Boiling is solely required for potable purposes and first flush water can be used for low end purposes. Furthermore, closed tanks or small fish can prevent mosquitos. Risk groups, including young children, elderly, people with weakened immune systems or skin injuries should be careful with the use rainwater. Depending on the roof size, tank size and operating scenario a certain tap flow can be expected from a rainwater harvesting system. It is found that for a tank of 2 m3 and a roof of 100 m2 an average tap flow of between 116 and 186 liter/day can be expected. This tank size has the lowest water price per cubic meter (between 0.40-1.11 euro per m3), in case a realistic roof size is connected. Payback periods were found to vary largely depending on the assumption regarding the fresh water requirement, and the operating scenario. Payback periods are around 2 and 8 years in case a fresh water need of 80 and 20 liter a family a day is taken into account. Payback periods decrease for larger fresh water needs, due to the fact that more of the expensive bottled water is replaced. In this case yearly savings based on investment increases. This research shows that rainwater harvesting is a suitable technique for the improvement of both quality and quantity of the water supply in Serang. Focus can be on the awareness, acceptance and knowledge of the population. Small changes can improve the operation of existing systems. Systems should be closed, contain overflow, tap and first flush. Harvest can increase largely by connecting the entire roof, and by considering the operating scenario carefully. Governmental institutions could help the local population with these improvements and by water quality measurements. Scientific research can focus on the remaining health risk related to rainwater use, methods for quality control of systems, constructions to bridge the large investment costs or improvements of the conceptual model used.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Water Management","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","Internet of Things (IoT) solutions are increasingly being deployed for smart applications. With the rise of smart cities there is a need for low cost and long range Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) technologies. LoRaWAN is an energy efficient and cheap LPWAN solution. It is rapidly being adopted all around the world. LoRaWAN however does not provide communication robustness in its basic configuration. Transmitted frames can be lost. In this study we perform extensive measurements on a brand new LoRaWAN network to characterise spatial and temporal properties of frame loss. The empirical outage probability for the farthest measured distance from the closest gateway of 7.5 km in our deployment is as low as 0.004, but the frame loss at this distance is significantly high with 70% frame loss. Furthermore, we show that burstiness in frame loss can be expected for both mobile and stationary situations. Frame loss results in data loss, since in the basic configuration frames are only transmitted once. To reduce data loss in packet-based transmission like in LoRaWAN, we design a novel data erasure coding scheme called DaRe. This coding scheme extends frames with redundant information that is calculated from the data from previous frames. We use a fountain code approach with a sliding window. We also develop an implementation for DaRe in LoRaWAN. We show that 99% of the data can be recovered with a code rate of 1/2 when frame loss is up to 40%. Compared to a simple repetition coding method DaRe provides 21% more data recovery, and can save up to 42% energy consumption on transmission for 10 byte data units. DaRe also provides better resilience against bursty frame loss. This study provides useful results to both LoRaWAN network operators as well as developers of LoRaWAN applications. Network operators can use the results to identify possible weaknesses in the network, and application developers are offered a tool to prevent possible data loss.","lora; lorawan; network; measurements; forward error correction; erasure coding; channel coding; application level coding","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Embedded Software Section","","","",""

One of the widely used methods in Recomender Systems is content-based filtering, which analyzes the description of item characteristics and the user profile illustrating user's preferences. Due to the sparsity of its dataset, i.e. many job postings are rarely interacted with, XING has been using content-based recommender system to promote the quality of the recommendations. Recent word embedding technique learns semantically meaningful representations for words from co-occurrence in sentences, which enables the effective comparison between words. Based on the Word2Vec technique, XING represents job postings by the average embedding over words they contain. This study explores three alternative methods to represent job postings for the task of recommending jobs to users. In the first experiment, we explore whether the use of a subset of words is more effective to represent the job postings. In the second experiment, instead of averaging over word embeddings, we directly learn document embeddings using Paragraph2Vec. And finally, the third experiment uses Word Mover's Distance to estimate the similarity between job postings. Our experiments show that the embeddings that are learned with Paragraph2Vec result in a better estimation of which job postings are similar, but only when high-dimensional settings are used. The Word Mover's Distance algorithm is computationally expensive, therefore we use existing lower-bounds that allowed us to complete a small-scale experiment within the available time. The results indicate that Word Mover's Distance is not as effective as the average over word embeddings and Paragraph2Vec. In the final part of this thesis, we present the Link2Vec, a novel item representation method based on Word2Vec, which learns semantic representations for items based on the context surrounding the hyperlinks that refer to the item, e.g. hyperlinks to the item's Wikipedia page. Our experiments show that the effectiveness of the embeddings learned with Link2Vec improves with the amount of training data. For the evaluation on the MovieLens dataset, we only obtained a limited set of hyperlinks, which resulted in results that approximate a baseline that uses the average over word embeddings.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Intelligent Systems","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","For decades, researchers try to model the subsoil as accurate as possible in order to make cost-efficient and safe geotechnical decisions. A troublesome aspect in modelling of the soil is to determine the heterogeneity within the soil, as this is usually associated with a great deal of uncertainty. Delft University of Technology used a recursive filter, the Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF), to reduce the spatial uncertainty of a numerically modelled hydraulic conductivity field, using pore water pressure measurements at limited locations. The EnKF does however require prior knowledge of the involved probability distributions concerning the hydraulic conductivity field. In addition, Gaussian assumptions of the involved probability distributions are ought to be valid. Many more methods are available to back calculate a hydraulic conductivity field from pore water pressure measurements, i.e. to perform an inverse analysis. A proper overview of these methods and their respective usability is however not available. The aims of this thesis are to provide a clear overview of the available methods to perform inverse analyses and to describe the similarities and the differences between them. In this thesis, a complete inverse analysis is divided into the formulation of the inverse problem and the optimisation method used to solve the inverse problem. An inverse analysis can be formulated as an objective function to be minimised in order to find the optimal approximation of the hydraulic conductivity. Such formulations include, the Least Square objective function, the Maximum Likelihood based objective function and several Bayes' theorem based objective functions. Objective functions are minimised using optimisation methods. The optimisation methods are subdivided in finite difference based optimisation methods and metaheuristics. Finite difference optimisation methods include the Gauss-Newton method, Steepest-Descent method and the Levenberg-Marquardt method. Metaheuristics include the Genetic Algorithm (GA), Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO), Ant Colony Optimisation (ACO), Greedy Randomised Adaptive Search Procedure (GRASP), Guided Local Search, Iterated Local Search and Tabu Search. Alternately, an inverse analysis can be formulated as a probability distribution to be approximated, such methods are regarded as sequential Monte Carlo based inverse analyses. Sequential Monte Carlo based inverse analyses include Particle Filters (PF) and the Ensemble Kalman Filter, which are derived from Bayes' theorem. Based on the usability following a literature study, several complete inverse analyses are numerically implemented and applied to multiple cases which vary in geometry and available information. The numerical analysis concerns an analysis of the numerical stability, accuracy, uniqueness, computational effort and reliability of the results. The main conclusion is that the Ensemble Kalman Filter is the most appropriate method to use when reliable information concerning the correlation structure and the mean and variance of the involved Gaussian distributions is available. When the statistical information is unreliable, the Levenberg-Marquardt optimisation method combined with the Sequential Bayesian objective function is more appropriate. In one dimensional linear problems, the Gauss-Newton Least Square method and the Levenberg-Marquardt Least Square method can be used, given that the expected soil variability is limited and the measurement errors are negligible.","numerical investigation; inverse analyses; Ensemble Kalman Filter; probability; uncertainty reduction; hydraulic conductivity","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","Geo-Engineering","",""

In the future, the driver will perform secondary tasks during driving. An example of such a task is reading. For this reason, there is an increase in requirements in respect to ride comfort. Improved suspension systems are of major interest, because they are one of the most important components of a vehicle when it comes to ride comfort. Recently, electromagnetic suspension systems are gaining more interest. In comparison to conventional suspension systems, which are usually hydraulic, electromagnetic systems have several advantages. They have a high bandwidth, a low power consumption and can be overloaded. In addition to the aforementioned, they also allow for energy regeneration. The low power consumption in combination with the ability to regenerate energy fit the requirements of the European Horizon 2020 policy regarding Smart, Green and Integrated Transport The goal of this thesis project is to assess ride comfort using an electromagnetic active suspension model. An extended model of an electromagnetic active suspension system is developed in order to achieve this. This model is designed to be used in vehicle dynamics simulations. First, the main aspects of the electromagnetic suspension system used in this thesis project are discussed. Next, the extended suspension model is developed. The developed model includes: non-linear damping, friction, a force ripple and non-linear active characteristics. In addition, both the passive and active frequency response are also included in the extended suspension model. Subsequently, the developed model is parameterized by performing measurements. Next, the suspension model is implemented into a multibody vehicle model including a MF-Swift tyre model. A suspension controller is presented, after which ride comfort assessment is discussed. Simulations are performed to assess ride comfort and investigate the performance of the electromagnetic suspension system. In addition, the effect of using tyre models with a different complexity is investigated. The developed suspension model is suited for describing all the static and dynamic characteristics of the electromagnetic suspension. Using the electromagnetic active suspension, significant improvements in ride comfort can be obtained. The results depend on the frequency content of the road. Both front actuation and full vehicle actuation result in improved ride comfort. However, when front actuation is used, the rear of the vehicle should also be taken into account. Due to the improvements in ride comfort, the road holding of the vehicle is decreased. It is shown that a reduced peak force of the electromagnetic suspension reduces the improvement in ride comfort only by a limited amount. When using an adjusted controller, motion sickness can be improved while maintaining similar performance in respect to ride comfort. It is shown that using tyre models with a different complexity can have a significant effect on the simulation results.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-11-24","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Precision & Microsystems Engineering (PME)","","Automotive","",""

(mentor); Yarovoy, A. (mentor)","2016","Modern automotive radar operates at the mm-wave frequency band and has to provide reliable sensing information about surrounding targets in all weather conditions. The aesthetic requirements for the modern car design and needs for mechanical protections result in the installation of radar sensor behind different types of plastic cover like the bumper for the forward-looking radar. The influence of radar signal propagation through such dielectric layer, which is a kind of radar radome, usually is taken into account by radar developers and car manufacturers. But during bad weather conditions like rain, this dielectric radome is becoming wet or even covered with a thin layer of water, ice or dirt and the radar signal propagates through the multilayer structure with transmission and reflection characteristics that can be quite different from the single dry radome case. Thus this project is basically focused on water film effects on the wave propagation on the radome and three models, namely a theoretical model fundamentally based on the plane wave propagation on the stratified media, an experimental model based on real measurements and a numerical model based on CST simulation are derived to investigate these effects. In addition, considering the importance of the antenna beam pattern for proper estimation of object angular position, water film effects on the beam distortions are discussed as well. The radar observation of road signs and other components of road/highway infrastructure can be quite useful sources of information for cars local real-time navigation on the road. To make such observation reliable, the road signs are required to have reasonably big radar cross section in a wide range of observation angles. As the operational wavelength for automotive radar is quite short (about 4 mm), the backscattered signals from road signs can strongly depend on characteristics of the thin layer of the paint on the surface of the objects. Based on these facts, some radar detectable paint samples with special discrete inclusions inside are experimentally studied and the statistical roughness of the surface for each sample is estimated. Such information can be quite useful for the future road or road infrastructure design, aiming to improve objects' detectability with the automotive radar.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Electrical Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","Jack-up structures are widely used in the offshore industry. Not only in the field of oil and gas, but also in the installation for offshore wind turbines. These jack-up structures typically consist of three trusswork legs, where the foundation is formed by inverted conical cones that are penetrated into the soil, called spudcans. The spudcans transfer the combination of weight and environmental loading to the underlying soil. Jack-up structures are assessed for each particular offshore site, where their stability is checked for a 50 year return period storm as prescribed by the current guidelines. The behaviour of the jack-up structures is strongly influenced by the restraint given by the spudcan footings. This phenomenon is generally described as fixity and is a complicated effect, governed by the interaction between soil and structure. To properly take into account this effect, computational models are needed that incorporate the complicated non-linear behaviour of the jack-up foundation in a structural framework. This paper describes the three-dimensional finite element modelling of a generic jack-up structure, that takes into account the interaction of soil and structure. Through calibration, the complicated non-linear behaviour of the soil is captured in the model. A benchmark study is performed, where the prediction of the finite element model is compared to experimental tests, as well as a macroelement model. This comparison shows that the finite element model is capable of describing the global behaviour of the jack-up unit under loading, as well as the behaviour of the individual spudcan footings. Furthermore, it has been shown through parametric analyses that emphasis should be placed on the calibration of soil parameters under compression, especially at high stresses. The dilative behaviour of the soil has a positive influence on both the global capacity and stiffness, as does an increase of preloading of the structure. The loading direction along the axis of symmetry provides the highest global capacity and stiffness of the rig during loading. Torsional loading of the structure predicts a significant torsional moment at the spudcan footings and predicts a rotation of these footings in the soil. The incorporation of a large-deformation finite element framework has shown to be crucial in the proper prediction of the behaviour of the jack-up structure during push-over loading.","Jack-up structure; Shallow foundation; Offshore engineering; Finite element modelling; Soil-structure interaction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","","",""

Gathering relevant factors on the future of air travel lead to a Future Vision for KLM, proposing a transition towards a true passenger-centric KLM. By considering the impact on passenger experience for all important decisions and policy, a new streamlined customer journey will emerge and the three main reasons to bring hand baggage (found to be time, security and cost) will disappear. Three concepts are proposed as first steps in this transition: KLM Trip Assistant, offering pro-active assistance throughout the complete trip, Shared Stuff, offering rental of commonly used items and Baggage Information, supplying passengers with up to date information about their check-in baggage. A truly passenger-centric experience will not only result in a decrease of hand baggage but will also put KLM back on the map as a reliable and comfortable way of travelling.","aviation; travel; hand baggage; design for behaviour change; customer-centricity; ViP; PASSME","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor); Doelman, R. (mentor)","2016","The next generation of ground-based telescopes have a segmented primary mirror consisting of up to 800 segments which are mounted on a support truss. These segments are actively controlled to correct for external disturbances of which wind loading is the primary source. As mirror size and number of segments grows ever larger, dynamic coupling between the mirror segments has increased impact on the system. The controller design methods currently proposed in literature either omit the dynamics of the support truss, are too computationally complex for large-scale implementation or lack an optimal control point-of-view in the controller design. We start by applying necessary transformations to the finite element model, which improve the numeric conditioning of the model. In contrast to the original model, the transformed model can be used for simulation and controller design. In order to reject the wind loading and other disturbances, H2 optimal distributed dynamic output feedback controllers with low on-line computational complexity are designed. Furthermore, a differentiable sparsity-promoting term can be added to the objective function, so that the controller design procedure finds a (locally) optimal sparsity pattern in the controller matrices, which we can interpret as a distributed controller. Current control strategies for the new generation of segmented mirrors reduce the effect of the disturbances to a level which can be corrected by the adaptive optics system. In simulation, the closed-loop Root-mean-square (RMS) wavefront errors are in the order of 2 nm, far below the diffraction limit of 28nm RMS wavefront error. Since the influence of the wind disturbance in this work is reduced to below the diffraction limit no correction by the adaptive optics is required, the adaptive optics system of the telescope can be fully employed to reduce atmospheric turbulence.","large-scale; control; telescopes; segmented mirrors; structured control; distributed control; sparse; active optics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-11-23","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Delft Center for Systems and Control","","","",""

(mentor); Bodega, R. (mentor)","2016","The recent developments in the offshore wind industry are pushing towards upgrading the inter-array voltage level from 33 kV to 66 kV. The main reason behind this, is the increased capacity of future wind turbines leading to an increased power density in the inter-array grid of the offshore wind farms. The current level of 33 kV cannot give cost effective solutions due to the larger conductor cross-section and the longer inter-array cables needed to accommodate the anticipated power output of future wind turbines. The option of increasing the voltage level seems much more realistic from technical and financial point of view, taking also into account the years of experience and technical “know how” of the manufacturers of high voltage equipment. The challenge for them now is to first optimize their products for the requirements of the offshore wind industry and secondly offer solutions that reduce the total investment cost, which is usually the fact for high voltage energy projects. For this reason, newly developed HV cable accessories are required, that follow the simplicity of the MV products used so far in the offshore wind industry. Such is the 72 kV Y-joint or branch joint intended to connect the inner-turbine cable with the two inter-array cables, each arriving from an adjacent wind turbine. This type of joint can offer significant reduction in the investment costs of future wind farm projects by reducing the number of switching facilities and as well as minimizing installation and maintenance costs. It is therefore very promising to develop such a product for the needs of the offshore wind industry market. This thesis will deal with the design of a 72 kV Y-joint and propose a development testing program. The focus will mainly be on making a compact and robust design that can successfully withstand the electrical, thermal and mechanical stresses that are expected throughout its lifetime. Due to the importance of the Y-joint as electrical component in the high voltage circuit, partial discharge detection would be a very desirable feature for the end customer. For this reason a feasibility study is conducted for designing a “smart” version of the product with integrated partial discharge sensor. The method of finite element analysis (FEA) is widely used throughout this work due to the complex design of the Y-joint. The advanced software and computational power available nowadays, allows three dimensional models to be simulated with multiple physics coupled with each other. These simulations will help identify highly stressed spots and allow correction actions to be made in the design of the product before this is released for production. Furthermore, FEA enables design optimization that will make the product more robust and more compact. The FEA simulations will assess: 1) the electrical stresses in the insulating materials of the Y-joint, caused by the nominal voltage as well as the expected overvoltages in the system, 2) the thermal behaviour of the Y-joint under both steady state and cycle loading conditions, that will determine its current carrying capability and 3) the mechanical stresses in the epoxy insulator from the production stage and mechanical stresses encountered during normal operation and short circuit conditions. After completing this stage, the output of the analysis will be used to plan a development testing program that can stress to the limits the Y-joint validating the models used during the design process. After a successful completion of the development test program the product can be released and the type test can commence to certify that the product meets the relevant standards.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-11-23","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Electrical Sustainable Energy","","DC systems, Energy conversion & Storage","",""

A marina, being a coastal (economic) development, interacts with the environmental conditions of the coastal zone and as such, affects the balance for sustainable development. Sustainable marina development is subsequently defined as the development of a marina in such a way and capacity, that the marina integrates its natural, social and economic environment. Additionally, a marina cannot be deemed sustainable by itself, as important principles for sustainable development like the cumulative impacts, multiple (long-term) objectives and sustainability need to be considered on the level of the larger coastal zone, or ecosystem. Currently, marina design is considered to lack an integrated development approach, and is inadequately represented in current marina development guidelines. Especially the initial stages of marina development, involving important development considerations like location selection and alternatives evaluation, lack the assessment of a marina’s integration in its natural, social and economic environment; a key element of sustainable development.","sustainable development; marina; Mauritius; environment; ecosystem services","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","Concern about the environmental footprint of aviation has re-sparked the interest in unconventional configurations, such as the blended wing body aircraft, BWB. While most research studies recognize the potential of the hybrid-body, they also list a number of challenges. Amongst these challenges is the need for adequate lateral-directional stability and control, which is complicated due to the concept's relative short moment arm and limited available control-volume. To refrain from further straining the trailing edge for directional control, most BWB employ either a conventional vertical tail or resort to yaw-control incorporated winglets. By combining the functionality of the vertical fin with the aerodynamic benefits of a winglet, the required control surface could be obtained without the drag penalty associated with a vertical tail. Although a number of BWB, such as the X-48B, operate these active winglets, limited information is available on the design of such a non-planar component and its influence on the stability and control characteristics. The presented research investigates these aspects aiming to provide a better understanding of the influence of the individual winglet design variables. A design methodology was devised that implements a first order panel method connected to a virtual flight test program. The information collected from the analysis of 400 configurations was used to construct response surfaces that span the entire design space. The generated winglet design program also monitors the impact of the non-planar component on the aerodynamic performance, weight, and operating cost. This enables the user to optimize the tip device, given specified stability and control requirements. It was found that implementing yaw-control incorporated winglets resulted in a statically stable aircraft that meets the requirements for crosswind landing. However, none of the tested configurations meet the dutch roll frequency criterion, corresponding to a satisfactory handling quality level. Research indicates that the tip device has little influence on ωdr, indicating the need to modify the baseline aircraft. Analysis of the response surface estimates for the asymmetric eigenmodes yields a significantly large average error and standard deviation for the spiral. Therefore, it is omitted from the study. Similar errors can be found for a number of other parameters. These parameters can generally be characterized by values that approach zero. The error and standard deviation is amplified when the parameter also changes sign. Normalization of these stability and control characteristics had little influence on the accuracy of the response surface. In recognition of the demonstrated inability of the response surface to accurately capture the behaviour of these parameters, it is concluded that further research is required to reduce the error of the estimates. Despite the indicated challenges, the system is able to explore various control surface configurations. This provides valuable insight into the behaviour of the stability and control characteristics and takes the first step towards the generation of less computational intensive models.","Stability; Winglet; Rudder; Blended Wing Body","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Aerodynamics, Wind Energy & Propulsion","","Flight Performance & Propulsion","",""

(mentor)","2016","In this report we applied the marginal structural model and the naive Cox model on a simulated dataset, in order to find differences between these models. The marginal structural model is used to estimate causal effects in case of time-dependent confounding via inverse probability weights. The naive Cox model may produce a bias estimate of the causal effect, because it cannot correct for this time-dependent confounding. In the simulation study we saw that the estimated effect of treatment was different for both models. In some situations the models gave different conclusions, which could lead to a wrong decision in a real problem. We also applied the marginal structural model on `The Netherlands Cooperative Study on the Adequacy of Dialysis' (NECOSAD). Patients that participated on this study all have a chronic kidney disease. Because of kidney failure, these patients could suffer from anemia. In order to correct for this, they are treated with Erythropoiesis-Stimulating Agents (ESA). We compared treatment in dialysis patients with no/low ESA dose versus treatment with high ESA dose. We want to estimate the causal effect of treatment on survival. We used the marginal structural model, because Hb is a time-dependent confounder in this dataset. We saw an increased risk of mortality for the 'High ESA dose' patients in our analysis of 58%. This suggests that treatment with high ESA dose increases the risk of death. So treatment with high ESA dose is harmful according to our marginal structural model. At the moment, there is no strict protocol for doctors for when to start treatment. If treatment with high ESA dose is harmful it would be better to expose patients as short as possible to high doses. So we want to find the optimal regime to start treatment. This can be done by applying the dynamic marginal structural model. This model compares different regimes, such that we can find the regime which has the smallest causal effect on mortality. For this analysis we define different regimes of starting treatment. For instance, one regime could be `start treatment once the Hb level is below 10 g/dL'. With the dynamic marginal structural model we can compare these different regimes to find the best moment to treat. In our real data analysis we compared 6 regimes to find the best moment to treat based on Hb level. We applied the dynamic marginal structural Cox model and regime 3, initiate treatment with high ESA dose when Hb-level first drops below 11 g/dL, showed the best results.","inverse probability weights; marginal structural model; dynamic treatment regimes","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Delft Institute of Applied Mathematics","","Probability, Risk and Statistics","",""

(mentor); van der Veen, C. (mentor); van Dalen, J.H. (mentor); van Dee, R.C. (mentor)","2016","This thesis aims to analyse the conservatism in the current Dutch recommendations on the external friction angle 𝛿 of diaphragm walls: 𝛿 = 𝑚𝑖𝑛[𝜙, 20°] (for curved slip surfaces) (CUR/COB, 2010), by means of an experimental investigation. Based on literature, two sources of conservatism are identified: 1) filter cake contamination by excavated soil particles is not taken into account, which can lead to an increased 𝛿 of around 30° (Day et al., 1981; Henry et al., 1998; Arwanitaki et al., 2007); 2) a continuous shear plane through the filter cake is assumed, ignoring the influence of concrete roughness and filter cake thickness. Cernak et al. (1973) and Lam et al. (2014) found that the concrete roughness causes an increased shear strength compared to the filter cake below a certain filtration time (which controls the filter cake thickness). These aspects are captured in a conceptual model (hypothesis), which predicts the development of interface shear strength as a function of filtration time for the case of a contaminated filter cake compared to a clean filter cake: For a contaminated filter cake, the lower boundary shear strength, which is that of the filter cake, is higher compared to that of a clean filter cake. However, this lower boundary is reached after a shorter filtration time for a contaminated filter cake compared to a clean filter cake, caused by the higher filter cake growth rate due to slurry contamination. The first experimental phase focusses on the filter cake shear strength. A series of small-scale direct-shear tests (∅ 67 mm) on sand/filter cake (clean)/cement-mortar samples show a linear trend of peak shear strength of 18,3° for normal pressures in the range of 200 kPa - 400 kPa at a shear rate of 1,2 mm/min. This result corresponds to the friction angle of 19,5° by Deltares (2008), which lies at the basis of the current Dutch 𝛿 recommendations. Additional tests on clean filter cakes indicate a peak shear strength around 23° at a shear rate of 0,0072 mm/min. Test series on contaminated filter cakes show an increased linear trend of peak shear strength of 25,6° for normal pressures in the range of 200 kPa - 400 kPa at a shear rate of 1,2 mm/min. The filter cake contamination is based on an analysis of an in-situ slurry sample analysis from the Spoorzone Delft project. Increased friction angles of 28,5° and 32,8° are observed at 0,0072 mm/min shear rate. In the second experimental phase, the influence of filtration time on the interface shear strength for clean and contaminated filter cakes is investigated. In total, 7 direct-shear tests have been performed on sand/filter cake/concrete samples (170 mm x 170 mm), in which a realistic diaphragm wall concrete mix is applied (max. aggregate size 16 mm, class F5). The test results (normal pressure of 200 kPa, shear rate 1,2 mm/min) show a decrease of interface shear strength with increased filtration time for both clean and contaminated filter cake samples and it is shown that for the contaminated case the filter cake shear strength is reached after a shorter filtration time (around 12 hours) compared to clean filter cakes (around 24 hours), confirming the hypothesis. An analysis of the concrete surface textures (based on 3D laser scans) indicates an increased surface roughness with increased filter cake thickness. The obtained concrete surface roughness is comparable to in-situ conditions based on an analysis of in-situ data from the Spoorzone Delft project. In this comparison the influence of macro-roughness patterns is not taken into account. The experimental results of this thesis indicate that the main source of conservatism of the current Dutch recommendations on 𝛿 is the omission of the influence of filter cake contamination on the filter cake shear strength. In addition, 𝛿 could further be optimised as a function of filtration time. However, the time frame of increased interface shear strength from the filter cake shear strength towards 𝜙 is limited for contaminated filter cakes (around 12 hours in this research). It is therefore concluded that the recommended 𝛿 value(s) can best be based on contaminated filter cake shear strength, omitting the time effect. It is therefore suggested that future research should focus on the lower boundary shear strength for the case of in-situ filter cake samples. For this purpose the developed direct-shear set-up can be applied. It is also suggested to further investigate the influence of macro-roughness patterns, since it can not be excluded that macro-roughness patterns do not cause an extended time frame of increased interface shear strength.","diaphragm wall; skin friction; bentonite filter cake; direct-shear test; concrete roughness","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","Geo-Engineering","",""

In addition, because of the fuel-flexibility of heat production facilities for district heating, district heating may also contribute to lowering the energy dependency of the Dutch energy sector. In order for the district heating sector to grow and increase its share of renewable heat production there is however a need to adapt the current regulatory framework such that the relative attractiveness of district heating versus other forms of heating is improved. In this paper a market design approach is presented for the regulatory framework of the Dutch district heating sector. The design challenge is conducted by combining theoretical insights from economic literature and empirical evidence drawn from international case-studies of alternative market models for the district heating sector. Two new, distinct, market models are suggested for the Dutch district heating sector, which both may (1) foster the growth of the district heating sector, including increasing the share of renewable heat production, and (2) facilitate the transition towards more sustainable practices in the overall heat provision system. Future research could focus on conducting more case-studies in order to improve the quality of the arguments for and against specific policy instruments in the design space. In addition, future research could also focus on improving the assessment of the expected performance of the market models in practice through modelling and simulation.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Energy and Industry","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","For the installation of offshore windturbine pile foundations a dedicated subsea drilling tool has been developed. The installation forms part of the Wikinger windfarm project, located in the Baltic Sea. The main function of the tool is dredging up to a few meters of soil from the pile to allow for jacket installation. Next to this it is also suited for the drilling of refusal piles, which cannot be driven to the full depth in one effort. The drilling tool consists of three main components. Two jets with a pressure of 1000 bar facilitate the cutting processes, whilst four low pressure jets aid the transport of material towards the suction inlet There are concerns about the capability of the drill-tool to extract loosened material from underneath its shield. In order to investigate the performance of the drill-tool and to gain better insight into the occurring processes physical tests are performed in the laboratory. A scaled down version of the drill-tool is built. Different combinations of suction flow rates, jet pressures and jet arrangements were tested. The presence of the low pressure jets proves to be critical for achieving higher productions. The angled nozzles present on the drill-tool prove particularly effective at transporting material towards the suction inlet. Based on the laboratory tests an significant improvement is achieved when using an adapted angled nozzle design that increases the horizontal component of the jet over the bed. It can also be be stated that the transport of material towards the suction inlet is not expected to be a limiting factor for production. This is more likely to be the cutting process especially when harder soils are encountered. Following the laboratory investigation a numerical CFD DEM study is conducted. The aim is to model the erosion process relating to the threshold of motion of a particle on a bed. This process occurs beneath the drill-tool's shield when the suction system is solely in operation. The terminal settling velocity and hindered settlement effect are successfully validated before proceeding towards the erosion study. A particle bed is created and subjected to different flow velocities. A bed shear stress is determined at this stage after which the results are compared to the established Shields curve. For 1 mm particles the threshold of movement is successfully validated against the Shields curve.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-11-22","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Marine and Transport Technology","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

(mentor); Radermacher, M. (mentor); Pel, A. (mentor)","2016","Durban is the biggest city of the KwaZulu-Natal province located at the East coast of South-Africa. In South Africa nation wide millions of Rands of damage occur along with tens of casualties as a result of urban flooding. These floods are usually the result of heavy rainfall. In Durban other factors that may contribute to floods are blockage or siltation of the drainage system. The blockage of the rainage system is a result of bad waste management. The continuously rising sea level in combination with a blocked urban drainage system could pose a serious threat. This results in the following main goal of this project: obtain insight in the effects of combined sea storm and high rain/river events on stakeholders and existing transport systems, for regular and more severe events. The scope of the project is the area of Durban from the port up until the Umgeni Business park and from the coast until the hill ridge. This report contains four parts. Part I: Analysis, Part II: Elaboration on Modelling Approach, Part III: Acquiring Results and Part IV: Solutions. In the first part are analysed: stakeholders, the transport network, the storm water network and hydraulic and hydrological aspects. In the stakeholder analysis several stakeholders are identified that either have a significant interest, or significant power to influence any decisions that will have to be made regarding floods. From the traffic analysis the most important roads and bottlenecks were identified. The only interesting network is the road network, since other infrastructure is not used by many people. The stormwater network analysis showed that in several locations such as the Central Business District (CBD) the tide penetrates far into the network and several outfalls are completely underwater during spring tide. This shows the possible vulnerability of the network to a high water level from the sea. The analysis also showed that external factors such as blockage of the manholes by waste could also affect the functionality of the system. The hydraulic & hydrological parameters that were analysed were rainfall and river discharge from the land side and the water level from the sea side. In the second part different maps are created which together reveal the most critical areas with respect to flooding. The most critical areas with respect to stakeholders and the traffic network were identified and mapped. Also the drainage model PCSWMM, which has been used to model the urban drainage system of the study area has been described. In the third part the stakeholder and transport map are combined with a flood map resulting from PCSWMM. The flood scenarios, which are used as input for PCSWMM are based on the likeliness of the combination of occurrence of the sea and land based hydraulic parameters. By the combination of these maps, the consequences of the floods have been evaluated. Because of inaccuracies in the flood map for some regions the focus was laid upon the Central Business District. The consequences of the floods are divided in capital, social and economic costs. Several main roads could get flooded in the CBD which will require the traffic to use other main roads. The exit- and entry ramps of these other roads however are not designed for such an increase in intensity and therefore congestion will arise at these locations. This will cause severe travel time delay and will result in economic costs. With respect to stakeholders, property owners and small businesses will be most affected in some parts whereas in other parts of the area insurance companies will be most affected because of the houses of middle or upper class residents and also business who are all insured for damages caused by floods. The last part contains four proposed solution strategies which can be used as a starting point in treating floods. Floods can be seen as a risk which consists of the combination of probability and consequences. Therefore four general risk treating strategies are used: Accept, Avoid, Mitigate and Transfer. Four global solutions to deal with floods are constructed each based on these different strategy. The four strategies were evaluated using a Multi Criteria analysis. This showed that all strategies are better than the 0-hypothesis (Accept) but none of the strategies proved to be the most suitable. Finally some recommendations are given for further research and to improve the PCSWMM model.","Floods; Durban; KwaZulu-Natal; eThekwini municipality; PCSWMM; Transport network; Stakeholder analysis; Risks","en","student report","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","","","","Multidisciplinary Project CIE4061-09","-29.88333, 31.05000"

The developed computational tool (FPSO TRANSIM) is validated against SafeTrans, a voyage simulation program developed by the Maritime Institute of the Netherlands (MARIN). Moreover, a sensitivity analysis is performed in terms of the wind coefficients and the calm water resistance so as to determine their influence on the speed, safety and voyage duration. Further, the effect of weather routing and the application of bow thrusters are investigated while lastly simulations are performed at various power options which are coupled with a cost analysis. It is finally concluded that the minimum required power can only be determined following a thorough risk assessment.","FPSO; FLNG; Minimum; Propulsion; Speed Loss; Maneuverability; Voyage Simulations; FPSO TRANSIM; SafeTrans","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Marine and Transport Technology","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","Power system blackouts have been observed increasingly frequent and severe. As an emergency control action to rescue the system from complete blackout, under-frequency load shedding (UFLS) technique can disconnect a part of the load when a disturbance occurs and an excessively low frequency is detected. Traditional UFLS scheme is widely adopted in present power systems. However, it usually has several pre-defined steps and corresponding frequency thresholds without sufficient consideration of the actual system characteristics and the disturbance situations. This can result in inaccurate load shedding or even unsuccessful protection. In comparison, advanced UFLS schemes proposed in the literature can dynamically adjust the shedding steps based on the specified algorithms and thus are advantageous over traditional UFLS scheme in frequency recovery and other aspects such as reducing total shedding amount and improving voltage stability. In the thesis, a set of models are developed using PowerFactory and Python for advanced UFLS schemes. Then three schemes are implemented and verified. Simulation results show that these schemes can successfully arrest frequency decline along with specified optimizations. Several factors such as load characteristics are observed to have significant impact on the UFLS performance. For one of the considered schemes, a step correction method is proposed in the thesis to improve the frequency performance for more disturbance scenarios.","Under-Frequency Load Shedding; Power Imbalance Estimation; PowerFactory; Python","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Electrical Sustainable Energy","","","",""

(mentor); Ngan-Tillard, D.J.M. (mentor)","2016","Dodanduwa is a small fishery village in the south-west of Sri Lanka, about 20.000 inhabitants are dependent on the fishery industry. Currently the harbour facilities, that were constructed in 2009, are hard to reach due to the wave conditions and sedimentation at the harbour entrance. The Ministry of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development initiated a rehabilitation project in 2015. In this report the issues at the Dodanduwa harbour area are thoroughly investigated and conceptual solutions are presented. The goal of this report is to provide several durable and feasible conceptual designs for the fishery harbour of Dodanduwa; which fulfil the needs of the community on the longer term, taking the socio-economic and environmental effects into account. This goal is reached by answering five sub questions: 1. What does the coastal system look like? 2. What is causing navigability issues at the harbour? 3. What are the involved parties and what are their interests? 4. What is the impact of the improved harbour on the surrounding area? 5. Which requirements should be considered when designing the harbour improvement? The report is divided into three parts: the preliminary study, the conceptual design and the evaluation. In 2009 the first major adjustment has been made to the Dodanduwa fishery harbour, a breakwater was constructed at the northern bay. The breakwater was only partly constructed, resulting in a less safe situation in the harbour. The redevelopment plans of the harbour involve ensuring safe navigation inside the harbour area and enough accessible anchorage capacity for the coming 10 years. To solve the issues in the Dodanduwa harbour on the long term, five different conceptual designs are presented. At the end of the design phase some recommendations are given. Six general recommendations are presented, closing with separate recommendations for the design of the hydraulic structures. Before continuing with the final design the expected future fleet should be investigated more thoroughly. Large uncertainties in the expected future fleet may lead to a non-functional harbour improvement. Another uncertainty is the effect of an all year open river mouth; with stakeholder interviews and research on salt water intrusion this should be cleared out. For a better prediction of the impact of the hydraulic structures on the coastline, performing wave and sediment modelling provides more insight. The extension of the current breakwater must be further investigated, the safety level of the current breakwater must be determined. The transition between the current breakwater and the new breakwater may not lead to a weak spot. The current preliminary designs are based on several assumptions due to data limitations. For the final designs it is strongly recommended that all investigations, such as bathymetry measurements and soil investigations, are performed properly. The financial feasibility of the project is uncertain, multiple fishery harbours in the region are already constructed. A study to determine total life cycle costs must be performed to determine the financial feasibility.","Dodanduwa; fishery harbour; rehabilitation; conceptual designs","en","student report","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","","","","MDP 205","6.10481, 80.12552"

(2015) have developed a solute transport model (STM) so as to paint a dire portrait of the leachate generation and transport in the Braambergen landfill (located in the western portion of the Netherlands) with the ultimate goal of quantifying the chemical composition of the landfill's overall emissions. In fact, the model simulates the Chloride (Cl-) concentration in the outflowing from the landfill leachate and the mass of Cl- that remains in the landfill by using an ordinary differential equation (ODE) that describes dualporosity, mobile-immobile solute transport phenomena. This environmental model, developed in MATLAB, simulates these state variables by solving the aforementioned ODE by means of the well-known ode45 solver in MATLAB. In spite of that, the computational expense of the ode45 solver does not seem to be identical (~20-30 seconds of calculations). As is widely known, various ODE solvers usually require different computing times. Namely, the selection of the method for solving such insightful equations most often affects the time efficiency of ODE-based models. In the light of these considerations, this paper exploits the robustness of several explicit and implicit Runge-Kutta methods to solve the STM's ODE in an effort to make this model more cost-effective. By virtue of the results, the fourth order explicit Runge-Kutta method along with the fourth and sixth order implicit Runge-Kutta methods have successfully managed to drastically reduce the computational cost of the STM (~4-9 seconds of calculations).","Runge-Kutta; STM; ODE; Cl; ode45; Explicit; Implicit","en","student report","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","Geo-Engineering","",""

The forward LIBOR rates are modeled at a constant additive spread over the OIS curve. An analytical closed-form approximation of the European swaption volatility in the multi-curve framework is derived and its accuracy is verified by comparing the Monte Carlo prices of a set of European swaptions with the corresponding prices obtained using the approximation. It is demonstrated that the approximation reaches the highest accuracy for swaptions characterized by short underlying tenors and strikes close to the swap rate. The multi-curve LIBOR Market Model is calibrated to the swaption market applying this approximation. Using the calibrated model distinct Bermudan swaptions are priced by means of Monte Carlo. These prices are compared to the corresponding prices obtained using the one-factor Hull-White model and the impact of the model selection is analyzed.","additive spread; Bermudan swaption; calibration; derivatives modeling; interest rates; LIBOR Market Model; LMM; multi-curve framework; Monte Carlo; OIS discounting; swap; swaption; swaption volatility approximation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Delft Institute of Applied Mathematics","","Applied Probability","",""

(mentor)","2016","An interesting evolution is happening in the airline industry, as more and more airlines start selling upgrades to a higher class. A decade ago, upgrades were for the top notch frequent flyers of an airline and could only be bought with air miles. Nowadays more than 20 airlines have a closed auction to sell upgrades and third party companies jump into this market with to gain a small part of the revenues. Three years ago, KLM introduced an open auction to sell upgrades to their business class. The ‘bid for an upgrade’ tool was great for passengers who did get an upgrade. On the other hand, the group of passengers who won the auction and did not get an upgrade was left with an incomprehensible feeling and caused several negative reactions on the Internet. Therefore, the aim for this thesis is to: Design an upgrade offer from economy to business class for KLM passengers. In order to develop a concept, the bid for an upgrade tool of KLM has been analysed. The main missing element in the tool was the fact that the customer experience was been undervalued. With a clear focus for the project, passengers were asked about their demands for upgrades and how they would like to be contacted by the airline. These insights lead to a clear picture on the importance of upgrade attributes and the relevance of an upgrade in the last days before departure. Another important insight in the customer analysis was the profile of passengers who buy upgrades. They could be identified on three characters: - Member of Flying Blue program - Bought ancillaries in the past (e.g. economy comfort) - Travels for business purpose Research on the influence of selling paid upgrades on the current business class passengers was done as well by a literature study and a check on passenger data and their satisfaction. Research showed that business class passengers accept the existence of paid upgrades if they perceive the price they pay as fair and understand the advantages of a full fare business class ticket (mainly the certainty of a seat). With the results from the analysis two concepts for selling upgrades were developed. (1) the Dutch auction focuses on selling upgrades by the website or KLM app 2-3 days before departure. The main difference compared to the open auction is that the price decreases over time, the principle used here is that people are risk averse. (2) the personal offer makes use of the KLM app and Facebook messenger to send a message to KLM’s customers about the possibility to buy an upgrade. The concepts fit well in the IT environment from KLM and could be implemented rather simple. Both the concepts are nowadays in the first development phase of KLM and are planning to be launched in 2017.","","","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","","","","",""

(mentor); Wang, H. (mentor)","2016","The tremendous growth of the Internet brings with it a massive amount of data that users are exposed to on a daily basis. Consequently, information filtering techniques like recommender systems have become increasingly important to sift through the data and find what is relevant to a particular user. A recent approach for recommender systems, called Factorization Machines (FM), has been attracting lots of attention for its flexibility and accuracy. In this work we explore the importance of optimizing FMs, the influence of different auxiliary features on the performance of FMs and how to weight these features. The results show that the optimization of hyper-parameters, factorization dimensionality and feature weights is a very crucial part of using FMs for recommendations. Using static un-normalized feature weights is found to outperform using previously proposed normalized weights in terms of rating prediction accuracy. Several new approaches to auxiliary features are proposed. Expanding feature vectors with info based on the ratio of users that found a review of the item helpful or not is found to improve performance slightly. Additionally, constructing feature vectors using the similarity of users (based on either common movies commented on, common friends or common ratings) was also beneficial to the performance. However, the overall conclusion is that there is no clear answer to which auxiliary features are useful, as it depends heavily on the dataset and in many cases auxiliary features seem to introduce noise into the model. A noticeable trend in the results indicates that item attributes are more useful for rating predictions than user attributes, while the opposite applies for top-N ranking predictions and diversity, which benefits more from user attributes.","Recommender Systems; Factorization Machines; Collaborative Filtering,; Feature Vector; Auxiliary Features; Feature Engineering","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Multimedia Computing","","Embedded Systems","",""

(mentor); Chen, X. (mentor); Romeijn, A. (mentor)","2016","During its expedition from 1872 to 1876, the HMS Challenger (see right) first proved the abundance of polymetallic nodules in the Pacific-, Indian- and Atlantic Oceans, giving rise to new interest in economic development of this resource. A century later, in 1976, the first successful pilot mining test for polymetallic nodule recovery was carried out. By now, 40 years later, hundreds of patents have been filed, and even more papers have been published related to deep sea nodule mining, yet progress remains slow. There is still no economically viable solution to mine nodules from the deep sea, and the few organizations involved in full scale testing rely heavily on government funding. In addition to funding issues, current designs struggle with reliability and cause severe turbidity in the deep sea environment. The subject of this work is the design of the collector subsystem, which is open to innovation. The collector is interfacing the natural environment containing the nodule resource on the one hand, and on the other hand the rest of the mining system. Therefore, its design is fundamental to the compromise between environmental impact and economic return which is central to the design as a whole. Innovating the design of the collector unit could steer away from the problems associated with current deep sea nodule mining designs, and perhaps make the development of this resource more viable, both in economics and environmental footprint. This could help make accessible a wealth of resources including manganese, nickel, copper, cobalt and rare earth minerals, which are vital for, among others, the green energy and defence sectors. Therefore a new design alternative is explored, along which the following hypothesis: There is a viable design solution to be considered for the collector module of deep sea nodule harvesting equipment which will improve on efficiency and reduce the environmental impact as compared to current state of art. Exploring this hypothesis without any bias towards a certain design requires the adoption of a meticulous design methodology which is followed throughout the work. It will finally result in the proposal of a mechanical rotivator design which is further optimized. Considering the environment, a study is performed to check the turbidity performance of the design. This finally results in a design that improves on efficiency, turbidity limitation and sturdiness compared to contemporary designs.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Venkatesha Prasad, R.R. (mentor)","2016","The massive availability of bandwidth in the millimeter wave (mmWave) frequency band has the potential to address the challenges posed by the unprecedented increase in the mobile data traffic. Therefore, mmWave wireless access is being seen as a promising candidate for multi-Gbps wireless access in the next generation (i.e., 5G) of wireless communications. In particular, 60 GHz frequency band with 9 GHz of unlicensed bandwidth (57-66 GHz) is being considered for the next generation of Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs) for high data rate indoor communications. Although the 60 GHz band provides very high data rates, its signal propagation properties are quite different from the 2.4/5 GHz bands. The high free-space path loss in 60 GHz band requires directional antennas to compensate for this high path loss. Further, the small wavelengths in 60 GHz frequency band makes 60 GHz links highly susceptible to blockage due to its inability to penetrate the obstacles. For example, human shadowing overwhelmingly attenuates the received signal power and results in frequent blockages. In this thesis, we experimentally evaluate the impact of human blockage on the performance (link quality, data rate) of Commercial Off-The Shelf (COTS) 60 GHz devices. To identify the blockages due to the human activities, we propose a reactive blockage characterization algorithm based on the observation of signal quality degradation time; and signal quality recovery time. Based on this, we categorized the blockage into: (i) short-term and (ii) long-term blockage. Our measurement results indicate that different actions are required to circumvent the link disruption caused by the long-term and the short-term human blockages. We show that in case of a long-term blockage, connecting to an alternate access point (AP) or searching for an alternate path helps in maintaining the link quality. On the other hand, in case of short-term blockage it is not advantageous to look for alternate APs or paths due to its transient nature. We also show that the incorrect detection of a blockage type aggravates the throughput performance degradation. Furthermore, we derive an important trade-off relation between the decision time and the accuracy of blockage-type detection, and show that by using an appropriate decision threshold, correct action can be executed with high detection accuracy.","60 GHz; mmWave; human blockage; IEEE 802.11ad","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","","","","",""

(mentor); Morales España, G. (mentor)","2016","In recent years, a transition towards a more sustainable future has started and it is imperative that this trend continues. An increasing energy demand from the continuously growing population, together with the increment of greenhouse gasses (GHG) emissions and the depletion of fossil fuels have motivated the penetration of renewable energy systems (RESs) in different areas and scales. As a consequence, the energy sector is facing a transition from a centralized network, composed of large and controllable power plants, to a decentralized grid based on RESs. Within this framework, microgrids (MGs) provide a key solution to integrate RESs, controllable energy resources, flexible loads and storage systems either in a grid-connected or an islanded mode. Optimal energy management is crucial to develop strategies to improve the efficiency and reliability ofMGs, as well as newcommunication networks to support optimal and reliable operation. This study proposes an energy management system (EMS) whose main objective is to optimally operate a microgrid (MG) using frequency as the only communication signal. The developed model considers renewable energy sources (RESs) such as photovoltaic (PV) panels and wind turbines, a micro-generator, a battery energy storage system (BESS) and both critical and controllable loads. In a conventional grid with a control system based on frequency communications, each element of the grid has a droop curve and the frequency reflects the generation - load balance as a result of a compromise between each other. However, in the inertia-less grid proposed in this thesis the EMS controls the BESS and solves the optimization problem, which determines the optimal frequency of the system. The rest of the system components react according to the optimal frequency by following their specific frequencypower response curves. In thisway, an optimal planning and operation of theMGis sought in order to minimize operational costs and consequently increase the use of RESs, reduce GHG emissions, perform a smart charge of the BESS and optimally operate the diesel generator. A demand-side management (DSM) mechanism is introduced in order to manage controllable loads via load-shedding to match availability of RESs. To further adjust generation to load demand, RESs curtailment or supply-side management (SSM) is implemented through the application of a version of an available standard that ensures grid security when connecting RES generators to the grid. The performance of the proposed EMS will be validated through simulation results for different scenarios using real numerical data from an existing microgrid, comparing the results against the traditional control system.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Electrical Sustainable Energy","","DC systems, Energy conversion & Storage","",""

(mentor)","2016","The analytic element method (AEM) is used to build a model that can simulate travel time distribution of steady-state saturated and unsaturated flow through and around non-overlapping circular and elliptic inhomogeneities in an otherwise homogeneous soil. The analytic element solutions for saturated flow are derived from Laplace’s differential equation by separation of variables in polar and elliptic coordinates. For unsaturated flow, the hydraulic conductivity is represented by an exponential function of the pressure head, the Richards equation is transformed into the modified Helmholtz equation, and the analytic element solutions are found by separation of variables in polar and elliptic coordinates. The AEM model is tested for accuracy and benchmarked against HYDRUS 2D/3D. The benchmark problem consists of three inhomogeneities in a uniform flow; both circular and elliptical inhomogeneities are considered. The pressure head and discharge are evaluated along cross-section lines in the flow field for three values of the uniform flow. The accuracy is tested by showing continuity of the pressure head and the normal component of the discharge across the edge of the inhomogeneities. Furthermore, numerical checks are conducted to confirm that the governing differential equations are fulfilled. Fifty inhomogeneities are semi-randomly placed and modeled in a cross-sectional area of one square meter. A relatively coarser soil type is selected inside the inhomogeneities and a relative finer soil type is selected as background material. The breakthrough curves are modeled for both circular and elliptical inhomogeneities with three values of the uniform flow. The simulated breakthrough curves for the saturated zone show a striking difference from the breakthrough curves of the unsaturated zone. For the saturated, zone the preferential flow is through the coarser inhomogeneities, and the variance of the breakthrough curve is very small. When the travel time is scaled by the average travel time, breakthrough curves for different uniform flow values all give the same results. The breakthrough curves fitted well with a Pearson III distribution, which is the approximate solution to a solute transport equation. For the unsaturated zone, the preferential flow is through the finer background material, instead of through the coarser inhomogeneities. When the simulated breakthrough curves are scaled by the average travel time, they show different results for different uniform flows. As the flow decreases, the difference in hydraulic conductivity between the inhomogeneities and the background material increases, leading to a larger range of the travel times. The Pearson III distribution does not fit the unsaturated breakthrough curves very well, because the breakthrough curves show a dual-permeability behavoir, where the fast flow and slow flow occur due to the large differences in hydraulic conductivity. The Pearson III distribution is adjusted to the dual-permeability by taking the sum of two Pearson III distributions, one for the fast flow and one for the slow flow. The fitted dual Pearson III distribution resembles the simulated breakthrough curves very well.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Water Management","","","",""

(mentor); Zaadnoordijk, W.J. (mentor); Oosterhof, A.T. (mentor); Rietveld, L.C. (mentor); Schoups, G.H.W. (mentor)","2016","The well field in Noardburgum has been closed since the year 1993, due to the salinization of the groundwater. Upconing and lateral attraction of brackish groundwater caused the salinization of the groundwater. Currently, Vitens is looking for ways to reinstate the Noardburgum well field without the risk of salinization. The Fresh Keeper is proposed as a solution. The Fresh Keeper extracts fresh and brackish water at different depths in the aquifer, thus preventing the upconing of brackish water. The extracted brackish water is infiltrated into a deeper aquifer. The Smart Well is a further development of the Fresh Keeper, which monitors the concentration of the brackish water and automatically adjusts the brackish extraction. Currently, a single Smart Well is installed in the Noardburgum well field. Plans exists for a full-scale well field in Noardburgum, including 4 SmartWells, to be operational by the year 2018. Another well field, called Ritskebos, is located 1.3 kilometer Southeast of Noardburgum. The chloride content of the extracted water has been increasing over the last decades. 800 meters North East of Ritskebos a hole exists in the aquitard, which separates the first aquifer from the brackish second aquifer. This hole is important to the salinization of the Ritskebos well field. The Smart Well is a potential risk for the Ritskebos well field, since it can increase the amount of groundwater flowing through this hole. It can also enhance the amount of seepage through the aquitard separating the aquifers. This is not beneficial, since groundwater with a high chloride concentration is located in the second aquifer. The objective of this study is to analyze the effects of the SmartWell and the full-scale design on the regional geohydrology. An uncertainty analysis is performed to assess the reliability of the results. The sustainability is measured using different indicators, including the chloride concentration and the origin of the extracted groundwater. The computed values of the indicators give a measure of the sustainability of the system and the corresponding confidence intervals. The results of this study show that the probability of salinization, noted as an exceedance of the 0.15 g L¡1 chloride concentration limit within the coming 50 years, of the full-scale design in Noardburgum is 0-2%. The probability of salinization at Ritskebos without any extractions in Noardburgum is 5-36%, and increases in case of the full-scale design at Noardburgum to 42-66%. There is a 31-55 % probability the mixed water of Noardburgum and Ritskebos will be salinized. The Smart Well increases the probability of salinization at Ritskebos, and poses a substantial threat to the sustainability of the Ritskebos well field. The computed values of the sustainability show that there is almost 50% probability that the full-scale design may lead to an unsustainable situation.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Water Management","","","","53.21660,5.99716"

(mentor)","2016","Turbochargers play an important role in increasing the fuel economy of passenger vehicles. With emissions standards getting stricter in Europe over the passing years, turbochargers have soared in popularity in the automotive industry. Due to increasing competition in the market place, manufacturers have had to optimize each of the sub-systems of the turbocharger for peak performance. One such sub-system is the V-clamp connection between the turbine housing and the bearing housing of the turbocharger. The critical loads on the components of the turbocharger are the cycles of thermal loading, with peak temperatures of the exhaust gases reaching 1100 ±C. It is the goal of this research to understand the behavior of the V-clamp clamping system when it is subjected to cycles of thermal loading. The bolted V-clamp has been investigated quite extensively in literature, but only under cold conditions. The behavior of this clamping connection under thermal loading has received surprisingly little attention by the scientific community. This is probably due to the fact that V-clamps are not widely used in academic research. Nevertheless, they are the go-to solution for clamping purposes in the turbocharger industry. Thus, understanding the reasons for the behavior of the connection under thermal loading is of importance in order to design a robust system. First, a simplified component model is created to model the V-clamp and the flanges it connects. Component models are combinations of 1-dimensional spring elements, friction elements, and rigid bodies connected together to represent a mechanical system. The component model created here models the elastic stiffness of the V-clamp and the turbine housing (as 1-dimensional springs), and the plasticity in the V-clamp (as a 1-dimensional friction block). Previous investigations from the literature have shown that plasticity in the V-clamp should be modelled as it plays an important role in the response of the clamping system. The component model is analysed with the help of dimensionless ratios, which make it easy to study the relative effects of the components on each other. It is found that the component model behaves in a similar way as the actual clamping system. Since dimensionless ratios were used for the analysis, the effects of different relative stiffnesses of the V-clamp and the turbine housing, and the effects of different thermal expansions of the V-clamp and the turbine housing could be easily studied. The results of the analysis help in understanding the behavior of the connection when thermal loading is applied. Next, an optimization study is conducted with the goal of maximizing the minimum axial clamping force in the system for the duration of three heat load cycles. A parameterized axially symmetric model is created in Abaqus 6.14-1 to simulate a simplified version of the turbocharger clamping geometry. The parameterization is done with design variables that allow changing the connection geometry of the clamping connection. Due to non-convexity of the design domain and non-linearity of the objective function, a response surface is first created to understand the variation of the objective function over the design domain. This is also useful in choosing proper starting points for the optimization process, in order to get close to the global optimum. The optimum found with this strategy is analysed for its validity, and compared with the conclusions obtained from the component model. Finally, the sensitivity of the optimum with respect to varying thermal loads, and varying thicknesses of the V-clamp is studied. It is found that lower heat loads and thicker V-clamps are beneficial to the performance of the clamping system. The investigation of the clamping system presented here will hopefully provide clear guidelines in the rational design of the clamping done by bolted V-clamps. This study of the V-clamp under thermal cyclic loading has contributed to a better understanding of the working of the system. The study proposes changes to the connection geometry that affects the relative stiffnesses of the V-clamp and the turbine housing, and their relative thermal expansions. Future work could investigate the effect of differentmaterial grades of the components on the response of the system.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Precision and Microsystems Engineering","","","",""

This passive device, which does not require any active energy, is gaining an increasing interest in this sector especially due to the trend of increasing wind turbine size. Vortex generators are a flow control technique used to prevent or at least lessen the severity of flow separation. The streamwise vortices shed at the free tips of the vortex generators increase the mixing between the high-energy flow in the outer part of the boundary-layer with the low energy regions near the walls. The shed vortices are defined by the strength of the vortices just downstream of the device, the streamwise decay of the vortex strength and the vortex trajectory. In order to assess and optimise the use of vortex generators, there is a need to accurately model the effect of this device in a cost and time efficient way. This could be achieved by modelling vortex generators using integral boundary-layer codes. XFOIL and RFOIL are two well-known integral boundary-layer codes. These two codes rely on Prandtl’s theory stating that a flow field around an object can be divided into two areas: the inviscid outer flow and the viscid inner flow. The inviscid part of the flow is solved using a streamfunction panel method while the viscid boundary-layer solution is prescribed by the boundary-layer equations and additional closure relations. Both solutions are strongly interconnected to each other. A suitable methodology to model the effect of vortex generators into integral boundary-layer codes is the source term approach. This approach was already initiated by Kerho and Kramer1 but is revised carefully in this thesis. The introduction of the streamwise vortices results in an increase in dissipation. To simulate this, the shear-lag equation is modified by introducing an additional source term to the equilibrium shear stress coefficient. The strength of this additional source term is varied over the chord to mimic the downstream decay of the shed vortex circulation. Implementing the source term into XFOIL and RFOIL allows to capture the expected effect of vortex generators on the boundary-layer properties. The source term shape function is prescribed by three parameters: the source term strength, the decay rate and the location of the vortex generators. Because the source term depends on the vortex generator geometry and the local flow properties, its value is calibrated for different airfoil/vortex generator configurations using reference data. Afterwards, these calibrated source terms are related back to the vortex generator parameters and local boundary-layer properties to establish an empirical relation for the source term integral. To do so, a multiple variable linear regression is applied in which the independent variables are the vortex generator height, vortex generator length, inflow angle, local boundary-layer momentum thickness and edge velocity. The source term empirical relation is implemented in XFOIL and RFOIL. Implementing the source term empirical relation led to the development of the foundations of the design tools XFOILVG and RFOILVG. These two codes are extensively validated to evaluate the performance and identify code limitations. Validating the source term empirical relation and its implementation, is realised by comparing the codes’ predictions with reference data from the data base that was already used to set up the source term relation. To further validate the robustness and generality of the code with respect to airfoil selection and Reynolds number, external data sets adopted from literature are used. Based on the validation results, it is believed that the source term approach to model vortex generators within the integral boundary-layer theory is very promising. To further elaborate on this method, recommendations for further work are made. These recommendations concern the data base used to set up the source term empirical relation, the effect of vortex generators on the friction coefficient and the role and value of adding a transition model.","Windenergy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2017-07-01","","","","Aerospace Engineering | Aerodynamics and Wind Energy","",""

The integration of the renewable sources into the low voltage grid requires the grid planning process which involves using the household load profiles with high time resolution (e.g., 15 s). Only a small number of households have smart meters installed and that is why methods for modeling realistic household load profiles with high time resolution are required. There are not a lot of such methods available and all of them require a lot of the data as an input which can be hard to obtain. This thesis is focused on developing a model which can be used for simulating realistic mean load profiles of a small number of households and which does not require any specific data for each household. A mean load profile of 13 households was analyzed and stochastic model based on this analysis was developed. This model allows to generate annual mean load profiles of a different number of households with 15 s time resolution using the Standard Load Profile (SLP) for the region under consideration. By comparing the generated load profiles with the real ones it was concluded that the model is capable to generate realistic mean load profiles of the different number of households.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Applied Mathematics","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","In this thesis, the improvement and extension of the North Sea Storm Atlas is studied. The North Sea Storm Atlas is a new statistical approach for rapid flood forecasting in coastal areas. The method is based on a large database of potential weather scenarios. A detailed hydrodynamic numerical model (WAQUA-in-Simona/DCSM98) has been used to compute the storm surges of all the scenarios. In order to give a quick surge prediction for an upcoming storm event, a smart algorithm is used to compare the weather forecast to the database of weather scenarios. When the best matching scenario is found, the corresponding surge is retrieved as a forecast. In the current North Sea Storm Atlas, the weather patterns are characterized and matched based on the mean sea level pressure. In this research, the setup of an Extended North Sea Storm Atlas is proposed. The goal of the adjustments is to improve the accuracy of the surge predictions and to add predictions of significant wave heights. In order to do so, wind data is introduced in the characterization of the weather scenarios. Hereafter a new database of significant wave heights is built using the ECMWF daily forecast dataset and corresponding Wave Model (WAM) results. The validity of the Extended North Sea Storm Atlas is examined by hindcasting 33 historic storms. The outcomes are compared to hydrodynamic numerical model results at several locations along the North Sea coast. The root mean squared error is used as statistical measure to quantify the error in the 33 peaks of the surge and significant wave height hindcasts. It is concluded that the North Sea Storm Atlas can be used to construct reasonable predictions of the offshore significant wave height, with large time savings compared to real-time modeling. Besides it is found that solely wind as storm characterization does not lead to a structural improvement of the surge or wave predictions. Therefore it is suggested to use a combination of the mean sea level pressure and local wind speed in order to increase the accuracy. In this way the North Sea Storm Atlas will be able to account for both the complete storm system as well as local conditions.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

Coquimbo is a port city approximately 400 km north of Santiago and lies next to La Serena. Coquimbo was recently hit by a tsunami on the 16th of September 2015. Most damage occurred in Coquimbo Bay, which is the scope area of this project. The area consists of a beach, a damaged seawall, wetlands, and the Altamar highrise. Due to the damage caused by the previous tsunami and the poor socioeconomic background of the surrounding neighborhood called Baquedano, the Chilean authorities are planning to redevelop the area. In front of Coquimbo a large seismic gap exists since 1922, which makes the probability of an earthquake and corresponding tsunami in the near future very high. This situation leads to the attention for the project; to find a new and integrated purpose of the project area, enhancing public values and improve the safety concerning a possible future tsunami. Functional aspects for the area as improving the safety against tsunamis, redeveloping the ecology of the wetlands, and increasing the welfare of the neighborhood results into 5 alternatives. With the NEOWAVE software a tsunami generation, propagation and impact is modeled. The bathymetry is modified conformthe different alternatives for the Coquimbo Bay area and a realistic earthquake scenario is chosen to model the inundation depth and flow velocity of the tsunami impact. Inundation maps and flow velocity data measured at important tide gauges provide information about the tsunami impact in the different alternatives. This information is used to assign a score to the safety criteria in the multi criteria analysis. Besides safety, also nature & recreation, welfare of the neighborhood, visual hindrance, infrastructure, construction process, and durability & maintenance are criteria that are assessed from the stakeholders point of view. Based on the score from this multi criteria analysis, the costs of the alternatives and a preference for a multifunctional solution alternative II is chosen as the best integral solution. This alternative includes an elevated coastal road with floodgates to reduce overtopping and to control the return flow of a tsunami. The wetlands are to large extend restored to their former configuration and the dynamic behavior of the wetlands is stimulated. Part of the coastal protection is defined as a multifunctional boulevard. For the remaining part of the coastal area 3 different possibilities are considered: a reflective L-Wall, a ground dam with a natural slope, or a dam of reinforced soil. Using NEOWAVE simulations the economically optimal height of the coastal protection is determined to be 5mfrom sea level. With a coastal protection of this height an average maximum inundation of 2,72 m in the Baquedano area is expected. Besides that, the coastal protection retains the first out of 3 incoming tsunami waves which increases the evacuation time. All options for the configuration of the coastal road are conceptually designed, loaded with tsunami forces and checked for several failure mechanisms. It turns out that horizontal stability and rotational stability are the decisive failure mechanisms. Based on the lowest costs and the highest aesthetic implementation the option with reinforced soil is the best solution. Furthermore the possibility of the Altamar highrise, which is located in the project area, as a vertical evacuation refuge is investigated. A model of the building is created in Etabs using the official structural drawings and information provided by the local authorities. Assumptions on the einforcement ratios and several structural element dimensions are made due to limitations in project time. A non-linear time history analysis for the earthquake loading is performed using amplified records from the September 2015 earthquake. Subsequently the tsunami forces are modeled and applied. A mesh refinement study and alpha-variation study are performed. The alpha factor determines the amount of numerical damping applied to solve the equilibrium equation in the non-linear time history analysis. Due to hardware limitations the mesh refinement study is not finished, but fortunately a value of 0 can be used for alpha which implies no numerical damping is necessary. The obtained model results are evaluated in terms of stability, displacements and story drifts. It is concluded that the Altamar building fulfills the structural demands and remains perfectly stable. With the availability of an additional evacuation building a new evacuation plan for Coquimbo Bay is created. The new coastal protection decreases damage and the probability of loss of life by increasing the evacuation time. New evacuation routes and a smaller inundation in the Baquedano area increase the safety for the area. It is recommended that further investigation should contain multiple tsunami scenarios with a finer grid size and a probabilistic calculation on the damage in the Baquedano area.","","en","student report","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering and Structural Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","In mass storage systems or certain transmission channels, such as optical data storage and non-volatile memory (flash), noise or interference is not the only disturbance during the data transmission, the error performance sometimes can be seriously degraded by the phenomena of unknown channel offset (drift) or gain mismatch, this is because the conventional minimum Euclidean distance decoding, where the receiver picks a codeword from the code book to minimise the Euclidean distance with the received codeword, doesn't offer resistance for the offset and gain mismatch. As a alternative to the minimum Euclidean distance detection, a new distance called Pearson distance and the Pearson-distance-based detection are introduced by Immink and Weber, where the error performance is immune to unknown offset and/or gain mismatch but more sensitive to the noise than the traditional Euclidean distance detection. In addition, the Pearson-distance-based decoding can only productively used for sets of q-ary codewords with some specific properties, which is a new class of code called Pearson code. Therefore, to make the Pearson-distance-based detection more applicable against the channel noise, it is crucial to improve the error control capabilities of Pearson code. In this thesis, we will investigate the performance of different Pearson codes in the Pearson-distance-based detection for offset-only mismatch case and offset-and-gain mismatch case. We will analyze the factors that can reflect or affect the performance of the Pearson code by studying the relations between Pearson distance and Hamming distance. The simulation results will be compared and discussed, the advices for improving the error control capability of the Pearson code will be given according the factors we found.","noise; offset and gain mismatch; performance; error control capacity; Pearson distance; Pearson code","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Intelligent Systems","","","",""

Through a set of examples, it is demonstrated that, in linear elasticity the recovered stresses converge at a higher rate than the directly-calculated stresses and that in some cases the rate of convergence is the same as that of the displacement field. This procedure builds on work of Payen and Bathe. The current technique can be readily implemented into existing finite element codes.

(mentor); Lindenbergh, R.C. (mentor); Abels, H.A. (mentor); Blom, J.C. (mentor)","2016","The traditional approach to studying and characterizing exposed, sedimentary, or layered, rock outcrops has depended on both the experience of the geologist involved and on the accessibility of the rock surfaces themselves. Morphological characterization of an outcrop, such as its layered rock orientation and thicknesses, are features that can be measured by hand or with 3D instrumentation such as a total station or GNSS. However, these methods can be time consuming when the scale of the outcrop is tens of meters large and the tall outcrops themselves block GNSS signal. The terrestrial laser scanner is a device thatmeasures line-of-sight distances to create a 3D point cloud representation of the target, an outcrop in this case. It can collectmillions of points in just minutes with millimeter accuracy. If the same characterization features are to be measured, quantifiable orientation and thicknesses values need to be estimated from this 3D point cloud. A semi-automatic work flow has been developed to extract these values and to represent them in a 3D virtual environment. The work flow contains various algorithm steps for extracting sedimentary layers from an outcrop. The algorithms were developed in Matlab on a 5 x 5 m sample section of the La Charce outcrop, a sedimentary outcrop in the study region with well-defined bedding layers. The local surface normals of the points in this section were calculated, grouped, and then filtered to extract points only belonging to the tops of bedding layers. Planes were fit to these grouped ’top’ points and estimated values for the dip and dip direction (layer orientation) and exposed layer thicknesses were calculated from the planes. Based on hand measurements taken in the field of these same parameters, the algorithms estimated values fall within one standard deviation of orientation field measurements, and may actually be more precise considering a more complete outcrop containing unreachable surfaces was used in the algorithm calculations. Thickness estimates from the field varied greatly (20¡300cm) and are dependent on the exact locations the measurements were taken (algorithm estimates fall within this range, regardless). Close-range three dimensional measurement data from terrestrial laser scanning has proved to provide adequate information for estimating morphological features of rock outcrops. This means that, in addition to traditional field measurements, laser scanning be used to both validate and gain possibly more precise insight to the true geometry of a sedimentary outcrop. It is a relatively fast and simple method that ’brings’ the outcrop back into the laboratory for a repeatable, more detailed analysis. This developed method, fully functional for the La Charce sample outcrop, demonstrates a viable road map for extracting morphological features from 3D point clouds of sedimentary rock outcrops.","morphology; lidar; terrestrial laser scanner; sedimentary outcrop; 3D virtual point cloud; plane detection; dip and strike","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience and Remote Sensing","","","","44.469289, 5.443916"

(mentor); van Wijk, A. (mentor)","2016","The Master's programme Industrial Ecology is jointly organised by Leiden University and Delft University of Technology - An emerging strategy for industry to reduce environmental impact is the utilization of by-products. Steel manufacturer Tata Steel IJmuiden in the Netherlands has identified a large potential source of by-product hydrogen inside a waste stream gas from cokes production, a process that lies at the heart of the steel making process. A possible market for such a novel source is regional hydrogen mobility, which is one of two zero-emission mobility options needed to reach climate goals. However, hydrogen mobility is currently in its infancy, applications are costly and development is complex. Also, alternative sustainable hydrogen sources are inefficient and not competitive with hydrogen produced from fossil sources. This research therefore proposes that by-product hydrogen could be a transitional source of hydrogen during market development of hydrogen mobility. A study in the US found that utilizing by-product hydrogen from the steel industry for hydrogen mobility can result in positive well-to-wheel energy efficiency and environmental gains. The aim of this research is to explore the requirements for developing regional hydrogen mobility with a by-product source of hydrogen from the steel industry. An emerging scientific field that can aid to do so is Industrial Symbiosis, which focuses on revalorization and utilization of by-products. Several models for the development of industrial symbiosis have been proposed, however none have looked into the use by-products for regional mobility development. A steel company can build the necessary technology and infrastructure on its terrain, however a hydrogen mobility market will not form itself. Therefore, in extension to the industrial symbiosis approach, this research uses the cluster approach. It is argued that in a globalising economy, clustering is necessary in order to achieve competitive advantage, an imperative for market development. Clustering focuses on how companies compete, and leads to productivity benefits, innovation benefits and the formation of new businesses, all relevant to the research aim. Based on these concepts, the research question for the thesis was “How can industrial symbiosis of by-product hydrogen from the steel industry contribute to regional hydrogen mobility by cluster development during transition to zero-emission mobility?” First, the question was asked how various scientific concepts of industrial symbiosis and clustering could be combined in order to form a general framework of requirements and related indicators. This framework was then applied to the case study of Tata Steel IJmuiden and the province of Noord Holland. Apart from scientific literature, information was gathered by explorative interviews with experts, attending meetings and studying publications, leading to a broad set of requirements and finally recommendations for the steel company based on a systems perspective. As the concepts of industrial symbiosis and clustering showed overlap, combining them was possible. This allowed for a broad scope for analysis of requirements 5 specifically for by-product hydrogen from the steel industry and hydrogen mobility. Mostly the model showed that cluster development is a complex process requiring not only technology and infrastructure, but additional institutional layers, policies and collaboration. Technologically, realizing a cluster was found to be possible, and by-product hydrogen delivered by the steel company can potentially be economically competitive with other sources, and able to provide at least on third of regional potential hydrogen demand. As a regional cluster approach takes into account all sources, an existing source of hydrogen was found that could be used during initial stages of market development to prevent high initial investment costs related to by-product separation. From an institutional perspective, clustering for hydrogen mobility was found to be currently happening through a National Hydrogen Platform. Currently the platform is in a relatively early stage, and showed clustering is happening on a national level rather than regionally. Importantly, regional policy in Noord Holland was found to be favourable towards zero-mobility, but the province has lost interest in hydrogen. It was found to be mostly up to transportation companies to choose their type of mobility and infrastructure, the province merely sets boundary conditions for zero-emission. Initially, public funding will be needed to finance the obstacles related to market preparation. Creation of an entity or “coalition of the willing” of industry partners is found to be favourable during early stages, which acts as a legal counterpart for the government that shows commitment in return for public funding. Establishment of a network of trust, collaboration and the sharing of knowledge are influential factors, for which public-private partnerships such as so-called ‘Green Deals’ can assist. Building the capacity to mobilize development in such a network may take many years of relationship building and joint production of knowledge. Several drivers are the strategic location of Tata Steel IJmuiden near potential urban markets, Schiphol airport and main highways identified by European initiatives as favourable initial refuelling station locations. Predominantly, this research has provided an overview of the requirements and important factors needed in order to develop such a configuration. It is based on several assumptions, one of which is that energy efficiency and environmental gains could be achieved. An important question remains whether utilizing a by-product from a waste gas stream that originates from a process with coal as a main input is desirable from an environmental perspective during transition to zero-emission mobility, and should be further investigated.","industrial symbiosis; clusters; hydrogen mobility; by-product hydrogen; coke oven gas","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Engineering, Systems and Services","","Industrial Ecology Joint degree Leiden & Delft","",""

Electric machines are largely used as the mean of a propulsion system for all the transportation related application, except for the aircraft where it is used controlling subsystems. For improving the efficiency, reliability, and maintainability in an aircraft, the technological advances in the aerospace industry is moving towards the electrification of onboard services by reducing or removing the presence of the hydraulic, mechanical and air/pneumatic systems. The modular design multiphase machine offers a number of advantages compared to the traditional three-phase machine, in terms of the fault tolerance and reliability in aerospace applications. Modular systems refer to the system which can be decomposed into a number of independent modules or components. This system can have their faulted modules bypassed and continue operation after fault, increasing system availability. Modular design permanent magnet drives are widely selected for aerospace application in the high-performance drive systems, due to their fault tolerant capability, power density, reliability and high efficiency associated with the control possibilities. At first, the modular design of the Permanent Magnet Synchornous Machin and power converter under consideration is explained using literature. Further, application of the modularity to the whole electrical drive system including the control circuit is presented. Subsequently, sensorless field oriented control (FOC) was implemented in the three phases of the machine using the inbuilt InstaSPIN FOC algorithm in microcontroller device. The control technique is later extended from three phase to six phase machine.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Electrical Sustainable Energy","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","Numerous structures constructed in 60’s and 70’s are now reaching their design service life and require reassessment to assure safety of users, reliability and economical exploitation. As a consequence, an adequate structural assessment of existing bridges has recently become a major subject of scientiﬁc work commissioned by the authorities in charge. The bridges designed according to then biding codes are often deemed to be structurally deﬁcient when re-evaluated with more restricting current design provisions. At the same time, it is often in conﬂict with the reality as many of the structures still continue in operation displaying no perceptible deterioration of state nor fatigue. The challenge therefore is to develop more reﬁned models to evaluate the structural behaviour and possible reserves of capacity accounting for the actual condition of the bridge under investigation. One of the potential deﬁciencies is related to the shear tension failure in thin-webbed post- tensioned T-girders which is the item of the this dissertation. The study comprises of two major parts. In the ﬁrst part, the thesis investigates an ability of the shear provisions for reinforced concrete structures as given in the following codes: Canadian Standard Association (CSA), the ﬁb Model Concrete 2010 (MC2010), the Eurocode 2 (EC2) and the RBK 1.1 (Richtlijnen Beoordeling Kunstwerken) to adequately address shear tension critical members. The predictions from codes are calculated for the three selected benchmark continuous I- beams tested in destructive laboratory tests as a part of the research on the inﬂuence of axial load and prestress on the shear strength of web-shear critical reinforced concrete elements at the University of Toronto. Out of three selected beams of interest subjected to approximately the same prestressing force, two contained a varying amount of reinforcement equal to twice and four times the minimum amount shear reinforcement as speciﬁed by the CSA code and one containing no stirrups in the test region. From the comparison of codes it was concluded that shear previsions relating shear resistance to the strain state of the considered section (CSA and MC2010) provide good predictions for members furnished with stirrups but inaccurately evaluate shear resistance for members without shear reinforcement being overly conservative. For this case, the empirical formulation according to the EC2 with mean characteristics applied resulted in the best estimate. In the second part of the study, an attempt to reproduce the tests of the benchmark beams numerically was undertaken. The simulation according to the highest level of approximation as classiﬁed in the MC2010 was performed through a series of nonlinear ﬁnite element analyses. Sensitivity analyses with the diverse variables such as: crack models, shear retention functions, iterative methods and convergence norms were studied to determine their inﬂuence on the ultimate shear strength and competence to recreate the observed in tests performance; i.e. the failure mechanism and crack pattern. From the conducted analyses, it was concluded that satisfactory crack pattern as well as magnitudes of shear resistance can be obtained for all treated specimens. The thesis was completed with considerations regarding the most appropriately performing constitutive model to simulate shear tension failure mechanism for the cases of benchmark tests. For the considered cases of shear tension critical beams, models with the rotating crack, energy convergence norm in combination with force or displacement convergence norm and the modiﬁed Newton-Raphson iterative method are recommended.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","Concrete Structures","",""

(mentor)","2016","The main goal in this research is to predict how translation waves evolve in a canal and what the consequences for the workability of water-borne construction equipment are. Translation waves arise due to filling and emptying of lock systems. In this research the measures to reduce effects of translation waves are control options related to the lock complex only. Adaptations to the water-borne construction equipment or to the bathymetry of the canal are excluded from this research. Currents induced by other external factors than translation waves induced by the lock complex, are not investigated. The research is applied to a case study, the Juliana Canal. Construction works are performed to make the canal attainable for vessels of CEMT-class Vb. To predict the adaptations of water level changes and currents due to translation waves a 1D-model is developed. In the model, theory from Thijsse (Thijsse, 1935) on the development of a translation wave is applied and extended on more complex discharge extractions from the canal. The propagating and reflecting waves through the canal are calculated. The bathymetry of the canal-system determines the transition points and reflections. To obtain a good representation of the translation wave in this canal, a set of 42 reflections were included in this model. If the currents in the canal become too large, unworkable construction situations arise resulting in downtime. Two control options can be done at the locks. The first option is regulating the magnitude of the discharge to fill the lock chamber. This is done by defining the number of culverts used during filling. Four scenarios are investigated, with: 2, 1 or 4 culverts used and with 2 chambers filled simultaneously. The second option is to vary the time between sequent fillings. Six scenarios for this option are investigated, with: 5, 10 and 15 minutes between subsequent waves, chambers filled with 1 or 2 culverts. None of the investigated scenarios result in no downtime but the downtime can be reduced significantly. The most favourable scenario from the first group of control options, vary between 1, 2 and 4 culverts, depending on the location. Simultaneous filling should always be avoided. In the second group of control options, the scenario where the lock chamber is filled with one culvert and 15 minutes between sequent waves, results at 4 of the 5 locations in the least downtime. At the other location the best option is the scenario where the chamber is filled with 2 culverts and also 15 minutes between the waves. There is not a scenario that is the best scenario for all locations along the canal. The resulting water level change and current are the summation of the original wave and reflection waves. The reflection waves are created by e.g. reflections at a port or changes in the width of the canal. The distance of the construction location to these transition points determine which reflections, and with what magnitude, are at that specific location. This makes the net water level change and net current very location dependent. For each location the model has to be run with different scenarios. Concluding, the model gives a good representation of the situation in reality, for the modelled locations in canal. For future projects, the model can relatively easy be adapted to another canal-system by changing the bathymetry, lock discharges and transition points. The model is applicable to gain insights of a system for designs. It can be used as a decision tool during construction works as well due to the short calculation period. The use of this model can forecast the working conditions and limit the downtime.","high head lock systems; locks; translation waves; Juliana Canal; currents","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-11-16","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Ooms, G. (mentor); Pourquie, M.J.B.M. (mentor)","2016","A study has been performed on the effects of the viscosity of the liquid in the core of core annular flow. This is a multiphase flow regime for two immiscible liquids in a pipe where the high-viscosity liquid forms a core and the other low-viscosity liquid forms a lubricating annulus around the core and along the wall. This is a very efficient method to transport oil. Another method is to heat the oil to reduce its viscosity prior to use in single phase transport. The advantage of combining these two methods is discussed in this thesis. First, two dimensional, axisymmetric numerical simulations using the OpenFOAM VoF solver have been performed based on previously performed experiments in vertical pipes. Periodic boundary conditions have been imposed in all the simulations under laminar conditions. The choice of the oil-water viscosity ratio is shown to influence the interfacial wave profile and the oil throughput. The highest throughput is achieved at an intermediate viscosity ratio. Simulations are also performed with a temperature gradient between the pipe wall and the oil which now has a temperature dependent viscosity. Multiple solutions are observed in some of the simulations when the conductivity is increased, which gives a relatively fast evolution to the final isothermal state. The causes for these multiple states have been investigated. It is concluded that the domain length and the initialization of the velocity profile influence the results. Next, the study has been extended to core annular flow in horizontal pipes. Experiments have been performed in which the oil has been heated to temperatures as high as 50 C to reduce its viscosity. The pressure drop that was measured along a 1 m section of the pipe shows a small dependence on the oil viscosity, for fixed oil and water flow rates. Images from the footage recorded for these experiments show how the interface waves and the levitation mechanism are affected when the oil viscosity is decreased. Three dimensional numerical simulations based on the experiments have been performed employing the Launder Sharma k-e turbulence model. Periodic boundaries are used to study the development of the flow. The pressure drop measured in the experiments is imposed in these simulations to study the effect of changing the viscosity. The oil holdup fraction is also imposed in the simulations. At high viscosity, deviations are found between the simulation results and the experiments in terms of the wave profiles and the resulting oil and water flow rates. For the lowest viscosity, the simulations show that the oil core will foul the upper wall of the pipe whereas the experiments show core annular flow with oil droplets. Simulations in which the experimental flow rate is imposed do not improve the results. The main conclusion from this study is that in horizontal pipes, core annular flows are more stable when the oil-water viscosity ratios are high.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Process and Energy","","","",""

In this project, an algorithm was developed to retrieve tropospheric NO2 vertical column densities from Spectrolite spectral observations during the AROMAPEX campaign in Berlin on 21 April, 2016. We applyDifferentialOptical Absorption Spectroscopy (DOAS) approach to obtain differential slant column densities (dSCDs) from spectral measurements. Afterwards, a look-up table which contains radiances output as function of various parameters was derived from radiative transfer model to compute air mass factors (AMFs). However, since we do not know the surface reflectance during the measurements, Landsat observations over a homogeneous region are utilized for vicarious calibration of radiances and this allows us to retrieve surface reflectance needed for AMF calculations. Subsequently, OMI data is used in order to determine tropospheric background and to correct for effects related to stratospheric NO2. Results of the dSCD retrieval show a pronounced NO2 plume over Berlin stretching out from West to East over the city. Several hot spots can be observed and related to emission sources on the ground. They also acquire a good correspondence with the dSCDs retrieved by other instruments (AirMap, SWING) at the same time during the campaign and therefore give much confidence for the future development at TNO. In order to obtain VCDs, AMFs were derived using complementary observations for some parameters (e.g. aerosol optical). Sensitivity studies were performed to assess the impact on the retrieval accuracy of other parameters. It can come to a conclusion that aerosol and NO2 vertical profiles are very essential to the VCD retrieval and need to be more well-defined in order to provide precise VCD results in absolutemagnitude.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience and Remote Sensing","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","Due to the increasing seaborne trade, shortage of officers, constant work of crew on machinery during voyage and the large contribution of human error to shipping accidents it is time for shipbuilding to take the next step in automation. Unmanned shipping is the way to move forward and since the engine room houses some of the most important machinery in the ship, this is the equipment which has to be made more reliable first. Improving the reliability of ship machinery is the goal of this thesis, and this will be done for ship types with a simple design and relatively simple equipment, namely general cargo ships, container ships, bulk carriers and oil and chemical tankers. In order to increase the reliability of the machinery, it will first have to be determined which failures occur to the machinery. The main engine, steering gear, fuel system, electrical system, cooling water system, diesel generator, shafting and other have all been found to be responsible for fatal technical failures in the past. Since these first five systems are responsible for the largest part of the failures, the focus of this thesis will be on these systems. These systems are crucial for the actual sailing of the ship, so making these systems more reliable makes great effort regarding unmanned sailing. With the failures known, solutions have been developed for each individual failure. These solutions should have an equal or higher reliability compared to the initial solution. For the found solutions it can then be determined what their reliability improvement is. Determining the reliability improvement is done by knowing the failure rate of the machinery, which has also been determined. A list can then be made to determine which solutions provide the most reliability improvement. The cost of the best solutions is calculated next. In order for the unmanned ship to sail the oceans in the near future, it has to be financially competitive to the manned ship. When looking at the causes of the failures it was found that human error and improper maintenance are both responsible for almost 20% of the failures. Performing better maintenance was though not found to realize much reliability improvement, just as an alternative solution was not found to realize much reliability improvement. Solving the maintenance related failures or choosing an alternative system is thus not the best solution to the failures. The best type of solution was found to be a type of redundancy. Solutions to the main engine failures, steering gear failures and fuel system failures were found to achieve the most reliability improvement. This was to be expected since these systems are also responsible for the highest number of failures. When making a ship unmanned, equipment such as accommodation, fresh water systems, HVAC and others do not have to be installed. Money that does not have to be spend on this equipment is the budget for the reliability solutions. The cost of the three solutions with the most reliability improvement was found to fit perfectly within the budget that is available. It can thus be concluded that it is possible to increase the reliability of ship machinery while staying financially competitive to the manned ship. Budget is then also still available to pay for other systems that are needed for unmanned shipping. Redundancy was found as being the best type of solution. If all the best solutions are applied, the machinery would have a mean time between failures of nine years. Finding solutions to the diesel generator failures, shafting failures and other failures is needed to increase the reliability even further. In order to improve the reliability of the machinery even further, more detailed failure data has to be known. Of half of the failures there is currently not enough information. Better knowledge of the failure distribution will help to determine better solutions. It also helps to know to what ship types these failures occurred to. Failures in redundant systems are not within the failure data. Having this data really helps to get a better view of the problem. Knowing what failures the crew prevents during operation and knowing more precisely which failures they induce also helps to get more detailed knowledge of the machinery failures. If better failure data is available, a more detailed failure rate can be determined. When it also known which level of reliability is required, the more detailed failure rate can be used to determine whether this level of reliability can be reached. The here named advises would though all require extra research and are therefore recommendations for future work.","reliability; unmanned; machinery failures; fault tree","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2016-11-16","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Marine and Transport Technology","","Ship Design, Production and Operations","",""

The viability and diversity of corridors in the city structure is recognized. Corridors form the backbone of the urban structure that connects other spatial elements in the overarching urban environment. The conclusion highlights design guidelines for the spatial framework of corridors in a city to be able to adapt to vivaciously changing urban environments today.

(mentor); Gangoli Rao, A. (mentor)","2016","The effect of aviation emissions on human-induced climate change has become a major concern in the last decades. The reduction of emissions, such as CO2 and NOx, is an important matter because of the predicted increase of the aviation market in the future years. The application of alternative fuels, such as hydrogen, and new combustion methods (e.g. lean premixed) are two of the main trends in order to reduce civil aviation emissions. The AHEAD (Advanced Hybrid Engines for Aircraft Development) project presented a novel hybrid engine concept. The proposed innovative design uses two combustion chambers. The first is a cryogenic fuel combustor, conceived to operate with liquid hydrogen or liquid natural gas, followed by an inter-turbine flameless biofuel combustor. In the present thesis, the lean premixed hydrogen combustor designed in the AHEAD project was simulated by applying a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) method. The main objective of the present study is to find a set of CFD models which better characterize the named combustor, using exclusively the RANS (Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes) approach. Both a reactive and non-reactive approaches were followed. The results obtained were analysed and compared with experimental data. The RANS k-ε realizable turbulence model provided satisfactory qualitative results for the non-reactive case. The model predicted the characteristic features of the flow field obtained at swirling premixed combustors, such as the central and outer recirculation zones, the vortex breackdown, etc. The reactive flow field was not well characterized by the selected combustion models (e.g. Flamelet-Generated Manifold, Eddy Dissipation Concept). The main problem was found to be the mixing pattern predicted by the set of models used in the study. The RANS turbulence models applied were not accurate enough to obtain a satisfactory hydrogen-air distribution at the mixing area of the combustor. Further analysis is advised, adding a more detailed CFD approach such as the Large Eddy Simulation.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Flight Performance and Propulsion","","","009#16#MT#FPP",""

The existing method combines physical- and geometry-based methods. The improved method uses a physically based method to calculated internal energy after an impact and uses the energy as a weight function to fracture the object. The splitting of the object follows a Weighted Centroidal Voronoi Tessellation. A tetrahedral geometry is generated for the physically based calculations and from that a graph structure is built. The weights calculated are located to the edges of the graph. The Voronoi cells are generated using a path finding algorithm on the weighted graph. The advantage of this approach is that the Centroidal Voronoi diagrams takes less cycles to minimize than a previous technique used in an article by Schvartzman and Otaduy[SO2014]. However the resulting Voronoi cells are an approximation of the real Voronoi cells. Two methods have been developed to split the object after the Voronoi cells are generated. The result of the improved method is a fast destruction method using impact location, direction and force to split the object into pieces. The material properties of the objects are limited to linear elastic, brittle behaviour.","Real time destruction; Voronoi Diagrams; Unreal Engine; Gaming","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Intelligent Systems","","Comp Graphics & Visualisation","",""

Through this study, the 7- by 10-Foot Wind Tunnel experiments of the Large Civil Tilt Rotor (LCTR) at NASA Ames Research Center will be validated using CFD. The CFD tool, RotCFD, that will be used for this study is developed in corporation with The Aeromechanics Branch at NASA Ames Research Center. RotCFD is a RANS solver wherein the fluid flow is governed by the incompressible, laminar Navier-Stokes equations, and a k-ɛ turbulence model. The current blockage study investigates the effect of the blockage generated by the test hardware on the walls by comparing CFD predictions of the LCTR2 model with and without wind tunnel walls to the wind tunnel test data. Furthermore, attention is paid to the side wall pressure distributions due to a large blockage in the tunnel (particularly at yaw angles approaching 20 deg.). Also, a comparison is made between the pressures measured at the pressure ring locations in the settling chamber upstream of the test section for blockage effects. To investigate this problem, a simplified geometry is analyzed for blockage effects in order to see if these different geometries can represent the LCTR as a simplified case to reduce computational time and obtain a quick understanding of tunnel blockage effects. The focus of this research will be to understand the limitations and accuracy of the recent small-scale Large Civil Tilt Rotor (LCTR) wind tunnel test campaigns.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

(mentor)","2016","Over the last few years machine learning has become popular among businesses. The insights and predictions given by the classifiers can help people make better decisions. The field of machine learning research is also highly active. Researchers frequently come up with clever tweaks or improvements that increase the accuracy of certain classifiers. However, there is a big imbalance in research topics within the field. On the one hand there is a lot of research on designing or improving machine learning algorithms. On the other hand there is very little research on how these algorithms are actually applied in practice. One of the difficulties that people encounter when applying classifiers in practice is the complexity. With each improvement the existing classifier becomes more difficult to understand, turning the classifier into a black box where the user only understands the in- and output. How it exactly computes the output is often too difficult to fully understand. This makes it harder for users to interpret and less suitable for knowledge extraction, especially for non-technical people. Based on the very little amount of behavioural studies on applying machine learning in practice, this thesis aims to get more insights into how people, especially non-technical people, think of machine learning based solutions and which factors influence their acceptance. Our study starts by designing classifiers that are able to predict outdated payment cards with high accuracy. After that, we found that both feature importance and rule-based approaches helped users in gaining a general understanding of the classifier. However, understanding the classifier was not as important as the conviction that the machine learning based solution was really better than the current solution.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-11-15","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Intelligent Systems","","Pattern Recognition and Bioinformatics","",""

(mentor); van der Vorst, R.R.R. (mentor)","2016","The identified problem KLM has, is a knowledge gap between KLM employees in middle and higher management and KLM’s frontline staff (FLS). New ideas or processes are created at KLM’s headquarters by ‘thinkers’, while these new ideas or processes need to be executed and iterated by front live staff, ‘do-ers’. By involving startups in their innovation process, KLM has an neutral third party who helps bridging the gap between idea and implementation: something that startups do everyday by nature: iterate. Currently startups are already embraced within KLM (e.g. challenges, pitching events, demo’s), but after the selection procedure there is no dedicated way of facilitating them for a pilot, collaboration or partnership. Until now, KLM has never organised a test flight where they invite startups to test their products. This research aims to co-design this way of working together with the end-users of the service: cabin crew, startups from the Bay Area and the passenger. By answering the question “How to facilitate these X-Flights best, within KLM’s existing flights?”, a small step is taken towards answering the bigger question: “How can KLM learn from startups to adapt their mind-set?”. solution X-flights is a project from KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, with the aim to facilitate test flights on regular flights real time, with real passengers. The objective of X-Flights is to facilitate both internal as external idea owners, and therefore make testing innovations, either process or product, during dedicated test flights easier and less bureaucratic. The aim of this thesis is to create a way of working for startups, cabin crew and passengers to test during flights and therefore add value to the passengers experience. First, a network of startups in San Francisco was created to invite for the test flight. Then, a baseline research has been done to observe the current way of working how partner airline Air France facilitates startups during test flights at the moment. From the observations and interviews made during this test flight, 4 clusters (Logistics, Communication, User and Timing) were made as a starting point for the next phase. The next step in the design process was to facilitate a 5-day co-design sprint together with a San Francisco-based startups, KLM cabin crew members and passengers. This co-design sprint was facilitated involving 2 X-Flights: from San Francisco to Amsterdam and back. The sprint consists of 5 phases: Align, Ideate, Prototype, Test and Evaluate. Using a framework to assess all criteria made before or during the sprint, conclusions can be drawn on how to facilitate test flights best. This gives KLM an overview of the assumptions, observed current state of facilitating, the desired way of working for all actors and how the tests were going. Finally, giving 7 recommendations for future test flights. Outcomes of the test flights were measured qualitative (Air France test flight) and quantitative (KLM X-Flights). Measuring the outcome focussed on the 4 clusters mentioned before, and for the passenger also on the added value to their experience. Results from the surveys show that passengers see an added value to their customer experience in testing during flights. It also shows that when communication is good to cabin crew and logistics planned well, cabin crew doesn’t experience interference with their regular tasks. The 7 recommendations given for KLM X-Flights in the final visual advice are: 1. Train a KLM Product Genius 2. Test in business class 3 . Sensitize the cabin crew 4. Provide a visual time line 5.

By exploring future images and scenarios the project seeks to support social and ecological integration. At a larger scale, the valley section (P. Geddes 1909) and the two network theory (S. Tjallingii 2005) inspire the definition of the valley system as a complex carrying structure for the territorial project. A new system of relations is designed upon the common grounds between Craiova city and its sorrounding natural and rural lands, territories placed within the fragmented land of Jiu River Valley. The project explores the definition of territory through precedent projects and elements that define it: the limit, the core and the main systems in relation to limits and cores. Existing networks and structures are re-used to scaffold (Forgaci, Alexandrescu, Ionescu 2016) a common territory and a new system of relations between Craiova city, natural lands and rural units. The limits and the trajectories to the cores are used to settle the scaffold. The condition of limits is gradually discovered from an administrative, morphological and topological perspective. Limits cummulate drosscapes (Berger 2006) and they are discovered as porous and permeable lands (B. Secchi and P. Viganò). By designing on limits and trajectories to the core, a polycentric model is ecouranged, consolidating local identity as well as exchange. The limits become themselves a scaffold to regenerate the cores. Three principles guide the construction of the scaffolding on site: porosity, permeability and correspondence. The research by design uses a gradient of scales, while the project is finally revealed at three main scales: the valley scale, the image scale and the project scale. This thesis set two main outcomes: to explore common grounds between practice and theories regarding territorial projects and thus by setting this provocation, to provide a grounded design strategy, which would support social and ecological integration.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2016-11-21","Architecture and The Built Environment","Urbanism","","","",""

The superyacht business has grown along and the number of superyacht builders has increased. In previous decades, potential customers were queuing for their superyacht to be build. The result was that yacht builders were able to set the price of a yacht. Nowadays there is much more competition amongst superyacht builders and therefore it is harder to sell yachts. The increased competition has introduced significant price negotiations in the world of superyachts. As yard it is important to estimate the costs of a superyacht early on in the sales process, to be able to negotiate healthy and realistic prices with a customer. Due to the inherent customization of superyachts estimating the costs is challenging as there are many unknowns during the estimation and it is time consuming. Currently there are no tools existing, that help yards estimate the costs of a superyacht in the early phases. Therefore, the research objective of this thesis has been: to develop an accurate cost estimation tool in order to help designers and yards with the newbuilding cost estimations of superyachts during the design phase. At the beginning of this design phase, almost all characteristics of the superyacht are unknown. At the end of this phase brief specifications are known which contains several main yacht characteristics. During the phases after design, the tool should function as a basis. The maximum allowed inaccuracy of the cost estimations during the design phase is 15 percent, but of course a higher accuracy is pursued. The defined research objective has led to the main research question: how to develop this cost estimation tool?","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Marine and Transport Technology","","Marine Technology","",""

Bicycles are usually purchased in a jam–packed store with a dirty workshop at the back. Favorit, a Czech manufacturer of premium bicycles, has decided to pioneer a bicycle showroom. ‘What should such a showroom look like?’ ‘What kind of experiences should it provide for visitors?’ These were the underlying questions of this project that are detailed in five main chapters. The first chapter, Analysis, focuses on the internal situation at Favorit and the external context. It reveals Favorit’s marketing strategy and the fact that the current purchasing process mixes online and offline steps, making it complex. As far as the profile of current Czech customers is concerned, these are job-wise successful people in the upper socio-economic class. Observations of customers were conducted at a Favorit store in Prague. The external context was studied for three target markets – the USA, Australia and the UK, which were preselected by Favorit. Based on the results, a recommendation is made to enter the UK bicycle market, more specifically the City of London. The second chapter, Conceptualization, covers the creative process of developing two advanced interior concepts envisioned for 2021 (five years ahead). The concepts are designed to respond to two relevant changes in the future. Firstly, business will become digitalized and less geographically dependent, thus competition and flexibility will grow. Secondly, private life and free time will be spent differently as well. Some people will gladly embrace a digital layer over the physical world while others will tend to avoid it and turn to nature for relaxation. These are the two experiential directions embedded in the concepts. The concepts were later tested on potential English customers as well as Favorit employees to arrive at a set of the best and most relevant interior features to serve as a foundation for a detailed proposal. The third chapter, Detailed Design, comprises a synthesis of selected features into a coherent interior proposal. The customer’s journey starts at the front of the showroom where his attention is drawn by sounds of nature, creating a distinctive contrast to the hectic sounds of urban life. In other words, this feature evokes an oasis in the desert to them. The entire interior was tested again and the results showed significant improvements. Favorit bicycles are the focus points inside the showroom. An innovative bike stand was developed to highlight them. The bike stand enhances interaction between the product, customer and sales assistant. Customers are encouraged to experience unique features of the bicycles such as automated lights and carbon drive belt, and to try their hand at peddling, shifting and braking, which creates a certain emotional bond with the bicycle. As a result, this hands-on exploration of the bicycles increases chances for a purchase. The fourth chapter, Embodiment, is devoted to developing a bike stand mechanism that can facilitate the interaction mentioned above. An iterative approach was adopted for prototyping that altered between two phases, a building plus improvement phase and a testing phase. The first version of the mechanism proved the concept idea to be feasible. The third variant worked as intended but some minor issues occurred. These were improved in the next step. The last prototype performed well and the aesthetics were improved. The last chapter, Discussion, presents a set of recommendations for implementing the designed interior and further developing a successful mechanism. Additionally, a summary reflection on this project is presented.","bicycle; showroom; retail; interior","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Integrated Product Design","",""

It has been demonstrated that in large wind farms the only source of kinetic energy to balance that extracted by the turbines is the vertical transport of the free-stream flow kinetic energy from above the wind-turbine canopy. This chapter explores the possibility to enhance such process by introducing tethered kites in steady flight within a small wind-turbine array. In a first step, an array of four wind turbines, aligned with the streamwise velocity component, is simulated within the Large Eddy Simulation framework. The turbines are placed in a pre-generated turbulent atmospheric boundary layer and modelled as actuator discs with both axial and tangential inductions, to account for the wake rotation. The main part of the study considers an identical wind turbine configuration with kites suspended half the inter-turbine spacing distance. The kites are modeled as body forces on the flow, equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the vector sum of the lift and drag forces acting on the kite surfaces. A qualitative comparison of the mean flow statistics, before and after the introduction of the kites is presented.","Windenergy; Kites; LES; Kinetic Energy Entrainment; Wind Farms","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Aerodynamics, Wind Energy & Propulsion","","Wind Energy","",""

(mentor); Zhao, W. (mentor)","2016","With the increase of air traffic demand, the terminal airspace becomes more and more congested. Future air transport systems are expected to handle increasingly heavy demand on air traffic, especially in a highly constrained terminal airspace. Therefore, the realizable capacity of current terminal airspace is a challenge for future air transport development. The objective of this thesis is to understand and identify the system vulnerability of congested terminal airspace, and then optimize aircraft landing sequence and runway allocation in order to maximize the TMA capacity and minimize delay. Thereby an algorithm for optimal arrival flight sequencing and runway assignment in a terminal airspace has been proposed. In this project, the optimization scheme selected to tackle this problem is genetic algorithm. Genetic algorithm is a problem solving system based on principles of evolution and heredity. It consists of an iterative procedure to identify and preserve the candidate solutions with higher fitness, as well as generating new possible candidates through chromosome operations. After a reasonable time of iteration, a feasible optimal solution will be generated. As demonstrated in this thesis, genetic algorithm is well adapted for resolving the congestion of terminal air traffic. The outcome of this optimization scheme is only the assignment of each aircraft with a respective landing time and runway, however it does not provide instructions on how aircraft can achieve this in real-world actions. Although the separation limits are in force for the initial positing and landing sequence of aircraft, there exist a risk that the separation limit may be violated during the periods in between. Therefore this is one of the major motivations to design a simulation scheme and incorporate speed adjustment and holding within it. In daily operations, altering the airspeed is a common tool that air traffic controllers used to achieve the desired arriving time of the aircraft. Hence, it is considered as the primary means of aircraft adjustment in the simulation. To visualize the optimization result and adapt for realistic situations, a dynamic simulation was designed. The fundamental logic of the dynamic simulation is to incorporate a quick optimization scheme into the simulation loop. As a result, the computational performance will be significantly improved; bring it closer to be implemented in the real world air traffic control dynamic environment. In this thesis, the proposed optimization scheme and simulation design is validated by using the arrival routes of Hong Kong International Airport. Accordingly, the genetic algorithm based optimization design is capable of generating a rather optimum landing sequence and runway allocation with minimal computation time. Therefore, the proposed scheme may be implemented into the real world air traffic control procedure to fill the void left in strategic decision making during high workload periods. This is not only crucial to efficient air traffic management, but also a cost effective solution to deal with the increasing flight demands.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Control & Operations","","","",""

(mentor); Van Oosterom, P. (mentor)","2016","Vario-scale data structures make it possible to derive maps at arbitrary scale. When requesting a map, data has to be transferred from server to client. This takes time, which affects the responsiveness of the system, and sometimes costs can be involved for every byte that is send over the network. Redundant data transfers should thus be avoided. Having vario-scale data, the opportunity arises to reuse data already present on the client and retrieve only the missing data from the server when requesting a new map. This thesis explores if a generic data driven spatial access method can be used for this purpose, while keeping the service scalable and responsive. The research shows that there is no ready-made solution available that can facilitate in reaching this goal, but that the Hilbert R-tree is suited to be used as a starting point. Like the generic Hilbert R-tree, an index is build using a space filling curve. However, instead of indexing individual objects, an index is made based on a set of objects. The objects are grouped together into packages based on spatial proximity and level of detail. Using the index, a client can request these packages over the network. The newly suggested method makes it possible to utilize client side processing for constructing vario-scale maps and thereby use the client cache to reuse already received responses. The results show that the efficiency of data communication and the responsiveness of the client can improve for an average user scenario. This is shown with the use of a prototype. Furthermore, the method is generic for the way in which data is retrieved by a client from the server. Therefore, the hypothesis is that the method can also facilitate communication for other use cases with higher dimensional data such as 4D point clouds. It is expected that communication can be similar as with vario-scale data, and that only the filter and visualization steps are different.","Vario-scale data; Vario-scale maps; Spatial access methods; Client-server architecture; Caching","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","OTB","","Geomatics for the Built Environment","",""

The project places focus on what things do, how they are formed, how they could be otherwise - to examine that which precedes the division of the world into objects, places, selves, things, etc. In this way it attempts to address the question: how could landscapes actively meet concerns of our social reality today? More specifically, the project deals with disturbed sites and a specific site of interest - Fort de Vaujours, an abandoned nuclear area near Paris. The basis of the project is the theoretical research on disturbed sites through the examination of the concept of territory and ‘the unfamiliar’ which focuses on territorology, a general science of territory as developed by Andrea Mubi Brighenti.","landscape; territory; disturbed sites; specificity; affect","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Landscape Architecture","","ExploreLab","",""

They are able to improve the air quality, the insulation values or social and psychological benefits. The aim of this Thesis is to increase the application of living wall systems by designing a living wall system with the principles of modularity, which should decrease the two biggest disadvantages of living wall systems: the high production cost and the high amount of maintenance. To reach this goal it is important to channel both knowledge about modularity and vertical green. For modularity this means understanding the principles: designing with repeating components, designing for prefabrication, designing for disassembly and designing for a catalogue. In the next step various connections are listed which can be used when designing for disassembly, along with types of façades and building references which apply the use of the principles of modularity. As for vertical green, a clear typology can be seen. Vertical green can be divided into green façades, wall vegetation and living wall systems. Living wall systems can be based on planter boxes, panel systems (of which some use mineral wool) and on felt layers. A history is provided of vertical green, along with a detailed explanation about the advantages and disadvantages of placing of vertical green on a building. All of these advantages are researched to find out if they can be improved with the means of modularity. These advantages are a first step into the world of innovations that could be used when designing a new living wall system, together with an insight into new innovations regarding modularity. The main research of this report is an analysis of all the living wall systems on the current Dutch market. These systems are explained in their way of working and are separated into components and materials. A conclusion is made about the separability and reusability of the components, as well as the circularity of the materials, along with general data, such as weight, water consumption and lifespan. This information is later used in a Harris profile that defines the type of living wall system that’s best for the design requirements. The design requirements have been determined by researching the context of a location where this living wall system can be installed; the Europoint-complex in Rotterdam. The Harris profile makes clear that planter box can best be used due to their low water consumption, high lifespan and their fit for circular design. In the end a planter box system is designed which can easily be removed from the building skin and replaced by means of modularity, which decreases the maintenance. It has even been adapted so it can be transported by drones, so no persons have to climb up a building. Planter boxes that are recovered from the building can be reused or recycled thanks to the circular design. By designing the system in such a way that it can function as the outer layer of a building, it also decreases the building costs. Finally, the system receives three add-ons, which use innovations to increase the effect certain benefits of living wall systems. These add-ons are part of a design catalogue, which helps the system to be applicable on other locations than the Europoint-complex, depending on the design problems at hand.","modularity; vertical green; urban green; living wall systems; prefabrication; design; catalogue; planter box","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Building Technology","","","",""

(mentor); Stolk, E.H. (mentor)","2016","The motivation for this thesis emerged from my growing questions on the architecture practice. My interest for the collectives and its respective dissemination in the past years were the starting point for this study. Through a long and tortuous way, the research has grown into a complex project. The project touches upon topics of social democracy, political issues, economics, spatial planning and governance. The city of São Paulo is socially and urbanely unbalanced. Three factors contributed to the unbalance: The fast disorderly growth of the city, the impacts of a complex governance structure for city development, and the planning tradition that still presents difficulty in implementing the proposed guidelines. All these elements are related to the theories exhaustively researched; the spatial justice, the right to city, open source architecture and the new economical devices have formed the foundation for my spatial design in a contested area of downtown São Paulo. Therefore, this thesis presents itself as an experimental process to include participation in urban development. The specific area of Largo do Arouche in downtown São Paulo was chosen as the test site in order to achieve more tangible results within participation and the issue of implementation. The design choices were based on the Municipal Master Plan and on the input of theoreticians and practitioners I gathered through the research. The visions presented as final design react to the municipal plan showing the possible short-term changes in the local scale. Finally, the main idea of my project is to create an open space for citizens to interact and intervene in order to co-create and to transform their own space of conviviality. This will encourage coexistence and the establishment of new bonds within the community. The proposed interventions are intended to make the space more democratic, inclusive and civic.","Participation; Right to the city; Spatial Justice; Governance; Implementation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Urbanism","","Urbanism and Building","",""

(mentor); Ottelé, M. (mentor)","2016","The presence of vegetation has proven to increase peoples well-being and has multiple other benefits. Unfortunately, there is a lack of green in urban areas. Three solutions exist which could reintroduce green in cities and have a low footprint: green roofs, green facades and living wall system. Living wall systems are visible from street level and are more effective than green facades with regard to their benefits. However, living wall systems are not yet largely implemented in the Netherlands. They have a relatively high installation and maintenance costs. Additionally, there is an unused potential of multi-functionality. This report considers the design of a living wall system which integrates a constructed wetland in order to separate, filter and reuse both suitable and valuable wastewater streams exiting a utility building. The design is applied at the WestCord hotel in Delft. The hotel’s water consumption amounts 20,239 L/day, the maximum that could be saved by the water filtering facade. However, the production of drinking water is not yet attainable, due to high investments in continuous monitoring of the effluent demanded by law. The façade will only produce water for toilet flushing and showering, as these two functions provide substantial savings. The fulfil this demand, the façade should therefore have a capacity of 15,715 L/day. Of which 12,101 L/day should come from greywater without food particles and 3,614 L/day of stormwater roof runoff. These sources contain the least organic load. A constructed wetland should consist of distribution, filtration and drainage zone. The most important factors for good constructed wetland design are: high efficiency by a long hydraulic retention time (e.g. by shallow slope, small grain size, low influent velocity, recirculation) and by creating an ideal environment for microorganism development (e.g. by large surface area, the presence of both oxic and anoxic conditions), a large capacity (e.g. by large volume, steep slope, large grain size), prevention of clogging, organic- and hydraulic overload. A constructed wetland is one step of an individual purification system (secondary treatment). The greywater should be pre-treated by a degreaser, the stormwater by a leaf and coarse particle filter. Post treatment for use in shower is desired, this is done by an RO system. The effluent water from the water filtering façade can however be used directly for toilet flushing. To determine the construction for the Living Wall System, research was done into eight existing living wall systems. They were compared for their circularity in order to determine the best system configuration and materials. The water filtering façade will be a panel system as these systems have a large substrate volume related to low materials volume. A list of healthy materials which are recyclable or compostable was composed. Plants species suitable need to be fast growth, but easy maintainable and have a high tissue content. A selection was made of potential plants already applied in both Living Wall Systems and constructed wetlands. Chosen plant species are silene-flos-cuculi, carex pendula, carex elate and carex caryophyllea. Best is to pre-cultivate the system with bare root seedlings. In this case plants should be able to grow at west orientation, the position of the chosen façade at the WestCord Hotel Delft. The main concept of the design is to create a water filtering façade with the least materials as possible, which is easily demountable, prefab and rapidly installed (large modules of 2100x3400mm). The water is intermittently feeded, desiring a low influent velocity for sufficient treatment. The slope was one of the few factors important to constructed wetland design, which could be influenced by the shape of the water filtering façade. In order to lengthen the retention time as much as possible, the shallowest slope is desired which does not cause clogging. From practice a slope of 14.3 degrees proved to perform well. The water flows in a zigzag through the façade in order to cover an as large possible façade surface area.","Vertical green; Constructed Wetland; Living Wall System; WestCord Hotel; Delft; The Netherlands; Design for Circularity","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Building Technology","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","It is well known that desiccation fissures can have detrimental effects on the performance of flood defence embankments. While many studies have focused on understanding the mechanisms of desiccation cracking in clay, few have tried to simulate field conditions in laboratory experiments. In general desiccation experiments are performed on thin (10-30 mm) clay samples. Experiments executed with thicker specimens (15 cm, 100 cm) did not include water availability below the desiccating clay layer. In both cases the studies exclude the effect of water transport that is naturally present in a dike due to the presence of ground water. Furthermore past studies have mostly tracked the evolution of the crack pattern as seen from the top (2D), and were therefore not able to investigate the evolution with depth (3D). In this research four physical models of a clay dike cover (29 £ 21 cm2 and 19 cm thick) were constructed using remoulded kaolin. In two of the models a constant source of water was incorporated directly below the desiccating clay layer and cracked specimens were subjected to several wetting-drying cycles. Wetting was applied in two ways: starting from the top and starting from the bottom of the specimen. The evolution of the 3D crack network was visualized with computed tomography (CT scan). The results demonstrated that water availability below the drying clay inhibits desiccation. Infiltration lead to a decrease in crack aperture, whichwas more prominent near thewater source. Furthermore cracks initiated below the surface and wetting induced the formation of new cracks at the surface. These results imply that surface observations are not sufficient to accurately predict the state of a dike cover at depth. The presence of ground water below the dike cover will inhibit desiccation and thus desiccation cracking in a zone where the evaporation rate is equal to the replenishment rate (water transport from the water table).","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","Geo-Engineering","",""

(mentor)","2016","Key technological challenges within the field of aeronautical engineering drive the design of wings to become increasingly lighter and more flexible. The added flexibility increases the influence of aeroelastic effects, which need to be incorporated in the preliminary design phase. To this end an aeroelastic tailoring tool for composite wing optimisation is developed by R. De Breuker et al. called Proteus. However, this design tool only assesses the wing, neglecting the wing's direct environment, the aircraft. The influence of the aeroelastic aircraft environment on the design performance of the wing is unknown and determining its significance is the topic of this thesis work. A standalone aeroelastic model of the complete aircraft has been developed as a proof of concept of the models and theories involved. To represent the aerodynamics of the aircraft, a source panel distribution placed on the fuselage wetted surface has been combined with a vortex-lattice method describing the wing and tail. This aerodynamic model is coupled to an Euler-Bernoulli beam based structural model of the aircraft. The resulting aeroelastic model is aeroelastically trimmed for static flight conditions. This is done with the use of sensitivities, omitting the need for an iterative trimmed aeroelastic equilibrium solution. The standalone aeroelastic model is verified with relevant test cases obtained from literature for both the aircraft aerodynamics and aeroelastic phenomena. The verification proves the concepts implemented and the aircraft aeroelasticity theories are added to the Proteus framework. The resulting formulation is again verified with the aforementioned test cases to ensure the correct implementation of the aircraft aeroelasticity. The expanded Proteus framework is used for the design performance analysis of an optimized composite wing on a real-life aircraft, the Common Research Model (CRM). The optimised wing design is obtained from the original Proteus tool to show the effect of the different aircraft parts on its design performance. The simulations are divided in wing-only, wing-fuselage, wing-tail and aircraft configurations to accurately determine the effect of the fuselage and tail on the design performance and trim conditions of the system. The four configurations are tested for three load cases: cruise, manoeuvre and pitch up and down loads. From the simulations performed it is deduced that the aeroelastic aircraft environment has a significant impact on the design performance of the optimized wing. The results prove that the influence of the aircraft and tail cannot be neglected during the structural design optimisation of the wing and when neglected creates a wing structure which is under-designed.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Aerospace Structures and Computational Mechanics","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","The aim of this graduation studio was to find new ways of housing elderly with dementia in the city of Rotterdam. Current nursing homes lack a connection with their surroundings, due to their organization of smaller living groups clustered in islands of elderly. Inside the living groups there is great attention for creating a home-like feeling and organizing things the way people know it from home. However the imbedding of these homes in their surroundings, in this case other elderly homes, seems to be lacking that home-like quality. My proposal is based on the idea that the house of elderly with dementia should be linked with the city in a way that any house is, surrounded by different functions and user groups to stimulate interaction with the world outside the home. An existing concept, called the Herbergier, is based on this idea. These houses are inhabited by 15 people with different stages of dementia. They are taken care of by two care takers, called care entrepreneurs, who live with them under the same roof. They run the house within the concept of the larger organization, but are free to hire their own staff and implement the care as they want to. The current Herbergiers are mostly located outside of the city, where the land is cheaper and they can provide the inhabitants with large apartments and green surroundings. This also causes a very one-side atmosphere and does hardly allow the inhabitants to interact with other people outside of their house. I have found three locations within the given area in the city of Rotterdam to show a possible implementation of the Herbergier. One of these location I have worked out in full detail. At this plot, the Herbergier is surrounded by an existing building block from the fifties. The Herbergier takes on the role of the garden home, allowing it to blend in with the existing situation.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Architecture","","Studio Interiors, Buildings, Cities","",""

(mentor)","2016","In the light of the European Work Program DRS-11-2015, a Dutch Collision “Solid City on Soft Soil” was formed in order to mitigate disasters brought by subsidence and safeguard cultural heritage assets. As an initial approach, the Dutch Collision planned to explore and implement solutions for this challenge in the historic city center of Gouda and made this project as a paragon for other cities suffering from the similar problem. Multiple parties – governments, scientific institutes, private parties, and civilians – are interested and involved in this project. The inner city of Gouda is an independent polder built on the Holland-Utrecht peat. The combination of subsidence and climate change increases the overall vulnerability, and a sustainable and efficient urban water management plays a significant role when it comes to the solutions. As the starting point for the Gouda project, this research focuses on the investigation of the fluctuation characteristic of groundwater under different influential factors (primarily precipitation, evapotranspiration, and sewage water) in two contiguous drainage areas – Nieuwe Haven and Centrum, where the impacts of climate change and land subsidence had been identified enormously negative. In order to have a comprehensive understanding about the groundwater flow pattern in the research area, a new groundwater observation network was designed and implemented on 20th of May, 2016 to collect sufficient groundwater level data. The network took into consideration of the influential factors on groundwater, susceptible areas to groundwater fluctuation, and accessibility for subsequent validation and maintenance. Once the new observation network started to measure the groundwater levels properly, a field experiment was implemented to investigate the leaky extent of the back-stowed sewer system as well as the response of the groundwater to the variation of the sewage water levels. Both the time series and cross-section analysis among groundwater levels, sewage water levels, precipitations, and evapotranspiration were carried through. At the end, a preliminary construction and parameter analysis of a 3D finite-difference transient daily groundwater flow model were performed with the help of iMODFLOW v2.6.37. However, further calibration of the model is required to improve the model performance in the future. The current results illustrate that the leaking extent of the back-stowed sewer system depends on the year of the construction and the pipe material. Generally speaking, the reactions of groundwater levels to the changes of the sewage water levels are up to the leaky extent of sewer pipes and the distance to the leaky system; groundwater in the vicinity of vegetation displays a similar variation pattern with the potential evaporation within a day; and groundwater in the unpaved and riparian areas are more sensitive to the precipitation. The whole project is still in progress, and certain aspects of current investigation require further improvements. Additional recommendations related to data collection, model calibration, and investigation in other areas of the inner city of Gouda were given at the end of this thesis. Although there is no “one-size-fits-all” solution, due to the fact that seldom research has focused on the urban groundwater management related to land subsidence so far, the methods, procedures, experience and lessons accumulated in this research can still be considered as a guide or assistance for other areas or cities which are willing to make a change.","groundwater observation network; groundwater level; historic sewer system; iMODFLOW","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Water Management","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","Transport operators worldwide need to focus on how they can implement automated vehicles in their schedules in the coming years. Automated vehicles are particularly suited for use in demand-responsive transport, which is often modeled as a Dial-a-Ride problem. This report investigates how public transport demand forecasts can be used to improve the routing of vehicles in the Dial-a-Ride problem. In particular, two improvements to solutions of the Dial-a-Ride problem are investigated. The first, empty vehicle rerouting, deals with the relocation of vehicles that are currently idle, which has been studied before. The second, demand rerouting, is introduced in this thesis and uses demand forecasts to deal with the issue of which vehicles serve which passenger. To analyze the performance of these additions to the Dial-a-Ride problem, the rerouting measures are modeled for various demand distribution patterns on the road network of the Tata Steel IJmuiden area in the Netherlands. A visualization tool is created to analyze the key performance indicators of the solution algorithm, with an insertion algorithm used to assign passengers to vehicles. Throughout this report it is assumed that deterministic distance and path matrices are available for the network. Stochastic travel times are not taken into account, but can be incorporated in the model. The inclusion of empty vehicle rerouting reduces passenger rejections by up to 98% and can reduce passenger travel and waiting times by up to 5 and 16% respectively. This requires an increase of the vehicle distance driven per passenger by up to 25%. Demand rerouting reduces travel and waiting times by up to 6 and 30% respectively, with only a very minor increase in vehicle distance driven. The main conclusion of this thesis is that the two rerouting measures can be combined and that this combines the strengths of both types of rerouting. Passenger rejections are all but eliminated, passenger travel times can be reduced by 10% and waiting times can be reduced by almost 50%. This comes at the cost of only a 25% increase of vehicle distance driven per passenger. A sensitivity analysis of the input parameters of the model shows that the advantages of the rerouting measures are effective in all cases. Demand forecasts can thus be a very strong tool in optimizing the solution to Dial-a-Ride problems.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","","","","",""

In this work we create elongated droplets which are stored in droplet chambers in such a microfluidic device. However, these elongated droplets are shown to wet the walls of the microfluidic device. Furthermore, within the droplets, a strong swirling flow has been observed. Both the above phenomena are very undesirable in experiments that aim to reconstitute the spindle apparatus. In this study we investigate the origin of the fluid flow and how to control it. To achieve that, we add microparticles in our aqueous phase, which we are able to track with the use of the micro Particle Tracking Velocimetry (𝜇PTV) method. It is shown that the main cause of the fluid flow is viscous entrainment, since the velocity of the aqueous phase is increasing proportionally with increasing input pressure on the continuous phase which flows around it. Consequently the main cure to the swirling flow problem which we encountered is reducing the input pressure of the continuous phase. Moreover, we focus in optimizing our microfluidic device in order to minimize wetting of the device walls. Optimization is accomplished by coating the device surface with a chemical that lowers its surface energy and through the creation of a controlled nanostructured surface with the use of nanoparticles. Both techniques have shown to work and result into a hydrophobic surface at the bottom of the device and superhydrophobic surface at the top of the device respectively. Further investigation can be done in the future in order to replace the bottom, currently limited, hydrophobic surface with a superhydrophobic surface. Furthermore, the flow field which is created by the moving components of a mitotic spindle can be investigated. This can add significant insight to the way the different components of the spindle apparatus interact with each other.","microfluidics; mitotic spindle; emulsion droplet; surface modification; superhydrophobic surface; viscous entrainment; 𝜇PTV","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Process and Energy","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

The Gipps car-following model is manipulated in such a way that it represents (C)ACC driving behavior to a satisfactory extent. A simulation network of a part of the A15 highway containing the junctions Ridderkerk, Vaanplein and Benelux is used to assess network-wide and bottleneck specific traffic flow effects of increasing market penetration rates of (C)ACC. Microscopic simulations showed that the results of increasing market penetration rates of ACC range from negative to positive effects, while increasing market penetration rates of CACC generally provide positive effects. Additionally, traffic flow effects of increasing penetration rates of (C)ACC at on-ramps, weaving sections, lane drops and bottlenecks where extreme braking is applied, have been assessed. At on-ramps, ACC systems generally have a negative to no effect, while CACC systems show positive effects. At weaving sections, increasing penetration rates of (C)ACC could either have a positive or negative effect, depending on the lay-out and characteristics of the weaving section. At lane drops, (C)ACC systems generally have a negative to no effect. At bottlenecks where extreme braking is applied, (C)ACC systems have a very positive effect, since these systems have a homogenizing effect on traffic flow. Additionally, at road sections at or near capacity, (C)ACC systems were found to have a homogenizing effect on traffic flow. Although the microscopic simulation showed reasonable and credible results, some improvements to model (C)ACC more effectively could still be made. For example, by including the possibility to activate and deactivate (C)ACC systems at certain times or locations in the network. Furthermore, mesoscopic simulations in Aimsun were performed in order to find out whether it is possible to obtain similar results as found in microscopic simulations. The relation between mesoscopic and microscopic simulations in Aimsun is still unclear when fixed time headway settings are applied, which indicates that further research on this topic is necessary. In general, mesoscopic simulations could be used as an indication on the traffic flow effects of (C)ACC systems, but it is very important to be aware of the differences in simulation results that can be found as a result of the simplifications to allow mesoscopic modelling.","Traffic simulation; Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control; Adaptive Cruise Control; Traffic flow; Advanced Driver Assistance Systems; Intelligent vehicles; Microscopic traffic simulation; Mesoscopic traffic simulation; Aimsun","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2016-11-10","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Transport & Planning","","Transport, Infrastructure & Logistics","",""

Therefore the aim of this thesis is to develop further insights in the governance of Smart City initiatives and the specific processes that can improve implementation. The proposed governance framework is based on the processes: collaboration, leadership and champion, partnership and participation, communication, service and application integration, data-exchange, transparency and accountability. The framework is applied for the analysis of two Dutch Smart City case studies Transform-Amsterdam and Triangulum-Eindhoven. The study concludes that collaboration is the core process of governance, mainly driven by leadership, partnership and participation, on the basis of transparency and accountability, supported by the other governance processes. No additional governance factors have been identified. The governance framework proved to be supportive in getting insight in the different processes of the specific Smart City initiatives. This framework, including the defined influencing processes, their mutual relations and the overview of success factors and barriers can be helpful to plan interventions to improve the critical factor of governance in the implementation of Smart City initiatives. The framework does not offer characteristics of maturity levels for each process.","Governance framework; Urban Area development; Smart City; Smart City Implementation; Governance","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Management in the Built Environment","","Urban Development Management","",""

To tackle this challenge, a robust design is needed, that performs satisfactory under a wide variety of future conditions. Multi-Objective Robust Simulation Optimization (MORSO) was applied, to create a robust re-design for pumping station Vissering in the Dutch Noordoostpolder. Combining the future scenarios and design alternatives led to a large set of simulations, that was analyzed using sensitivity analysis. The future scenarios caused the same order of magnitude sensitivity as the design choices. As such, this insight confirmed the importance of including uncertainties about the future in a pumping station design. By considering multiple performance objectives, instead of just a single cost objective, many trade-offs and interactions between design choices and future scenarios were revealed. Traditional design strategies and the other robustness frameworks would not have come to these insights. In the end MORSO enabled us to design a robust pumping station and create a starting point for an adaptive operational strategy.","Gemaal voor de Toekomst; Robuust ontwerpen","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

Present day we are still reshaping rivers, building structures in rivers or adjusting them, which results in changes in the hydrodynamics and morphology. In order to obtain more insight in the consequences of these adjustments, it is convenient to use a numerical model to simulate the river hydrodynamics. For the last decades numerical models have been developed that are able to simulate hydrodynamics. Currently, new software packages are proposed that are more efficient in predicting this. Two of these new software packages are D-Flow Flexible Mesh (FM) and 3Di. Whereas the first is especially designed to model the hydrodynamics of rivers and other flows such as in estuaries, the latter is mostly used for the simulation of flooding of land (for example due to dike breaches). The usage of numerical model applications results usually in many choices that have to be made. Based on these choice there are considerations that need to be taken into account. Both these choices and considerations will have influence on the river hydrodynamics. With two new packages available that can simulate hydrodynamics, the choices and possibilities for each package should be clear. When multiple numerical model applications are considered the similarities and differences should be known. The aim of this thesis is to indicate which considerations and consequences for simulations, that follow from the choices in numerical model applications, are important for the suitability of results given a specific problem.","D-Flow Flexible Mesh; 3Di; Elbe; hydrodynamics; numerical model application","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","3Di en D-Flow Flexible Mesh","",""

(mentor)","2016","Wave climate in harbours determines for a significant part the efficiency of harbour operations. A good prediction of the hydrodynamics is therefore regarded as indispensable, which is often done by means of advanced numerical modelling. This study is a part of the Joint Industry Project XBeach. The goal of this research is to determine the application limits of the numerical model XBeach (both nonhydrostatic and surfbeat) for the purpose of modelling hydrodynamics in harbours. XBeach non-hydrostatic, a phase-resolving model where the waves are resolved on the individual wave scale, is theoretically able to predict the hydrodynamics because relevant short and longwave processes are resolved. To this end, the depth-averaged nonlinear shallow water equations are solved. Further, the application range for phase-averaged models is smaller, because the waves are averaged and no phase information is considered to include the dominant wave processes in harbours (e.g. diffraction). XBeach surfbeat (Roelvink et al., 2009) is a mix between phase-resolvingmodel (long waves) and phaseaveraged model (short waves). This indicates that the long wave processes (e.g. harbour oscillations) are included in surfbeat. This mode uses the energy balance equation, which is coupled to the nonlinear shallow water equations for the long waves. To be able to examine the applicability of XBeach, two simplified harbour layouts are considered which are subject to a variety of wave conditions. The considered governing wave processes are reflection, diffraction and harbour oscillations. These laboratory experiments are reconstructed in XBeach and its results are compared to the measurements. Wave-structure interaction is not further considered, because the XBeach model does not have the possibility to define structure properties. Comparison between the simulation results and measurements have shown that periods and wave heights of the short waves (f > 0.04Hz) are only well calculated by XBeach non-hydrostatic. Wave conditions with a relatively large wave height over depth ratios (up to 0.3) are still accurate. XBeach surfbeat gave inaccurate results for the wave heights of the short waves, because diffraction is not considered in the calculation model. With respect to the long waves (f · 0.04 Hz), both modes in XBeach are able to reproduce the wave heights, wave periods and the resonant frequencies. The accuracy of the phase-resolving and phaseaveraged modes is comparable. However, more confidence is placed in XBeach non-hydrostatic, especially when long-crested waves are involved. The accuracy of XBeach surfbeat for the wave heights is higher if the long waves are still bounded to the wave groups inside the harbour. Without the presence of these short waves, the long waves are free which can freely amplify resulting in an overestimation.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

Some data parallel programs are functionally correct only when they are solved with a specific number of threads. For these programs, the question whether or not parallelization reduces computation time, can be answered with a simple “yes” or “no”. Other data parallel programs can be solved with any number of threads. This study focusses on these other data parallel programs which can use any number of threads and are still able to function correctly. With those data parallel programs, there is not a single answer to the question whether or not parallelization reduces computation time, it depends on the number of threads used.<br/>There are many things that impact the computation time when data parallel programs are executed. For example: overhead, the cache size, and/or the data size. Therefore, the relation between the number of threads and the computation time of a data parallel program is not linear. A typical time-thread curve has a first part where it decreases towards a certain minimum time, and a second part where the curve increases. In the first part, there is sufficient data to make efficient use of the extra threads. In the second part of the curve, threads can no longer be used efficiently, therefore there is no further decrease in execution time possible. Since, the overhead still increases, the curve increases as well. In order to make the computation time of data parallel programs as short as possible, it is essential to determine the optimal number of threads.<br/>There is another reason not to use just the maximum number of threads. To execute multiple threads in parallel, extra hardware is needed. Therefore, the energy consumption increases, when more threads are used. By using less than the maximum number of threads energy can be saved by deactivate threads that are not used for computations.<br/>We describe a method for automated determination of the optimal number of threads. We have developed a technique that we call the smart decision tool. With the smart decision tool the number of threads needed for maximum speedup can be determined for every parallel computation task in a program.<br/>The program language Single assignment C (SaC) was used as a host for our research. SaC is a functional programming language with a syntax that is similar to C. The programming language has a special syntactical construction (array comprehension) with which data parallel operations can be described. The SaC compiler can turn these array comprehensions into program parts that can be executed on any number of threads. With the add-in of the smart decision tool the number of threads that are actually involved in a parallel computation can be optimized.<br/>Single assignment C puts threads that are not used for computations in a spinlock. These threads in spinlock consume energy. No energy is saved when a part of the treads is hold in spinlock. We have developed barriers that deactivate threads that are not used for computations. In this way energy can be saved.","parallelism; sac; thread; dynamic adaptation; smart decision tool","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This applies especially for the twin city of El Paso – Juárez. This twin city used to be the epicentre of the Mexican drug war. Juárez was known in 2010 as the most violent city in the world while El Paso on the other hand was ranked as one of the safest in the United States. This antithesis increased the dissociated relation of the two cities. Meanwhile, many victims of drug war related violence and family of victims on the Mexican side are left behind without a place to commemorate their deceased loved ones. Also, justice for the victims of those commited crimes is lacking due to the absence of prosecution by the Mexican government. The current hostile border condition, together with the lack of justice and a place commemorate for the inhabitants of Juarez, have been used as a conceptual starting point for this project. This graduation project tackles these problems by implementing a memorial & research center for drug war related victims on the border of the two cities. The building combines it function as a memorial and research center with making a physical connection between the two cities. It is therefore a multifunctional, binational accelerant for both cities/countries meant to improve the binational relationship and well-being of the citizens on both sides of the border.","Memorial & reconciliation center; US-Mexican border; border","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Architecture","","Complex projects","",""

This is especially important for 3D path-finding. 3D features of the environment can have an effect on the computed path and these features can not be represented correctly in a 2D representation. A voxelized model is a good 3D representation that supports path-finding. It is a geometrical and topological model and it is easy to incorporate semantics. It is also fairly easy to consider the shape and size of the actor. This thesis presents a new path-finding method that operates on a voxelized model and supports different kinds of actors. Distinction is made between actors by their size and mode of locomotion. Supported modes of locomotion are walking, driving and flying. A hierarchical data structure is used to reduce the time complexity of the path-finding problem. This hierarchical data structure is a graph which is derived from a cell decomposition of space. The results indicate that the path-finding method in its current state operates well for walking and driving actors, but further improvements are required for flying actors.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Urbanism","","","",""

The theme of the world expo is: where ambition turns environmental challenges into economic opportunities. The building industry is a large polluter, since manufacturing processes cause a lot of waste and has a high energy consumption. The paradigm shift from mass standardization to mass customization is made possible by the third industrial revolution, namely the robotization of the manufacturing industry. When the manufacturing processes in the building industry are robotized this could reduce energy consumption, reduce waste, increase efficiency and use less materials while allowing humans to specialize. Robotic devices are already being used in the manufacturing industry, but they are not being used to their full potential. The tasks they are most commonly given are repetitive, because of limitations in the software and willingness/knowledge of manufactures. The pavilion should showcase the development of the robotic devices that will allow for mass customization in the building industry. ROS industrial consortium is a developer of open source robotic software and apply the software to the manufacturing industry. During the World Expo, the ROS industrial consortium will exhibit the newest technologies and showcase the major developments. After the World Expo the pavilion will be used as a research, education and conference centre by ROS. Research questions - In what way can the pavilion be shaped so the visitor will be stimulated to explore the pavilion and its exhibitions? - In what way can the paths to the pavilion and inside the pavilion be shaped to account for these people flows? - The inhabitants of the Noordereiland in Rotterdam appreciate the park space on the chosen site.

(mentor); van Oosterom, P.J.M. (mentor)","2016","The rapid developments in the field of point cloud acquisition technologies have allowed point clouds to become an important source of information for many applications. One of the newest applications of point clouds concerns the monitoring of the coast. Many countries, among which the Netherlands, use this source of data in order to determine the changes in coastal elevations. This means that point clouds are collected every hour, day, month, year; ultimately talking about dynamic point clouds. To be able to efficiently use this plethora of data, the management of those point clouds, dynamic or not, is proven to be crucial. Point clouds, like the majority of geodata, have been traditionally managed using file-based solutions. Nevertheless, the last years database solutions have emerged. Typical examples are the point cloud extensions for PostgreSQL and the Oracle Database. Both options use a similar block-based organisation. In addition to the block based organisations, point clouds can also be managed using a flat table where each point is stored in a separate row. While the first approach is very scalable and efficient, the second is easier to implement and to update. To make the flat model scalable, a Space Filling Curve (SFC) can be used to cluster the data. Nonetheless, both approaches in their current forms, are not suited for the management of dynamic points. The reason for this is the fact that they do not consider the time dimension as part of the organisation and further insertions for the block-based approaches are not straightforward. Within this thesis a SFC approach for managing dynamic point clouds is investigated. For this, the flat model approach using an Index Organised Table (IOT) within a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) is used. Two variants coming from two extremes of the space - time continuum are then taken into account. In the first approach, space and time are both used within the SFC (integrated approach), while in the second one, time dominates over space (non-integrated approach). Along these two approaches, two treatments of the z dimension are, also, studied: as attribute or as part of the SFC. In addition to that, building on the coastal monitoring applications, the most important queries are identified: space - time, only time, only space. The efficiency of the implemented methodology is tested through the execution of a benchmark. Using two use cases coming from coastal applications, the benchmark is executed once for daily and once for yearly data. The results show that the SFC approach is an appropriate method for managing dynamic point clouds. Furthermore, the integrated approach is the most suitable way to proceed. Achieving scalability, time efficiency and dynamic insertions can be achieved for various use cases.","Point cloud data; Space filling curve; Spatio-temporal data; Benchmark; DBMS","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","OTB","","Geomatics for the Built Environment","",""

(mentor); Hopman, J.J. (mentor); Custers, K. (mentor)","2016","Additive manufacturing, colloquially known as 3D printing, is a production process that offers possibilities compared to conventional production methods. Current methods involve shaping or removing of material to create parts, where additive manufacturing adds material. Several industries have successfully implemented the technology showing improvements for components such as 50% weight reduction or better performance. These opportunities do not seem as relevant in the maritime construction sector, therefore determining the potential requires more detail. The goal of this report therefore is set as: Asses the potential for additive manufacturing in the maritime construction sector and show its effect on ships through case studies. This goal is realized by providing an overview of additive manufacturing capabilities, opportunities and challenges related to maritime technology. It is found that the most interesting opportunities are: • Weight reduction • Performance improvement • Part consolidation and integrated functionality • Customization To further analyse the potential, the effect on system engineering, ship design and mechanical engineering is considered. It is assumed that the effect is mostly on mechanical engineering level, where the added value shows through the effect additive manufacturing has on the shape and function a part fulfils. Cost and fitness models are created to be able to quantify the added value additive manufacturing has. These are applied to the components gathered from vessel data and brainstorm sessions with the project partners. After this filtering, optimization is considered for all of the selected components, based on the opportunities of additive manufacturing. To determine the possible weight reduction a case study is performed using topology optimization on a rudder. This confirmed that a weight reduction from literature of 25% and for a rudder further reduction up to 40% is possible. From selected components it is found through detailed analysis that fairleads are 10 times more expensive to print compared to the current pipe-based design. Ladders, air gratings are examples where the costs are similar to the current design, so a more detailed analysis is necessary for a verdict on these components. The mast of an lightweight offshore vessel produced with additive manufacturing can be cheaper, lighter and faster in production than the current composite design also offering the option of optimizing for a certain eigenfrequency to improve radar movement. Finally, rudders can be produced at similar costs as the current design but when printed, have the opportunity to be printed in a custom shape. This means features such as a twisted rudder can be implemented without additional costs. A case study is also performed for printing the entire hull of vessels, with an assumed weight reduction. This weight reduction then leads to fuel reduction from which return of investment is calculated. It is found that printing hulls is not feasible, since the average return of investment time is 282 years. The costs of additive manufacturing have to be 4 times lower or the weight savings have to be 75% to reach payback times of 5 years for some vessels. The implications of this thesis are that a general model is available for analysing components for additive manufacturing. This means that if the market changes or other components are requested to be printed, an analysis can easily be made. This thesis is part of a project called a GRaduation Industry Project (GRIP) in collaboration with Damen, Feadship and TNO and two other graduate students, Jurrit Bersgma and Martijn Obers . The two other students focus on the topics of production and structures, providing a total overview of the potential of additive manufacturing in the maritime construction sector.","Topology Optimization; 3D printing; Additive Manufacturing; Ship Design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-11-08","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Marine and Transport Technology","","Marine Technology - Ship Design Production and Operation Track – Ship Design Specialisation","SDPO.16.023.m",""

Another 5.500 years pass before the next paradigm shift of the wheeled car. A gradual series of technological advances eventually accelerated to the invention of the first ‘’auto’’mobile. During the 20th centure things are speeding up: Automatic transmission, highways, GPS navigation and during the last decade we see the first breakthroughs in automated driving and safety systems (Ingels & Klok, 2015). Autonomous driving promises to be the most far-reaching advance in mobility since the invention of the automobile itself. Cities are the place where self-driving vehicles are most likely to fundamentally change how people live, work, and, of course, get around (Lang et al., 2016). Far fewer accidents and much lower costs, as well as higher traffic efficiency, improved productivity, and lower pollution are just some of the anticipated benefits. Research by Lang et al. (2016) indicates, for example, that widespread urban adoption of self-driving vehicles and “robo-taxis” (and, especially shared self-driving taxis) could result in a 60% drop in the number of cars on city streets, and 90% fewer road accidents. The goal of the graduation project is to explore in what sense autonomous driving could improve the spatial quality of the public realm in the city of Toronto.","smart cities; autonomous vehicle; self-driving cars; transit oriented development; urban mobility","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Urbanism","","Urban Metabolism and Smart Cities","",""

(mentor); van Loenen, B. (mentor)","2016","Sensor data plays a significant role in our life. Sensors are devices that can sense our environment. This sensor data is part of the Sensor Web and needs a vast data infrastructure design, because many organisations are involved, the abundance of different sensors and because of the big volume of data and near-real time data. The extent to which sensor data can be used depends on a variety of factors, among them the observations of the sensor, the data about the sensor itself and interoperability between sensor systems. Standards will lead the way to a well-functioning interoperable Sensor Web, meaning all the systems can communicate with and understand each other. Therefore, the sensor standards need to be discoverable, interoperable and usable in their own domain. Currently this is not yet the case. There is not sufficient information available about the gaps and overlaps in the Sensor Web and there are a lot of different standards and therefore the systems are not capable of communicating to each other. Currently the standards are made and maintained by different organizations. There is one cluster of standards assembled by Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC), called Sensor Web Enablement (SWE), which forms the spine of the Sensor Web, but there are also other non-OGC standards that are useful for the Sensor Web, such as the IEEE standards and W3C's Semantic Sensor Network. A use case demonstrates both the usefulness and the gaps and overlaps of the standards in the Sensor Web, because it sketches a real-life situation in which standards can bring interoperability. The Smart Emission project in Nijmegen is a suitable candidate to assist in answering questions regarding sensor standards. In Nijmegen there is a citizen request for air quality data. The Smart Emission Project was initiated to respond to this request. The project is a collaboration between different organizations to to keep the city liveable by incorporating citizen participation in the Sensor Web. Sensors that measure different environmental indicators namely air quality, sound pollution, and meteorological data are placed all over Nijmegen to sense the city. The plan is to provide the data to the citizen for both viewing and downloading via applications. The project team is currently using OGC sensor standards, namely the SensorThingsApi and Sensor Observation Service, but is interested in alternatives, such as for remote access to the sensor, and can profit from research on sensor standards. The requirements for implementation in the use case are extracted from meetings with citizens, network maintainers, experts in the Sensor Web and project members. Validation of requirements from the Smart Emission project demonstrates weaknesses and strong points in the current standards and how they can be used in a combination to provide the right data to the citizen. Validation is done through a data model based mainly on Observations and Measurements. Results show that not all requirements for the use case are met and that standardisation is not achieved for every requirement. To improve standardisation for future projects the adapted Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model in combination with a digital sensor portal is suggested to be used. The OSI model, adapted from computer science and used for data interoperability on the Internet is an ordering system and can indicate the right standard for the right usage. It is a layered system in which data is added in all the five layers. The chosen data flows through this system and ends up with relevant information for the user and the system. The adapted OSI-model is changed on several aspects. The layers are different than the original OSI-model. Furthermore division between standards is made by categorizing them on implementation method. Using the Adapted OSI-model will fill the gaps and demonstrate the overlaps in the Sensor Web make it more interoperable. In this thesis data modeling of a use case has been used to analyse sensor standards. The results show that in the current situation the sensor standards are insufficient ordered, interoperable and harmonised. The Adapted OSI-model can bring order and the model can open up the way towards a more interoperable sensor web.","smart cities; sensor standards; Sensor Observation Service; SensorThings API; Semantic Sensor Network; SensorML; Observations and Measurements; standardisation; harmonisation; data modeling; Open Systems Interconnection model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","OTB","","Geomatics","",""

(mentor); Abels, H.A. (mentor)","2016","Several methods are used to measure fracture plane orientation. For these measurements manual, photogrammetric and laser scanning methods are in use. The latter method is used in this thesis to survey the geometry of an outcrop of the Devonian Condroz Sandstone Group in southern Belgium.The aim of this thesis is to develop a method with which the orientation of fracture planes in the Condroz Sandstone outcrop can be measured using LIDAR data. To this end, the research question is as follows: How can LIDAR data be used to find the orientation of fracture planes in the Condroz outcrop? LIDAR (i.e. Light Detection and Ranging) is a laser scanning method that captures the geometry of an object by illuminating the surface with a laser light. The fracture planes width varies between a couple of centimeters up to several meters.The research question is answered through developing a method for detecting and measuring fracture planes. The geometry of a rock face is captured in a point cloud. The normal vectors to all points in this cloud are determined and the azimuth of each point is put in a histogram. By selecting the second largest peak in this histogram and applying a nearest neighbour elimination, all points that belong to the fracture plane are selected. The dip direction and angle, which make up the orientation, are determined by selecting the median of this data set. Applying this method on several fracture planes, surveyed in the researched outcrop, seem to endorse the applicability of this method. The found results range in between the expected results after visual observations and comparison with another study. However, the validation of the results is poor, because exact measurements of the orientation of the studied fracture planes is missing. The developed method gives a basis for further research to validate, improve and automate the proposed method. This method can be used in other researches about orientation analysis using LIDAR data.","","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","","",""

Summer in the city: A research into the relation between Rotterdam’s South socially deprived neighbourhoods and the urban heat island","De Deckere, M.P.","Van der Hoeven, F.D. (mentor); Dabrowski, M.M. (mentor); Wandl, A. (mentor)","2016","Cities face challenges protecting their population from high air temperatures. In the coming century cities tend to become warmer as a consequence of global warming exacerbating the urban heat island. This affects the livability of neighbourhoods with negative effects for the population. The urban heat island is the phenomenon where the city warms up during the day and remains warmer during the evening and night then its surroundings. This is a consequence of urban characteristics like lack of vegetation and use of paved surfaces. However the urban heat island is spatially uneven distributed and some residents are more exposed. These neighbourhoods are often socially deprived neighbourhoods. Residents in these neighbourhoods are of low income and have bad health. In combination with badly insulated houses and a public space that does not provide room for coolness these people are disproportionately exposed. Such exposure to the hazard of high air temperature is considered as an issue of environmental justice. The city of Rotterdam has a strong urban heat island and above average percentage of people with low income. As such the thesis focuses on if there is a relation between Rotterdam’s socially deprived neighbourhoods and the urban heat island. Are people in these neighbourhoods disproportionately exposed to the urban heat island? If so, how can urban design mitigate and adapt to the negative effects of the urban heat island. With the use of a Pearson correlation analyses a correlation is found between the urban characteristics of neighbourhoods and the averages summer day surface temperature, which acts as an indicator for the urban heat island, fitting urban heat island theory. Interestingly population characteristics also correlate. Neighbourhoods that tend to have a strong urban heat island are also socially deprived. Such a combination is considered as an issue of environmental justice. Residents in these neighbourhoods are more exposed and vulnerable since they also have bad health conditions. Due to urban characteristics of lack of green and high percentage of paved surfaces the neighbourhood does not provide, both in the private and public space, room to escape from the urban heat island. Such an issue of environmental justice is considered to be the most severe in the city district of Feijenoord. Design interventions are proposed for the neighbourhood of Bloemhof. These range from the introduction of courtyard building blocks, to introducing vegetation in both the public and private space. The introduction of courtyard building blocks provides a typology in which the inner courtyard provides for coolness. The typology also attends to introducing more diversity and population density in the neighbourhoods. With the use of urban heat island mitigating and adapting design principles the building block and its direct surroundings remains relatively cool. More vegetation is introduced in both the public and the private space. A neighbourhood deal is proposed between the residents, the municipality and the housing corporation. In the private space of gardens with a high percentage of paved surfaces the tiles are removed with vegetation. With a careful selection of vegetation these gardens are easy to maintain and not expensive. Firstly the residents are provided with room in their private space to escape from the urban heat island. Secondly such a proposal reduces urban characteristics that contribute to the urban heat island. In the public space on street level vegetation is introduced that covers the facades and tiles along the facades are replaced with vegetation. For squares more vegetation is proposed, with playgrounds and benches in the shade and communal gardens. In retrospective the thesis introduces the concept of environmental justice on the city scale within the Dutch context. Broadening the scope how the urban heat island affects the population. Future research on the urban heat island should incorporate the concept of environmental justice as it will give a deeper insight in who will be most exposed by the urban heat island.","environmental justice; urban heat island; climate change; Rotterdam","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Urbanism","","","",""

Urban environment has a tremendous and not extensively explored impact on human health and on environment. Until now the UHI was mostly studied by the means of satellite remote sensing techniques. This approach has four basic drawbacks that the current paper tackles. Firstly, remote sensing does not allow examining the air temperature (Ta) for specific days; for instance days with greater scientific interest (e.g. heat-wave phase). Secondly, the spatial resolution cannot be altered depending on the research needs. Moreover, satellite images (e.g. Landsat 8) enables only per 16 days updates which is not enough to be able to capture the UHI distribution dynamically during a heat-flux. Finally, the estimation of Ta by using satellite images is based on the surface temperature (Ts). However, this paper judges that the relation between the Ts and Ta is not always strong and positive. To overcome these limitations, this research utilizes weather stations to enable Ta measurements with hourly updates which enable diurnal and seasonal observations. This paper investigates a methodology to analyze and visualize dynamically the Atmospheric UHI. The method followed is reusable since it can be applied for other cities or other time spans for which all the necessary data is available. To calculate the location variables (independent variables) which contribute to the UHI, data from different sources were acquired and utilized. Moreover, a dataset derived from 140 sensors distributed in The Hague area constitutes the most important dataset since accompanied with the KNMI temperatures dataset enables the timely analysis and visualization. All the data were integrated and organized into a grid with 100m *100m resolution. Data modelling is accomplished for all grid-cells in the area of interest by using the relation between the sensed temperatures with the location variables. The sensed temperatures were further used to validate the constructed models. During this research we observed that Ta and Ts have different behavior. Ta depends on the rural temperature, albedo, coastline proximity, footprints, sky view factor, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and imperviousness. However, there is no relation with water surfaces in contrast with Ts. Moreover, the relations are not as strong as with Ts. These findings highlight the need for extra research on this topic by examining variables that may affect more the Ta, such as the wind direction. Therefore, the final output of the paper is a dynamic representation of UHI during the heat-flux of 2015. The visualization aims to help urban planners, designers and policy makers to understand the microclimates in order to develop strategies and designs towards more liveable cities.","Atmospheric Urban Heat Island (AUHI); sensor data; location variables; data modelling; dynamic visualization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Geomatics for the Built Environment","","","",""

(mentor); De Oliveira Barbosa, J.M. (mentor); Jarquin Laguna, A. (mentor); Natarajan, G. (mentor); Visser, C. (mentor); Hassan, M. (mentor)","2016","The investigation into the dynamic behavior of a cable during installation was done with the aim of improving cable installation for safety, operational and commercial value. In order to increase the operational limit of the vessel during cable installation, the investigation into improvement systems was desired. The workability of a vessel during cable laying operations is governed by the cable integrity design criteria such as maximum tension, touch-down-point tension, side-wall-pressure and the minimum bending radius. In practice during cable-laying the touch-down-point tension and minimum bend radius cannot be measured. Therefore a dynamic analysis of the subsea cable is required to determine the cable motions and tension fluctuations. The main objective of this Master Thesis is to develop and investigate two cable lay improvement systems. Both systems are modeled in OrcaFlex software to analyze its improved effect on the workability during cable laying operations. The cable integrity design conditions are compensated by either active force control at the tensioner systems or by active position control near the departure point on the chute. By controlling one of the two parameters the catenary shape is stabilized and therefore the fluctuating tension and cable motions are controlled. Force control is developed in OrcaFlex by a Tensioner System controlling the tensions in the load cells at a target value, position control is controlling the chute-end location with an Active Heave Compensated Chute System. To actively control the improvement systems, a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID)-Controller is used in OrcaFlex as external function where the performance dependents on the defined PID-Parameters. To optimize the improvement systems further, first simplified 1-Degree Of Freedom (DOF) analytical position controlled models are developed to identify the initial guess PID-Parameters. Subsequently, a 6-DOF position (left picture) and force (right picture) controlled models in OrcaFlex, was developed and simulated using the obtained initial guess PID-Parameters. In OrcaFlex the PID-Parameters are further adjusted using regular wave theory to achieve the full performance capacity of the improvement systems based on data obtained from existing systems on the market. Finally a detailed numerical model is developed and analyzed for irregular wave heights to obtain the workability plots. The numerical models are subjected to environmental and hydrodynamic loads during a three-hour simulation. Results show that the force and position controlled systems are able to improve the cable integrity design conditions significantly, but more for the position controlled system. The force controlled system is limited by the pay-out velocity for deep water and by cable compression and the minimum bending radius at shallow water, whereas the position controlled system is limited by the stroke of the cylinder. Also it has been found that the controller performance for the force controlled system must be adjusted for different range of waterdepth, while the position controlled system maintains the same performance. Furthermore, the position controlled system is able to hold the catenary shape nearly still, significantly more that it does for the tension controlled system. In conclusion an increased workability during cable installation can be achieved with one of the improvement systems.","cable; workability; improving; tensioner system; heave compensated chute; OrcaFlex; PID-Controller; Tension; compression; minimum bend radius; side wallpressure; catenary shape; integrity","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-11-07","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering, specialisation: Bottom Founded Structures, Artic & Wind","",""

(mentor)","2016","The offshore wind market is growing rapidly and will take a significant share in the total energy supply. Offshore wind energy is usually generated by large wind turbines. To transport the generated energy to transformer platforms or the mainland large sub-sea power cables are used. These cables are installed by means of a cable installation vessel. One of the possibilities to store power cable on board is by using a turntable. This is a large type of equipment consisting of a foundation and basket. Ship motions create accelerations giving an extra dynamic force on the turntable. The current turntable, which can have a cable storage capacity in the range between several hundred tons and 10,000 tons, is designed to be applicable on all kind of vessels and for all kind of weather conditions. Also the influence of cable loads on the turntable is not well known. Due to this rough approximations are made, resulting in a conservative design. A better understanding of the cable loads will give an optimised design. This will effect in savings on material (and thus weight), assembly time and also the amount of shipping containers used to transport the modular turntables worldwide. The objective of this research is to investigate the mechanical behaviour of the cable in the turntable to obtain better design loads for the turntable whilst maintaining safety levels. An experimental and analytical approach is used to obtain a better understanding of the mechanical behaviour. A scale model is built to gain knowledge about the physical behaviour of cable, obtain a distribution of forces on the basket walls and obtain hands-on experience. The experiments can also be used to improve and validate theoretical models. Three experiments were performed: static wall deflection test, acceleration test and the (in)-stability test. The wall deflection test is used to determine the static deflection of the walls due to the cable. The acceleration test is used to determine the dynamic influence of the cable loads on the walls. The (in)-stability test is done to show a relation between the acceleration and stability of the cable package. The experiments are performed with two types of inner wall: stiff and elastic. The two inner wall configurations are combined with three (elastic) outer wall configurations: a complete, half or no outer wall. From these experiments a new distribution of cable load between the inner and outer wall is found. This result can be used for new, optimised turntable designs.","turntable; cable; shaker","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-11-07","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

This research showed that there are two main categories in the migration of shoreface nourishments. The first one migrates only in cross-shore direction and alongshore migration is negligible, this mainly occurs at beaches without influence of surrounding structures and the outer delta of the Wadden Sea. The second one migrates onshore and in alongshore direction, this category occurs mainly southward of the outer delta of the Wadden Sea. The migration can be predicted by the behaviour of the original bar system. The first one exists at coasts with primarily cross-shore bar behaviour and the second one at coasts with primarily alongshore or no bar behaviour. For future application of shoreface nourishments, it is recommended to analyse the original bar system and determine the location of execution on this analysis.

(mentor); Bergsma, A.C. (mentor)","2016","Modern office buildings commonly have fully glazed façades in order to reflect a luxurious appearance while maximizing the daylight penetration to the interior space. Though glass façades provide plentiful natural light, the amount of energy needed to maintain indoor thermal comfort poses a great challenge to the designers with the cost of what is called environmental services (those services devised to control the internal thermal and ventilation environment) to be respectively high. The effect of responsive building fabrics to complement, reduce and in some cases render unnecessary, mechanical and electrical environmental systems, may result in effective redeployment of a building’s construction and maintenance budget. In the same time, it can increase occupant comfort and control. The “Water Wall” is an experimental system which was designed to explore the potentials of water as a construction material to regulate the exchange of energy between a building and its environment. The concept originates from research done on the field of biomimetics and inspiration gained by the way living organisms maintain their body’s temperature within comfort limits; it is motivated by the thought that the challenge of having a constant interior environment while the temperature and the weather outside fluctuate has been tackled many times in nature and this could provide inspirational solutions to the design process. The idea of introducing variability into the fabric of a building to respond to changes, rather than relying on building services, offers tremendous advantages; it actually extends the ideas and principles already well-established in building and accords with the propositions of Darwin, who held that the capacity to survive depends on the ability to adapt to a changing environment. All in all, “Water Wall” is an easy to install modular frame system that controls the heat energy flow by the use of variable thermal mass (water) and the direct solar heat gain through an absorbing colorant diffused into the water. Although, this thesis includes detailed design and simulations to test the performance of the system, there is still space for a lot of improvement and many ideas that could be implemented to increase its value of the system, bringing it to a whole different level of performance.","biomomicy; adaptive facade; water; thermoregulation; office buildings; thermal control; control strategies; energy reduction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Architectural Engineering +Technology","","Building Technology","",""

One of the proposed solutions to restore the sediment balance and encourage mangrove re-establishment, is the construction of semi-permeable dams. This study aims to optimise the design of such structures. A 2DH site-specific model was set up in Delft3D Flexible Mesh to simulate the large-scale morphodynamics of the area. As Demak coastal zone is a data poor environment, the model validation was largely based on qualitative observations and expert judgement. In order to capture sediment behind the dams, the system mainly depends on locally eroded sediment. Waves dominate the availability of sediment in the area. After waves have stirred up the sediment on the foreshore, the tidal current transports the suspended sediment towards shore. The model results show that the dams successfully attenuate waves and capture sediment. Important design aspects were studied, aiming to formulate more generic guidelines for the design of such structures. New dams were found to have a negative influence on the sedimentation rate behind surrounding dams that are located backward or sidewards. For comparable mangrove-mud coasts, single coast-parallel dams are expected to capture more sediment than closed off cells. It is recommended to use the model to test new dam configurations and to study other design aspects.

(mentor); Jonker, P.P. (mentor)","2016","To possess a computer algorithm that can perform the popular task of object localization with only weak supervision is valuable for numerous reasons. Often enough a certain localization task (e.g. bird localization) simply does not have properly annotated training data available. In this thesis a novel approach called Positive Class Localization Map is proposed for Weakly Supervised Object Localization (WSOL) in visual data. Currently a Deep Learning algorithm called a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is used for most tasks on visual data. A traditional CNN consists of two parts of which the first is shown to learn features for the task it is applied to. In this thesis we obtain the multidimensional representation stored in this part of the network and effectively filter the information related to the target class into the namesake of this thesis, a Positive Class Localization Map (PCLM). We show that from this PCLM the network is still able to perform classification of the input image. We also show that the PCLM holds the location of the target objects. Additionally we study how with padding and pooling we can optimize the information in the PCLM and process any size of input image. Based on this study we propose the optimal PCLM implementation which includes a novel type of pooling we call Spatial Pyramid of Average and Max (SPAM) pooling. We validate the PCLM on the PASCAL Visual Object Classes Challenge (VOC) dataset against the state of the art for WSOL. On PASCAL VOC 2007 we achieve an Mean Average Precision (mAP) of 65.7 when the algorithm is allowed to return the x,y-location of an object. When it is tasked to return a bounding rectangle we achieve 27.5 mAP. On the 2012 dataset we obtain 64.5 and 25.4 mAP respectively. Especially the results with a bounding rectangle as response are very close to the state of the art (30.9) in terms of mAP. In terms of processing time we significantly outperform all other frameworks. We also evaluated performance on a real world bird localization problem. On large 2560x1600 images containing tiny birds we achieve an mAP of 97.3 when the algorithm is allowed to return the x,y-location and 86.8 mAP for bounding boxes. These results show the promise of our PCLM framework.","weakly supervised; object localization; birds; deep learning; neural networks; convolutional; PCLM; Positive Class Localization Map","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Biomechanical Engineering","","Mechanical Engineering - Biomechanical Design - Biorobotics","",""

(mentor)","2016","An estuary forms the transition between the ocean/sea and a river. Within its boundaries salt and fresh water mix. Fresh water intake points may be located within the reach of salt intrusion. In order to justify political and managerial decisions it is thus necessary to understand and be able to predict the process of salt intrusion in estuaries. Within this thesis the one-dimensional modeling suite SOBEK is used to simulate salt intrusion in estuaries. Within SOBEK the one-dimensional continuity and momentum equations are used to describe hydrodynamics within the system. A state equation, relating salinity and density, is used to couple an advection-diffusion equation to the momentum equation. This advectiondiffusion equation can be used to describe salt transport and makes use of a dispersion coefficient. The dispersion coefficient should capture the mixing mechanisms taking place in an estuary. Mixing mechanisms in an estuary are induced by tidal forcing, river discharge or wind and the most dominant ones are gravitational circulation and tidal pumping. Recent validations of SOBEK have mainly focused on water levels and discharges, while less attention was payed to its capability to describe salt transport. The objective of this research is thus to obtain a better understanding of dynamic one-dimensional modeling of salt transport, validate the model and used dispersion coefficient, determine the applicability of the model and improve the dispersion coefficient based on the latest insights and recent developments. The study is performed using two data sets. One of which is a prismatic tidal flume experiment conducted in the 60’s at Delft Hydraulics. The other one is a data set considering worldwide measurements in convergent estuaries by Savenije and his students. The nature of the considered water bodies, tidal flume and real convergent estuaries, differs much and so do the results and conclusions regarding both data sets. The first analysis performed was testing the dispersion formulation based on the one derived by Thatcher and Harleman (1972) which is currently used in SOBEK. Based on validation results for both the tidal flume experiment and real convergent estuaries and an analysis of the dispersion relation, improvements to the dispersion formulation were formulated and tested in the second phase of this research. For example, simulations for the tidal flume test showed that the model was not capable of dealing with changes in bed roughness or water depth in the tidal flume and as such terms containing those characteristics were added to the dispersion formulation. In search of a better performing dispersion formula, the effect of the improvements to the dispersion formulation are tested. Individual adjustments were tested separately on the tidal flume simulations. More recent formulations derived by Savenije (2012), Kuijper and Van Rijn (2011), Gisen et al. (2015) and Zhang and Savenije (2016) are tested on the tidal flume experiment and/or real convergent estuaries . The dispersion formulations described by those researchers all contain one or more of the suggested improvements and together they contain all of the suggested improvements. For the tidal flume experiment model results using dispersion formulas derived by Thatcher and Harleman, Gisen and Kuijper and van Rijn are compared. For convergent estuaries simulations using dispersion formulas derived by Thatcher and Harleman, Gisen, Savenije, Kuijper and van Rijn and Zhang are compared. For the tidal flume experiment the dispersion formula derived by Kuijper and van Rijn clearly performed best. This formulation relates the dispersion coefficient to the maximum flood velocity in the estuary mouth, the water depth in the estuary mouth, the estuarine Richardson number1, the bed roughness and the relative salinity. Other formulas performed worse as they do not relate dispersion with the water depth in the estuary mouth or bed roughness. For the convergent estuaries none of the assessed dispersion formulations performed substantially better than the others as all of them result in strong correlation between measurements and simulations. However, the simulations using the dispersion formula’s described by Thatcher and Harleman (1972) and Gisen et al. (2015) are closer to the measurements than the other ones. The formulas described by Savenije, Kuijper and van Rijn and Zhang underestimated the salt intrusion and may potentially be improved by recalibrating the constant used. The dispersion formulation derived by Gisen is the simplest formulation, while it performs more or less equally well than the others. Here it is therefore suggested to continue with this dispersion formula. Gisen related dispersion at the inflection point to the maximum flood velocity, the tidal excursion and the estuarine Richardson number and used the relative salinity to convert this to dispersion along an estuary. Savenije and Kuijper and van Rijn additionally included terms relating dispersion to the estuary geometry and bed roughness, however this did not lead to better results. The formulation of Thatcher and Harleman uses the estuary length, instead of the tidal excursion, as a mixing length scale. This estuary length is not well defined and lacks a physical background regarding dispersive salt transport. Therefore the formulation derived by Thatcher and Harleman is not recommended.","(alluvial) estuaries; dispersion; tidal flume experiment; mixing processes; one-dimensional numerical modeling; salinity; salt intrusion; SOBEK","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Water Management","","NUS-TUD Double Degree Program Hydraulic Engineering and Water Resources Management","",""

This marketing plan is supported by branding touch points that will come out of an appropriate branding research. Further, the project will expand the development of Concept X for 2020, by designing a brand experience based on stimulating the social interaction between people’. The Millennials, also known as the smartphone generation or the sharing conversation, are a critical target group for RTL Nieuws, since their audience rate of RTL Nieuws has decreased over the last couple of years. The 4C-analysis and the benchmarking research were all conducted through a user-centered approach. Both qualitative as quantitative methods were used to get insights in what the target group, Millennials, perceive as important and relevant when reading news. The analysis has shown that Millennials feel overwhelmed with the overload of news information. They are in need for a filter. The consumer research has shown that three aspects are important for Millennials when reading news: creating an overview, providing reliable news updates and develop an attractive layout for the news platform. The literature research has shown that Millennials want relevant, accessible and objective news updates. The objectivity is mainly important, since the Millennials want to be free to develop their own opinions. News is seen as a tool to start a conversation or to talk about during a conversation. The Millennials feel a need to stay up-to-date, in order to join the conversation. The social aspect is therefore seen as a critical element for Millennials, since they do not want to lag during a conversation and they do want to know what their friends are reading. Getipt is a new news platform, powered by RTL Nieuws. All content of the RTL Nieuwsgroep will be reviewed by an own redaction, which will implement the content in the home feed of the users. The redaction Getipt will also develop own content. The user can rate articles as interesting or as not interesting. Through on an algorithm, the user will receive news updates within his/her interest level. Within Getipt the user will see the articles below each other, through a visual including the header, time and friends who rated the article as interesting. This friend-option is the unique element of Getipt. Users can recommend articles in-app by using the ‘tippen’ feature. For each article the user has recommended a friend, the user will receive points. For each recommendation that is being liked by their friend, the user will also receive points. These points can be used for creating an own discussion form, discussing news with experts within RTL or to share points with their friends. The unique aspect of Getipt, compared to other competitors, is it’s positioning in the market, which is focused on ‘engaging’. Engaging people with and by news creates the unique selling point that people can discover news with each other. The reason for this social engagement is that the research has shown that the Millennials read news for two purposes: for their own knowledge growth and for staying up-to-date for their friends. By recommending articles, seeing which articles are being liked by friends and by discussing news articles with their friends in the forum option, the users will always stay up-to-date when using Getipt. Compared to other competitors, who only add Facebook as a social engagement tool, Getipt creates the opportunity to make a forum with your own friends. The harmful discussions that are occurring on Facebook are being diminished, since it is only possible to discuss news with your friends in Getipt. Getipt makes news more relevant, due to the personalized news updates and due to the link with friends. In this way people are always up-to-date in their own social life. The combination of gamification and actual and factual news is a strong proposition in the news market. For further research it is useful to create a study on the perception of Millennials towards RTL Nieuws. Getipt, which is powered by RTL Nieuws, might result in a negative association according to the branding link with RTL Nieuws. In addition, it is interesting to find out what the perception is on the content of the RTL Nieuwsgroep. The design of Getipt 2020 has to be tested with a large test group, in order to make sure that the interaction of the product is clear, easy understood and fast (all guiding principles in the big idea). The marketing plan has not been completed in this report. It is useful to find out what types of channels are useful to invest in, in order to reach the target group. The message itself should be tested if it is clear and attractive enough for Millennials to discover news with each other. The business model of Getipt has to be explored. The revenue model, the sales proposition etcetera are still unkown. The future vision for Getipt is to create own content. It is therefore important to analyze what kind of content could be unique, compared to other competitors, and suitable for Getipt.","branding strategy; product development","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor); Diakité, A.A. (mentor)","2016","Developments in remote sensing created new possibilities to capture the human environment on a large scale. This data is used in the generation of large scale Three dimensional (3D) city models, which has led to a higher demand for 3D city models in a wide range of fields. The lack of semantic information in many 3D city models is a considerable limiting factor in their use, as a lot of applications rely on semantic information. This research is a first step in creating an automatic workflow, that semantically labels a plain 3D city model, with level of detail 1 or 2, represented by a triangulated polygon mesh, with semantic and thematic information as defined in the CityGML standard. The first step in this labelling process is the reconstruction of the building entities and (parts of) the terrain: the thematic features. Next, two methods are proposed to semantically label the surfaces in the previously defined building entities. The first implemented method is a best practice of methods that are tested, which aim at labelling the 3D city model with the classes WallSurface, Roof- Surface, and GroundSurface. The second method is an explorative approach and a proposal that additionally recognises the classes OuterCeilingSurface and OuterFloorSurface. In this approach, an proposal is made that extends the current class definitions of a RoofSurface and a WallSurface in CityGML. This research shows that by extending these defintions, a CityGML file with Level of Detail 1 and 2 can be semantically labelled automatically. The results show that a high semantic classification accuracy is possible. The accuracy depends on a number of factors, floating point precision errors is the biggest limitation factor in the thematic and the semantic labelling.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Urbanism","","Geomatics for the Built Environment","",""

(mentor)","2016","The traditional brick masonry houses in the Kathmandu valley of Nepal are highly vulnerable to seismic excitations, due to their low-strength masonry material and the lack of sufficient connections. Research is needed on how to make these houses more earthquake resistant; preferably without interfering with the original architecture. Tying the building elements together could enhance the global seismic performance. Therefore the main question asked in this research is: “How to improve the connections and diaphragms between building elements of traditional brick-masonry buildings in Nepal for future earthquakes?” The first objective of the research is to explore affordable, accessible and integrable retrofit measures, considering the specific circumstances of Nepal. Two combinations are proposed for respectively urban and remote areas: 1) A horizontal seismic bandage around the perimeter of a house at floor level, tied to a reinforced concrete floor overlay and 2) Perforated steel strips as wall ties, timber slats as plate anchors and stiffening of the floor by means of diagonal timber planks. The second aim is to study the effect of the retrofit measures on the seismic performance of a typical low-strength masonry structure. For this, several nonlinear time history analyses are conducted in the program LS-DYNA. The masonry walls are modelled as shells with a smeared crack model, newly developed by Arup. First a comparison is made of a numerical model to a shake table test on a scaled low-strength masonry structure from literature, by Sathiparan (2016), to gain understanding to what extent the seismic behaviour can be reproduced. Secondly, a full-scale, one storey model, comparable to one bay of a vernacular house, is analysed with alternative retrofit measures to simulate their effect on the global seismic behaviour.","traditional masonry houses; nonlinear time history analyses; low-cost retrofit; box-action","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","Building Engineering","",""

(mentor)","2016","The strength of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) will decrease due to climate change. However, the magnitude of this decrease is still under debate, since uncertainties exist about the driving mechanisms of the sinking branch of AMOC. Conceptual models have shown that sinking is located at the lateral boundaries of the Labrador sea, and its magnitude is governed by the densification of the boundary current. However, some of the assumptions in these conceptual models are questionable in reality. These assumptions include a highly stratified density profile, constant horizontal boundary current velocity, the absence of localized eddy activity, which is present as Irminger Rings (IRs), and the seasonality of the heat flux. In this study the validity of the assumptions in the conceptual models of Spall and Pickart (2001) and Straneo (2006b) is studied in a more complex, but still idealized configuration, of the Labrador Sea. We show that the localized eddy activity and boundary current velocity influence the location and magnitude of the sinking, since the net sinking in the simulations increases from 0.4 Sv (1 Sv = 106 m3 s−1) to 1.7 Sv at 1000 m depth after the IRs were introduced. A distinction was made between friction dominated sinking and eddy dominated sinking. In friction dominated sinking, which dominates in a simulation where IRs are suppressed, the largest vertical transport region is confined to a narrow friction dominated boundary region. In this type of sinking, the validity of the conceptual models is confirmed. In eddy dominated sinking, the region with largest vertical transport moves offshore due to the presence of IRs. Our results show that the IRs affect the magnitude and location of the sinking branch of the AMOC.","Sinking Eddies; AMOC; Labrador Sea; Oceanography","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2017-11-04","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Lemmen, R.J. (mentor)","2016","Damage is found in resin rich bead corner radii of RTM 6 epoxy-based composite ribs due to in-service thermal-mechanical loading after an aircraft inspection. The same types of damage are obtained through pure thermal cycling of a single bead. However, thermal cycling is a time-consuming process. Therefore, a faster way of damage investigation is required. A potential way to achieve this objective is by mechanically cycling a coupon specimen with simpler geometry than the bead. To investigate potential solutions to the problem a literature review is performed. The scope of the literature review covers several topics as follows. Laminate fatigue damage modes and their impact on the laminate is researched. It is discovered that it is typical for RTM 6 epoxy-based laminates to build-up high matrix residual tensile stresses after manufacturing. Several differences between thermal and mechanical cycling are discovered. It is found that the most common way to test composites is by the use of ASTM standards. However, there is little available information about the fatigue behavior of laminates with resin rich areas. Investigation of the fatigue behavior of laminates with resin rich areas is performed by the use of FEA and physical tests. Four specimen types labeled from A to D are manufactured. Type A is a dog-bone pure RTM 6 specimen. Types B to D are all composite specimens with the same in-plane geometry and different layups and manufacturing processes. All specimens are tested statically and in fatigue. In the fatigue testing session, fractography of the damage occurring at different test conditions for different specimen types is performed. In addition, two FE models are created. The first model is of the bead. The second model is a harmonized model applicable to all composite specimen types with required layup readjustments for each specimen type. It is discovered by FEA that the maximum principal stress in the resin rich area is perpendicular to the matrix cracks in the bead and the composite specimens. It is also discovered that the maximum principal stress cycle of the matrix at the resin rich layer interface with the fabric is similar in the bead and the specimens. The similar fatigue parameters are the R-ratio and the stress amplitude. The parameter similarity suggests they could potentially drive the resin rich layer fatigue damage initiation. Moreover, a positive through-the-thickness stress gradient is discovered, which suggests the cracks are likely to initiate bellow the resin rich layer surface. This hypothesis is further supported by fractographic observations of cracks not reaching the laminate free surface. Static and fatigue tests are performed. The static test provides the UTS of all specimen types, based on which cyclic load levels are selected. In the specimen fatigue tests several results are observed. In the first place, damage similar to the bead damage is found, namely cracks and delamination. In the second place, the damage is observed to penetrate through the laminate thickness and to be dependent upon the laminate compaction. However, this penetration depth dependency on the compaction might be influenced by the second curing cycle of specimen type C, in which the damage was observed. Finally, reduction in the specimen stiffness is observed due to fatigue damage accumulation in time. Based on the results recommendations are formulated. For design purposes resin rich area formation should be avoided both inside and outside the laminate. If their formation is inevitable, at least the laminate should be kept well compacted and the resin rich area location should be kept only at the surface. For future research, two topics are identified as requiring such. First, is the laminate stiffness reduction. Second, is the influence of the second curing cycle of the well compacted specimen type C.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Aerospace Structures & Materials","","","",""

(mentor); Van Oosterom, P.J.M. (mentor)","2016","This MSc thesis aims to develop a management solution for historical Automatic Identification Structure (AIS) data by finding a suitable database and data(base) structure for an effective extraction of historical AIS data to support Spatial-Temporal analyses. The work-flow the thesis proposes focusses on the selection of a database, the organization of the data inside this database and the effectiveness of the extraction of information that can be used in Spatial-Temporal analyses. AIS data, vessel movement data, has a complex structure consisting of 27 different kind of encoded messages. These messages hold their own unique and similar data and are related to each other by their vessel-ID number (MMSI). The update rate of the messages, the data, is dynamic, different for each kind of message. Storing and structuring historic AIS data should be able to handle the data features. Based on the comparison between the AIS data features, the requirements that the database has to meet which are set by Rijkswaterstaat and related literature and documentation is MongoDB a suitable database to manage AIS data. The requirements that are set by Rijkswaterstaat are based on three use cases; location, trajectory and bounding box. Extraction of the information, that can answer the use cases, from the historic AIS data that is stored within the database, should be effective. To ensure this, two data(base) organizations are developed, one storing AIS data in a way that it will support the Spatial-Temporal analyses of the specified use cases and one storing AIS data in a way that it will support all possible spatial-temporal use cases. The first will store only the four decoded attributes that are necessary to answer the use cases together with the original encoded AIS message. The second will store all decoded attributes an AIS message holds. To enhance the performance of MongoDB holding AIS data in one of the two data(base) organization, four indexes on individual attributes and one 4D Morton code index are developed. A 4D Morton code index based on latitude, longitude, MMSI and date-time is developed to enhance the effectiveness of the extraction of the information from the database that will answer the three use cases. A comparison between the two data(base) organizations and the five indexes by measuring their effectiveness while executing three, on the by Rijkswaterstaat specified use cases based, queries, concludes on a suitable management solution for historical AIS data which will support Spatial-Temporal analyses.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","OTB","","Geomatics for the Built environment","",""

(mentor); Bergema, C.P.A.M. (mentor)","2016","The showers are one of the facilities offered by KLM in their Crown Lounge at Schiphol Airport. This service is offered to KLM and its partners’ most loyal customers, passengers that departure from or transfer at Schiphol Airport and are a KLM or SkyTeam Business Class passenger, Flying Blue Platinum or Gold member or SkyTeam Elite Plus-member. The current shower service is a complex process, which involves different actors (i.e. Lounge visitors flying with KLM or one of the Skyteam members, KLM, KLM Lounge agents, cleaning staff, etc.) and interactions between them through many steps in the journey. The connections and procedures between these different components lack harmony and synchronization, which in turn adversely affects the performance of the service. In addition, shower service’s innovation needs have been overlooked as the service has not been included in KLM’s management priority until now. Due to the development of the new KLM Crown Lounge providing the opportunity to design a new shower service, KLM decided to bring the shower service up to priority focus. This graduation project from the master Strategic Product Design from the TU Delft complements KLM’s efforts to improve the Lounge service in general and the shower service experience specifically. It does so by analysing the current state of the service, by researching opportunities for improvement, and by proposing a design solution to be implemented by KLM within 2 years. This project is divided in four main phases; Discover, Define, Develop and Deliver, related to the Design Council’s double diamond model. In the Discover phase, insights were gathered by analysing the current shower service, the envisioned new KLM Crown Lounge concept and shower facility and by performing an external analysis and internal analysis. In this phase, most emphasis lied upon customer journey mapping of the current shower service and extracting the four areas of interest; external communication, scalability, shower logistics and process oriented, which represent the main weaknesses of the current shower service. In the Define phase, all findings of the Discover phase were clustered into building blocks for the new shower service vision. Based on these building blocks, the pillars seamless, personal and efficient were created. The different interwoven pillars formed the basis for the shower service vision of the new KLM Crown Lounge: ‘Making use of KLM’s Crown Lounge shower service should feel like a seamless, personal and efficient experience’ In this phase also the personas Lucien and Maria were defined, for which the new shower service was specifically designed for. In the next phase, Develop, ideation took place and out of the many created new shower customer journeys for the personas Lucien and Maria, a future shower service scenario for both Lucien and Maria were created. Together with KLM, it was discussed what shower service scenario would be feasible to deliver in the new KLM Crown Lounge that opens in 2018. In the deliver phase the final design was developed, focusing on the main problems clustered in the analysis of the current Shower Customer Journey, namely the AoI’s external communication, scalability, shower logistics and process oriented and the formed shower service vision. The proposition consists out of a three new product-service system to enable Lounge visitors to book a shower in the new KLM Crown Lounge in a seamless, personal and efficient way, namely via KLM’s mobile app, KLM’s self-service device in the Lounge or via the Lounge agent’s Appy2Help. The product-service systems were developed by means of user stories. From these user stories, the service blueprint was developed that describes the full sequence of interactions of the shower service process in the new KLM Crown Lounge in 2018. Next, the what if processes are described, which show how the system reacts when disruptions occur. This graduation report concludes with an implementation plan consisting of a two-year roadmap for the development of the proposed shower service system for the new KLM Crown Lounge and final recommendations.","Product-service system; Service Blueprint","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor)","2016","Renewable energy is evolving to a source of increasing importance for the global energy supply. Within the renewables market, the offshore wind sector has become an important participant and experienced a rapid growth during the last years. Over 80% of the support structures of offshore wind turbines are monopiles (large diameter steel cylinders). These monopiles are installed by either dedicated jack-ups or floating vessels. Due to the trend of offshore wind farms to deeper waters and the installation of larger monopiles, the more cost effective option may become the floating vessels for all installation cases in the future. The Oleg Strashnov, a heavy lift vessel that is owned by Seaway Heavy Lifting (SHL), is used for the installation of monopiles. Currently, the company executes this operation with a moored floating vessel. Since running and picking up of the anchors consumes over 40% of the total duration of a monopile installation, SHL desires station keeping with a dynamically positioned (DP) vessel. A workability assessment is performed for monopile installation with a DP vessel, where the modelling of the monopile installation system is analysed and a comparison is made between the moored and DP cases. In the industry, the conventional method to analyse the workability of a DP vessel is by means of static DP capability plots, which include limited dynamic effects. The vessel is fixed, and constant wind, mean wave drift and current loadings are incorporated. However, the major drawback of this method is that it does not consider the dynamic effects properly and could lead to unrealistic allowable environmental conditions. For this reason, two dynamic models are developed in this study in order to compare the moored and DP monopile installation systems. In these models, the vessel and monopile are connected by means of the active controlled motion compensated outrigger. To investigate the most critical phase of the monopile installation sequence, the monopile is lowered until self-weight penetration and the hammer is placed on top (see Figure 1). Considering various nonlinearities in the installation system, such as control systems and viscous drag forces, the Cummins equation provides a satisfactory approach in the time domain. However, the convolution integral is inconvenient for computational analysis and is therefore approximated by a state-space subsystem with the MSS Toolbox. A verification study is performed by a comparison of the dynamic vessel model provided with the state-space approximation and an AQWA simulation including the convolution integral. The dynamic installation models are subjected to collinear environmental conditions, determined with potential theory and viscous drag calculations. During one hour simulations, limiting values of the wind, wave and current loads are determined below which the operation can still be executed. From these results, dynamic capability plots are constructed. The limiting environmental conditions are closely related for the moored and DP monopile installation methods. However, the DP installation system proves to be superior since it can optimize the heading during an installation, which is not the case for the moored vessel. In conclusion, a time reduction could be realized by the installation of monopiles with a dynamically positioned vessel. In this study, an ideal DP system is considered. Implementing a DP system that is closer related to the real system may have a significant impact on the results of the simulations. In addition, the systems prove to be highly sensitive for variations in the hydrodynamic coefficients. Thorough investigation is therefore needed for the determination of realistic viscous drag loads in future studies.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-11-04","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Offshore & Dredging Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); van der Vegte, W.F. (mentor); Backer, J. (mentor)","2016","Current lighting solutions for emergency services can take up to 10 minutes before they are up and running, lack portability and depend on external (power) resources. How is this acceptable when lighting is one of the primary needs in order to provide aid? This master project describes the development of the Floating Emergency Light (FEL). The ﬂoating emergency light (FEL) is a stand-alone, portable lighting device for the fre department, which allows frefghters to set up overhead lighting within 1 minute after activation. The product uses a helium flled balloon to lift an extremely powerful LED light into the air, which will shine overhead lighting onto the emergency area. A ground station contains a pressurized helium canister, a battery pack and several control mechanisms. When the activation button is turned, the product inﬂates the balloon with 300 liters of helium. Once completed, the balloon automatically releases, lifting the LED light to an altitude of 4.5 meters. The device is capable of illuminating a surface area of 150m2 for 4 hours. The optimized geometry of the balloon is able to position itself in a way that wind is of minimal inﬂuence to the movements and position of the light. The optimization of the balloon included enlarging the volume of the balloon (buoyancy), minimizing the weight of all components, minimizing the frontal area and optimizing the drag coeffcient. Both frontal area and drag coeffcient depend on the positioning in the air. This is controlled by attaching the balloon colineair with the center of buoyancy (CoB) of the balloon. This also applies to the lighting, since this relatively “heavy” component becomes the rotation axis of the balloon due to the moment of inertia. Neither horizontal nor vertical faps are necessary, since the drop shaped balloon will be guided by the wind. All these measures will enable the balloon to act as a weather vane. However, the balloons shape will not fully compensate for the wind; in case of wind the lighting will displace or move. Tests with moving light have indicated that a wide spread lighting is most desired (since the transition from light to dark will be much larger). A diffusive layer is added for limiting potentially blinding refections of the “point-source” lighting. As a final milestone for the project, a working model was built to test the principle of overhead lighting by mounting under a balloon. Together with the fire department, the conclusion is that the stability of the balloon needs to be increased; despite the optimized shape it still behaves beyond the acceptable range. The moving light is not a problem at all but the uncontrollability of the balloon and the cable is. Despite this conclusion, feedback from the fire department has indicated that the concept has potential for a wide range of applications for emergency services and deserves further development.","Lighting; Balloon; Helium; Emergency","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","Integrated Product Design","",""

The implementation of detection methods reveals the usage of particular tools and the the existence of previously unknown software. Analysing these previously unknown tools shows that there is a difference in levels of sophistication of the tools used by scanners. Following, this thesis confirms the existence of the horizontal, vertical and strobe scanner classes, it also describes a new method in which a destination port and address are only scanned once. In addition a method to identify individual scans from traffic captures for further analysis is presented and evaluated.

(mentor)","2016","The work of this thesis has been carried out in the framework of the project Multi-Object Spectrometer with an Array of superconducting Integrated Circuits, also known as MOSAIC. The aim of this instrument is to resolve the Cosmic Infrared Background (CIB) from a 10 m diameter ground-based telescope. MOSAIC will be the first multi-object three-dimensional (3D) camera for astronomy with independently electrically-steered pixels. Two spatial dimensions will be readily available from a matrix of 5-by-5 pixels and the third dimension (distance) will be derived from the spectrum of the redshifted signals captured. Thanks to the electrical beam-steering of each of the pixels and to the very sensitive and high-resolution sensors attached to them, 25 astronomical objects from different regions of the sky will be spectrally resolved in simultaneously. For this very reason the whole ALMA (Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array) observatory could be outperformed for just a fraction of its cost. Foundations for such improvements stem from two successful earlier projects making use of broadband antennas and KIDs (Kinetic Inductance Detectors): DESHIMA (Deep Spectroscopic High-redshift Mapper) and A-MKID (Array of Microwave KIDs). The former as an infrared camera of the sky mapping the location of astronomical sources, and the later as a high resolution spectrometer looking at the already pinpointed sources. This thesis contributes to MOSAIC with the early stage design process of the integrated, broadband and electrically beam-steered antennas implementing each of the pixels. The connected array is chosen as the antenna solution to fulfil the requirements: fully planar, broadband and electrically steerable. Fundamental studies on the antenna dimensions, input impedance and efficiency in terms of surface waves are carried out and traded-off in order to satisfy the requirements of the instrument whilst conforming to the manufacturing constraints and the optical front-end of the Atacama Submillimeter Telescope Experiment (ASTE) in Chile, where MOSAIC will be eventually installed. Among the plethora of options, some of the proposed set-ups in this thesis will stand out as more appropriate candidates for the instrument. Aiming at developing a first prototype of MOSAIC, a reduced-bandwidth antenna is investigated with one of the most promising set-ups previously studied. More realistic structures accounting for the finiteness of the antenna and including the actual feeding network are investigated in order to provide considerations on the final design to be manufactured.","MOSAIC; antenna; connected array; surface waves","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics","","Master in Electrical Engineering, track in Telecommunications and Sensing Systems","",""

While motivation is a key aspect within the process of behavioural change, games can effectively be deployed as a persuasive technology. Gamification, the use of game design elements in any non-game context, is seen as the next generation marketing trend. City marketing was found to be another marketing trend, as a result of globalisation and the increasing popularity of city marketing itself. City marketing authorities attempt to positively engage (new) residents, (new) visitors, (new) companies and (new) investors to their city, in order to improve the mental, absolute or relative position of the city. While pervasive technologies can visually overlay the environment, persistently run during daily life or add additional meaning upon the real world, pervasive games could allow city consumers to engage with their city environment through real- and virtual world interaction and experiences. Therefore, city marketing through gamification may be brimming with potential. This project resulted in the design of a mobile, pervasive city game for new Delft students to be played during the five days student introduction (OWee) for the underlying purpose of raising awareness and appreciation of local resources. A prototype was developed and tested that could be played by new students during the OWee (21-08-2016 / 25-08-2016).","Gamification; City Marketing; Delft; OWee","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Design conceptualisation and communication","",""

However, both surgical experiences and a literature study have pointed out that small differences occur between the virtually planned resection and the obtained resection.

(mentor)","2016","Research has shown that leg stiffness of animals is an important characteristic in their locomotion. It was shown that leg stiffness is correlated with the mass and gait of animals and properties of the terrain that is traversed. This observations inspired research on variable leg stiffness in robotic locomotion. Legs have been developed of which the passive compliance can be varied. Experiments have validated that variable leg stiffness can increase the dymamic stability, speed and efficiency of pedal robots. It can also be exploited to control the gait of locomotion and to adapt to varying conditions. A simulation study suggests that online control of leg stiffness is an effective approach to stabilize the gait of an RHex when faced with variations in terrain properties. The bandwidth of the stiffness adjustment in existing leg designs for the RHex is to low to realize real-time control of leg stiffness. The goal of this thesis was to improve on the bandwidth of current designs to enable online control of leg stiffness for the RHex. A motivation for this research is to improve the locomotion preformance of the RHex and to make it a valuable asset in research on variable leg stiffness. A segmented leg design is developed that is suitable for online control since its stiffness can be adjusted power efficiently and with a small actuation stroke. The variable stiffness is realized by mechanisms that exploit a novel concept to realize a variable transmission. The stiffness of multiple joints can be controlled by a single actuator which is not yet a feature in other designs that exploit variable transmission. A model has been composed to characterize the stiffness of the mechanism and the leg. Experiments with a prototype have validated that a variable stiffness has been achieved.The outcome of the experiments only partly validated the models. More research is needed to fully understand the behaviour of the prototype. An actuator has to be integrated to determine the realizable bandwidth.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Precision and Microsystems Engineering","","Mechatronics","",""

(mentor); Brinkgreve, R.B.J. (mentor); Everts, H.J. (mentor); Loonen, N.T. (mentor); Lagendijk, P. (mentor)","2016","A hot topic in the Netherlands is the safety reassessment of dikes. Currently several (river)dikes are being reinforced to withstand a given normative high water level. The environment of those dikes is often characterised by small floodplains and urban areas right next to the dike, wherefore standard geo-technical measures cannot be applied. Installing a diaphragm wall in the crest of the dike is in such a case a measure that can guarantee the safety, by preventing the development of a shear plane when the dike is subjected to a normative high water level. In engineering practice modelling of those structures is simplified by using a linear elastic plate element with a reduced stiffness, to account for concrete cracking upon loading, or a linear elastic-perfectly plastic volume element in the geotechnical finite element code Plaxis. In this master thesis attention will be paid to the possibility of modelling and designing such (geotechnical) reinforced concrete structures in Plaxis more accurately with the use of a new concrete material model. Recently the Shotcrete material model for volume elements is released by Plaxis. The Shotcrete material model accounts for non-linear and time dependent behaviour, i.e. more realistic behaviour, of concrete. The material model is however only been used for modelling unreinforced shotcrete in a NATM application. The capabilities of using the Shotcrete material model to design laterally loaded reinforced concrete structures in the subsurface is investigated. At first the theoretical applicability of the Shotcrete material model to design reinforced concrete structures in Plaxis 2D is being researched. Verification against guidelines and model codes for describing concrete behaviour showed that the material model has the prospect to model non-linear concrete material behaviour, including cracking, realistically. By means of analysing a statically determined reinforced concrete bending beam model it is found that using a by elastoplastic plate element(s) reinforced Shotcrete volume element has additional value over the use of a linear elastic and a linear elastic-perfectly plastic material model when modelling a reinforced concrete structure. Nevertheless it is observed that the results given by the Shotcrete model are slightly mesh sensitive. The use of a by elastoplastic plate element(s) reinforced Shotcrete volume element is subsequently verified by comparing the results to commonly for design used M-kappa and M-N-kappa hand calculations. It is demonstrated that in case the reinforced concrete structure is subjected to bending, as well as a normal force, the model gives accurate and realistic results. Deviations can be explained by differences in calculation method, hand calculation versus numerical model. When the structure is subjected to a normal force attention has to be paid to pre-stressing of the reinforcement and the resulting stresses in the concrete. An elastoplastic plate reinforced Shotcrete volume element is used to model a diaphragm wall next to an excavation. Evaluation of an excavation next to a diaphragm wall, such that structural bending failure is the normative failure mode, showed that using an elastoplastic plate reinforced Shotcrete volume element gives improved results with respect to commonly used modelling methods. The other used modelling methods are a linear elastic, respectively equivalent to the reinforced diaphragm wall M-kappa, plate element and a linear elastic volume element. A lower bending moment is obtained in the structure at the same deformation, which is partly the effect of higher (soil-structure) interface shear stresses. During the analysis it is found that obtaining the correct bending moment in the structure is not straightforward. It is found that only by taking an internal force equilibrium at the neutral line in the normative cross-section of the diaphragm wall the correct bending moment can be obtained. Applying the model in the Kinderdijk-Schoonhovenseveer (KIS) dike reinforcement project demonstrates the advantage of applying a more realistic, nevertheless more complex, way of modelling reinforced concrete structures in Plaxis 2D. The obtained bending moment in the structure increases with 25 % in SLS and decreases with 10 % in ULS with respect to modelling the diaphragm wall by means of a linear elastic plate element with a reduced stiffness, to account for cracking. To conclude, a stepwise approach is proposed to model a laterally loaded reinforced concrete structure in the subsurface realistically, by means of implementing a by elastoplastic plate elements reinforced Shotcrete volume element.","Plaxis; Finite element method; Soil-structure interaction; Reinforced concrete; laterally loaded reinforced concrete structures; Material model; Shotcrete; Diaphragm wall; Dikes; Dike reinforcement","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","Geo-Engineering","",""

(mentor); Dubbeldam, J.L.A. (mentor); Ng, N. (mentor)","2016","The resource theory approach is a recently developed framework used in the study of thermodynamics for finite sized quantum systems. A simple way to describe how a quantum system evolves under energy-preserving unitaries while interacting with thermal reservoirs, has been formulated in the framework of thermal operations. Despite the conceptual simplicity of these operations, much is still unknown about their mathematical structures. In this work, we studied these mathematical structures, in an attempt to better understand how these operations, and some variants, describe quantum thermodynamics. One of the interesting phenomena that occurs in quantum thermodynamics, is something that we call super-activation. In this phenomenon, we make multiple forbidden transitions possible by combining them together. This phenomenon could, for example, be used to extract more work from two systems, while it is impossible to extract any work from the individual systems. We found conditions for when this phenomenon can occur. As a result of this, we found that qubits with trivial Hamiltonians cannot super-activate each other. On the other hand, we found a way to construct infinitely many examples of super-activation. We also investigated what happens if we combine multiples of the same forbidden transitions together. We found necessary conditions which each have to satisfy in order for this joint transition to be possible. In particular, these conditions show that this special case of super-activation can only occur in one direction. Another topic that we studied in this work is smoothed Rényi divergences. In an attempt to give an operational meaning to these quantities, we studied two special states that allow us to clarify the relation between the smoothed Rényi divergences with the possibility of a transition. These special states are the steepest state and the attest state. For a given state p, the steepest state is a state that is e-close to p in terms of trace distance and can be transformed, in the presence of a thermal bath and while conserving the total energy, to any other state that is also e-close to p. The attest state is a state that is also e-close to p in terms of trace distance, but all e-close states of p can be transformed to it. We found a way to construct this steepest state for limited values of e, and the attest state for any e.","quantum thermodynamics; thermodynamical operations; thermo-majorization; super-activation; smoothing","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Applied Sciences","Applied Mathematics","","Double Bachelor Applied Mathematics/Applied Physics","",""

(mentor)","2016","Lately, commercial aviation has been moving towards the reduction of environmental impact and direct operating costs, due to the rapid increase in aircraft demand and air traffic congestion predicted for the next years. Several researchers have been abandoning the fully exploited conventional configuration and exploring novel arrangements, such as flying wings and blended wing bodies. The Flying V concept, proposed at TU Berlin in collaboration with Airbus GmbH, represents the focus of this research project, since the preliminary analyses have estimated remarkable aerodynamic benefits and weight savings. It is a V-shape flying wing with two cylindrical pressurised cabins placed in the wing leading edge and engines over the trailing edge; elevons provide longitudinal control and vertical tails double as winglets. The primary research goal is the aerodynamic design of the Flying V aircraft to assess whether this concept has better aerodynamic performances than the reference conventional configuration during cruise. The design philosophy selected for this project consists of a multi-fidelity design space exploration followed by two different design paths: dual step optimization, where planform and airfoil variables are subsequently varied, and single step optimization. Athena Vortex Lattice is used to rapidly investigate the feasible design space, whereas the Stanford University Unstructured code in the Euler mode is adopted for an accurate wave and vortex-induced drag estimation. The profile drag is computed by a separate empirical module. The three-dimensional geometry is automatically generated within the ParaPy framework (a Knowledge Based Engineering environment) according to a multi-level parametrization: the wing planform shape is parametrized with 10 variables, the profiles with 43 parameters, and the winglets are defined by 3 additional variables. Subsequently, the unstructured volume grid is produced by the Salome platform wrapped in ParaPy and then fed into the aerodynamic solver. The aerodynamic design is performed at one single cruise condition: the Mach number is equal to 0.85, the lift coefficient to 0.26, and the altitude to 13,000 m. The baseline configuration is progressively improved: the wave and vortex induced drag components are reduced, the wetted area is slightly decreased and the pitching moment coefficient about the reference centre of gravity location is almost null. The maximum lift to drag ratio of the single step optimized configuration is 23.7 at the cruise point: this value confirms the estimation of 25 of the conceptual phase. A 12% reduction in subsonic drag is achieved, with the desired pitching moment. The Flying V is then compared to the NASA Common Research Model, a conventional configuration benchmark, by using the same solver and a similar mesh refinement. The maximum lift to drag ratio of the NASA Common Research Model is 18.9, hence the Flying V is 25% aerodynamically more efficient at the design cruise condition.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Aerodynamics, Wind Energy & Propulsion","","Flight Performance and Propulsion","",""

John Zeisel (1981) noemt dit de ‘user-needs gap’. Er is sprake van een zekere afstand tussen de wereld van de architect en de wereld van de gebruiker. Die afstand wordt in veel projecten bepaald door de tijd. De gebruiker bestaat aan het begin van een project vaak uit een algemene groep.

Als er al sprake is van overleg met de gebruiker, dan vindt deze pas in een later stadium van het proces plaats, wanneer het voorlopige ontwerp er al ligt en veel van de ontwerpbeslissingen dus al zijn genomen. De focus van dit onderzoek ligt op de afstand tussen de denkwereld van de architect en de denkwereld van de gebruiker. In vijf jaar opleiding leren architecten om anders te denken dan de gebruikers van hun ontwerpen, wat kan leiden tot miscommunicatie tussen beide partijen.

(mentor)","2016","Jumbo maritime has almost 50 years of experience in the heavy shipping industry. In the past two decades Jumbo has developed into an offshore installation company by equipping the Fairplayer with a DP2 system. The Fairplayer has two 900 [ton] Huisman cranes. However, due to insufficient static stability a stabilization pontoon is required to increase the lifting capacity from 900 [ton] to its maximum capacity of 1800 [ton]. This stabilization pontoon cannot be used in offshore conditions. However, due to recent requests from clients it is desirable to also reach this maximum capacity in offshore conditions. Therefore, the goal of this thesis is to increase the vessel offshore lifting capacity from 900 [ton] to 1800 [ton]. Starting the design process, eleven design criteria were created, on which the new design had to comply. Some of which were safety, additional stability and construction costs. Each of the design criteria have been ranked according to influence and have been given a weight factor. This weight factor has been later used in the MCA. With the design criteria in our mind, ten concepts have been created. By use of a MCA the concepts have been evaluated on their performance. This analysis reduced the number of concepts to four. The final four concepts all showed good potential. To make a final decision further analysis was required. The final four concepts have been analysed on their motion behaviour, by calculating the operability. The motion behaviour of the concepts has been calculated by the dynamic coupling model. The model uses the hydrodynamic coefficients from each of the concepts obtained by diffraction software. The dynamic coupling model, which models the interaction between the vessel and the suspended load, has partially been validated by model tests. The operability study is used as a concept comparison model. It has been executed with two-dimensional hindcast wave data. The use of two-dimensional wave spectra showed to give a far more accurate prediction of the operability compared to a scatter diagram. This increased accuracy allows us to draw conclusions on smaller differences in the results. The operability study has been executed for seven, typical installation locations for Jumbo, to see the performance of the concepts in wind waves, swell and the combination of both. Each of the concepts were evaluated for six load cases, before lift off, after lift off and at our reach for both loads of 900 and 1800 [ton]. The operability study showed that the hull extension has a significant better operability over the other concepts. Even for the 900 [ton] load case the hull extension showed better operability than the original hull. It also turned out that the operability has a strong correlation with the vessels roll motion behaviour. From the operability study also a second concept was chosen for further evaluation. The twin pontoon concept showed reasonable good operability but has the mayor advantage of not having to modify the Fairplayer, which results in a much lower investment. Only a small modification to the pontoon sleeves is required. The pontoons shall be installed in calm water conditions after which the vessel will sail offshore to execute operations. The maximum speed of the vessel with the pontoons installed is 7.5 knots. It can be concluded that both concepts, the hull extension and the twin pontoons show great promise. It will be up to the outcome of a market research to determine which of the two concepts will be the best solution to ensure maximum profit for Jumbo.","Concept study; Offshore stabilization; Heavy load crane vessel; Two-dimensional wave spectra","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2017-11-01","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Offshore & Dredging Engineering","","","",""

The effect of the additional transparency was investigated in a user study using a prototype of the system on user performance, situational awareness (SA), trust and cognitive task load. However, there was insufficient statistical power to conclude that the additional transparency, compared to a condition without additional transparency, nor the order of these conditions, had a direct or interaction effect on the participants, except for a learning effect on SA. Besides other interesting effects, the experiment showed that the order of the conditions with and without additional transparency had an effect on the use of it and a positive attitude of participant towards the system resulted in automation-induced compliance.","military domain; system transparency; aligning objectives; unmanned vehicles; human factors; situational awareness; scheduling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Intelligent Systems","","Computer Science","",""

The SOFEC mode of operation is related to the conventional SOFC and SOEC. The available theoretical knowledge for those modes is presented and then applied to SOFEC. In this report the operation of SOFEC is analyzed and explained, while the experimental part aims at validating the theory through laboratory experiments, inspired by previous tests in literature. The conducted experiments focus on symmetrical button cells, with platinum being the electrode material for both the anode and the cathode. The initial tests are carried out on custom-made cells, with platinum pasted on an electrolyte substrate by hand. The equipment used, as well as the procedure of preparing the test setup are detailed. This is followed by proposed setup modifications for future application. Afterwards, the results are presented. These focus on the polarization curves for different operating modes, while comparisons between SOFEC and SOEC modes illustrate the positive impact of the assisting fuel on the performance of the electrolyzer. Hydrogen and carbon monoxide are used as fuels, while carbon dioxide is utilized for co-electrolysis with steam. Comparisons of the electrolyzer performance between different fuels are presented and explained.

(mentor)","2016","With an expected growth of renewable energy sources, the amount of variable andweather-dependent energy input to the electricity system increases. This is a growing source of deviations between day-ahead forecasts and the realisation on time of delivery. On the other hand, new sources of flexibility (demand response, storage, EV, wind curtailment) are being developed. Modeling electricity markets is becoming increasingly complex with more interconnection, stochastic inputs and smarter optimization methods. The aim of this research project was to create a model for the Dutch Frequency Restoration Reserve (FRR) market in theNetherlands. With this model scenarioswere tested extending to 2030. Thiswas done by looking at the fundamentals of this market, expected future developments, development of a computational model and assessment of improved wind forecast accuracy, wind curtailment and large scale storage scenarios. Combining spot market unit commitment data from Eneco scenarios with unit constraints on ramping, the available flexibility capacity was calculated for every Program Time Unit (PTU). Using this capacity and its cost price, a bidding mechanism was used to establish a merit order for the available flexibility. Bidding was modelled to reflect profit optimization and validated with historic FRR market prices and volumes. The historic FRR data was taken for PTUs with a spotmarket price comparable to the expected spot price market. This was done to ensure differentiation between days of the week and time of the day. Linear price elasticity was included to reflect the effect of offering a volume on market prices. Furthermore, the effects of market participation on its own imbalance costs were taken into account. Storage and wind curtailment were shown to have an enormous impact on the availability of flexibility to the market and to market pricing. Wind curtailment will limit prices on the down regulating direction. While its availability coincides with wind production, it was shown in Chapter 4 that its availability is less than for storage. Improvements in VRES forecasting will have a much smaller impact. Through capacity contracts the Dutch TSO ensures capacity to provide both upward and downward regulating energy. Moving towards smaller periods for contracting, could enable more participants to become active in the market. The most important uncertainties for the future development of the FRR market are international harmonization and integration and liquidity of intraday and balancing markets as reviewed in Chapter 5. Combined with new forms of flexibility, this could lead to a different pricing regime than observed in the current scenarios.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Engineering, Systems and Services / Energy & Industry","","Sustainable Energy Technology (SET)","",""

(mentor)","2016","To guaranty safety of the vessel, operation and especially the people during offshore activities, a motion analysis is executed. The motion analysis determines the motions over the entire frequency spectrum. Motions are amplified when incoming wave frequencies come to the vicinity of the natural frequency of the vessel, hence a very interesting region concerning the safety of the operation. In the vicinity of the natural frequency the motions are highly dependent on the present damping, therefore an accurate prediction of the damping is desired. This thesis study aims to improve the roll damping operation of sheerlegs (barge-type vessels) Taklift 4 and Taklift 7 during a lifting opertation. This is achieved by implementing the viscous roll damping component and investigating the effect of a vertical center of gravity well above the waterline. A high VCG results in a coupled motion between roll and sway. The effect of a high vertical center of gravity on the potential and viscous roll damping is studied. Furtermore, the viscous roll damping is determined applying three different techniques. Finally all models are validated with data from pre-executed experiments. Theory developed by Ikeda, Tanaka and Himeno (IHT) is implemented to compute the viscous roll damping for ship shaped hulls and barge-type hulls. IHT theory is the ITTC recommended procedure for practical assesment of viscous roll damping in absence of experiments, as long as the hull dimensions and motion conditions are within the set limitations. Two numerical models are developed according to IHT theory, the IHT - Ship model and IHT - Barge model. The IHT - Ship model is verified and showed no discrepancies with the verifying document. However, the calculated viscous roll damping for the Taklift 4 is surprisingly small when compared to the potential roll damping. The estimation of the bilge radius and the lewis transformation to determine the velocity increment appeared to be the least accurate parameters causing an inaccurate viscous roll damping estimation. After the IHT - Barge model is developed, it is directly validated together with the ‘κ-formula’-model against the decay test data. Journee designed the κ-formula’-model, which contains the potential roll damping ratio and a viscous contribution multiplied with the square-root of the roll angle. The validation shows that the ‘κ-formula’-model consistently estimates the viscous roll damping in a more accurate manner for barges where 5≤B/T≤7.5. Unfortunately, the decay tests were limited with an initial roll angles up to five or six degrees. It is rather challenging to define a limitation concerning a roll angle for this approach. Therefore, the ‘κ-formula’-model can safely be used, but for large roll angles it is advised to maintain a conservative user approach. For barges where B/T=10, the IHT – Barge model is not appropriate and also the ‘κ-formula’-model is accurate for roll angles smaller than 2.5 degrees. It is suggested the free surface effects ‘hide’ the dependence of the viscous roll damping and the roll angle. The third technique to determine the viscous roll damping, is the so-called Magnuson approach. Magnuson applied an equivalent linearization procedure on the experimental data of the Noble Denton JIP to determine the viscous roll damping. To develop the Magnuson approach, experimental data providing motion response and environmental conditions is required. Such data is not available for the Taklift 4 and Taklift 7, hence results from pre-executed experiments are used, which among other things contains free decay test results and behavior in regular beam waves for rectangular scale models with similar dimensions as the Taklift 4 and Taklift 7. The main difference between the vessels studied in this thesis scope and pre-executed experiments, is the height the vertical center of gravity (VCG). A VCG above the waterline causes the response motion to change from 'pure' roll to a coupled roll-sway motion. Due to a phase difference between the coupled terms and b44 and b22 term, the B44p is decreasing for increasing VCG. The B44p coefficient becomes zero for a certain location of the VCG, which could not be explained physically in this thesis. The effect of the VCG on the b44v is positive. It is suggested the coupled roll-sway motion and secondary separation can account for this. An attempt is made to determine viscous effects of b24, b42 and b22. Very limited studies are executed on this topic, hence it is very difficult to determine the correctness of the computations. After all developed models were compared with each other, the Magnuson approach showed most promise. Therefore this approach is used to determine the viscous roll damping of the Taklift 4 and Taklift 7. Viscous damping ratios of 0.041 and 0.034 respectively, were computed for the most similar scale models, hence a viscous damping ratio of 0.0375 for both Taklift vessels is determined. It is left for future work to determine how the workability of the Taklift 4 and Taklift 7 is increased by the more accurate roll damping prediction.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Offshore & Dredging Engineering","","","",""

Organizations’ ability to make changes in the environment creates awareness of their disadvantage and stimulates a reaction. A data driven platform, which consist of a personal and organizational dashboard, allows for communication between individuals and organizations and evokes a sense of control, as it allows individuals to share their experience of the context and choose an environment which meet their personal needs. Through individuals’ input, organizations are able to change the context in a way that it meets the variety of needs, and managerial success is expressed in levels of satisfaction. For organizations it becomes relevant that individuals choose a context which increases the efficiency in which organizations meet the levels of satisfaction. The role of the personal data visualizations is to provide individuals with individual meaningful data insights which encourage the interaction and provoke individual changes in behavior in favor of the collective. Gamification elements which respond to social belonging, such as social anchoring, are drivers for the data-driven platform to evoke behavioral changes which are initiated by the collective. They are supported by elements which evoke a sense of esteem, such as leaderboards and progress bars, and mastery of feedback and creativity, such as direct feedback and meaningful choices. Moreover, random and unexpected rewards evoke a sense of curiosity, which promotes a sense of urgency in the interaction. The ability for organizations and individuals to reflect upon the current context with regards to organizational goals and the variety in individuals’ needs, and the development of individual meaningful insights which promotes behavioral changes initiated by the experience of the collective, are captured and presented in a framework. The framework envisions way to handle the data and apply the data visualizations so that organizations and individuals can collaboratively transition from current to future states.

This allows differentiation between tumors and healthy tissue and quantification of the specific absorption rate (SAR) of the tissues. Visualizing the EPs based on measurable magnetic radio frequency (RF) fields that are noninvasively acquired in vivo by a magnetic resonance scanner is called electrical properties tomography (EPT). Contrast source inversion-electrical properties tomography (CSI-EPT) is an iterative EP reconstruction method that is based on the integral representation of the electromagnetic field and has shown its ability to reconstruct the EPs of small biological tissue structures, as well as tissue boundaries. However, the results of this method are based on a two-dimensional configuration that is only valid in the transverse midplane of an RF coil and introduces errors at other slices. In this thesis, a three-dimensional (3D) approach for the CSI-EPT method is presented. In this approach, all the electromagnetic components are used to reconstruct a complete 3D object. Three-dimensional simulations of an anatomically correct human body model show that this 3D approach can reconstruct the EPs in good agreement with the true model at all the slices, especially those away from the transverse midplane and at tissue boundaries. This makes the approach a whole body application, in contrast to the 2D approaches and reconstructs superior to the well-known 3D Born and 3D iterative Born reconstruction methods. It has a potential for phantom and in vivo applications, thereby facilitating patient-specific local SAR estimation and tumor characterization.","three-dimensional; 3D; contrast source inversion; CSI; electrical properties tomography; EPT; MRI","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-11-01","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics","","Electrical Engineering - Signals and Systems","",""
