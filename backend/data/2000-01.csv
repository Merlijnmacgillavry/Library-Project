(mentor)","2000","This study contributes to the MaST-lil project SASME in which amongst others the influence of bay shapes on hydraulic and morphological processes has been investigated. Numerical models can nowadays simulate the far field impact of coastal structures. With the help of numerical models predictions can be made about the consequence of new coastal defence schemes. Therefore, the objective of this study is on the one hand, to increase our understanding of the hydraulic and morphological behaviour of bays in order to make deliberate decisions about the application of headland control in future. On the other hand the objective is investigate whether the numerical model Delft3D-MOR that has been developed by WL-Delft Hydraulics is a helpful tool to predict the coastline evolution behind a series of emerged breakwaters. The work described in this report is a continuation of work done by Slankers [1999] and Sweers [1999]. The studies done by Slankers and Sweers also contributed to the MaST-lil project SASME. This report of the Delft University of Technology will be the last that contributes to this subject of the SASME project but it is certain that it will not be the final one about this subject. A lot of unknown factors still have to be investigated. In this report a lot of attention has been paid to the bottom profile. The studies done by Slankers [1999] and Sweers [1999] were mainly based on Iinear bottom profiles. To achieve more reasonable profiles in this study concave bottom profiles are applied with a part in the centre of the bay having a constant depth. It turns out that a concave bottom yield different results compared to linear bottom profiles, so the simulations in this report are all executed with this kind of concave profiles. The concave bottom profile is based on the Sruun [1954] profile with some adaptations that were necessary for this specific situation. Hydraulic and morphological simulations are executed to investigate the influence of the wave period on the initial longshore flow veloeities and on the initial suspended sediment transports. A smaller wave period results in lower initial longshore flow velocities and thus lower initial suspended sediment transports. In the study mainly initial conditions are investigated. Like Slankers and Sweers 40 different bay shapes are compared. In some design studies, e.g. Maasvlakte 2, a bay shape with a straight part in the centre of the bay is assumed as an alternative. It is interesting to know the effects of such straight parts in the centre of the bay. This has been investigated in this study. Near the centre of the bay the initial flow velocities become a bit less compared to a case without a straight part but further along the periphery the effect of the straight part seems smal!. After this part of the research contributing to the SASME project done by the Delft University of Technology final answers concerning bay stability have not yet found. In order to increase our understanding of the behaviour of bays and to find equilibrium further research about this subject is necessary.","","en","master thesis","TU Delft, Civil Engineering and Geosciences, Hydraulic Engineering","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","","","","",""

(mentor); Schiereck, G.J. (mentor); Fontijn, H.L. (mentor)","2000","Dit rapport beschrijft een onderzoek naar de bodembescherming die voor een verticale golfbreker aangebracht wordt. Voor een verticale golfbreker ontstaat een staande golf waarin orbitaalstromingen wrijving op de bodem veroorzaken. Het ontbreken van een bodembescherming kan leiden tot het ondergraven van een verticale golfbreker. Om inzicht te krijgen of de bestaande theorieen van Rance & Warren en Jonsson & Sleath toegepast kunnen worden voor het bepalen van de bodembescherming voor een verticale golfbreker zijn er experimenten uitgevoerd. De experimenten zij uitgevoerd in het laboratorium voor vloeistof mechanica van de faculteit Civiele Techniek van de Technische Universiteit Delft. De experimenten zijn uitgevoerd in een golfgoot met aan het eind een verticale wand met daarvoor een 5m lange testlaag. De testlaag bestaat uit stenen die in gekleurde stroken zijn aangebracht met een breedte van 10 em. Aan het begin van de golfgoot bevindt zich een golfinachine die aIleen regelmatige golven op kan wekken. Elke proefis driemaal uitgevoerd, in totaal126 proeven.. In de proeven zijn de steendiameter, de soortelijke massa, de golfhoogte en de golfperiode gevarieerd. Na elke proeven is de schade bepaald door middel van verplaatste stenen te tellen die van de ene strook naar de andere zijn verplaatst. De schade is bepaald door het percentage te bepalen van het nominale oppervlak van het aantal verplaatste stenen per strook. Onder de knopen van de staande golf is de schade van de bodembescherming maximaal, dit is conform de golftheorie. Volgens de golftheorie is de stroming onder de knopen van de golf maximaal en onder de buiken de stroming minimaal. De knoop van de staande golf ontstaat op een kwart golflengte van de verticale wand hier treed dus ook de maximale schade op. De resultaten van de proeven zijn vergeleken met de theorieen van Rance & Warren en Jonsson/Sleath. De golfhoogte van de staande golven bij het begin van bewegen zijn vergeleken met de berekende waarden van Rance & Warren en Jonsson/Sleath. Hieruit volgt dat de theorie van Rance & Warren zeer goed voldoet om de benodigde bodembescherming te bepalen. De theorie van Jonsson/Sleath geeft bij de zelfde bodembescherming een golfhoogte toe die een kwart kleiner is. Hetgeen vergeleken met de experimentele resultaten erg conservatief is.","vertical breakwater; bed protection","nl","master thesis","TU Delft, Civil Engineering and Geosciences, Hydraulic Engineering","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","","","","",""

(mentor); Stive, M.J.F. (mentor); Roelvink, J.A. (mentor); Walstra, D.J. (mentor)","2000","Computer models are commonly used to simulate the behaviour of the coast in response to natural processes (e.g. storms, extreme sea levels) or management plans (e.g. beach nourishment, channel dredging). The COAST3D project was initiated to improve and validate these numerical models. COAST3D stands for Coastal Study of ThreeDimensional Sand Transport Processes and Morphodynamics. In March 1999, a COAST3D Pilot experiment was held in Teignmouth on the coast of Devon in Southwest England.Teignmouth has a very irregular coastline. It comprises a tidal inlet adjacent to the beach and a sandstone cliff, making it three-dimensional.This study involves the modelling of the Teignmouth site with data from the Pilot campaign. The general goal is to validate Delft3D-MOR against the field data taken in Teignmouth. For this purpose, a model grid covering the Teignmouth site is constructed. The hydrodynamic boundary conditions are determined by nesting the Teignmouth grid into a larger model, the Lyme Bay Model, which is in turn nested into the Continental Shelf Model. After the nesting procedure, the boundary conditions are calibrated with the use of water levels recorded during the Pilot campaign. The influence of the Teignmouth estuary is calibrated by varying the bed roughness inside the estuary. However, the tidal flow through the estuary mouth can not be modelled accurately, as the bathymetry data used in the Teignmouth model is outdated. The different COAST3D modelling teams agreed to carry out three common test cases: 1) A spring tidal cycle without waves. 2) A hypothetical situation with high waves and a fixed water level. 3) A neap tidal cycle with large waves. The focus of this study is also on these three test cases.The suspended and bedload transports and resulting bed-level changes are also computed for each test case. This is done with and without intratidal bed updating.","estuary; modelling","en","master thesis","TU Delft, Civil Engineering and Geosciences, Hydraulic Engineering","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","","","","",""

(mentor); Van de Graaf, J. (mentor); Reniers, A.J.H.M. (mentor); Roelvink, J.A. (mentor)","2000","In this report a study is presented concerning the morphological impact of breakwater structures perpendicular to a coast. This study was initially associated with the Indian coast between Chennai (formerly known as Madras) and Ennore in India. Like many ports, the harbour of Chennai had, and still has a considerable morphological impact on the surrounding coast. By obstructing the longshore transport, the presence of the breakwaters caused accretion and erosion. Construction of a new harbour near Ennore, 20 km north of Chennai, started in 1997. During construction of the harbour similar effects like near the Chennai Port are visible. Morphological consequences of these harbours can be simulated and predicted by a morphodynamic model. The objective of this study is to design a morphological model of the coast between Chennai and Ennore, and calibrate this model by means of the recorded coastline advancement near the Chennai Port. The time period for these morphological simulations is set to 25 years. Use is made of DELFT2D-MOR, a software package developed by WL I Delft Hydraulics. This numerical program offers a wide range of tools for implementing physical processes that determine coastal morphology. The objective mentioned above could not be met within the timeframe of this study. In the course of this study, the implementation of breakwater structures appeared to be more complicated than expected. Hence a greatly simplified representation of the real situation has been modelled: simulations have been carried out for a breakwater, perpendicular to the shore where only waves determine the morphological behaviour. The following conclusions can be drawn: a) The present definition of structures like breakwaters in the computational area of DELFT2D-MOR is not suitable for morphological calculations. The breakwaters do not obstruct the longshore sediment transport properly. Most of the incoming sediment does not settle, but ""disappears"" near the breakwater. A large portion of the longshore sediment drift therefore does not contribute to beach accretion. These structures have to be implemented as closed boundaries within the computational area. b) If the breakwaters are implemented as closed boundaries, DELFT2D-MOR is able to simulate the accretion process due to the presence of a breakwater. The numerical model responds well to input with respect to varying particle size, and varying bottom roughness. c) The erosion process in DELFT2D-MOR is not simulated properly. Although coastline retreat is taking place, the erosion mainly generates unrealistic steep beach slopes. d) The single line theory of Pelnard-Considere yields the same results with respect to coastline advancement near the breakwater, compared to DELFT2D-MOR. The similarity with the computational results only holds for the accreting coastline.","break water; modelling","en","master thesis","TU Delft, Civil Engineering and Geosciences, Hydraulic Engineering","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","","","","",""
