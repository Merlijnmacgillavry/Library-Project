(mentor)","2016","The search for and characterization of exoplanets and other sub-stellar companions are hot topics in contemporary astronomy. Currently, the characterization of the atmospheres of exoplanets through direct imaging leverages on the analysis of only the intensity of their light as a function of wavelength and time. Additional information on the composition and structure of planetary atmospheres - that cannot be obtained with spectroscopy - can be deduced with polarimetry, i.e. measuring the direction of oscillation of the electric fields of light. Not only the starlight that an exoplanet reflects is expected to be polarized, but also the thermal emission of a planet, as this radiation from inside the atmosphere will be scattered by cloud and haze particles on its way up. Indeed, the polarized thermal radiation of several field brown dwarfs has already been measured and is attributed to the scattering of the radiation by patchy clouds in their atmospheres. The degree of linear polarization of hot exoplanets at near-infrared wavelengths is expected to generally be larger than 0.1% and could be up to several percent in some cases. Measurements of the polarized thermal emission of exoplanets can provide information on the presence and patchiness of atmospheric clouds and hazes, the cloud top pressure, spatial structure such as rotational flattening and cloud bands, the atmospheric rotation rate, and the surface gravity and mass of the companion. By determining the angle of linear polarization, the planet's projected spin axis could be constrained. The recently commissioned VLT instrument SPHERE is a high spatial resolution, high-contrast, direct imaging instrument that is specifically designed to detect and characterize giant exoplanets orbiting nearby stars. SPHERE's near-infrared instrument arm IRDIS has a dual-beam polarimetric mode that is primarily used for high-contrast imaging of circumstellar disks, as it is expected to be too insensitive to directly measure the polarized thermal emission of exoplanets. However, IRDIS has already detected exoplanets with huge signal-to-noise ratio using angular differential imaging (ADI) of thermal fluxes. The aim of this thesis is therefore to investigate the feasibility of combining ADI and accurately calibrated polarimetry with SPHERE/IRDIS to for the first time detect and possibly characterize exoplanetary atmospheres through direct imaging polarimetry at near-infrared wavelengths. To assess whether IRDIS can detect the expected polarization signal of exoplanets, and using HR 8799's planetary system as a study case, IRDIS' polarimetric sensitivity is estimated by extrapolating the results from VLT/NaCo observations to IRDIS, and by simulating single-beam polarimetric measurements with real IRDIS data. Based on these estimates, SPHERE/IRDIS is expected to reach sub-percent polarimetric sensitivity when combining extreme adaptive optics, coronagraphy, ADI with advanced data reduction techniques and dual-beam polarimetry. A model describing the modification of the polarization signal induced by the telescope and instrument is established and validated with available internal calibration measurements and observations of a standard star. It appears that for some filters and particular combinations of the parallactic and altitude angle, only a very small part (~10%) of the incident linearly polarized signal is actually measured by the instrument. This loss of signal is accompanied by large offsets in the angle of linear polarization. It is also found that the instrumental polarization of the telescope and SPHERE's first mirror varies with telescope altitude angle and can reach values of a few percent. To limit the instrumental polarization and the loss of signal, an observation strategy is presented for IRDIS' polarimetric mode. In addition, a data reduction method is developed that uses the instrument model to derive an exoplanet's true degree and angle of linear polarization from the measured polarization signal. It is estimated that, after correcting for the modification of the polarization signal induced by the complete optical system, a polarimetric accuracy of ≤0.1% is reached. Given that an exoplanet will generally be between a few tenths of a percent and a percent polarized, it is concluded that, if SPHERE/IRDIS can indeed attain the predicted sub-percent polarimetric sensitivity when combining angular differential imaging and polarimetry, exoplanetary atmospheres can be characterized for the first time through direct imaging polarimetry.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Space Engineering","","Astrodynamics and Space Missions","",""

The company's value proposition consists of addressing this problem by means of artificially assisted therapy. The specific mission of this project has been to reconsider the company's value proposition(VP) from a sustainability and circular economy perspective. This has been done in particular by exploring how circular and platform design strategies can be articulated in such a way that leverage the company's activities towards its main goal. As a result off a multilevel design approach, a platform business model has been proposed as a sustainable approach. As part the platform VP, a circular open-source platform strategy has been proposed to develop the platform infrastructure. A technological vision towards this infrastructural development proposes a tool kit composed of a set of subsystems which includes Human Machine Interfaces and Active Assistance Devices of different types that support different treatment modalities. This set of subsystems are designed to be highly open, adaptable, upgradable and reconfigurable. Within this strategic framework, a showcase application of circular and platform design strategies has been reached by means of a modular architecture. This technical application demonstrates how the vision can be systematically implemented in the short term, within the value creation activities of the startup company.","stroke rehabilitation; sustainability; circular economy; circular platform design; platform business model; open-source","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","The increasing shares of RES-e generation have resulted in unexpected but well-documented effects, such as the Merit Order Effect (MOE) on the power market. According to the MOE, the electricity prices decrease along with high penetrations of low variable cost technologies such as RES-e. Due to high investment costs the deployment of RES-e technologies is strongly depended on policy support. Upon lower electricity prices, generating profits becomes more and more challenging. Therefore, investors are more reluctant on financing such capital intensive projects. In consequence, further policy support is required to incentivize RES-e investments. However, subsidies are not expected to support the RES-e investments for an unlimited time but only for a certain time span during which the RES-e should evolve to self-sustained technologies. The design of the subsidy itself can contribute to tackling the negative impact of the MOE. The EU member states not only need to reduce the public support that is imposed by EU commission mandates, but at the same time have to ensure that they will meet the targets set for RES-e consumption in 2050 (European Commission, 2011). According to the abovementioned goals, two issues arise: a) how can the public support be reduced without challenging the RES-e generation? b) how can dependency on public support for the development on VREs be eliminated? To tackle these issues, the present thesis comes with the objective to provide recommendations regarding policy support without challenging the deployment of VREs. To deliver the objective an agent based model designed by the Energy and Industry Section of TPM faculty of Delft University of Technology called EMLab Generation was employed. The model is built to study the transition of the European Energy markets towards a carbon-free regime. To deliver the thesis objective six scenarios were tested- five including policy support and one Base Case scenario in which no subsidies are provided. The following KPIs were measured to provide answers to the research question and sub-questions: investor profits per energy unit, spot market revenue per energy unit, mean subsidy per energy unit, ratio of RES-e to total generation, production per technology, average electricity price for each year of the simulated period and aggregated profits and subsidy costs during the entire modeled period. The findings suggest that the optimum subsidy scheme to reduce public support is provided by the FIP Ex Post scenario according to which the mean paid subsidy decreases with time. Regarding the insight for energy investors, more profits are generated when investments only in RES-e technologies are realized. The reason for the latter is that investments in CCGT plants result in losses. This is explained by the exclusion of CCGT technology from the market due to the high penetration of the zero marginal cost RES-e technologies. RES-e technologies are first in the merit order and therefore have priority on supplying the electricity market. Consequently, as more RES-e technologies are implemented the lesser, is the load needed to be supplied by other sources. Finally, regarding the value of storage in the energy market the only remarkable effect is the smoothening of electricity prices which still is not observed when storage capacity increases from 20gwh to 40gwh.","RES-e; investments in RES-e; investments in VREs; Energy Policy; Feed In Premium; FIP; RES-e subsidies; Energy Economics; Renewable Energy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Engineering, Systems and Services","","Management of Technology","",""

(mentor); Charbon, E. (mentor)","2016","Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is a nuclear-medicine imag- ing technique used extensively in diagnosis of early stage tumors and cancers. Apart from clinical applications, PET is also employed in biomedical and pharmaceutical research. For this purpose, small- animal PET scan systems have been developed with superior per- formance metrics and cost efficiency. Small-animal PET scan systems provide higher spatial and temporal resolution. Conventionally, PET scan systems are developed using photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) which have certain intrisnsic limit on spatial and temporal resolution. The prospect of designing PET scan systems with solid-state based pho- tomultipliers is quite rewarding in terms of detector miniaturization and higher spatial and temporal resolution. The thesis project presented hereafter discusses the design im- plementation of a small-animal PET scan detector module based on multichannel digital silicon photomultipliers (MD-SiPMs). It outlines the design details of the MD-SiPMs i.e., its pixel and array architec- ture, readout mechanism, on-chip time-to-digital converters (TDCs). The firmware development over field-programmable gate arrays (FP- GAs) is presented next, followed by radiation characterization using a 22Na radioactive source.

(mentor)","2016","The ease of availability of low cost aerial platforms has given rise to extensive research in the field of autonomous navigation. There are strong indications in existing research that UAV autonomy leads to significant gains in terms of safety as well as performance in a number of scenarios, including but not limited to search and rescue missions in disaster areas. This paper tackles the problem of autonomous indoor navigation by applying reinforcement learning. In specific terms, this paper employs hierarchical reinforcement learning methods in order to overcome the challenges posed by the complexity and size of the problem space when dealing with navigational problems. In addition, a feature-based relative state is used so as to contain the number of states to a manageable level, while ensuring that the learnt policies are perfectly valid, independent of the size of the problem. The findings of this paper successfully demonstrate the ability of the Options method to solve a complex navigation problem involving goal finding, room exiting and battery recharging in an efficient manner, and further to solve a problem that cannot be solved using traditional flat Q-learning. In addition, this paper provides evidence of the positive influence of prior high level knowledge on the learning rate for a navigation problem as a) the problem size scales up and b) the problem complexity scales up.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Control & Operations","","Control & Simulation","",""

(mentor)","2016","Within the Netherlands, house owners set up projects in which all houses within a neighbourhood are collectively renovated and equipped with distributed energy resources (DERs) at the same time. These projects are called ‘neighbourhood distributed energy resource projects’ (NDPs). As some of the equipped DERs electrify much of the heating previously generated by natural gas, and other equipped DERs produce electricity themselves, the electricity grid experiences a rise in electricity flow in these neighbourhoods. At certain times, the limits of the electricity grid will be exceeded, and black-outs will occur. Therefore, the distribution system operator (DSO) will have to invest in strengthening the electricity grid to prevent black-outs from happening. These investments are costly and because the DSO can not charge the costs directly to the NDP causing them, the DSO has to cover all the costs itself. However, as ICT-technology is advancing, an alternative solution becomes available: Steering the production and consumption of electricity of DERs, as such that the limit of the electricity grid is not exceeded, and expensive investments in strengthening the grid are not necessary. Instead of investing in strengthening the grid, the DSO could apply this ‘flexibility management’ option. It is however unknown how much grid limit excess would be reduced, and what the influence would be on the house owners. Therefore, the main research question this thesis seeks to answer is: How can a distribution system operator feasibly mitigate grid limit excess in neighbourhoods with a high penetration of distributed energy resources by applying direct control flexibility management, given the current Dutch institutional context? To answer this question, a desk study was performed on both the socio-economical side and the technical side of neighbourhood distributed energy resource projects. The obtained knowledge was used to construct a spreadsheet model which enabled for the comparison of different combinations of DERs and flexibility management options and the influence of these combinations on predefined key performance indicators (KPIs). The model incorporated the perspectives of both the DSO and the house owners, and was based on the case of the Netherlands. The following KPIs were considered: Net present value (NPV), grid limit excess and carbon emission reduction. Input data for the DERs in the spreadsheet model was based, among others, on historical data obtained from real life NDPs. The answer to the main research question is: The possibilities for the DSO to feasibly apply flexibility management to DERs in neighbourhood with a high penetration of DERs are highly dependent on the type of DERs being applied. Results show that only rigorous peak clipping and valley filling flexibility management options are able to completely eliminate grid limit excess. Other DER combinations were found that mitigate grid limit excess, but not completely eliminate it. Rigorous peak clipping and valley filling could feasibly be applied to DER combinations consisting of hybrid heat pumps and photovoltaics (PV). For other DER combinations, consisting of electric heat pumps and PV, flexibility management is not feasibly able to completely eliminate grid limit excess. Furthermore, if electric vehicles (EVs) were to be introduced to the NDPs, it would become even more difficult to feasibly eliminate grid limit excess, even for DER combinations consisting of hybrid heat pumps and PV. Future research could focus on if and how the DSO should compensate the house owners for the flexibility management applied. Other topics for future research include the way flexibility management by a DSO fits within the Dutch market environment as present, legal changes necessary for flexibility management and the costs and privacy issues occurring from developing the ICT-infrastructure needed for flexibility management should be discussed here. Furthermore, the model simulation used in the research could be further developed.","Distributed energy resources; distribution system operator; electricity grid; flexibility management; grid limit; house owners; neighbourhood","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Engineering, Systems and Services","","","",""

To determine the notional permeability of these intermediate structures, various hypotheses have been proposed. In this thesis, the IH-2VOF numerical model is used to predict the notional permeability for a range of intermediate structures based on the various hypothesizes. The hypothesizes used are indirect methods based on the ‘hypothetical’ flow into the core and prediction of the reflection coefficient.

(mentor)","2016","Double degree: MSc in Applied Sciences (SET) and MSc Thesis in EWI Faculty / Department DC systems, Energy conversion & Storage - - Wireless Power transfer is an innovative topic for electric vehicle charging, that has a very promising market implementation curve in the future. Many companies have shown interest in this topic while it consists a new way of charging with many challenges. Induction, as it is also called, is also used the latest two decades in lower powers, and even in the residential buildings as ovens or toothbrush and mobile chargers. The main idea of a wireless power charger is actually an air core transformer, that the leakages are compensated by added capacitances. This boosts the power that is delivered and many topologies exist, according to the application needed. In this thesis an effort was made to describe an 11kW system and the construction of it. The main topology that was used was SS, in which the primary and the secondary of the transformer have capacitors in series. The first part of the thesis is describing the general theory of semiconductors that are used. The typical material Si was avoided, since new promising SiC Mosfets and Diodes are offering higher power, speed and efficiency. The second part of the thesis is dedicated to the description of the inverter and boost converter hardware that was designed. Several scenarios were taken into account, in order to describe the theory behind the IPT system and the complication that may exist in a market product. Of course the resulted system needs improvement in order to obey the legislations needed, but the theory of operation behind it, is fully described. The main contribution through of this thesis is the EMI filtering that was proposed. Before the experimental description, several topologies were proposed to eliminate the EMI from its source, than eliminating the harmonics after their creation. The final part of the thesis, is describing the results from the laboratory experiments on the hardware that was designed during this thesis. The filters that were proposed are tested and efficiencies are calculated. Typical efficiencies of these systems with no filtering are about 89% while with the topologies offered the efficiency reduces to 85% but with zero EMI.","inductive power transfer; wireless power transfer; magnetic resonance; ZVS inverter; phase shift; EMI elimination; Faraday Box","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-09-30","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Electrical Sustainable Energy","","DC systems, Energy conversion & Storage","",""

(mentor); van der Vorst, R.R.R. (mentor)","2016","Guidelines for translating relevant zones in the HEMA stores into rituals, based on qualitative and literature research. Elaborated design of a ritual for the relevant zone in the HEMA stores, based on customer insights. The project set-up consists of an analysis phase, a research phase and a generation phase. Research in collaboration with the HEMA customer is an essential part of this thesis. By means of interviews, creative sessions and observations the optimal HEMA experience is retrieved from current customers. Research has shown first that there is not a particular zone in the current HEMA store that stands out either positive or negative. Concluding from the customer research the optimal HEMA experience consists of five aspects: Customers want to see what they can do with the product and/or where it came from. A context needs to be given. Inspiration with a ‘wink’ Customers want a quick-targeted route and a route to shop around. There has to be a clear difference between the departments. This can be done with colors, because they think that is typically HEMA. Customers want to try, taste and feel the products. The zone chosen to design for is the entrance area. In this zone, the shopping baskets are (amongst others) potentially suitable for designing a shopping ritual. Earlier customer journey research done by HEMA showed that the current shopping baskets are perceived negative. Customers do not know that the baskets are available or they are not satisfied with the usability of the current baskets. To enable customers in a HEMA store to have an optimal shopping experience, a new way of carrying products in the store is designed. This new design gives the customer the ability to keep their hands free while carrying multiple products. In this way the customer can feel and try new products from the shelves while shopping. This functions as inspiring. The customers can get a better image of the product and what they can do with that product. Since a large part of HEMA customers consists of young parents, and especially young mothers, children are thought of as well. Shopping with young children can be chaotic and difficult. Giving children a role in the shopping experience makes them feel appreciated and exciting to go shopping at HEMA. Parents can go shop more relaxed when they do not have to think of how to involve their children in shopping. For the adults a canvas shopping bag is designed. The bag will change the way customers move around the HEMA store. Customers will always have both hands free. Currently customers always need one hand to hold the basket or to hold products. Using the bag will make their shopping experience more convenient. A design of Takkie, the famous dog of Jip & Janneke, is converted into a pull cart for children. Jip & Janneke and their dog are very recognizable HEMA characters. Takkie is chosen because next to the recognisability for HEMA, it gives children the idea of walking the dog. Children can use this cart within the store to carry around the products they or their parents want to buy. The final designs are created by developing and testing multiple prototypes. Finally, professional prototypes are produced to test in a pilot within a HEMA store in the Netherlands in September 2016.","shopping ritual; customer experience","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovatie Management","","","",""

Among these, communication using visible light (VLC) has gained considerable momentum. The imminent adoption of energy efficient Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs) and the high data transmission rates offered by VLC has greatly contributed to the spread of visible light as a competitive communication medium. Apart from communication, another area greatly benefiting from visible light is localization. A significant amount of work has been done in localization for VLC based networks, however most of the methods proposed are dependent on either surrounding environments or require multiple reference points at fixed positions for localization. These dependencies greatly restrict localization for scenarios where a lot of mobility is involved, such as vehicles on a road, or robots in an industrial environment. This master thesis presents a localization model which can be used to find the relative position of devices or nodes without such dependencies. Compared to the existing work in this field, in our proposed model, nodes are free to move and rotate in any direction, and only require a single light source for position estimation. We present a mathematical model for relative localization and a software implementation to visualize the location of nodes in real-time. Results from experiments conducted in both static and mobile settings under different illumination levels validate our proposed model. These results also highlight the effect of errors in received power and orientation of nodes on localization accuracy. Our work indicates that this proposed model can be further extended and implemented in a real world scenario.","visible light; communication; localization; mobile","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Software Technology","","Embedded Software","",""

(mentor); Rutten, M.M. (mentor)","2016","Additional thesis - Rapid advancements in satellite observation technologies have resulted in an unprecedented availability of remotely sensed rainfall characteristics. These freely available precipitation measurements could be of great value for improving current weather prediction, particularly in developing countries where other data is scarce. A key parameter to derive rainfall intensities is the drop size distribution (DSD). Data of the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission provides amongst others the DSD and rainfall intensity, but it is unknown how well the device can convert the DSD to rain intensity. Therefore the main goal of this study is validating the GPM measurement results, by using ground based disdrometers. The disdrometers were located in De Bilt (The Netherlands), Yangon and Bago (Myanmar). In the Netherlands an industrial standard Thies LPM was used, whereas in Myanmar innovative Delft-disdrometers were tested. DSD’s obtained from the Thies LPM showed a decreasing peak for increasing rainfall intensities, which corresponds to DSD theory. In most cases the DSD’s of the Thies LPM and GPM were comparable with an average R2 of 0.9. On the other hand, the rainfall intensities for these two datasets were not comparable with a relative error varying between 49 and 3314 %. The very limited joint occurrence of satellite flyover and rain events caused insufficient data for validation in Myanmar. The data obtained from the Delft-disdrometer in Yangon showed that, despite the limitations of this innovative device, it is possible to produce representative DSD.","Rainfall; Drop size distribution; Satallite remote sensing; Delft-disdrometer; Thies LPM","en","student report","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Water Management","","","",""

It is very important to ensure the safety of the patient along with other personnel in the operation theater and prevent damages to the equipment during an intervention. Due to the complex environment and multiple unknown dynamic objects in the room, vision-based safety system has been regarded as a promising solution to the safety issue in such an environment in recent years. Moreover, the evolving pace of depth dense measuring by modern low-cost camera technologies has been fueling the scientific community to contribute to the healthcare applications. This work aims at developing a vision-based safety system in the intervention room to ensure collision-free trajectory of the C-arm integrated into the Philips Allura Xper X-ray Imaging device. The system is designed to accomplish the task of automatically identify the trajectory area of the C-arm in the room and then to avoid collisions in the identified area. The technique of locating trajectory area is realized by point cloud registration while the collision avoidance is ensured by detecting free-space in the area. The accuracy of the system has been evaluated for several practical cases. The collision avoidance algorithm showed accurate verdicts of declaring safe movements of the C-arm for all the cases while the automatic trajectory identification suffers from a drawback of correct registration, especially, due to the limited view frustum of the camera setup in the scene. The proposed system incorporates a prototype safety solution applicable to clinical setup.","safety; computer vision; depth image; depth sensor; medical robotics; intervention room; object detection; free-space detection","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Intelligent Systems / Comp Graphics & Visualisation","","Computer Science - Digital Media Technology (ICT Innovation - EIT Digital Master School)","",""

The shell formation was analysed for MoSi2B healing particles alloyed with 2, 6 and 12 wt% Al. According to oxidation kinetics study at 1100˚C using thermogravimetry, MoSi2B-12 wt% Al particles formed exclusive alumina formation via selective oxidation of Al due to the more homogeneous distribution of Mo(Si1-x,Alx)2 among the particles. A more exclusive alumina formation was also favoured by oxidation in lower pO2 using CO/CO2 (ratio of 4.2, pO2 of 9.1x10-14 atm) compared to oxidation in pure Argon. The shell formation of the Al-alloyed MoSi2B particles inside YSZ matrix composite was also studied. However, oxidation of composite containing MoSi2B-12 wt% Al in the CO/CO2 resulted in simultaneous oxidation of Al and Si with mixed silica-alumina was formed. This suggests zirconia matrix may play a role in oxidising the particles by partial reduction of YSZ. Nevertheless, shell showed protection for particles even after microcapsule stability test at 1100˚C in laboratory air for 100 hours. Crack-gap filling experiment was conducted for composites containing pre-encapsulated and in situ encapsulated MoSi2B-6 wt% Al particles. Healing treatment was done with exposing the composites at 1100 ˚C for 1, 4 and 16 hours in laboratory air.

(mentor)","2016","In pursuit of saving mother nature, man has been extending his boundaries to find renewable sources of energy. Wind being one of them, has been exploited in the past years with offshore wind gaining high popularity in the recent years. Owing to the high capital costs of the offshore wind sector, research has been directed to focus on technology and science that could ultimately contribute in cost reduction of offshore wind projects. One such science is the mechanism of damping. Damping, which is often described as ‘dissipation of energy stored in a dynamic system’, can indirectly play an important role in determining the structural configuration of the support structure and the foundation of an offshore wind turbine. A higher value of overall damping can be associated with either an increase in fatigue life or a reduction in overall structural weight. In both the cases there is significant aid to foundation cost cutting. Currently, a typical value of 2-3% (of critical) is used within the industry as an overall damping estimate with little understanding about the contribution of soil damping. This thesis focuses on developing a methodology to compute soil damping coefficients for the case of suction pile foundation and further apply it to a Suction Installed Wind Turbine (SIWT) structure to find soil damping in the form of modal damping percentage.The thesis objective is tackled by using two case studies from projects executed by SPT Offshore. The first case study proposed a method to calculate the vertical damping coefficient (Cv) for an individual suction pile using forced vibration analysis in PLAXIS. Two interesting conclusions were drawn from this case-study; • the Cv increased with an increase in the forcing amplitude. • the Cv decreased with increasing loading frequency (ω), while the product of Cv and ω increased with increasing ω. The second case study implemented the proposed methodology (of the first case study) to a SIWT structure in order to calculate the modal soil damping percentage for the first two modes of the structure using modal analysis. The results when compared with logarithmic decrement percentages, gave similar estimates. The found influence of soil on the damping of this particular structure is significantly larger than the order of magnitude used in the industry today.","Soil damping; Suction pile; three legged jacket","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","","","",""

These systems use occupancy and light sensor data to adapt artificial light in accordance with changing occupancy and daylight conditions. In these systems, the performance relies on a pre-calibration phase to achieve daylight adaptation of artificial light. Since the pre-calibrated value is achieved by artificial light, the changes of daylight and/or reflectance changes can cause deviations against desired illumination. For example, the deviation takes place when the daylight distribution is affected by the reflectance changes in the environment. Additionally, these systems cannot account for individual user preferences at the workplace in real-time. A contribution of this thesis is to introduce human interaction to the smart lighting control system, taking user's satisfaction into account to achieve better performance in terms of the desired illumination. A proposed sensor-driven human-in-the-loop lighting control system is developed to incorporates user feedback in addition to occupancy and light sensor inputs. Camera-based visible light communication (VLC) is applied for the user to identify the luminaires within its neighborhood by its smartphone camera. Also, the intensity sensed by the smartphone camera is used as the illumination information offered from the user. A control algorithm is designed that incorporates these user inputs along with occupancy and light sensor inputs to determine the dimming levels of the luminaires to achieve illumination levels acceptable to users.The performance of the proposed lighting control system is compared with the state-of-the-art lighting control system in an experimental office space environment.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Software Technology","","Embedded Software Group / Embedded Systems","",""

(mentor)","2016","Digital platforms have worldwide transformed the way citizens organise themselves to address public issues, resulting in social citizen platforms that affect traditional forms of public service delivery. Simultaneously, governments seek a smaller, partner-level role in public service delivery. Governments therefore both have an interest in social citizen platforms and are uncertain about what responses suit the new role of government. Knowledge about why and how local governments respond to the emergence of social citizen platforms is missing, both in science and practice. A qualitative research and a case study are conducted to analyse the motives and instruments of Dutch local governments via a perspective of collaborative governance theory, taking into account the characteristics of three phenomena – citizen self-organisation, social innovation, and digital platforms – that together shape the concept of social citizen platforms. Motives to respond are 1) ideological grounds, 2) to enhance benefits and 3) to mitigate undesired characteristics. Governance instruments are identified, as well as challenges that local governments experience in their decision making process. The scientific value of this paper lies in making a first attempt to analyse the tension between the societal emergence of social citizen platforms and governments that want to properly respond to that development while maintaining a collaborative, facilitating role. Future research areas are the long term effects of the identified governance instruments, a cross-country comparison, and how challenges contribute to non-decisions.","citizen self-organisation; social innovation; digital platform; local government; collaborative governance","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Policy, Organisation, Law & Management","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","An ever-increasing demand for electricity pushes the wind energy industry to deep waters that favor floating concepts. Vertical axis wind turbines (VAWTs) failed for onshore applications in the 1980s, but its advantages raise the potential for competitive floating designs and ultimately lowering the cost of energy. This thesis aims to (1) better understand the dynamic response characteristics of such floating concept and (2) critically evaluate numerical tools able to perform fully coupled dynamic analysis on floating VAWTs. The studied wind energy converter is a combination of DeepWind’s two-bladed Darrieus rotor and the OC3 spar floater. A comparative study is made between this spar concept and the equivalent land-based VAWT in both steady and unsteady wind-wave environments. The dynamic responses are calculated by the aero-hydro-servo-elastic code SIMO-RIFLEX-AC, designed to model physical phenomena as accurately and efficiently as possible. Efficiencydriven design solutions imply simplifications in the field of aerodynamic, hydrodynamic and structural modeling. The effect of modeling theories on the calculated dynamic response of the spar VAWT is studied in a code-to-code comparison between HAWC2 and SIMO-RIFLEXAC. Special attention is devoted to the aerodynamic models, which are both based on the Actuator Cylinder (AC) flow theory. The model-comparison shows high energy content at the 2P frequency in most responses, this characterizes the two-bladed Darrieus rotor. Aerodynamic loads excite the first tower modes (close to 2P) of the land-based VAWT, whereas the spar VAWT hints to a tower mode around the 4P frequency. Tower tilt of the spar concept – pitch offset extends up to !"" – induces gravitational loads at the tower base and blades, and also reduce the generated power up to 5%. Dynamic content from hydrodynamic loads is strongly felt at the tower base, but the effect of wind turbulence is more significant in terms of platform motions and rotor speed. Introducing wind turbulence reduces the aerodynamic and structural loads. The code-to-code comparison shows that HAWC2’s aerodynamic model calculates lower loads in steady wind, but higher aerodynamic torque in turbulent wind. Dynamic stall significantly increases the lift force in the downwind half of the rotor, causing an overall increase of aerodynamic load at low tip-speed ratios. The wave-induced platform response is stronger in HAWC2, which is also felt at the tower base. The physical mooring system in SIMO-RIFLEX-AC endures an increased mean tension, but its standard deviation is lower.","Vertical Axis Wind Turbines (VAWTs); AC Flow Theory; Fully coupled dynamic analysis; Code-to-code comparison; HAWC2; SIMO-RIFLEX-AC; EWEM; NTNU","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","In online stores, the lack of physical contact with products could sometimes make it difficult for customers to clearly evaluate the product. Clothing, for example, without direct touching people might not be confident about purchasing because there is not enough information for the material. On the other hand, limited interaction with the online products could mislead product perceptions and sometimes cause mismatch with the actual one. In this case, customers are disappointed. Several technologies have been developed to tackle this issue. For example, with zoom-in technologies online shoppers can interactively examine product details. Other technologies like full-angle viewing or short movies are also deployed in many fashion and apparel online stores. Researches indicated that these technologies can improve online shopping experience, and call for the continuous development of advanced online interaction. Therefore, this project aims to explore a new form of online product interaction, which simulates people’s real-life behaviours through interactive movies. It is expected to enhance the communication of product properties and increase online engagement. To start with, insights on how people interact with products in real life were gathered through in-store observation. Sketches were made and clustered to provide the basis for prototyping. After an iteration process, 12 final prototypes of interactive movies were made online (scan the QR-code on this page). Products were selected based on the observation results, and each of them stands for certain feature(s). Next, an experiment was conducted to test these movies. The goal was to examine if these interactive movies could enhance online product communication and increase engagement, compared to still images. Test results indicate that these interactive movies marginally enhance the product communication, while significantly increase engagement. In other words, they are very novel, fun, and interesting to play, but might need further improvement to communicate products better. Directions for further study on this topic are 1) combining actual/pseudo force on more products, 2) putting products in context instead of plain background, and 3) keeping hands in the movie instead of only showing the product. For industrial practice, it is recommended to 1) combine more interaction for one product, 2) use interactive movies for key product features, and 3) develop interactive movies for similar products for customers to compare.","cinematics; online products","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","","",""

(mentor); Terwel, K.C. (mentor); Broersma, S. (mentor)","2016","The importance of energy and sustainability issues related to buildings and built environment is constantly increasing. Developed countries are already dealing with these issues by adjusting their building codes and by introducing sustainability assessment methods as an important part of building projects. But how can developing countries with all its challenges and a focus that is understandingly more pointed towards escaping poverty than thinking about long term sustainability deal with these issues? In this thesis, I assessed the possibilities for an integral design of an energy neutral and sustainable office building in Rwanda, a small country in the heart of Africa and one of the few developing countries that is progressing very fast. I chose to work out the design of a - potentially to be built - office space where the embassies of 6 EU countries could set up office, a project that I named the 'European House'. The main research question of this study is How can a European house in Kigali be optimally designed in an energy neutral and sustainable way? To find answers to this question, the climate of the location, its challenges and opportunities in terms of building design were studied. I also researched locally available construction materials and in general construction materials that could be applied on the project. To get some quantitative values of sustainable issues, a few rating systems were considered. Eventually, I applied the BREEAM International rating system and described how, in this specific context, the European House could score an outstanding rate. Following a literature study, case studies were introduced in order to see what kind of strategies did similar projects use in similar climates (Kenia, Zimbabwe and Malaysia) and what were their achievements regarding sustainability issues. As the European House physically did not exist, some space limitations/dimension requirements needed to be determined by interviewing potential users of the EU House. Representatives of 5 embassies in Kigali filled in my questionnaire, describing their potential spatial requirements, which helped defining the size of building and set further boundaries for the sketch design of the European House. The following conclusions have been drawn based on the proposed sketch design: Use of local/regional building materials Multi-story buildings are almost exclusively made out of concrete in Rwanda, with currently very little focus on sustainability. Recently increased tax rates on cement imported out of east African community will hopefully contribute to the reduction of the embodied energy of the concrete used in Rwanda. With high demand of concrete on one side and its low availability on the other, Rwandan building market will have to search for some appropriate alternatives. When applying timber bearing structure on the European House, the total environmental cost of the bearing structure is 0,21€ per m2 GFA. In this case, the wooden bearing structure offers much less environmental impact than other possible solutions (concrete and steel) and therefore it is the preferred choice. However, timber in Rwandan constructions is still not being used in structural applications, even though it offers great potentials and it is available and possible to be imported from DR Congo – Rwanda’s neighboring country. Passive and active design strategies The following passive strategies proved to be effective in the Kigali climate and could therefor be applied to the European House design: Orientation – long narrowly designed buildings with long side along north/south facade Shading devices – horizontal devices should be installed on northern and southern facades Size of windows: wall/window/ratio should be at least 40%, European House window dimensions should be 1,8x1,8m Natural ventilation: On the proposed design of the European House, the best applicable method is natural side ventilation Active design strategies Focusing on sun and wind local potentials, Energy potential mapping gives encouraging results. Most of the locally available energy could be obtained from the sun, in case all the roof area would be covered by Photovoltaics. In order to assure buildings self-efficiency, it is essential to have an energy storage system/battery, to be able to use the harvested energy in different moments if needed. In the Equator area (which is the case in Rwanda), the solar generation does not change a lot during the year and therefore no large amount of storage is needed. Storage that equals to 3,5 days of average generation should serve as a reasonable backup (this equals to the storage capacity of 1061 kwh in case of Rwanda). In conclusion - with integrating passive and active design strategies on the European House design, 2,5 times more energy is obtained than required. BREEAM International sustainable assessment BREEAM proved to be a very useful tool on the road to sustainable and energy neutral design in the Rwandan context. BREEAM International credits studied in the Rwandan context show that most of them are actually possible to reach, assuming that the project team is experienced in the BREEAM field and that clear goals are set from the very beginning of each project. In theory there are no real obstacles to obtain high credit scores in the Rwanda. However some of the BREEAM International credits would need to be adapted to the local Rwandan context. This regards mostly the credits that are referenced to the local legislations. In conclusion – the example of the European House in Kigali shows that an energy neutral and sustainable office building is possible in Rwanda. Perfect climate conditions and renewable energy potentials are there, to be discovered and used in a smart and responsible way. Rwanda of course misses many things, without which some parts of my analysis would be hard to materialize – like an environmental database for different types of construction materials. Further more, many parts of the BREEAM analysis are assumed to be achieved under good management and financial means which are both hard to find in Rwanda. However, the realization of this or a similar project could inspire a new way to look at possibilities for sustainable and energy neutral buildings in Rwanda. Recommendations for other developing countries · Make a climate study of the location a ‘must’ for any type of construction project in order to reduce the overall energy costs and building performance, even if this is not required by local building regulations · Introducing sustainable assessment methods (BREEAM International) in projects in developing countries encourages the use of passive strategies and influences sustainable outcomes. BREEAM International is a valuable tool to be applied on projects in developing countries. However, when certain datas are not available, one needs to be resourceful · Often the choices of materials applied for structures is related to the fact that local workers only know specific methods and are ‘afraid to build differently’; Rwanda’s recent example shows that local workers can easily be trained to use different building techniques · The benefits and high potentials of sustainable and energy neutral buildings in developing countries need to be better explained and promoted to all parties involved. Suggestions for further research based on this thesis · Further improvement of other widely used construction materials (adobe bricks) and their structural application in multi story buildings in Rwanda · Possibilities of creating a Rwanda National scheme based on BREEAM International Assessment · Challenges of building techniques from vernacular to modern in Rwanda · In case of rising temperatures due to climate change, what kind of consequences would this have on the natural ventilation possibilities in European House","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","Building Engineering","",""

For one dimensional, incompressible, immiscible three-phase flow in a homogeneous medium without gravity and capillary pressure, loss of strict hyperbolicity can occur for certain relative permeability models causing problems when solving the three-phase flow model numerically. To avoid loss of strict hyperbolicity, a set of three curves is used to determine the existence of an elliptic region and modelling three-phase relative permeability is seen as an interpolation problem between two two-phase relative permeabilities. This results in a new type of three-phase relative permeability model where the relative permeabilities of all three phases depend on both the water and gas saturation. The new relative permeability models are able to avoid loss of strict hyperbolicity in some cases where the existing relative permeability models resulted in an elliptic region, however, the new relative permeability models do not guarantee strict hyperbolicity for all situations. This leads to the view that a relative permeability model must be chosen for each situation separately.","elliptic region; loss of strict hyperbolicity; three-phase porous media flow","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Delft Institute of Applied Mathematics","","Numerical Analysis","",""

(mentor)","2016","Circular Hollow Section (CHS) are widely utilized as a structure element due to its excellent property of compression, tension, bending and torsion resistance as well as the less consumption of materials. However, the connection joint of the CHS is the place where we should pay attention because of the stress concentration effect, which may lead to the fatigue damage and even structure fail. For offshore tubular structures in the North Sea, the fatigue failure mode must be taken into consideration because of the arduous ocean conditions. The work present in this master thesis focus on the SCF on tripod joint due to both reference and carry-over loading in order to make a precise determination of the geometry stress on this multi-planar tubular joint. In the first part of the master thesis, the 20 node solid element modelled weld profile according to AWS specification is introduced because previous studies have shown that the SCF is sensitive to the weld shape. Apart from this, mesh generation method which include a fine mesh around the stress concentration area and a coarse one in the far field area is introduced to trade-off between computation efficiency and result reliability. Then SCF on the reference brace due to axial loading, in-plane bending and out-of-plane bending is investigated through ANSYS based on the surface linear extrapolation method. Extensively parametric FE analysis is carried out and database is established to compare the correlation of SCF between the FE analysis results and existing T/Y joint equation calculated values. In the final part of the thesis, carry-over effect induced SCF’s, related to the three different types of reference loadings are achieved through FE analysis in ANSYS. Besides, the corresponding equations to calculate the carry-over induced SCF value are proposed.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-09-28","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Marine & Transport Technology","","","",""

First, the luminescence properties of sodium iodine (NaI) crystals doped with thallium (Tl) and co-doped with Sulpher (S) and selenium (Se) were determined. Tl occupies cation sites whereas S and Se are supposed to occupy anion sites in the NaI crystal lattice. Doping with both S and Se led to colouring of the crystals and were not dissolved into the NaI crystal. The light yield and resolution of these crystals were reduced compared with NaI doped with only Tl (NaI:Tl). A fast light intensity decay component was observed for low temperatures (77 – 150 K) when exciting the NaI:Tl crystal with relatively low energy X-rays ($<$40 keV). This fast component may be responsible for the increase in light yield when going from 150 to 77 K. Next, the luminescence properties of cerium bromide (CeBr$_3$) crystals co-doped with cadmium (Cd), yttrium (Y), lutetium (Lu), and double co-doped with strontium (Sr) and sodium (Na), and strontium (Sr) and calcium (Ca). All co-dopants when dissolved occupy cation sites in the CeBr$_3$ crystal lattice. The Ce$^{3+}$ cations act as a luminescence centre. The CeBr$_3$ with isovalent co-dopants (Y, Lu), showed perturbation of the Ce$^{3+}$ doublet and light traps where this was not expected. The improvement of the light yield at low temperatures is stronger for the CeBr3:Lu crystal compared with that of the undoped and the Y co-doped CeBr$_3$ crystals, suggesting that Lu is better dissolved than Y into the CeBr$_3$ crystal. The divalent co-dopant Cd results in a strong perturbation of the Ce$^{3+}$ doublet and so-called deep traps in the CeBr$_3$ crystal. This causes a weak thermoluminescence intensity as well as low light yield, which strongly improve with decreasing temperature. The double co-doped CeBr$_3$:Sr,Ca crystal showed the strongest perturbation of the Ce$^{3+}$ doublet and highest thermoluminescence below 200 K. This is reflected by the decrease of the light yield in the temperature range of 77 to 200 K. The double co-doped CeBr3:Sr,Na crystal show a weak perturbation of the Ce$^{3+}$ doublet and a weak thermoluminescence due to a low trapping probability for electrons. The CeBr$_3$ crystal with Sr,Ca displays the most proportional behaviour and the highest resolution as well as light yield. The crystal with Sr,Na as co-dopants, on the contrary, has a low resolution and low light yield. The isolvalent co-dopants Y and Lu both showed a moderate proportional behaviour and a low resolution, but Y resulted in a low whereas Lu in a high light yield. The CeBr$_3$ with Lu as co-dopant shows an anomaly at 8 keV in the non-proportionality response curve (proportionality equals 40\%). Cd as a co-dopant displayed the lowest light yield and a low resolution, but a reasonable proportionality. The low resolution of all co-dopants except for Sr,Ca were caused by inhomogeneity of the crystals.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Applied Sciences","Applied Physics","","","",""

The luminal narrowing caused by the growing of the plaque has been commonly used for identification of plaque rupture risk. However, there have been signs that plaque composition is also important in the identification of plaque rupture risk. Quantitative Magnetic Resonance Imaging is able to characterize and quantify plaque composition by estimating magnetic resonance tissue properties, T1 and T2. In this thesis we evaluate the reproducibility of T1 and T2 estimation on data acquired from nine healthy volunteers. For reproducibility purposes, these volunteers were scanned twice with the same protocol. Several challenges are imposed on the fitting of T1 and T2 on the acquired images. Firstly, the number of acquired images is low, which may result in inaccuracy of the estimated parameters. Hereto, the fitting was performed on the complex MR signal, as opposed to the magnitude MR signal which is more commonly used. The second challenge is due to a translation between the images due to patient movement, as well as translation between the images acquired in both scan sessions. In this thesis we propose three image registration methods that enable us to decrease the translation between images. Our results show that the reproducibility of T1 and T2 with our proposed methods is sufficient to potentially allow the characterization of several plaque components. For further analysis of our method on the estimation of T1 and T2, patients need to be scanned.","quantitative MRI; image processing; carotid artery; atherosclerotic plaque; maximum likelihood estimation; image registration; T1 and T2 estimation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Biomechanical Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","Magnetic Drug Targeting could be used to cure atherosclerosis in the Carotid Artery. The idea of this method is that magnetized drug particles are added to the blood in the artery while applying a magnetic field at the location where the drugs is desired to enter the tissue. Therefore the concentration increases at the location of the atherosclerosis while minimizing the side effects in the rest of the body. For the prediction of the amount of drugs entering the tissue it is necessary to accurately determine the flow profiles in the Carotid Artery. Since the geometry of the Carotid Artery is unique for each person, a cheap and fast method to accomplish flow profiles is demanded. Simulations using Computational Fluid Dynamics could meet these requirements. To validate Computational Fluid Dynamics simulations, experimental velocity measurements in a model of a Carotid Artery Bifurcation were performed. Particle Image Velocimetry and Magnetic Resonance Imaging were performed in the Carotid Artery Bifurcation and Particle Image Velocimetry and Laser Doppler Anemometry were performed in a cylinder, wherefore an analytical solution is available. The reproducibility of Particle Image Velocimetry results was tested by comparing the measurements with previous work. Three different measuring techniques were used. The Particle Image Velocimetry results in the Carotid Artery Bifurcation showed indeed similar results. In addition, the possibility of constructing a quasi-3D model of data from different planes was investigated. It was concluded that due to interpolations a significant amount of information is ignored when the data from different planes were combined. Phase-ContrastMagnetic Resonance Imaging experimentswere repeated with some recommended improvements implemented. Smoothness of the images has improved. Qualitatively the results show in general good agreement with the PIV results. Finally, Laser Doppler Anemometry was tested as measuring technique to measure the flow in the Carotid Artery Bifurcation model. Therefore the technique was tested in a cylinder. In general the results show good agreement. Moreover, a high resolution could be obtained if the refractive conditions are of sufficient quality.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Applied Sciences","Chemical Engineering","","Transport Phenomena","",""

This thesis is concerned with system identification methods related to a nuclear norm pareto optimization. These algorithms try to join 2 families of system identification methods, the PEM and SID, this with the purpose of trying to find a balance or trade-off between the complexity of the system identified and the goodness of the fitting criterion. The nuclear norm heuristics are used widely as a convex approximation for the RMP.

This algorithm will rename and stack data to construct a matrix that thanks to the properties assumed in the system it can be defined as a upper triangular lowrank matrix. The objective is to see if this method brings any benefits compared to the already existent low rank matrix mechanisms that are inspired by structural analysis or the instrumental variables and/or projections methods. A step further was taken to provide the framework for this method named N2PBSID algorithm by providing the steps necessary for the implementation of this optimization problem on MATLAB. Lastly, several experiments are performed and a number of conclusions are drawn from them.

Breaching is the most unknown process and has a low predictability. Dredge mining is strongly influenced by the breaching process. If breaching can be accurately predicted, the efficiency of the dredging production can be maximised.It is the objective to know what field- and lab tests must be conducted to be able to predict the breaching behaviour of a slope. In this report, a model is developed to predict the breaching behaviour of a slope after a single cut at the toe of the slope is made. The model is used to research the influence of several soil parameters and geometrical parameters on the breaching behaviour. The most important criterion is the difference between stable and unstable breaching. An empirical relation is created which can be used to estimate the critical cut height. This is the height at which a smaller cut height creates a stable breach and a larger cut creates an unstable breach. The critical cut height is dependent on the particle size distribution represented by the D50 and the D-10, the particle density and the slope angle. By using these parameters, the breaching process can be predicted. The critical cut height can be used to predict what the best cut depth for a certain slope and dredger is. After the first cut, usually several more cuts are made in order to keep the production at a high level. This process is not extensively researched in the past, so a second simplified model is created which predicts the breaching production in 3D and can incorporate multiple cuts. The model incorporates a swinging motion by the cutter, which is essential for a dredging operation. The model can demonstrate different phenomena which might occur during a dredging operation. It will illustrate examples of consequences of a slow or fast swinging motion, large or small delay times between swings and differences in swing widths. The input parameters necessary for the model can be obtained from field- and lab tests. Several field- and lab tests are advised after analysis of the model. The tendency of the soil to either breach or liquefy can be estimated by a state parameter analysis using CPT data. It might however be more suitable to use an SPT, in this case the SPT data gives a direct indication of the relative density which can also be used to estimate the ability to breach. A sieving is necessary to obtain the particle size distribution in order to obtain the D50 and the D10. A pycnometer test is necessary in order to obtain the particle density. The angle of repose can be determined with a lab test or a correlation with SPT data. In order to get a better estimate of the permeability, it is advised to do an auger hole test to measure the permeability more accurately. The data from these tests are suitable to predict the breaching behaviour of any submerged slope around the world.","Dredging; Breaching","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","","",""

For fulfilling these needs there is, a large selection of high performance computing platforms exists. These platforms vary in terms of architecture as well as their flexibility in terms of programming and programming models. Therefore, programmers need to be able qualify their needs and align them to the corresponding platform and tools. Computational finance is an area where being able to adapt to the constantly increasing amount of data, as well as reducing simulation times is a primary concern. Many computational finance applications, such as option pricing, algorithmic high frequency trading and risk management have their own HPC requirements. In this thesis, we investigate the computational requirements of a scenario based ALM application, which is part of a commercial product offered by Ortec-Finance. Also, we propose a novel OpenCL implementation, optimized for the Intel Xeon Phi co-processor. Further, we evaluate the performance portability of the proposed solution to other platforms such as a high-end CPU and an NVIDIA GPU. In general, with deploying simple optimization techniques we manage to achieve a speed-up up to 150x for Intel Xeon Phi, compared with the initial sequential implementation. Also, we prove that for our application, OpenCL yields significantly improved results in comparison with OpenMP on the Phi. In addition, we show that by following basic optimization guidelines, a certain level of performance can be preserved among different platforms (CPU, GPU, and Phi). Overall, our results show that our OpenCL ALM implementation is suitable for multiple accelerators, and it promises to yield significant performance improvements compared with current state-of-the-art implementations.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Software Technology","","Distributed Systems","",""

An approximation for skin friction is included. The method passes numerical verification. The computed flow field and interaction forces are compared with experimental results in various conditions, showing that the method performs well enough to be useful in the design of navigation channels and to make initial computations on flow fields beneath ships. Modelling errors limit the applicable range of the method so that it is not ready to be used in a general manoeuvring simulator.

This study aims to contribute to the creation of an affect-adaptive system that can recognize negative moods of elderly in care homes from a video feed, and improve it by adapting the lighting in the room. An affective database of videos portraying different moods is required to train such a system. While many affective databases exist already, they are primarily targeting emotions rather than mood. Therefore, we introduce a new database of annotated videos that can be used for mood recognition. To maintain control over which moods are depicted in the videos in the database, we combine the use of mood induction and acted performance to portray the moods in a realistic way, incorporating in the acted scripts the results from a series of interviews with caretakers in care homes. The database covers three visual modalities: body, face and 3D Kinect data for a total of 24 hours of recorded video material. We use crowdsourcing to annotate such a large amount of material in terms of perceived mood of the person portrayed in the videos, by outsourcing via the internet the annotation task to a large number of paid annotators. A risk of using crowdsourcing is unreliable annotator performance, due to the low level of control applicable to the annotation process. We deal with this problem by filtering the annotations according to predefined criteria, checking for task commitment and self-consistency of the annotators. We validate our use of the combination of induction and actors with a comparison between the intended mood, the mood felt by the actors, and the mood perceived by annotators. Furthermore, we demonstrate that crowdsourcing is a promising tool for the annotation of mood.","automatic affect recognition; crowdsourcing; multimodal database; emotion recognition; mood recognition; affective annotation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Intelligent Systems","","Interactive Intelligence","",""

(mentor); Rusák, Z. (mentor); Luijten, J. (mentor)","2016","This report covers the design of a product to help stroke survivors who are suffering from chronic spasticity manage their everyday activities. In the Netherlands alone, 44.000 people suffer from a Cerebro-Vascular Accident (CVA) each year. A CVA, more commonly known as a stroke, results in brain trauma with afflictions such as paralysis, fatigue and spasticity. It is possible to recover some, if not all, motor function though intensive physiotherapy, which requires long-term stay at a rehabilitation clinic in severe cases. Due to limited room and staff, only 12% of stroke survivors end up rehabilitating in a clinic. The remaining survivors are sent home, and will to travel to the clinic 3-5 times per week for therapy as part of the outpatient rehabilitation. Adjuvo Motion, a young start-up, aims to improve the situation of stroke survivors by bringing the rehabilitation centre to their home through the Adjuvo Platform, which allows them to perform exercises in the context of virtual tasks. They proposed an assignment to extend their product portfolio with a Range of Motion assessment device that is suited for those suffering from spasticity. Spasticity occurs in roughly 60% of stroke survivors with varying degrees of intensity. It is caused by the damaged parts of the brain sending conflicting signals to the muscles, causing them to contract. This inhibits the survivor’s ability to perform daily tasks, but can be solved temporarily with stretching exercises. A solution to compensate for these spastic forces using a passive-assist device was proposed at the start of this project. The project was divided into four stages: Analysis, Synthesis, Embodiment and Evaluation. During the Analysis stage, interviews with a Physiotherapist and stroke survivor and literature studies regarding anatomy, the state of the art and relevant technologies were used to create a framework for the design of a smart passive-assist glove. Looking at competing products, there is a demand for passive assist and Range of Motion assessment functionalities, yet a combination of these in a single device is not yet present in the market. During the Synthesis stage, the design problem of the passive assist device was split into three groups: Orthoses; the connections to the body, Passive Assist; the compensation medium, and RoM measurement; the sensing mechanism(s). These three groups were further split into sub-problems, the solutions to which were compiled into a Morphological Chart. By combining the solution within this chart, three promising concept designs were created: One upgrade to the existing sensor glove, one full integration of sensing and passive assist, and one passive assist glove with removeable sensors. To evaluate these concepts, eight criteria were established and weighted with the help of a physiotherapist. In order to create an objective assessment, the criteria were kept strictly quantitative and the three designs were first scored against the Raphael Smart Glove by Neofect using early prototypes. These scores were then used to evaluate the designs relative to each other, which resulted in an overall higher score for the concept with separable electronics. Making the sensor part of the brace removeable allowed the product to be used during daily life as well as physiotherpy exercises, and proved a key benefit in keeping the product clean. Based on the chosen design, four iterations of prototypes were made, which were tested with healthy subject. During this stage, it became clear that flex sensors are be best suited to create a range of motion assessment for spastic stroke patients, since it is less important to know how well they perform a task, and more important to know if they can actually perfrom it. Based on a quantified use case, the four sub-assemblies; the Wrist Wrap, Finger Modules and Sensor Module, and their connections were materialized in the Embodiment design stage. When selecting production methods, the main challenge was a small batch size of 1000 units, which made conventional techniques for mass production, such as Injection Molding, less attractive. This stage ended in an assesment of the product’s production price and durability: The product would cost €250 to make, and would last for 2.5 years before the Velcro connection on the Wrist Wrap would become too weak to sustain the spasticity forces. In the Evaluation stage, the product was evaluated on the seven most important requirements established during the analysis stage. For several of these, a user test was performed, again with healthy subject. While the Adjuvo Auxilius passed most theoretical requirements, the user tests on healthy subjects could not be used to draw any conclusions regarding its effectiveness on spastic stroke patients. However, since the product’s working principle is based on that of existing spasticity compensation products, the prediction is that the Auxilius will be an effective therapy supplement. The result of this project is the Adjuvo Auxilius; a spasticity-compensation glove with modular sensors, which can be added to allow virtual (stretching) exercises through the Adjuvo Motion’s platform. The results of these exercises are used to create a remote assessment of the patients motor skills, and to adjust the therapy if needed.","Medisign; Stroke; Rehabilitation; Spasticity; Physiotherapy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","Integrated Product Design","",""

Contactless positioning offers advantages, especially in terms of risk of breakage and contamination. A system is considered designed for contactless positioning by floating a silicon wafer on a thin film of air. This paper focuses on the design of a control system, including actuators, sensors and control method, suitable for this purpose. Two cascaded control loops, with decoupled SISO controllers, are implemented for this moving mass controlled on a mass-spring system, which can be modelled as a fourth order system. The SISO controllers are first designed with classic loopshaping tools, which are then modified using fractional control. Two arguments based on examples in this system are given for the application of fractional control. Firstly, to increase the bandwidth of a regular mass-spring system, and secondly to control a plant which behaves fundamentally fractional, such as the moving mass in this cascaded fourth order system. By merely the application of fractionality, the bandwidths are extended by 14.6 % and 62 %, for the inner and outer loop respectively. A closed-loop positioning bandwidth of the wafer of 60 Hz is achieved, resulting in a positioning error of 104 nm (2ơ value), which is limited by sensor noise and pressure disturbances. This paper shows how the extension of classic loopshaping tools with fractional control can directly improve the performance, without adding to the complicatedness of the control system. Moreover it demonstrates a working concept of a novel type of contactless actuator.","Fractional Order Control; Contactless actuation; cascade control; air-bearing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-09-27","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Precision and Microsystems Engineering (PME)","","Mechatronic System Design (MSD)","",""

(mentor); de Jong, W. (mentor)","2016","Synthesis gas, or syngas, is among the most common products of biomass gasification and pyrolysis process. Syngas is produced by various fuels such as coal, biomass and any other hydrocarbon material. The principal use of syngas is in gas turbines as a fuel. It may also be used as the constructive material in other applications, such as methanol synthesis or biodiesel. Syngas is a mixture of gases, primarily with compounds of Hydrogen and Carbon Monoxide. During gasification, other substances are created which can cause problems for the system machinery, and consequently create problems in the production of a final product. Harmful substances created in gasifiers include; nitrogen-based substance, sulfur-based substances, particulate matter, alkali metal, halides and tar compounds. These substances pose a threat to the system and may cause a series of problems at a further stage in the process. As gasification process is still under development, many case studies look at how different gas cleaning systems can eliminate or convert those contaminants from the syngas flows. Tar contaminants are the smallest product of the gasification process, however, they are consistently associated with malfunctions, such as pipe and filter blocking and deactivation of catalyst’s particles. The term “tar” includes all the hydrocarbon compounds with molecular weight above benzene. Tar cleaning systems continue to cause major technical barriers to gas cleaning systems due to their complexity, and the diversity between the compounds in tar. In order to save time and optimize the system’s operation conditions, the establishment of a computer program is essential. The use of this program in an operation could save time, may minimize the energy consumption, and lower the economic cost of the system. Tar cleaning systems are separated into two main categories; dry and wet methods. Dry methods are carried out using heat and catalyst particles to convert the heavy hydrocarbon compounds to useful and non - harmful light compounds. On the other hand, wet methods commonly use cooling and liquid agents in order to condense or absorb the tar compounds into secondary flows. To create the optimal computer program for this process, an extensive literature review exploring the existing cleaning systems and tar classification was carried out. The purpose of the literature review was to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the systems at work, including the contaminants. The literature review allowed for a deeper understanding of the cleaning principles and the properties of the tar contaminants. Consequently, a program was designed which could estimate conditions such as; flow rates, temperatures and pressure in order to have the most sustainable arrangement. Further to the literature review, ASPEN Plus was chosen as the program to simulate the gas cleaning scheme. The program was based on the wet-model theories. Due to the high complexity and the lack of detailed data of the chemical reactions and kinetics occurring in dry models, an extended description was given for the second cleaning method with two simulations based in some of the main reactions that are taking place in a commercialized reformer and an ideal simulation with an RGIBBS module. To draw comparison between the two systems, data from literature on established implementations which use dry cleaning systems were compared with the results from AspenPlus used in this study. In addition, a small review for organic agent regeneration systems was carried out, as biodiesel was chosen as the absorber agent in the system. In the presented study, two validation experiments were tested in order to prove that AspenPlus software works under the correct principles, and the results given are in line with those used in previous studies. At the second stage, data from two gasifiers were tested with the software in order to evaluate the optimum operation conditions needed to achieve tar concentration 0.1 mg/Nm3; the minimum limit for methanol synthesis. This study investigates the efficiency of an absorber column unit by using biodiesel. Methyl-palmitate oil was chosen to replace biodiesel as the organic agent in scrubber based on the liquid’s similarities and sustainability as liquids. Due to the lack of data surrounding solubility and absorption, correlating tars in biodiesel or MPO, a simulation was carried out to predict the theoretical solubility of those compounds in the liquid. Finally, the designed wet model was tested with the data of two pilot/commercialized plants; Synvalor and Guessing. The simulations results were compared with results from the plants cleaning systems.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Applied Sciences","Process and Energy","","Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

In this study, the contribution of biologically induced phosphate precipitation to the total removal of phosphate was investigated in full-scale AGS installations in Utrecht and Garmerwolde, the Netherlands. A longitudinal phosphate balance showed that under current operating conditions, phosphate does not accumulate noticeably in mature full-scale AGS systems. The total phosphate content of granule fractions, the scanning electron microscope (SEM) images coupled with energy dispersive X-rays (EDX) and the X-ray fluorescence (XRF) analyses on reactor granules showed no substantial phosphate crystals in the granules. The X-ray diffractions (XRD) revealed the presence of quartz crystals (SiO4) and, at some moments in time, different types of other minerals (e.g., potassium struvite, dolomite, magnesium calcite, brushite). Other XRD measurements however, showed no crystals at all besides quartz. It is suggested that a dynamic precipitation - dissolution process occurs in full-scale AGS systems within each process cycles or over multiple cycles. Overall, no indications were found phosphate precipitation contributed significantly to the total phosphate removal. In addition, the potential of phosphate to contribute to the process control of full-scale AGS installations is discussed.","phosphate; aerobic granules; precipitation; total phosphate balance; process control","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Water Management","","Sanitairy Engineering","",""

(mentor)","2016","Fulfilling our energy demands with renewable resources is one of the world’s greatest current challenges. Building offshore wind farms and using wind energy is one option to achieve this goal. The cost efficiency of offshore wind farms is still limited however, due to high construction and maintenance costs. Several research and development projects are therefore initiated by the Dutch government and the offshore wind industry. One of these projects, being implemented by TNO, is intended to better predict the fatigue degradation rate of arc welded, tubular joints in a cyclic loading environment; this study is being carried out within the framework of this research program. The arc welding process is accompanied by several undesirable side effects, including alteration of the microstructure, introduction of initial defects and the development of residual stresses. These effects significantly affect the design life of welded joints. The specific focus in this study is the effect of a residual stress distribution on the fatigue crack propagation rate. One weld configuration is studied: a bead-on-plate welded specimen that has characteristics similar to a tubular welded joint, e.g. a heat affected zone and a tensile residual stress distribution at the position where fatigue cracks are expected to develop. The research question for this thesis is as follows: “What is the influence of a residual stress distribution on the fatigue crack growth rate in bead-on-plate welded steel specimens under constant amplitude, cyclic loading conditions”? The formation of residual stresses in bead-on-plate welded specimens is examined by finite element modelling techniques and by an experimental procedure in this research. The numerical calculation procedure comprises two sequential coupled analyses and involves an extended material research program and several validation steps. The first analysis calculates the transient temperature distribution in the workpiece that originates with the heat input. The output of this analysis is validated by measuring the temperature at several locations during an arc welding process. Experimentally obtained dilatation curves are employed to relate the transient temperature distribution to thermal strains in the numerical program. Phase transformation behavior is included in regions that reach a sufficient peak temperature in which the iron lattice structure completely transforms. The measured temperature-dependent stress-strain curves convert the thermal strains to elastic and plastic stresses in the material. This mechanical analysis set-up is validated by means of the experimental procedure, the crack compliance method. The experimental procedure employed in this study is the crack compliance method. The basic principle of the crack compliance method is to introduce a crack in a specimen that contains residual stresses in several increments. The internal stress state at the crack faces is thereby released and a redistribution of the stresses occurs. The residual stress perpendicular to the crack in the uncracked configuration can be obtained by measuring the strain at arbitrary locations of the specimen. The influence of two fatigue life improvement techniques on the microstructural composition and residual stress distribution within the samples are examined for the bead-on-plate welded specimen. Preheating reduces the cooling rate in the welding applications and thereby the formation of hard and brittle microstructures and potential initial cracks and defects during cooling. A post-weld heat treatment reduces the hardness and residual stress by heating a sample to a predefined temperature and holding it for a certain period of time. The combined stress distributions of the external load configuration and internal stress controlled the fatigue crack growth rate of a cyclically loaded bead-on-plate welded specimen. The internal stress is redistributed when the fatigue crack propagates and the influence of the external stress cycle increases due to a reduction in the remaining ligament of the specimen. This observation led to a constant alteration of the effective stress ratio during the test. This research takes a linear elastic fracture mechanics approach whereby the principle of superposition is used to account for the contribution of the two stress distributions. Crack closure is a phenomenon that involves the contact between the fracture surfaces during a portion of the cyclic load cycle. Only the part of the load cycle that leads to an opening of the crack contributes to the fatigue crack growth. This phenomenon leads to a reduction of the stress intensity factor range at the crack tip and therefore a decreased fatigue degradation rate of the material. Several studies have reported empirical crack closure equations that reduce the stress intensity factor solution at the crack tip. The crack depth-dependent effective stress ratio is substituted in one of these equations in which the residual stress state strengthens or mitigates the crack closure effect. The main conclusion of this study with regard to the research question is as follows: Fatigue crack growth in bead-on-plate welded specimens is influenced by the combined effect of the residual stress distribution perpendicular to the crack path and the externally applied stress cycle. A tensile residual stress distribution is constantly present at the crack tip due to the redistribution of the initial internal stress state when the fatigue crack initiates and propagates from the weld toe in the as-welded specimen. This leads to an increase in the effective stress ratio that is introduced by the external load cycle and affected by the residual stress state. The crack closure effect is mitigated when the effective stress ratio increases and a larger portion of the external load cycle therefore contributes to fatigue crack propagation. Tensile residual stresses at the crack tip are thus detrimental for the fatigue design life of welded structures due to a less pronounced crack closure effect and a higher fatigue crack propagation rate.","Arc Welding; Fatigue Crack Growth; Residual Stress Distribution; Dilatometer; Numerical Welding Simulations; Crack Compliance method; Crack Closure","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-09-27","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Desmet, P.M.A. (mentor)","2016","This report describes the process and results of the graduation project ‘Reconsidering loss: an application design for the future of bereavement’ that is executed in collaboration with Monuta. The project aims to improve Monuta’s service by making it more meaningful for their customers in the future. By doing so, it responds to the desire for innovation in the funeral context as it is felt in the Netherlands. More concretely, the assignment is defined as follows: Develop a human-centered strategy for Monuta’s services based on a vision of the needs of people around the death and funeral of a beloved in 2025. Illustrate this strategy by developing a new concept for gedenken.nl. The projects approach is based on the design method Vision in Product whereby the project structure largely corresponds to the steps as prescribed in this method. The project starts of with context research, firstly brief on funerals as we know them today, then more extensive on the future context: ‘a farewell in 2025’. The research includes literature studies as well as experts interviews. All the gained insights are grouped into twelve clusters, each describing another interesting aspect of the future context. Based on these clusters, a framework is created that describes six different meanings people can ascribe to a funeral in 2025: • A funeral as ‘life-event’: an event that has a considerable impact on your personal life. • A funeral as ‘inconvenient truth’: a wake up call to remember you of your own losses and your own mortality. • A funeral as ‘get-together’: an event where people get together to collectively deal with their loss. • A funeral as ‘last respects’: a moment to pay your last respects. • A funeral as ‘part of life’: an inevitable part of the circle of life in which one returns to nature (or the cosmos) after death. • A funeral as ‘rite of passage’: a human transition from a state of ‘life’ to a state of ‘death’. The frames ‘life event’, ‘get-together’, and ‘last respects’ are used as inspiration for the further development of a new concept for gedenken.nl. This is reflected in the following statement, which is the starting point for the design phase: We want to enhance the social and reflective aspects of a funeral while facilitating people’s wish to honour the deceased. In the design phase, five concepts are generated of which one is chosen and further developed into a final product proposal: GedenkApp. GedenkApp is a mobile memorial platform that allows people to share their love for and grief over a deceased mutual friend or relative. It stimulates the bereaved to make explicit how the deceased still has a place in their heart and thoughts, by honouring him or her with tributes. For people around the bereaved (the so called supporters), GedenkApp provides a channel to show their sympathy, also when life goes on again. The platform has three main features: a post wall, a funeral page and a personal space. The post wall can be used to share memories about the deceased (like pictures or anecdotes), tributes to honour the deceased (e.g. a written poem dedicated to the deceased or a photo of bringing flowers to the grave) and supportive messages for the bereaved (like condolences and comforting words). The funeral page allows the bereaved to communicate information about the day, like the program, location(s), time schedule and other additional information. The personal space includes a page where one can see an overview of his or her personal contributions to the postwall: a representation of one’s own memorial tribute to the deceased. In addition, every user will have a personal account. Via this account one can participate in multiple memorials: a digital cemetery for all your deceased beloved ones. In the last stage of the project, GedenkApp is evaluated according to two studies. Firstly, a user test evaluates the usability of the app. From this study can be concluded that the overall interface design and structure of GedenkApp are clear. Recommendations are made for small adaptions. The second study concerns expert interviews in which GedenkApp is assessed on its possible effect on people’s wellbeing and its potential pain points. The general conclusion that can be drawn from the second study is that GedenkApp has the potential to become a truly valuable product for bereaved. Nevertheless, the concept leaves space to be used by people in ways that may be undesirable for other users or for themselves. To some extent, this can be limited by making a few adaptions to the design as proposed in the recommendations. The following things are recommended to Monuta: • Collaboration between Monuta and a design graduate student is believed to be valuable for both parties and is therefor recommendable to be repeated by Monuta in the future. • The academic knowledge from the various fields of research that have been consulted to construct the framework, are believed to be a valuable addition to Monuta’s expertise and a solid base for strategic decisions. It is therefore recommended to Monuta to try and use the framework as a tool to manage their product and service portfolio, aiming to address all the six frames with the entirety of their product offer. • Based on the insights gained during this project, it is believed that the proposed features of GedenkApp would be a valuable addition to gedenken.nl. From a user perspective, implementation of these features is therefor recommendable. To conclude, it can be stated that the results of this project largely meet the initial aims and goals that were defined along the way.","application design; ViP; future of funerals; grief","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design for Interaction","","","",""

(mentor); Babuska, R. (mentor)","2016","Modern robotic systems are increasingly expected to interact with unstructured and unpredictable environments. This has reiterated the importance of sophisticated reasoning and adaptive motor skill learning. Although low-level methodologies for sensorimotor control have been relatively well studied, constrained motion for robotic manipulators in general environments still remains a challenge. In addition to viable kinematic trajectories, successful interaction requires a system to adjust the magnitude and direction of the force applied on an object or human being. One force control architecture that is stable under a wide range of conditions is impedance control. However the defining inertial, damping and stiffness parameters are highly task dependent and often difficult to deduce a priori. To this end, one promising strategy is through reinforcement learning. Several frameworks have already emerged that are capable of learning compliant behaviour in this fashion. However the complex and sometimes discontinuous nature of physical interaction in robotics provides additional challenges in designing algorithms capable of learning complex behaviours with minimal interaction time. This thesis details an extension to the PILCO algorithm for learning variable impedance control. The proposed method attempts to construct a Gaussian Process model of the robot-environment system through interaction. This approach permits long-term inference and planning in a fully Bayesian manner, reducing the required interaction time for convergence and allow for efficient analytical gradient-based policy updates. Two skill learning problems are investigated both in simulation and experiment on a 7-DOF `KUKA LBR iiwa 7 R800' robot. The first scenario entails learning state-conditioned variable stiffness parameters along predefined motion plans. In the second framework, the agent learns both stiffness parameters and kinematic trajectories simultaneously to complete a constrained motion task.","Processes; Robotics; Reinforcement; Learning; Force; Control; Impedance; Interaction; Contact; Gaussian","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-09-26","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Delft Center for Systems and Control (DCSC)","","Mechanical Engineering/ Track: Control Engineering","",""

(mentor)","2016","Topology optimization is an automated design approach for structural applications that is gaining popularity in industry, including the aerospace sector. Resulting designs can be made suitable for traditional manufacturing techniques, although it is a technique that is particularly useful for non-conventional approaches such as additive manufacturing. The procedure allows for choosing a design objective, such as minimum compliance or maximum heat conduction. Given one or more constraints, the optimal distribution of material within a domain is computed. A popular topology optimization method is the so-called Solid Isotropic Material with Penalization (SIMP). It is traditionally implemented using piecewise constant density values, specified per element. One technical difficulty with this approach is the formation of “checkerboard-like” patterns where the material is assigned to one element while the adjacent elements contain no material. This issue has been circumvented through the application of filters that explicitly prevent the formation of checkerboards. However, as a result of the filtering process, the designs display structural members with relatively high thicknesses and, at the same time, the structural detail level is relatively low. Several authors in the scientific literature argue that this effect is beneficial from a manufacturing viewpoint. However, recent progress in manufacturing techniques, such as additive manufacturing (also known as 3D-printing), allows to manufacture components with an increased level of detail and complexity. From this point of view, it is relevant to study optimization procedures that preserve the level of detail displayed by unfiltered designs. In this project, SIMP is implemented using Isogeometric Analysis (IGA). In IGA, Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines (NURBS) replace the Lagrange polynomials classically used in Finite Element Analysis (FEA). Through the use of Bézier extraction, implementation changes are confined to the “shape routine”. Rather than working with piecewise constant density values, density is consistently approximated using NURBS. A consistent gradient formulation is derived as well. The effects on checkerboard formation are studied. Instead of filtering, separate meshes are used for density and displacement definition. A displacement mesh is obtained by further refining the density mesh, such that the displacement representation is more accurate. Adequate procedures for Gaussian integration are determined. The treatment is limited to two dimensional minimum compliance problems. It is found that a consistent density representation using NURBS does not prevent checkerboard formation. However, the use of separate meshes for density and displacement diminishes checkerboards. It also generates more detailed designs than those produced by filters. Obtained compliance values are lower as well. Through the use of IGA, arc-like geometries may be studied. At the same time, non-classical checkerboard patterns are observed.","topology optimization; isogeometric analysis; SIMP; Bézier extraction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Aerospace Structures and Materials","","","",""

Key applications are including vehicle simulation, experiments on control behavior in virtual environments and studies into human self-motion perception. To maintain a good dynamic capability, the known motion simulator usually has a custom-designed cabin with optimized stiffness and weight to encapsulate the various moving components. However, the particular shell structure is very inflexible for exchanging its functions. To improve the functionality of the motion simulator for conducting multi-purpose research, a modular cabin structure with flexibility and time efficiency when exchanging setups is demanded. This research project is based on a practical design task of a multi-purpose research cabin for a hexapod motion simulator installed at the Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics. It is aiming to develop a simple cabin structure with more modularity while maintaining acceptable dynamic capabilities. In this project, a detachable structure concept is proposed based on a systemic assembly break down of the cabin entity into a base frame, an outer structure frame assembly and filling-in panels. Each part is designed as a self-supported substructure that could provide sufficient stiffness individually. Connections between each substructure is proved to be stiff and will not reduce its stiffness during motion also at higher frequencies. The designed cabin can access the limited motion lab entrance as disassembled parts and can be reassembled again inside the room. It has optimized setup positioning and high modularity for exchanging its functions. With bolted connection, the side panels can be removed fast for exchanging setups and repositioned back easily. The design of a modular cabin structure has contributed to the desired multi-functional research motion simulators.","multi-purpose motion simulator cabin; structural design; modular cabin design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Precision and Microsystems Engineering","","","",""

Using a special chair, drivers are able to do different types of exercises in the cabin. However, the acceleration, deceleration and jerk of normal highly automated vehicles can hardly satisfy the safety and comfort requirements for sports exercises, especially during lane changes. It is very difficult for the driver to keep balance when the lateral or longitudinal jerk and acceleration reach a certain level. In order to provide a suitable environment for exercises, a multi-level control architecture has been designed to satisfy the safety and comfort requirements from an ergonomics aspect.

(mentor)","2016","The introduction of renewable energy sources such as wind, CHPs, photovoltaic in the electrical power networks has coined the term of distributed generation (DG) penetration into the electrical power grids. Often this DG penetration is concentrated in the distribution grids leading to complex electrical behaviour, in terms of power flow and voltage of the distribution grid. At present, the understanding of stability and dynamic behaviour of the medium voltage distribution grids as a result of increased DG penetration is limited. As a consequence, there is a need to improve the present monitoring of medium voltage (MV) electrical distribution grids. This has prompted Delta Network Group (DNWG), one of the Distribution Network Operator (DNO) of the Netherlands to install Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs) in their 50 kV Delta ring distribution grid resulting in increased observability of the 50 kV distribution grid. However, with the increased observability there is a need to analyse the distribution grid based on the data generated by the PMU monitoring system. The aim of this thesis, is to analyse and evaluate the 50 kV Delta ring distribution grid in terms of steady state and dynamic voltage and power flow behaviour based on the real time data acquired from the PMUs. The approach involves at first modelling the Delta distribution grid under study in PowerFactory software. The grid is modelled partly in detail based on actual parameters of components like 50 kV cables, transformers, CHP synchronous generators and assuming already available standard generic models for distributed generation like wind turbines, and controller models for CHP plants. The software model forms the basis for analysis of the distribution grid; at first the instantaneous steady state power flow behaviour based on PMU and SCADA data. Furthermore, evaluating the distribution grid during two contingencies considered as case studies; -Switching out a 50 kV cable. (contingency in the 50 kV distribution grid) -Loss of generation from wind power plant. (contingency in the 0.4/10 kV sub distribution grid) The contingencies are actual past grid events observed by the PMUs and using this data, along with the data from the SCADA monitoring system the contingencies are simulated, analysed in terms of power flow and voltage behaviour. The results for each contingency are compared with the PMU and SCADA monitoring system. The analysis reveals the bi-directional power flow nature in the Delta distribution grid majorly influenced by the variation in the distributed generation. Extending the analysis in case of contingencies, the common observations during both the cases show slight changes in voltages and redistribution of power flow in the 50 kV distribution grid. The voltage fluctuations are within the stable operating limits. A possible explanation for this is the connection of the Delta 50 kV ring distribution grid to a secure 150 kV transmission network of the Netherlands. The power balancing of the distribution grid is also done by the 150 kV transmission network in both the cases without having a significant impact on the response of the distributed generation during both the cases studied. Lastly, the work conducted in this thesis provides an insight and a general framework into analysing the Delta MV distribution grid containing distributed generation based on the data obtained from the PMU monitoring system.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Electrical Sustainable Energy","","Intelligent Electrical Power Grids Group","",""

Yet, upper-limb prostheses are of focus in only 20\% of the reviewed published literature (60\% less than lower-limb prostheses), with less than half of the publication addressing engineering design to improve these devices. The prosthesis-limb interface, such as a conventional socket, is a critical component in upper-limb prostheses, necessary for force transfer to and from the wearer and thus important for control and comfort of the device. Though volume management of the residual limb is accounted for in some sockets designs, pediatric residual limb growth is not, aside from compensatory padding techniques. o Due to the growth of a child, replacement of an upper-limb prosthetic device is necessary every 1-2 years, while adjustments are more frequent. Limited availability of properly-sized components and the combined costs of hardware and clinical visits pose technical and financial challenges for families. Lack of proper adjustment or replacement of the device may lead to poor fit and function, resulting in rejection or physical injury. o Transradial deficiency is the most common major upper-limb deficiency in children. To extend the functional lifetime of the related prosthetic device and thereby reduce frequency and cost of replacement, the aim of this study is to design an adaptable transradial limb-prosthetic interface to accommodate pediatric growth.","prosthesis; upper-limb; transradial; socket; socket design; prosthesis-limb interface; pediatric; growth","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Biomechanical Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Molenbroek, J.F.M. (mentor)","2016","Analysis The overall assignment at the start of the project is “Designing a low threshold product for at-home use to maintain and increase the physical fitness of Dutch older people over 70 by increasing their physical movement and thereby increase confidence, mobility and independence”. The project was executed at Springlab, an innovation agency that focuses on innovations that incorporate physical activity in daily life in a fun way. First of all the target group was researched, starting with orientating on the subject with interviews. The findings of the interviews were validated using a questionnaire. The decision was made to design for a target group aged 75-85 of people with limited to no physical limitations that are in a transitional period of becoming less physically active. Furthermore people enjoy walking and cycling outdoors, but don’t like actually exercising or feel too old for it. When looking at the current Dutch healthcare system, many different home and care institutions are apparent. Only older people with severe physical or mental limitations are allowed to live in care institutions resulting in 96% of older people living independently. Simultaneously healthcare is focused on treatment rather than prevention by for example exercising. Due to Sarcopenia, the decrease of muscles, it is recommended for older people to perform strength exercises twice a week in addition to the recommended standard of 30 minutes of physical activity daily. Progressive strength, flexibility and balance training is chosen to design for as it is most effective in increasing mobility and thereby independence. In terms of motivation, self-efficacy, prompts and social support is key. Market research has resulted in a market size of 27.000 people, about 3% of independently living older people aged 75-85. When looking at the current market, products and services do not sufficiently satisfy the preferences of the user. Large expensive or small and simple exercise products are offered, though products tend to focus on one type of exercise and not provide feedback to the user. A product that provides at home guidance and feedback with the feeling of an exercising companion is the goal. Trends show opportunities in products for older people, quantification of personal data and an increased focus on health and wellbeing. All gained information and the requirements towards the design are bundled in the design brief.The final design goal is to facilitate in increase in physical fitness and confidence to enable older people with decreased activity to be more active outdoor by motivating them to do at home strength exercises in a fun way. Ideation With the design brief brainstorms were held and concepts were developed. The intended interaction of the product was determined with a scenario. Three different concepts were developed and assessed using the requirements and wishes that were set-up during the Analysis. The workout buddy will be further developed. Embodiment A short test of the working principle of the workout buddy showed enthusiasm from the users. Therefore it was decided to continue with the concept. The form, color and parts were determined by studying current solutions and available parts. The interaction and exercises were determined with the help of a geriatrics physical therapist, and literature study. Progressive strength, flexibility and balance exercises are included, endurance training is excluded due to potential risks for cardiovascular failure in the target group. The interaction is as simple as possible with only audio feedback towards the user. The user provides “yes” and “no” feedback to the product. Furthermore the product detects and saves the performed exercises along with the performed level. Determining the materials, production and costs of all parts resulted in a cost estimation for a 1000 batch edition and a 27 000 batch edition. The current investment for the physical parts of 1000 products is €27 323, which is €27,32 costs per product. The total investment for the physical parts 27 000 = €276 796 which is = €10.25 per product. Investors need to be found and the product will be promoted amongst caregivers and older people for a sales price of €100-€150. Testing with the target group has shown that the interaction with the product is effective, users enjoy the product and follow the exercise instructions. However some aspects still need improvement. First of all the audio volume should be adjustable and even more adapted to deaf people. Some exercises should be explained more clearly. It should be clear when to press the buttons, the table attachment should be possible with a tablecloth and the colours of the product should be adjusted to the interiors. Overall a unique new product has been designed, a low tech affordable exercise robot that provides feedback and companionship while doing a variety of progressive exercises. Future opportunities lie in more advanced technology and functions and new applications in the medical field or other target groups.","physical activity; older people; robot; exercise; geriatrics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Integrated Product Design","","Integrated Product Design","",""

(mentor)","2016","With stricter laws on emissions in marine industry it has become necessary to shift to low sulphur content fuels, use of scrubbers for exhaust gas cleaning or shift to natural gas powered engines. Offshore Supply Vessel (OSV) have a combination of low loads due to DP3 requirements with peak loads due to position correction. A gas engine will work with reduced efﬁciencies under dynamic and low load condition To prevent this compromise in the working efﬁciency and for the standard working operation it is necessary for these gas engines to work under standard loads. This can be done by integrating gas engines with energy storage option available on board the vessel. This application of energy storage will level the dynamic loading curve ensuring the gas engine running at given standard constant load. The goal of this thesis research is to integrate natural gas dual fuel engines with energy storage for offshore DP3 applications. To achieve this goal a dynamic simulation model will be developed for the energy storage in Matlab/Simulink which will be integrated with the available gas engine model of IHC. A comparison is be made with some key parameters being the fuel consumption, emissions, operating & installation cost and their compliance with classiﬁcation society for DP3 vessels. Gas engine model available at MTI will be made suitable for the OSV with some required changes. A Matlab/Simulink model for the chosen energy storage option from phase 2 will be a dynamic model. In the ﬁnal stage this energy storage model will be integrated with the gas engine model with proper system integration. These models developed and integrated will be based on the literature study of my thesis.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-12-31","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Marine and Transport Technology","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","The main goal of this thesis is to develop and implement an algorithm that is capable of finding and applying the optimal policy for a class of continuous-time linear time-invariant systems which are subjected to input saturation. An algorithm is proposed that is capable of doing this on-line (i.e. in real time while controlling the system) without any prior knowledge of the systems dynamics. The proposed algorithm is named Safe-Generalized Policy Iteration ( Safe-GPI ) and uses Approximate Dynamic Programming techniques to converge towards the optimal control law. The main contribution of this work is a novel Safe Policy Improvement step that uses a Sum-of-Squares programming routine to guarantee that the updated policy will actually stabilize the system. Identification of the unknown system dynamics is achieved by employing on-line parameter estimation techniques. Subsequently a novel value function approximator can then be proven to converge through the certainty equivalence principle. For both the system identifier and the value function approximator experience replay update laws are presented that use current and recorded data, which allows the persistence of excitation condition to be checked on-line. The Safe-GPI algorithm is implemented in MATLAB and its convergence and performance properties are studied in two case studies. The first case study is on the position control of a mass-spring-damper cart system and here convergence of the Safe-GPI algorithm towards an optimal policy is demonstrated. Moreover the Safe-GPI algorithm is shown to outperform a current state-of-the-art algorithm. In the second case study the algorithm is implemented as a router-based Internet congestion controller, where it performs Active Queue Management (AQM).","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Delft Center for Systems and Control (DCSC)","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","Robotics has evolved since its inception and has found major applications in industries. With recent de- mand for medical and social robots, they are required to be flexible, compliant and adaptable. Today’s robots are far from performing smooth, fine co-ordinated movements that are required to be used in the fields mentioned above. Primates seem to be excellent at such tasks, especially humans who perform complex tasks in dynamic environments and the credit is attributed to the complex brain structures and bio-mechanical design. In particular, cerebellum is understood to be involved specifically in fine co-ordinated movement control. But the understanding of computations that are responsible for this functionality has seen no consensus yet. One reason for this is the number of theories that exist to ex- plain the functionality. This work focuses on reviewing existing theories and models to come up with testable model cases in a control scenario. To understand the principles behind cerebellum two differ- ent control scenarios are developed. One a control engineering approach to control the position of a DC motor and second a biological control scenario of vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) for image stabilization. For testing these a biologically realistic firing rate neuron model is used. For the implementation of VOR a robot head with stereo cameras is used. The purpose of VOR is to reduce image blur in the cameras. And cerebellum is known to be the adaptable block of this reflex. At the end of this work from the engi- neering control scenario it was observed that cerebellum as forward model adds stability to the system. And in the case of VOR the cerebellum was able to adapt the gains when subjected to disturbances.","VOR; optical flow; firing rate model; forward model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Steele-Dunne, S.C. (mentor); Van de Giesen, N.C. (mentor)","2016","Reservoirs are often operated to meet two or more objectives that sometimes may conflict. An example of this conflict is to keep storage low enough to maintain spare capacity for flood protection, but also to keep it high enough to maintain reliability of water / hydropower supply. Optimising the control decisions of reservoirs can provide a valuable contribution in effectively meeting those objectives. Those decisions require the procurement and interpretation of information from computer models and hydrological data. Any improvement in the availability or accuracy of these sources of information will naturally improve the quality of decision making in operating the water systems. This thesis presents a method for quantifying the value of having different levels of information in operating a test case reservoir. The reservoir selected as a case study is Salto Grande Reservoir, located at the border of Uruguay and Argentina which is operated to maximise hydropower generation while minimising flood risk and damage. The value of those levels of information is done by using a multistage stochastic programming (MSP) on the control of reservoir outflows implemented using a decision tree. There are two key components in making a decision tree. An ensemble of future inflow trajectories, and a representation of information uncertainty along the horizon. The levels of information will influence how uncertainty evolve along the optimisation horizon. Uncertainties constrain the decisions that can be made by a controller. If decisions are constrained, it is likely to be less optimal. Better availability and accuracy of information would result in uncertainty being resolved earlier in the optimisation horizon. The earlier uncertainties can be resolved, the earlier branches in the decision tree can bifurcate from each other, resulting in less constrained decisions. After this methodology is applied to the Salto Grande Reservoir case study, it is confirmed from the results that better information does indeed result in better operational performance. Having accurate forecasts has a quantifiable benefit to the operational performance than having less accurate forecasts or no forecasts at all.","Value of Information; Multistage stochastic programming; Operational water management","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Water Management","","","",""

The Satisfaction Questionnaire and the Satisfaction Analysis serve for the analysis and determination of value regarding customer satisfaction. The third tool, Impact Grid, is used for the assessment of impact through the expected usage and adoption of the different features, as well as the combination of both dimensions for an effective appraisal of the overall user value that guides the subsequent assignation of priority.","design; software; prioritization; insights; user value; product backlog","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovatie Management","","Strategic Product Design","",""

In order to bring the people suffering from such, back on their feet and closer to the able society, exoskeletons have been in existence for some time. Only recently (2012) a new genre of ‘soft exosuits’ gained popularity (Wyss Institute, Harvard University). These devices, unlike traditional exoskeletons are extremely lightweight as they are devoid of rigid materials.In the world of assistive wearable robotics for rehabilitation, there is a dire need for a lightweight, cosmetic, adaptable and cost effective solution to provide assistance to the lower limbs. There lies a lacuna in the state of the art for an exosuit which is specific to healthcare applications. The most premier biomechanical motion in this context, which needs to be assisted is the sit to stand transition. A highly detailed computational model of the schematic was designed which, for the 75th percentile Dutch male can provide almost 60.44 % of total assistance at the hip and 57.3 % of assistance at the knee in the sit to stand motion. Along with this theoretical finding, a proof of concept prototype to test the scheme at a human scale is also invented. EMG measurements were conducted for observing the behaviour of the muscles in the quadriceps group with assistance. The results of the study were positive and showed upto 37.5 % dip in the muscle activity with assistance. This objectively shows that the system is promising and capable to provide assistance. The understanding from this 3D interactions and the design development of the embodiments from the schematic have also resulted in the development of a vision for the industrial design concept of this product, if it is to be developed further.","lowerlimb; exosuit","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","","",""

For incorporating more functionality and having more space chip manufacturing industries invest heavily to reduce the size of the structures on the chips. This directly requires the stepper system to operate in nanometer scale resolution. To achieve such high accuracy, the stepper system should be isolated from the external vibrations. Isolators are the auxiliary systems that protect the device from floor vibrations. In order to better understand how to tweak isolator components to boost the vibration isolation performance a parameterized multi body model of the system is the first step. From a system theoretical perspective, estimating the parameters of such a multi-body model is a problem on gray-box system identification. The state-of-the art approaches in this field estimates both the state transformation matrix and the system parameters. This increases the number of decision variables in the optimization problem. Very few results exist in which more than 6 system parameters have been estimated accurately. In this thesis we develop a framework for gray-box system identification comprising of PBSIDopt algorithm and H-infinity static output feedback synthesis. This approach bypasses the estimation of state transformation matrix. Also this optimization addresses the input output behavior directly which makes it conceptually simpler. We also explain how to judge whether the framework has estimated the parameters such that the input-output behavior of the system is captured. Our simulation results suggest that to estimate the 16 system parameters very accurately, precise knowledge of the inertial properties of the system is required. Nevertheless, there are other applications within vibration isolation where a multi body model which explains the data is sufficient. We expect our framework to aid the engineers at Zeiss for such applications.","PBSIDopt algorithm; static output feedback synthesis; model matching; Gray-box system identification; single stage mechanical system","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Delft Center for Systems and Control","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","Climate change gives incentive for the transition to sustainable energy sources such as wind energy. To make wind energy cost competitive with fossil fuel sources, wind turbines are commonly placed in groups. As wind turbines extract energy from the wind, a wake occurs behind the turbine characterized by reduced a wind speed and increased turbulence. This wake causes downstream turbines to incur decreased power production and increased loading. Due to this aerodynamic interaction between these turbines, the total energy production is sub-optimal. A control strategy to mitigate these losses is by imposing yaw-misalignment with the incoming wind flow. This induces a lateral force which will cause the wake to deflect, with the goal to avoid downstream turbines. A side effect of wake deflection is partial wake overlap which has the potential to increase the fatigue loading of wind turbines. One way to decrease the cost of energy, is to increase the power production without significantly affecting the loads. Therefore, this thesis aims to quantify the load variations due to partial wake overlap and evaluate the benefits of a combined optimization of power and loads over traditional control strategies. For this purpose, we design a computational framework which computes the wind farm power production and the wind turbine rotor loads based on the yaw settings. To investigate the influence of partial wake overlap on the rotor fatigue, the differential flapwise and edgewise bending moments at hub height are computed. FLORIS is used to compute the power and CCBlade to determine the loads, supplemented with an algorithm to find the velocity distributions as hub height. The optimal yaw settings are found using an optimizer. The simulation results show that partial wake overlap can significantly increase asymmetric loading of the rotor and that yaw-misalignment is beneficial in situations where the wake can be sufficiently directed away from the downstream turbines. Furthermore, a combined optimization of power and loads in all wind directions has been found to increase the average power production by 1.53 % and decrease the average differential flapwise and edgwise loads by respectively 42.67% and 45.70% compared to greedy control settings. Although results are promising, further improvements are required to confirm that mixed-objective optimization of power and loads is beneficial. We recommend the use of dynamic models to allow for more accurate load computations, validation of the results using high-fidelity models and investigating the influence of turbulence and Individual Pitch Control.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2017-01-01","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Delft Center for Systems and Control (DCSC)","","","",""

(mentor); Polewski, M. (mentor)","2016","For the radar systems using phased array antennas it is important to understand how the reduction of mutual coupling between antenna elements can improve antenna scan performance. In order to perform this analysis one has to focus first on the physical phenomena and the structures that might decrease the mutual coupling. Among various approaches shown in the literature the resonance circuits based on defective ground structures (DGS) showed to have potential to be used between elements in micro‐strip as well as in dielectric resonator array antennas. Based on requirements on operational frequency bandwidth a suitable defected ground structure was synthesized to be applied to arrays of dielectric resonator antennas (DRAs). The constraints on spacing between antenna elements (0.5lambda) leaded to a novel DGS that provided the flexibility in the adjustment of structure geometry. This new design allowed to fit the DGS within 0.5lambda grid of DRAs. Moreover, the novel DGS takes into account radiation effects below the ground plane. Tuned DGS structure is further used in infinite arrays where the results illustrate stabilization in the scan performance and bandwidth enhancement. An 11x11 novel antenna‐DGS array in triangular configuration is analyzed where the DGS location is able to benefit E, H plane and diagonal coupled elements. The embedded element analysis indicated bandwidth enhancement in parallel to lower coupling and improved quality for the embedded patterns. In addition, it gives improvement in gain compared to the 11x11 array without DGS elements. It is concluded that reduction of mutual coupling by applying the novel DGS for DRA arrays with strong coupling between antenna elements, can be used as a method to stabilize the active impedance match for various scan angles.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-09-20","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Electrical Engineering","","The Telecommunications & Sensing Systems Track","",""

(mentor)","2016","Standing time, prior to testing, is a necessary part of the oil-filled transformer manufacturing process and its duration is design dependent. Caution on part of the manufacturer to avoid failure of expensive transformers leads to the overestimation of standing time, consequently impacting annual production. Thus, a need for optimizing (reducing) standing time arises. The absence of Partial Discharges (PDs), above predetermined limits, during testing indicates sufficient standing time. Moisture in oil-paper insulating system is a source of PDs. Thus, moisture and its migration between oil and paper can determine the duration of standing time. Moisture is absorbed by and extracted from paper during the tightening and vacuum steps of the production process, respectively. The aim of this thesis is to determine if paper actually plays a role in determining the standing time. Two investigations were conducted using presspaper and crêped presspaper samples having different geometries. One investigation was to characterize the moisture ingress and egress processes related to non-impregnated paper. Moisture ingress was studied by exposing dried paper samples to air (60 ⁰C, 75% Relative Humidity (RH)) in a climate chamber for 24 hours while moisture egress was studied by placing the climate exposed samples in vacuum (10 mbar) at 25 ⁰C for 48 hours. The other investigation was to study the changes in PD behaviour of Oil Impregnated Paper (OIP) with respect to standing time. PD tests were performed on samples conditioned to different levels of moisture content and impregnated with dry, hot (70 ⁰C), PD free oil. The effect of clamping force was also considered. Both presspaper and crêped presspaper samples attained an average moisture content of 8%, by weight, within 7 hours of exposure, whereas their moisture content reduced to 1% within 24 hours (conventional duration) of placing them in vacuum. No PDs were observed in samples exposed to the chosen climate for 24 hours and placed in vacuum for 4 hours (24cc/4vac) when tested at the normal testing electric field level of 6 kV/mm. Moisture saturated samples exhibited PD activity at 3 kV/mm immediately after impregnation whereas, 24cc/4vac samples had Partial Discharge Inception Fields (PDIFs) in excess of 8 kV/mm. The results indicated that paper did not determine the standing time for transformers.","Post-impregnation standing time; Oil-paper insulation; Power transformers; Moisture; Partial Discharges; Presspaper; Crêped presspaper","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-09-22","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Electrical Sustainable Energy","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","Mooring a vessel is generally still done by means of ropes. The main disadvantages of mooring with ropes are that the process of mooring a vessel can take up to 90 minutes, it involves unsafe situations for, and cargo handling efficiency can be suboptimal. Mampaeys goal is to provide an active mooring system that adresses these challenges. It has designed and built a system for mooring ship to ship in the benign conditions of the port of Rotterdam, called the DockLock (DL). The design of the current DL is such that it counteracts vessel movement in surge, sway and yaw directions. The vessel is free to move in heave, pitch and roll direction. The goal of this thesis is to determine the optimal control of the DLs mooring an LNG Carrier (LNGC) to a jetty, minimising the maximum displacement of the vessel,the maximum force in the DLs and the energy dissipation from the vessels response. Two models are analysed: the first is a model in the time domain in ANSYS AQWA (AQWA), where the current DL is used to moor a 170.000m3 capacity LNGC to a jetty. The same LNGC is moored with the new PD-controlled DL in the second model. Ideal PD-control is assumed, allowing the new DL to be modelled as linear spring and damper. To enable analysis of a large amount of different situations this is modeled in Matlab in the frequency domain. The models are subjected to first and second order wave forces coming from -1800, -1350 and -900. The simple AQWA model shows that the structural part of the current DL is subject to large deformations, which will quickly consume fatigue lifetime. The current DL design is considered to be insufficient to moor a 170.000m3 capacity LNGC to a jetty. To determine the optimal control of the new DL, three objectives are evaluated: the 3-hour Most Prob- able Maximum (MPM) COG displacement in x and y, the MPM force in all four DLs, and the average energy dissipation in all four DLs. The MPM responses to the combined first and second order wave forces are calculated with an empirical method proposed by Naess, known as the modified SRSS combination formula. The average energy dissipation is computed taking the average of a time realisation of the frequency spectrum. The three objectives are combined with the weighted sum method to a scalar objective function. From the Matlab Optimisation Toolbox, the Multi Start Local Optimisation with the SQP algorithm has been used find the optimum, varying DL damping and stiffness in x and y direction. For the defined problem the optimisation tool finds an optimum, keeping displacements and energy dissipation within requirements, but exceeding force requirements for wave direction 900. This can be solved by increasing the number of DLs, or by changing the influence of maximum displacement, force and energy dissipation, adapting their weights. The optimisation tool shows to be able to find an optimum allowing smaller or larger displacements, or smaller forces. As such the optimal settings of the DL can be tuned to what the situation requires. The optima found are insensitive to changes of ±10% in DL stiffness in x and y, and damping in x, but sensitive to changes in damping in y. This is because the energy dissipation has been normalised with a low value, resulting in a large influence on the objective function.","active; mooring; optimisation; weighted sum; multi objective; LNG; carrier; shore","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-09-23","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Offshore & Dredging Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Wijntjes, M.W.A. (mentor)","2016","It is estimated that approximately 320,000 people in the Netherlands are visually impaired, some of which also have other physical or mental disabilities. The combination of disabilities can have profound impact on a person’s daily life. One of the encountered difficulties is a disrupted time perception. With a visual impairment the sensory input is limited and the perceived time is often longer than expected. an expertise organisation for visual impairments that also houses 250 (deaf)blind and mentally impaired people. Bartimeus is an expertise organisation for visual impairments that also houses 250 (deaf) blind and mentally impaired people. Amongst their clients Bartimeus observed behavioural and emotional problems, some of which are assumed to be related to the disrupted time perception. To be able to understand the clients in these situations and to design a product that offers adequate support, a user research and literature study have been conducted in collaboration with Bartimeus on the topic of time perception amongst visually and mentally impaired people. Interviews and observations showed that the general time perception is satisfactory, because of the support of supervisors, the structure and the tools. When a client is designated to a situation, in which the support or structure is missing, problematic behaviour may occur. One of these situations is waiting. The literature about the cognitive processes of time perception show that it is influenced by the sensory stimuli, the attention to time and the memory. When applying the processes to the situation of waiting, it is assumed that the clients get tense and confused due to a limited time understanding and an increased focus on waiting. With these insights the design goal has been formulated to guide the design process. This goal aimed to design a product that assists deafblind clients to get grip on waiting time and to make the experience of waiting pleasurable. The formulation of the design goal was followed by a series of brainstorm sessions, idea generation and concept selection. A selection of six concepts have been presented to several supervisors for evaluation. These concepts were amongst others a heating leave, a vibration pillow and a community timer. Based on the functionality of the concept and suitability for this target group the choice have been made for the vibration pillow. This concept has been developed in the areas of vibrations, material, shapes and feedback, with the aim to optimize the functions of and interactions with the product. The final design is the TactoTimer, a tactile timer that consists of a vibrating pillow and an application to control the timer. It makes the duration of waiting tangible via vibrations and thus supports the user in the understanding of waiting time. Essentially, the pillow vibrates throughout the set waiting time and the client has to wait until the products stops. The timer can be set with an application. The interaction with the pillow can distract the user from the waiting itself. The final design was evaluated in a user study with one visually and mentally impaired group and one deafblind mentally impaired group of Bartimeus. The main purpose of this study was to reveal the effects of the product and the behavioural responses of the users. The product was simulated by a prototype. The outcomes did not yet reveal whether the TactoTimer could support the users while waiting due to the limited testing time. It did show the need for improvements on the vibrations and the shape of the product. It is recommended to continue the user test with the TactoTimer for at least two months to be able to see results on the effect of the product. The product can also be extended to other target group like people with behavioural problems or elderly people.","time perception; (deaf)blind and mentally impaired people","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","Fire Island has been monitored since Hurricane Sandy (2012). During that period, Fire Island showed recovery (accretion on the island). Behaviour of the recovery is not yet well-known. Main processes during the recovery are also not known. Therefore, the emphasis of this thesis is on the understanding of the main processes of the recovery of barrier islands, with Fire Island, New York, United States as a case study. AeoLiS has been validated for the Sand Motor, Kijkduin in The Netherlands. From this study it is (1) not known whether AeoLiS would have the same predictive skill at other locations and (2) not clear what parameters at a new site would affect skill and model sensitivity the most. Fire Island differs from the Sand Motor as the beach width of Fire Island is significantly smaller. Therefore, the focus of this thesis is on the beach width and its effect on the aeolian sediment supply and transport. Testing the model at a new location will also indicate what additional data or processes are missing in the present AeoLiS model which are required to perform a hindcast. The main processes and behaviour in the recovery of Fire Island are analysed in a data analysis. The results of the analysis showed that, during the period 7 November 2012 until 26 September 2013, there was an accretion of the dunes. In this period the island was recovering from the impact of Hurricane Sandy. During this accretion period a welding bar was observed. This welding bar could be an important mechanism for the dune accretion growth as accretion was seen in the period after the welding of the bar. The reason for this accretion could be the increasing fetch and the addition of new sediment. Under idealized circumstances it can be assumed that the total flux settles in the dunes. The determination of the total transport under these circumstances using Bagnold’s formulation indicates a larger increase than is actually measured. This indicates that the actual accretion of the dunes is limited. The AeoLiS model was used to hindcast the recovery of Fire Island, during the period 7 November 2012 until 26 September 2013, by predicting the transport rate into the dunes. It is assumed that the total flux into the dunes will settle in the dunes. Comparing these results to the data analysis, showed that the hindcast was in the same range. The general validity of the results depends on several assumptions. The main assumption is; the model only included onshore transport, while the wind direction was variable and mainly offshore during the accretion period. The sensitivity analyses indicated that the model simulation of Fire Island is most sensitive for a variation in the beach width and the median grain size. Furthermore, it can be concluded that aeolian sediment transport on Fire Island is often transport limited (85%) but occasionally supply limited (15%). From this research it can be concluded that there are processes and data missing for a hindcast with the AeoLiS model. The improvements for the AeoLiS model can be summarized as improvements to the initial conditions, as follows: 1. The accretion of Fire Island in the data analysis is based on lidar data. The lidar data is compared to 1D transects. Those 1D transects are also imposed in the AeoLiS model. Using a 2DH bathymetry with both x-directions and y-directions could give more information about aeolian sediment transport. 2. The grain size distribution for Fire Island is not known in detail. The sensitivity analysis indicated that the effect of the uncertainty of the mean and standard deviation of the grain size distribution on the total transport is 13%.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Kerst, S.M.A.A. (mentor); Shyrokau, B. (mentor)","2016","Anti-lock Brake System (ABS) is an active safety system nowadays implemented in every new car and could prevent the wheels from locking during heavy braking. Steering becomes ineffective and the brake distance longer than necessary when the wheels are locked. ABS has reduced the amount of non-fatal crashes significantly, but there are still situations in which it can control worse than driver would himself. For example, when driving on low-friction roads. The aim in this thesis is to develop a new ABS algorithm using potentially available information about wheel forces. Data of wheel forces is currently not measured in consumer cars, but SKF is developing load sensing bearings which could be feasible for such cars. The sensor output provides more directly relevant information than wheel deceleration data does. The latter is used in current ABS technology. A novel ABS algorithm that uses both force and wheel slip measurements for control is designed. The algorithm is validated on a Simulink model consisting of Delft-Tyre, simplified actuator dynamics, (optional) sensor noise, and a quarter car model. An EKF based on the Burckhardt model acts as reference for the control algorithm. The Burckhardt model is a computationally lightweight formula and allows the EKF to be used on-line against relatively little computational cost. Friction estimation is essential in the designed ABS algorithm, as it is dependant on the road surface which is not known a priori. The designed algorithm is first assessed in a Simulink model on different road surfaces. Field tests are performed as well. They show that the combination of force and slip measurements is indeed promising. On-line estimates using the EKF are found sufficiently accurate to be used as main reference for the controller.","anti-lock brake algorithm; ABS; on-line friction estimation; load sensing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Delft Center for Systems and Control (DCSC)","","","",""

Using transition analysis, it is assessed how people switch between different travel patterns over time. Data from the first three waves of the Netherlands Mobility Panel (MPN) is used to reveal different travel patterns and analyse transitions between these patterns over time. Six different meaningful travel patterns are used to asses transitions between these patterns over time. Four exogenous variables and six life events within the household-, employment- and residential biography are included to assess their effect on people’s transitions between the travel patterns. For all life events significant effects are found, indicating that there might indeed be ‘windows of opportunity’ to change travel behaviour when a life event occurs. The results show that, on average, people who only use a single mode are less likely to change their travel pattern compared to people who show a travel pattern that includes multiple modalities. In addition, the effects of life events and exogenous variables depend on initial travel pattern membership. For example, strict car users are generally less affected by life events than the other travel patterns. This indicates that it is important to include past travel behaviour within mobility biographies studies.","Latent class analysis; Latent transition analysis; Travel patterns; Life events; Mobility biographies; Travel behaviour","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2016-09-22","Technology, Policy and Management","Transport, Infrastructure & Logistics","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","Meeting short-term production targets is desired by many companies, since this would enable them to fine tune the processing operation, meet budget plans and obey contract requirements. Recently stochastic optimization solutions have been developed requiring geostatistical simulations as input. The significant value added has been demonstrated, however, an operational implementation of such approaches for day-to-day use is complex and seems currently difficult as it requires expert knowledge and extensive computational capacity. To control the short-term deviations, a new fast metaheuristic scheduler is developed that blends Geological Confidence Classes (GCC’s) from resource reporting standards. For the scheduler, a new penalty function is developed to schedule for a target blend of GCC’s and a new method is developed to enforce smooth mining patterns in three dimensions. The metaheuristic solver uses a Genetic Algorithm and an Ant Colony Optimization algorithm to efficiently converge towards the Pareto optimum. To establish an optimal blend of GCC’s, a methodology is developed which creates a range of equally probable scenarios of deviations from production targets for different blends of GCC’s. A least-squares estimate can be fitted to these scenarios at the required level of confidence to determine the optimal blend for a maximum allowed deviation. An historical world class gold deposit is used to show that the monthly and quarterly deviations can be controlled by blending GCC’s. Furthermore, the case study shows the possibility to establish an optimal blend of GCC’s by using the developed methodology. The scheduler proofs to be able to efficiently create and evaluate schedules to blend the GCC’s for this case study. For a maximum quarterly deviation of 15% at a 90% confidence level, the established optimal blend is 59% ore tonnage classified as measured resources. For the monthly deviations, a maximum of 15% is too low and cannot be met at a 90% confidence level.","Short-Term Mine Planning; Metaheuristics; controlling deviations; Geological Confidence Classes; Resource Reporting Standards","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","Resource Engineering / European Mining Course","",""

(mentor); Pulit, S.L. (mentor); Allahyar, A. (mentor)","2016","Motivation: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) aim to uncover the genetic basis of traits and common diseases. Due to the large number of common variants, most studies use a single-locus approach. However, those fail to explain most of the heritability, especially for complex diseases. Epistatic interactions, where two or more loci have a synergistic effect on the phenotype, are worth investigating to improve our understanding of the genetic architecture of human disease. Most studies that have investigated epistatic association in GWAS focus on gene-gene interactions only. However, regulatory elements such as enhancers have the power of increasing and decreasing the expression level of their target genes, playing a fundamental role in determining their effects, also in relation to diseases. Thus, enhancer-promoter, or enhancer-enhancer interactions should be included in the search for GWAS epistasis. More and more studies show that the control of gene expression can occur over large genomic distances. Enhancers loop over to get in physical contact with their target genes. In vivo, enhancers and promoters are therefore found in close 3D spatial proximity. Chromatin loops can be detected using the chromosome conformation capture (3C) technique and its derivatives. Particularly, Hi-C combines 3C with next generation sequencing (NGS), identifying all contacts between all pairs of genomic regions. Results: In this study, we investigate GWAS epistatic effects of single nucleotide polymorphisms pairs (SNPs) engaging in long-range chromatin interactions. To this end, we overlay GWAS hits, using the T2D (type 2 diabetes) dataset from the WTCCC (Wellcome Trust Case-Control Consortium), with high resolution Hi-C maps. We show that chromatin loops are enriched for common variants, particularly when highly associated with the phenotype. Moreover, looping regions are associated with enhancer activity. We find three sets of SNP pairs engaging in epistatic interactions, on chromosomes 2, 3 and 12. The SNPs are found in either regions with high enhancer activity or in genes involved in metabolic pathways, which supports their potential role in type 2 diabetes (T2D).","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Intelligent Systems","","Computer Science, track Bioinformatics","",""

(mentor)","2016","Wind assessment of new locations prior to the installation of wind turbines is an established process. However, this process is still very costly. The common way to measure offshore wind profiles is the usage of met masts, which get more expensive with increasing water depth and hub height. Recently, wind measurement LiDARs are installed on floating platforms to investigate the wind profile offshore. Floating LiDARs are a promising technology thanks to low cost and high flexibility. However, further understanding is required in order to make floating LiDAR technology fully acceptable. The movement of a floating LiDAR brings some uncertainty in reconstructing the wind vector and turbulence characteristics. These uncertainties hold back the full commercial acceptance of LiDAR technology in the offshore wind energy industry. In order to accept floating LiDARs as a valid technology, acceptance criteria need to be defined in terms of accuracy and confidence of the results. This thesis has developed a simulation tool to define and model the effect of uncertainties in floating Li- DAR technology, which influence the accuracy of the wind field characterisation. The model reconstructs wind vectors as seen by a specified LiDAR and is capable of analyzing the parameters influencing wind vector reconstruction. These parameters can be categorized in wave, wind and LiDAR conditions. Several wind profiles were used as input: a logarithmic wind profile for a first assessment, synthetic turbulent wind fields and Large Eddy simulations (LES) for a more realistic approach. Wave conditions based on the Airy wave and real-motion data are used to see the influence of wave height, wave period and wave number. It has been observed that floating LiDARs can reconstruct 10min velocities in a very accurate way, regardless of the experienced wave conditions which varied from normal to extreme conditions. For all considered wind tools, the error was less than 0.1 m/s for the averaged 10min wind speed, with a very small standard deviation, ¾. Reconstructing turbulence characteristics has been proven to be less accurate. The error is significant and cannot be ignored. With a reference turbulence intensity value of 8% at an altitude of 100m, the average bias can go up to 0.60% with a ¾-value of 0.52%for synthetic wind fields. In more extreme wave conditions, the average bias can go up to 1 % andmore. An error of more than 3%may occur at altitudes of 150m or higher for the turbulence intensity when using LES files in these extreme conditions. The use of motion correction is suggested to reduce this bias. This correction can happen with a mechanical system (motion stabilization platform) or a correction algorithm built into the software. Since the approach that was used in this research has proven to be successful, further research can be performed based on this study. Further investigation should be focused on understanding turbulence behaviour, measured by floating LiDARS. Also the usage of wind data coming from measurement campaigns should be valuable to proceed with in this research.","Windenergy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Aerodynamics, Wind Energy & Propulsion","","Wind Energy","",""

(mentor); Van Horssen, W.T. (mentor)","2016","The Three Body Problem (3BP) has been one of the main celestial mechanics problems in the past few centuries, for a long time studied by both engineers and mathematicians. Its practical purpose is to describe the motion of three particles only under their mutual gravitational interaction, thus it actually represents a ‘model’ of the real physical world. In fact, it can be seen as an extension of the Two Body Problem (2BP), which solutions are well-know and have been already employed in many space missions since the launch of Sputnik-1 in 1957, first artificial Earth satellite. Alternative formulation is given with the “restricted problem”, assuming the mass of the third body as negligible with respect to both principal ones. Under this assumption, justified by the small size of a general spacecraft compared to planets or moons, the ‘unperturbed’ motion of the main masses can be described by a Kepler solution, involving elliptic or circular bounded orbits. It follows the existence of an Elliptic (ER3BP) and a Circular problem (CR3BP), both admitting five equilibrium points (named Lagrange points), where a periodic orbital motion is theoretically possible. In this work three main families of periodic solutions (here called Lagrange orbits) have been investigated in a neighbourhood of L1/L2, Lagrange points adopted in the last 40 years for many space missions, e.g. for space observation and exploration purposes. The main objective here is to study these models based on their ‘standard’ formulation, so adopting the Dynamical System Theory for the Circular problem and later extending the entire discussion to the Elliptic one. In the CR3BP periodic solutions have been found embedded within continuous families, also showing different types of bifurcation. A single shooting method (Differential Correction algorithm) and a numerical continuation scheme have been applied, starting with the analytic approximation based on Perturbation Theory (Linstedt-Poincaré method). Indeed, the linear stability assessment, through Variational equations (studying the so-called Monodromy matrix), has provided large insights into dynamical proprieties of the problem. In some cases, close members within the same family have shown a very different behaviour, in the limit of this linear analysis, but still allowing to well-define principal bifurcations in their continuous parameters. The analysis and all methodologies presented have been tested on a nominal system, here the Earth-Moon-Spacecraft one, while their validity can be trivially extended to several other restricted problems. The ER3BP has been the second fundamental step of this work, where many additional aspects have been presented, e.g. the loss of continuous families. Nonetheless, non-trivial difficulties arise within the analytic approach, while many insights for the new dynamics can be provided by an analytic approximation of such motion. In support, the numerical approach has been able to tackle the problem, thus improving not only the analysis on linear stability, but most important revealing the so-called “eccentricity-bifurcation”. The latter is one of the most peculiar aspects related to the Elliptic problem, which now involves a new time-constraint (nominally the shooting-time), and leads to two branches of solutions (Left/Right family or Peri/Apo group) in agreement with most recent literature. A very different behaviour has been shown between these branches, while only resonance orbits actually survive within the ER3BP, once again highlighting the essentiality of adopting this more complete model for an accurate real space mission design.","Circular Restricted 3-Body Problem; CR3BP; Elliptic Restricted 3-Body Problem; ER3BP; Linear stability; Bifurcations; Earth-Moon system; Linstedt-Poincaré method; Differential Correction algorithm","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Space Engineering","","Space Flight","",""

(mentor); Fechner, U. (mentor)","2016","Kite Power research group at TU Delft developed the KiteSim framework for dynamic simulation of crosswind kite power systems. Currently, KiteSim has the capability to simulate leading edge inflatable kites. The use of rigid wing kites in crosswind kite power systems is becoming widespread. Accordingly, KiteSim framework is planned to be augmented to simulate the rigid wing kite power systems as well. Therefore, objective of this thesis is set to enhance the KiteSim framework in order to include the capability of the dynamic simulation of a rigid wing pumping crosswind kite power system by developing a particle system model to represent the tethered rigid wing. The particle system model of rigid wing consists of 6 point masses and 13 spring-damper elements. Positions and masses of the discrete particles are calculated in order to represent the rigid wing properties accurately. The spring-damper elements are interconnecting the particles. Lifting line theory and Kirke’s post stall correlation methods are used to create the full angle of attack aerodynamic model for wings and tails. Available atmospheric, tether and winch models of the KiteSim framework are also used for rigid wing dynamic simulations. Equation of the motion of the particle system model is formulated as an implicit problem, which is simulated by implicit Runge-Kutta method of fifth-order. Validation simulations are conducted with the particle system model of NASA SGS 1-36 flight test sailplane. Validation cases show satisfactory results with the flight test data. For the remaining simulations, AP2 PowerPlane of Ampyx Power is modelled as particle system and manually flown in KiteSim. Mass properties of the model is found to be highly accurate throughout the simulations. Power generation capabilities of the model is checked by flying figure-of-eight trajectories. Reel-out phases are investigated, a peak mechanical power of 45 kW and a mean power of 10 kW are obtained. Further comparison of the reel-out dynamic simulations with the quasi-steady theoretical calculations is done. Moreover, gliding and stalling manoeuvres are simulated for a plausibility check study. The developed particle system model for rigid wings shows satisfactory results and a potential for further development.","Windenergy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Aerodynamics, Wind Energy & Propulsion","","Flight Performance and Propulsion","",""

(mentor); Frouws, J.W. (mentor); Schuil, H.H. (mentor)","2016","Since ING Shipping would like to gain more insight in sustainability in shipping, the costs and benefits of sustainable shipping are investigated. Sustainability is defined as a state that will retain the combined amount of social, economic and environmental assets over time. And ING defines a sustainable transaction as a transaction in which the asset financed outperforms its peers in a sustainability assessment. The critical factors of the sustainability of a ship’s design are air emissions, the presence of a ballast water treatment system and the presence of a green passport. Air emissions can be evaluated by determining the amount of emissions of a vessel and multiplying them with the external damage costs of the different emissions. The available shipping sustainability models were assessed and deemed as insufficient. Since none of the models met the requirements of a sustainability model, a new model was developed. This model estimates the sustainability of a vessel by comparing it to a benchmark vessel, which is determined by the Holtrop Mennen method. This comparison is based on the external costs of the air emissions of the vessels. In the current worldwide fleet, being sustainable means being more fuel efficient than the average vessel. The increased fuel efficiency of sustainable vessels leads to a yearly cost saving of approximately 2 – 10%. The sensitivity analysis of the fuel price shows that its influence on the financial advantages of fuel efficiency is limited. Calculations with a scrubber, an SCR system and MDO show that the advantages to society are significant compared to the costs for the shipping company. However, the systems are not used, since the costs are for the shipping company, yet it does not get the benefits. Therefore, incentives from society to stimulate the use of these options can lead to more sustainable shipping.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-09-21","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Marine and Transport Technology","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","Data-driven technologies for building decision support tools are on the rise and the shipping industry is also exploring this concept. Various applications of the such methodologies are being developed in order to understand trends and patterns deeply. Such trends and patterns can certainly help in the decision making process as well as risk mitigation. These methods are useful for both, the operational as well as the managerial side of shipping. Many organizations feel the need to acquire and process business and trade data for gaining valuable intelligence which can aid the decision making process. Automatic Identification Sytem (AIS) is one equipment which is being used not only for the purpose of enhanced safety, but also Business Intelligence in the shipping sector. The use of AIS is increasing and the information generated by processing this raw and unstructured data can prove beneficial for all stakeholders in the shipping industry. As the data generated by thousands of vessels everyday is huge, several problems arise during its analysis. Reliable analysis, information and intelligence can be possible only after the data is transformed into a clean and structured database. Such clean databases can be worked upon to design various applications which in turn improve business and operational processes. The dry bulk shipping is one of the most important segments in shipping and industry sectors like manufacturing, energy, real estate and infrastructure are heavily dependent on it. Also, the trade in this segment is quite specialized. Research related to trade patterns in the dry bulk shipping market can certainly give an insight into the current economic activity in a particular country. This research work focusses on developing tools to clean and process this huge data in order to create a database suitable for analysis. Further, it also aims at developing tools to eliminate the impact of unreliable data arising due to human interference. It also tries to formulate methods capable of calculating/estimating the import trade for certain commodities in a defined maritime zone. Lastly, the thesis discusses the various applications which can be designed by creating a link between information generated from mining AIS data, public databases, existing literature and basic knowledge of shipping. All this research work contributes to lessening the effort required to acquire data from independent ship-brokers. It reduces subjectivity and dependency on information providers. Moreover, the thesis also explores emerging concepts of data analytics, location analytics, text mining and most importantly business and commodity intelligence in the shipping sector.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-09-21","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Marine & Transport Technology","","","",""

(mentor); Sleeswijk Visser, F. (mentor); Roscam Abbing, E. (mentor)","2016","On the present day, corporate organisations want to change their product-focussed approach towards a customer experience focussed approach. This human- centred approach to innovation is called CX Innovation. CX Innovation gives corporate organisations a competitive advantage, but they struggle to implement CX Innovation in their organisation. Corporate organisations struggle to be CX-Innovative because current initiatives are intervention focussed. External consultants are hired to do projects on CX Innovation, but those projects are often not implemented because they lack organisational support. Some organisations send their employees to external training programmes, but these programmes lack integration and links with the employees’ daily practices. To overcome this struggle, training that is integrated in the corporate daily practices is the most effective way to ingrain CX-Innovation. To conclude; in order to be CX-innovative, corporate organisations need an integrated training programme on CX Innovation. Zilver Innovation is an expert in the area of CX Innovation, and this provided the following assignment: “Design an integrated training programme to ingrain CX Innovation in daily corporate practice to enable corporate organisations to adapt to changes in society and create value for their customers by delivering CX Innovative experiences, products and services” Internal, external and literature research, and eight interviews provided insights on the structure and components of the integrated training programme. The research furthermore provided a learning objectives framework, ten didactic guidelines for trainers, and the start of a new instructional design model. The insights and didactic guidelines were validated and sharped by three real-life case studies. The case studies also provided additional insights on the integrated training programme. The combined insights led to the advice to link training to consultancy projects: Consultancy+. Linking training to consultancy projects is the next step in consultancy. It creates both buy-in for the consultancy project as for the way of working, and possible other projects. In this way, participants can be trained together with their colleagues, and without being isolated from their organisation. Participants are able to apply everything learned immediately into their daily jobs. It helps participants to explain what they are doing to their boss, and stimulates the relationship with the client. Consultancy+ offers a modular integrated training programme, including twelve possible training sessions. Consultancy+ is completely optimised to offer the best possible learning experience, based on latest scientific insights on (corporate) learning. The modular structure makes the programme (partly) scalable, repeatable and adaptable. The programme is customised for every client, to fit their specific needs and requirements. For the customisation of Consultancy+ a toolkit was developed, which helps Zilver to co-create the perfect programme for and with their client. For the execution, a manual for trainers was developed. The manual shows information on the programme, provides an action plan for Consultancy+ and helps the trainer to develop the best learning experience for the participants in a training session. To summarise, Consultancy+ offers an unique training programme on CX Innovation for corporate organisation by combining Zilver’s expertise on CX Innovation with a didactically optimised learning experience.","customer experience; training; consultancy; learning; corporate training; didactics; customer experience innovation; service design; design thinking","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","The Master's programme Industrial Ecology is jointly organised by Leiden University and Delft University of Technology - Biojet fuel is developed as a potentially more sustainable alternative to existing petroleum based jet fuels. To establish the environmental and social sustainability of the biojet fuel product system, the full life cycle of the production should be analyzed. The environmental LCA (ELCA)and social LCA (SLCA) have been developed as two independent tools, but they cannot be used to analyze the same product system as their system boundaries differ. This research studies the possibility of harmonizing the two tools into a single social and environmental LCA (SELCA) methodology in light of its use in the biojet fuel product system. SELCA was developed through an extensive literature review, followed by catering it to the biojet fuel product system based on a survey and a dummy case study. The ELCA is based on unit processes while the SLCA uses organizations as its base. To reconcile these two system elements, the organizations were treated as multifunctional processes that can be allocated to the product system. The DPSIR model was used to ensure that data on interventions and economic flows were equivalent to each other and capable of being causally connected to the product system. The resulting methodology has consistent system boundaries and data for both social and environmental impacts. The majority of existing SLCA characterization methods and indicators are not compatible with SELCA. Indicators must be based on DPSIR pressure level data and be capable of being aggregated for the product system in order to be comparable to ELCA indicators. Many SLCA methodologies are based on statistical data which conceptually cannot be attributed to a particular organization or unit process. The only operational methodology is that of Hunkeler (2006) which uses quantitative labor hour data. As a methodology for assessing the biojet fuel, SELCA has several limits. The existing indicators do not address all issues considered important by academia and the industry. Also, despite that SELCA can in principle include the full biojet product system, in practice it will be limited by the lack of background databases. This results in more cut-off points and smaller system boundaries as shown in the dummy case study. However, with further research and development of characterization methods and databases, SELCA has the potential to fully integrate the environmental and social impact assessments of the biojet fuel product system.","Life cycle assessment; LCA; Social life cycle assessment; SLCA; Biojet fuel","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Engineering, Systems and Services","","Industrial Ecology","",""

During a landfall operation an offshore pipeline is pulled by means of a steel wire rope on the shore with a velocity of 7 cm/s. During this process the steel wire rope interacts with the soil located on the seabed and on the shore. Allseas Engineering BV has a long experience on landfall operations and it was occasionally noticed that the steel wire ropes were buried beneath sand dunes which resulted from sedimentation and wave actions. In these instances excessive pulling forces were required to mobilise the steel wire ropes. A prototype experimental setup was developed for simulating the pulling process in medium scale. Physical modelling involved the pulling of a steel element through saturated sand with a relative density of 80%. The aim of this apparatus was to examine the shear failure mechanisms that develop in saturated sand while a steel pipe, with a significantly rough surface, is pulled through it. The main focus points of this study were the peak pulling force of the steel pipe and the change of pore pressures around the steel pipe's circumference during the pulling process. The latter two were examined with respect to six burial depths (0 - 0.31 m) and three pulling velocities (1, 4 and 7 cm/s). It was observed that at every test a momentary decrease of pore pressures was taking place around the steel pipe during the pulling process. A peak was always recorded at the same time as the peak pulling force and this was attributed to the tendency of sand particles to dilate around the steel pipe. Undrained loading conditions were caused by the high pulling velocities and low permeability of the soil. Therefore, dilation was restrained by the pore water and consequently tensile pore pressures developed which increased the shear strength of the soil, momentarily. Burying the steel pipe at different depths influenced, as it was expected, the peak pulling force due to the increase of the vertical effective stresses. In addition, the peak decrease of pore pressures was found to increase in magnitude while the burial depth ranged from 0 to 0.09 m and this was an unexpected event as the tendency of the soil to dilate was expected to be restrained. The magnitude of peak pore pressure decrease was also found to reduce at burial depths ranging from 0.09 m to 0.31 m due to the increase of vertical effective stresses that restrained the soil's tendency to dilation. The effect of pulling velocity to the peak pulling force and the peak pore pressure reduction values was also examined. The latter were found to increase linearly with the increase of pulling velocity, at each burial depth that was tested. Also, the peak pulling forces were found to increase linearly while comparing tests at the same burial depth, conducted with different pulling velocities. In addition, the increase of pulling velocity caused a linear increase on the stiffness index of the test specimens. The scientific significance of the results of the current study can assist to performing landfall operations in a more efficient way. It is recommended that during a landfall operation the initiation of the pulling of the steel wire rope should take place at the lowest possible rate. As a result, the maximum pulling force will be minimised and the pulling velocity can be increased gradually once the steel wire rope is mobilised. Moreover, the findings of this study can be useful for the (un-)installation of (offshore) piles, sheet pile walls, soil nails and dredging operations on saturated sands.","undrained; sand-steel interfaces; shear strength; pore pressure reduction; physical modelling; landfall operations","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","Geo-Engineering","",""

(mentor); Brinkgreve, R.B.J. (mentor); Gavin, K.G. (mentor)","2016","The constantly increasing demand of the world for energy has led to a remarkable advancement in the offshore geotechnical engineering field that is closely related to the oil and gas production. In this industry, floating production facilities are connected with the seabed through mooring lines that are attached to anchor foundations. In this context, suction anchors have been increasingly installed to ensure good mechanical performance under variable operational loads. Therefore, they should be able to withstand the horizontal, vertical and torsional (HVT) loads stemming from the inclined loading imposed by the mooring chains. The undesired torsion is induced in the problem when the anchor is not perfectly aligned with the floating facility due to imperfections during installation. This work constitutes a comparative study between three distinctive numerical approaches that revolve around the undrained capacity of misaligned suction anchors founded in normally consolidated clay. Its main aim is to unravel the strengths and weaknesses of the well established methods of analysis used nowadays. The effectiveness of the two current adopted methods is shown with reference to a benchmark study that involves a thorough 3D finite element investigation on the impact of misalignment on the capacity of suction anchors following a total stress analysis (TSA) within Plaxis 3D. Even though this type of analysis (TSA) is widely employed nowadays, it is considered as a rough approximation of the actual soil behaviour under undrained conditions. This statement acted as an incentive to conduct an effective stress analysis (ESA) of the same problem. For this purpose, different calibrations of an advanced Cam - Clay type constitutive model (the Soft Soil model) were realised to capture the soil conditions of the benchmark study, which embraced a simplified Tresca failure criterion. Additionally, a simpler 2D numerical approach of the same problem was realised with the use of SPCalc, which is a special purpose tool that accounts for 3D effects through the application of side shear and reduction factors. In this case, misorientation is modelled by the reduction of the soil - anchor interface resistance. Failure envelopes are derived for the two current approaches and compared for three different length-to-diameter anchor ratios (1.5, 3 and 6), and for misalignment angles in the range of 0° to 10°. The outcomes of this study give a better insight into the practical implications of certain modelling assumptions. In particular, it is shown that the influence of misalignment on the undrained HV capacity may be in fact non-negligible, while the expected conservatism arising from simplified 2D analysis is quantitatively pointed out. Even though ESA is thought to enhance the mechanical soundness of undrained modelling, it creates additional difficulties in terms of soil parameter calibration. Therefore, the close relationship between HVT failure envelopes and the modelling of clay strength in the effective stress framework is critically discussed with respect to the preliminary results of the benchmark study.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","Geo-Engineering","",""

(mentor); Roscam Abbing, E. (mentor)","2016","Background & Relevance The OV-chipcard has been widely accepted within the Netherlands as method for payment in pubic transport. However the smartcard does not lower the barrier of use for everyone and research shows that infrequent and international travellers often still have trouble purchasing and using it. To deal with this problem the Nationaal Openbaar Vervoer Beraad (NOVB) created a future vision document in which they state the want to enhance the travel experience and increase traveller satisfaction within in the Netherlands by implementing the contactless EMV bank card in Dutch public transport (EMV-pt). Because experience with the OV-chipcard has shown the importance of dealing with a new development through a user-centered and integral approach, the main focus for this project is the perspective of the user. If done right, the implementation of the contactless bank card in public transport could increase the simplicity of the Dutch public transportation system by giving travellers an extra way of travelling. Project Setup & Approach This project is a collaboration between the TU-Delft Expertise Centre or E-ticketing in Public Transport and Translink. The main focus during the project was the perspective of the user and thus a user-centered approach has been taken. Although the emphasis during this project was on user-centered design solutions, other aspects were also taken into account during the project. Throughout the project user demand and wishes served as starting point and the technological feasibility and business viability acted as frame in which the eventual design should fit. Process The project consisted of two phases, an analysis phase and a design phase. In the analysis phase research has been performed in various contexts that have EMV-pt implemented. By taking a closer look at the public transport system of London, Chicago and the Czech Republic, it became apparent that there are still many pitfalls when it comes to implementing EMV-pt. Issues concerning consistency, service personnel knowledge and the experience of insufficient control could be found within these countries. The results of this research made is possible to form threats and guidelines for the implementation of the contactless bank card in Dutch public Transport as well as create a model showing which factors influence the acceptance of EMV-pt. In the design phase the results of the analysis research has been used to see what is needed to make the adoption of EMV-pt in the Netherlands successful. Within the scope of the first years of EMV-pt implementation, several user groups could be defined and mapped out in a customer journey. Using the customer journey to identify opportunities for improvement, various touchpoint ideas were generated in order to enhance the user-friendliness of EMV-pt. By evaluating these ideas with users and stakeholders the wants and needs of all parties involved could be identified in order to create an EMV-pt service concept that was acceptable to all of them. This service has been prototyped and tested in its entirety with the user groups in order to refine the concept. Design: A Service Design for EMV Contactless in Dutch Public Transport The service design for EMV-pt aims to give travellers an easy way of accessing public transport using their contactless bank card. By making it possible to directly travel from one’s bank account, EMV-pt allows travellers to use public transport without having to top up or pay for a ticket or travelcard in advance. Within this service concept several aspects form the foundation of this design. These aspects can be described with the following keywords: uncomplicated, transparent and empathic. Uncomplicated: When using the contactless bank card the aim is to make sure its use it perceived and experienced as simple. Features that are connected to this aspect are the ability to be able to travel with EMV-pt without activating or registering the bank card prior to use. Unlike the OVCP the bank card does not make use of a deposit and has a stretched contactless spending limit of 50 euro in order to make it possible for users to travel without worrying too much about reaching their contactless spending limit. The entire service is promoted as a service given by public transport as a whole that is supported by the banks, making it clear for people where to look for help in case problems occur. Transparent: Seeing as EMV-pt makes it possible to travel using the money of the traveller’s bank account, it is essential to be honest and open in order for people to trust the new technology. Because EMV-pt is not like any other public transport ticket and certainly does not work the same way in the back office, information will be made available to the travellers of the exact way EMV-pt works. Empathic: Because the bank card is a personal and valuable object to many travellers, it is important that the card is also treated as such. The service gives travellers the option to deactivate EMV-pt if they do not want to use it, which can be either done by deactivating the contactless feature at one’s bank or by specifically deactivating EMV-pt at the OV-betalen website. When used for the first time, the banks will also notify people when the card is used in order to make them aware of both the existence of EMV-pt as well as potential misuse. Although a spending limit hinders the use of the contactless bank card in public transport, it is nevertheless added to the service in order for people to feel comfortable when using EMV-pt.","user-centered; design; public transportation; ov-chipkaart; bank card; contactless; user research; technology acceptance; adoption; EMV","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor); Holtslag, E. (mentor)","2016","The capability to acquire accurate and reliable measurements of the wind is essential for wind turbine validation and wind resource assessment. These measurements are typically done with tall meteorological masts (met-masts). However, as of 2004 the concept of remote sensing has started to become specialised in wind energy. A key requirement before full implementation can be accepted, is a fully traceable uncertainty chain. The aim of this thesis is closing the uncertainty chain by providing an innovative best practise guideline in order to establish a quantifiable and repeatable classification uncertainty. After the closure the viability of remote sensing to replace met-masts has been assessed. The classification uncertainty comprises several steps, of which the assessment of interdependency of atmospheric variables was left open by the regulations. This thesis provides a tested automated procedure, hence contributes to both the wind industry and body of science. Based on the results of this thesis it was observed that the usage of thresholds, imposed by the regulations, led to erratic behaviour in the uncertainties. The acquired inconsistencies are significant to the extent that the author recommends not to use the classification uncertainties, and therefore the total uncertainties. As a direct result the author does not recommend a full replacement of met-masts. To improve the current uncertainty model, it is recommended to implement weighing functions to create a smoother output. Furthermore, additional requirements to the acceptance of binned data are recommended in order to avoid skewing of the regression due to biased data-sets, hereby increasing the robustness of the procedure. After these recommendations are implemented it is advised to do a second iteration of establishing the thresholds.","Windenergy; Remote; Sensing; Lidar; Sodar; Classification; Uncertainty; Interdependency","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2016-09-20","Aerospace Engineering","Aerodynamics","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","The work done in this thesis focused on controller software for the Generic Short Stroke Actuator of Moog B.V. The actuator is controlled by the FCS controller, which makes use of a switched PID controller. This allows arbitrary control over the movement of the Generic Short Stroke Actuator. The FCS controller can switch between a position and force feedback loop. For various safety reasons the FCS controller has both force limits placed on it. If those limits are breached during operation, the FCS controller switches from position PID to force PID. Under certain conditions the even of a switch drives the actuator into a region of instability. The following thesis deals with finding the conditions for which the FCS controller drives the system into unstable regions. With the problems found, a solutions will be sought after from the field of Hybrid and Optimal Control theory. Three different approaches are investigated to solve the problems found: Dwell-time, Back Calculation Anti-Wind Up,Model Predictive Control. Dwell-time is a technique from the Hybrid Control theory field. A adequately found dwell-time guaranties the stability of any arbitrary switching system, like the FCS controller is. The Back Calculation Anti-wind up technique is a extension of PID control that deals with actuator saturation due to integrator wind up. Both of those techniques are improvements made to the FCS controller. Model Predictive Control comes form the filed of Optimal Control theory. Model predictive control tries to find optimal control input at each time step, taking into account any limits. In order to be able to design the above controllers, an accurate mathematical model was developed using fist principles. The model was optimised and validated against measured data from the system plant. As the plant is non-linear, to analyse it locally, the non-linear equations are linearised to establish a state space linear time-invariant system model. As the controllers are implemented on a computer, the model needed to be discretized to enable design of discrete controllers.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Delft Center for Systems and Control (DCSC)","","","",""

(mentor); Verheij, H.J. (mentor); Molenaar, W.F. (mentor); Bloemendal, M. (mentor)","2016","The city of Amsterdam increases with approximately 10,000 inhabitants per year and Amsterdam-North is strongly under development attracting housing, employment and (re)creational activities. This is expected to induce a growth of 65% in pedestrians and cyclists, referred to as slow traffic. crossing the river IJ in 2025. The city ferry system, that currently facilitates the connection between the river banks for slow traffic, has almost reached its maximum. Therefore, the connection between the river banks of the IJ needs to be improved in order to meet the future demand of slow traffic by guaranteeing a fast and safe connection. This research investigates the possibility of bridges at the Java-island and the Stenen Hoofd providing a continuous available connection for slow traffic, considering the area between the Stenen Hoofd and the Schellingwouderbridge. The main goal is to determine the influence of the Java bridge and the Stenen Hoofd bridge on the passage time of the recreational fleet on water and pedestrians and cyclists crossing the bridges in 2025. As this is influenced by the bridge opening regime applied to these bridges, the optimal bridge opening regime is determined in case the Java bridge and/or the Stenen Hoofd bridge are present at the IJ. Finding the optimal bridge opening regime is an optimization process that is done by defining, evaluating and improving the performance of a certain bridge opening regime. The performance of a certain bridge opening regime is determined by executing simulations with SIVAK II. This model simulates the behaviour of the traffic flow of both vessels and road traffic within a network of (inland) waterways including hydraulic structures, like bridges. If the optimal bridge opening regime is applied to the Java bridge and the Stenen Hoofd bridge, the following can be concluded. The delay in travel time of the recreational fleet navigating between the Stenen Hoofd and the Schellingwouderbidge depends on the number of bridges. This delay can increase up to 14 minutes if both the Java bridge and the Stenen Hoofd bridge are present. An average number of four vessels has to wait prior to passing a bridge, which can increase up to 15. The mean waiting time for slow traffic, when being halted during bridge opening operations, amounts approximately five minutes. This corresponds with around 120 pedestrians and cyclists on average, which can increase up to 500, to be halted during a bridge opening operation. Concerning the influence of the presence of the Java bridge and the Stenen Hoofd bridge, it can be stated that the efficiency of the navigation flow of the recreational fleet increases when the number of bridges at the IJ is reduced. Furthermore, it can be stated that pedestrians and cyclists significantly benefit from the presence of bridges. As this study focuses on the impact of the optimal bridge opening regime on the navigation flow of the recreational fleet and slow traffic only, it is recommended to take other criteria into account as well when deciding on the number of bridges preferred to be present in 2025. These criteria are amongst others the influence of a certain bridge opening regime during peak hours, the accessibility of the city districts, life cycle management, long term plans and costs and benefits.","IJ; optimal traffic flow; SIVAK; recreational fleet","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Ports and Waterways","",""

(mentor); Niedermeier, A. (mentor); van der Veen, A.J. (mentor)","2016","Transform coding has been extensively used for audio and speech compression applications during the past decades. A widely used transform is the real-valued Modified Discrete Cosine Transform (MDCT), which is employed in several state-of-the-art codecs such as the MPEG-1 Layer III (aka mp3) and AAC. An extension to this transform is the Modulated Complex Lapped Transform (MCLT). One advantage of the MCLT over the MDCT is that the phase information is easily extractable in the former transform. However, this comes at a cost: Since the coefficients are complex, the critical sampling property of the MDCT does not hold any more. Thus, to overcome this shortcoming, it would be plausible to send the magnitude of the complex MCLT spectrum plus certain side information to the decoder and estimate the phase spectrum there to be able to reconstruct the time domain signal. In this work, the properties of the MCLT phase spectrum are investigated for simple signal classes, namely sinusoids, chirps and their harmonic extensions as a model for voiced speech. Then, algorithms for reconstruction of the phase spectrum using the magnitude spectrum and side information are proposed. Furthermore, heuristics for decreasing the computational complexity of the derived algorithms are given. For the objective evaluation, the MCLT phase of artificial harmonic chirp signals is reconstructed. The measurements show high reconstruction accuracy. Additionally a subjective listening test on synthetic chirp vowel signals with reconstructed phase indicates high perceptual quality.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2017-09-19","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics","","Signals and Systems","",""

(mentor)","2016","Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) have the potential to make quality education affordable and available to the masses and reduce the gap between the most privileged and the most disadvantaged learners worldwide. However, this potential is overshadowed by low completion rates, often below 15%. Due to the high level of autonomy that is required when learning with a MOOC, literature identifies limited self-regulated learning skills as one of the causes that lead to early dropouts in MOOCs. Moreover, existing tools designed to aid learners in the online learning environment fail to provide the support needed for the development of such skills. The aim of the present work is to bridge this gap by investigating how self-regulated learning skills can be enhanced by encouraging metacognition and reflection in MOOC learners by means of social comparison. To this end, following an iterative process, we have developed the Learning Tracker, an interactive widget which allows learners to visualise their learning behaviour and compare it to that of previous graduates of the same MOOC. Each iteration was extensively evaluated in live TU Delft MOOCs running on the edX platform while engaging over 20.000 MOOC learners over the whole duration of each MOOC. Our results show that learners that have access to the Learning Tracker are more likely to graduate the MOOC. Moreover, we have observed that the widget has a positive impact on learners' engagement and reduces procrastination. However, we have little evidence that learners improved their self-regulated learning skills by the end of the MOOCs. Based on our results, we argue that the mere fact of receiving feedback on a limited number of learning habits could trigger self-reflection in learners and lead to improved learner performance. This work underlines the powerful effect feedback and self-reflection on one's behaviour has on learning performance. We recommend that future research should investigate learners' feedback literacy and devise effective ways of presenting learners with personalised feedback based on their goals, learning skill level and cultural background.","learning analytics; learner dashboard; self-reflection; feedback; social comparison; massive open online courses","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Software Technology","","","",""

(mentor); Molenaar, W.F. (mentor)","2016","On 29 October 2012 hurricane Sandy hit the coast of New York City. This category 1 hurricane had a devastating effect: large parts of the city were flooded and the city was out of business for several days. An estimated total damage of $41.9 billion had occurred of which $5 billion in account of the metro system. The largest damage was to the subway (underground) on Manhattan. The main challenge of this research was to design a protection for the subway of Manhattan. The main sources of flood water are the rivers that enter the city via overflow of the river bank. Flood water enters the subway system mainly via the ventilation grates and the commuter entrances. There are not many tubes that start in a flood prone area. The tube most vulnerable for flooding is the Steinway tube of the Flushing line, running from Queens under the East River to Grand Central Station on Manhattan. The Steinway tube has 200,000 daily users and was flooded during Sandy via the ventilation grates on 50th Avenue. The future flood levels in this report take the 90th percentile sea level rise (SLR) projection into account as calculated by the NPCC. The safety level is currently 1/60-years, but decreases to 1/5-years is SLR projections in 2080 are reached. Long Island City is modelled as a storage basin where water enters via overflow of the East River Bank. The inflow of the 100 to 10,000 year floods is modelled as a harmonic tidal wave. The results show that the water level in the basin is equal to the storm surge flood level in most cases. Combined with surface elevation data, the damage to the three subsystems Long Island City, the Steinway tube and the subway system of Manhattan shows that the risk is significant. At the considered flood levels, the Flushing line will flood via the start of the Steinway tube. The Steinway tube inflow model shows whether the flood water reaches Grand Central Station on Manhattan. A 1/500-years flood in 2080 results in a total damage of $2,571 million to all three systems. Compared to protection of only the Steinway tube, the multifunctional bank protection at the East River, called the Greenline, adds the most value to Long Island City. Considering the political and economic feasibility, the Greenline is not designed into detail. The Steinway Flood Gate scores the highest on benefit/costs-ratio, while the protection of Manhattan only is economic not feasible: the net present value is negative for each design level. The Steinway tube is protected by closing the ventilation grates and commuter entrances with covers that are designed by a third party. Directly in front of the Steinway tube, the Steinway Flood Gate is designed. This vertical lifting gate has a door of 6.00 meters high and 7.70 meters wide. Two towers of 12 meters support this flood door. The door is able to move in horizontal direction to enable the sealing of the tube. The Steinway Flood Gate is a perfect long-term flood protection that can be realized in the near future. It is an economically attractive investment that improves the safety of the New York City Subway system. However, in the faraway future the Greenline gives much more value per invested dollar.","Flood risk; New York City; Hydraulic structures; metro; subway; protection","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Jonker, P.P. (mentor)","2016","The Dutch Central Bureau of Statistics expects the elderly population to grow from 2.4 million in 2012 to 4.7 million in 2041, putting intense pressure on health care budgets. As elderly get older and older, even more pressure on health care budgets will exist in the near future. Therefore, there is currently a focus on prevention: reduce incidents and allow people to live safely in their own homes for a longer time as this will greatly reduce healthcare costs. One approach to this goal is the development of an autonomous service robot, capable of assisting elderly persons in their daily activities and able to recognize dangerous actions or situations. Although humans are seemingly capable of effortless action recognition, artificial systems employing human action recognition algorithms still have many difficulties doing so. This thesis proposes a new approach: Kinect RGB-D skeletal data is captured in a spatial temporal pattern, making use of 3D motion history. Using a dimensionality reduction technique called orthogonal class learning a novel representation is generated called motion history spatio temporal pattern or MH-STP. This allows the space and time information of the skeleton to be preserved and compressed in a compact feature. Using an action graph model for classification, real time recognition rates can be achieved by modeling probabilities of observed consecutive poses. This thesis aims to provide a novel method for successful, robust and reliable action recognition in an online setting. The system was tested on the Microsoft Research Action 3D dataset as well as a novel dataset (12 actions, 9 subjects, 3 different angles, 3 instances per angle) recorded specifically for this thesis. Although the Microsoft dataset did not have high quality skeleton data, promising initial results were obtained (existing methods 68% - 90%, proposed method 83%). More extensive testing of the method’s parameters on the novel data set led to a much better understanding of the MH-STP representation in both offline and online action recognition methods. This resulted in an excellent offline recognition rate on the novel data set in a more challenging cross subject situation (proposed method: 95%, existing up to 89%). In the online situation the general approach was tested as well using a novel two-stage classifier that adds a secondary classification step on top of the action recognition framework. This allows (re)classification if the action graph result is not confident enough or fails to classify an observed test sequence. A very good recognition rate of 92% was observed in a 50% training cross subject test. Although this result was well above expectations, inter-action variance is a challenging factor, depending on the MH-STP grid size and the amount of available samples","vision based action recognition; spatial-temporal patterns; home automation; elderly care","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Biomechanical Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Nas, D.N. (mentor); Baak, L. (mentor)","2016","The world of telecom is changing rapidly. Access to internet has changed the way customers use their phone. To differentiate itself from competitors, increase customer satisfaction and willingness to stay, Vodafone introduced Smart Life products. These products add value to the standard contract of the customer. The Consumer Services (CS) department is responsible for the Smart Life products. Within the department CS marketers are responsible for the communication about the Smart Life products to the customers. But the communication does not seem to meet the value and benefits for the customer and therefore the customer does not activate the products. The problem found in the CS department was that the current communication strategy was product focussed and did not stimulate the customer to activate and use the Smart Life products. The CS marketers said that they lacked insight in customer values, did not knew who their customer was and that the communication strategy was not designed from a customer perspective. This resulted in the aim of the thesis: Make the CS marketers aware of a customer centric way of communicating towards a customer and support the CS marketer to design a customer centric communication strategy. To solve the problem two research questions were developed: 1, how to develop a more customer centric communication strategy. And 2, who is the Smart Life user? The research questions are answered by two qualitative researches: an internal research and an user research. The internal research investigated what factors influenced the current development process and what holds the CS marketer back from developing a customer centric communication strategy. The user research provided deep information about who the Smart Life user is and why the user uses a product. These insights of the researches are used to solve the problem in practice. The internal research obtained two focus areas where the communication strategy could be improved to be more customer centric: Understanding the customer Redesign of the development process of the communication strategy The user research led to three characteristics based on customer behaviour: • Willingness to pay (extra), • Level of consciousness on data spending • The attitude toward adopting a Smart Life product. To make use of a Smart Life product data is needed and a subscription need to be bought. To do so a customer needs a high or medium willingness to pay for data usage or a subscription. Moreover, the research showed that users who used the Smart Life products were less conscious on data spending and had a positive attitude toward adopting Smart life products. This is affected by knowledge based trust in the product and perception on what the attribute of the product can deliver to the customer. With this insights three customer profiles are found; • Enjoyer • Conscious enjoyer • Saver A saver has high level of consciousness on data spending, a low willingness to pay for a subscription or his data usage and a negative attitude toward new products. Because of this a saver will not use the Smart Life products but the enjoyer and conscious enjoyer will do. They have a higher willingness to pay and lower level of consciousness on data spending. Both profiles need a different way of communication. This results in messages with different benefits, context descriptions and characters. Character statements help to design a more personalised goal for a message and fit an enjoyer or conscious enjoyer. The following character statements were developed for the target groups: Enjoyer - An enjoyer must be approached in a enthusiastic, proactive way, the fact that the product provides comfort and takes less effort should be the main message. Conscious enjoyer - A conscious enjoyer must be approached with a cheerful message that is transparent on price and amount of data that the product will cost. Additional educating information will provide knowledge about the product and data spending which will help to get to know and trust the product and finally adopt it. The marketers needed to have more understanding of the customers and a redesign of the development process for a communication strategy was needed. As a result a workshop, consisting of 3 tools is designed. Every tool is used for another goal: • Tool 1: Participant and facilitator guide: preparation for the workshop • Tool 2: The customer canvas: get to know the customer & brainstorm about their needs. • Tool 3: Communication strategy canvas: customer centric design of the strategy. The tools will enable the CS marketer and the involved stakeholders to be more aware of what type of customer they target and what should be communicated to them. The tools create a new development process to design a customer centric communication strategy. The customer insights from the participant and facilitator guides (tool 1) can be used to support brainstorms and decisions during the design of the strategy. Following the two other tools ensure that all stakeholders think from the customer perspective and that an overview is created of the all communication moments. Additionally the tools take care of understanding each others ideas and communicating these ideas. All together the designed solution meets the aim of this thesis. The design supports the CS marketer in creating a customer centric communication strategy. It makes the CS marketer more aware of the different kind of customers he is approaching. This transforms the product focused communication strategy into a customer focused one and results in a more personalised message towards customers.","Telecom; User research; Customer profiles; Tool design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Strategic Product Design","","","",""

(mentor); Van Ledden, M. (mentor); Verhagen, H.J. (mentor); Van Berchem, E.C. (mentor)","2016","The Houston Metropolitan area is a hurricane prone area and vulnerable to flooding by large storm surges caused by these extreme storm events. The area is a major economic center in the State of Texas and even the whole United States. Protection of the area against flooding is extremely necessary to protect the economy, community and environment. Hurricane Ike (2008) is one of the many hurricanes ever to hit the coast of Texas and was a catalyst of the development of several flood protection strategies, such as the Ike Dike. In this report the Coastal Spine Strategy has been used as a reference strategy. The basic idea of this strategy is to shorten the coastline by implementing a moveable storm surge barrier at Bolivar Roads and Land Barriers at Galveston Island and the Bolivar Peninsula, which will reduce the inflow of water towards the Galveston Bay. The objective is to obtain a probabilistic design of the Land Barrier on the Bolivar Peninsula taking the overtopping failure mechanism into account. The possibilities of overtopping resilience are also explored. By designing probabilistically insight is gained on the uncertainties of the system and the failure probability of the design. The approach to obtain the objective is first describing the requirements. The most important one is the sufficient reduction of the inflow of water towards the Galveston Bay. Important boundary conditions are sea level rise, storm surge height and wave height. Three alternatives have been developed for the Land Barrier: ‘Natural’ approach, ‘Low’ design and ‘In between’. The first alternative is the highest, has little overtopping and the inner slope could be executed with a high performance turf mat. The second alternative, ‘Low’ design, has the lowest height. The overtopping discharge is extreme (>700 l/s/m) and therefore needs a stronger inner slope, which is executed with Elastocoast and a sandy cover layer. The third alternative is a compromise between those two alternatives. The ‘Low’ design was favored in consult with researchers in the area, since this alternative is assumed to fit the best in the flat environment. The design mostly deviates from a standard levee design at the inner slope due to the extreme discharges. Asphalt and Elastocoast are highly erosional resistant and cost-efficient, where Elastocoast is the most environmental friendly one and is therefore selected for the inner slope revetment. The Elastocoast revetment is assumed to withstand the erosional force, but the top layer could slide down the slope, exposing the subsoil. Also, behind the structure the excessive amount of water flows over unprotected soil leaving an erosion hole behind, which could undermine the structure if it becomes too deep. These two failure mechanisms have been expressed in limit states. The stilts of the houses create a weak spot if these interfere with the revetment on the slope, which is a point of attention during construction. It was not possible to make a reliable limit state for this mechanism. Another limit state is related to the ability to limit inflow towards the bay to prevent Kemah from flooding. These limit states are used in the probabilistic model to calculate the failure probability. The requirement is stated as a conditional failure probability given a once per 100-yr storm occurs. The base design is a levee with the highest point at MSL 5.9 meter. The outer slope, with a gradient of 1/4, and the inner slope, with a gradient of 1/6, is protected with an Elastocoast revetment. Behind the levee there is bed protection such that the scour hole will not undermine the structure and energy can be dissipated. Resilience is expressed with an additional conditional probability of failure given that a 500-yr storm occurs. Three resiliency measures are added to the design, namely; purely heightening, a milder slope with a small heightening to 500-yr storm surge level (MSL + 6.7 m) and a combination of various measures. A fragility curve is a nice tool to present failure probabilities given a certain storm surge height. It is interesting that the fragility curve is shifted to the right when resilience is added to the design. The first conditional probability of failure (for the 100-yr storm) becomes unnecessary. The total failure probability is reduced when the measures are added to the design. This means that resilience is an effective method to reduce the total failure probability. It is possible to design a low Land Barrier where overtopping discharges are very high. The inner slope needs to be protected with a revetment and bed protection needs to be applied to prevent scour to undermine the structure. This design can be improved if research is conducted on the real flow behavior behind the levee after the transition to the horizontal. Also, the actual strength of Elastocoast against overtopping discharges needs to be found in combination with the sliding induced by the force of the water over the layer. Investing in research on this topic can reduce the total costs of the Land Barrier. Next to that, an optimization can also result in an improved design. Applying a berm and milder slope to reduce overtopping discharge could give a better solution. A simplified 1D model, based on a rigid-column approximation, showed that the contributions of the flow through Bolivar Roads and the overland flow are comparable in the current situation during a 100-yr storm. Large storm surges result in a more dominant overland flow. The Coastal Spine will limit the inflow towards the bay the most compered to four other scenarios. But the Coastal Spine is not going to keep sea level rise out of Galveston Bay and the wind during hurricanes will push the water level towards the shoreline of the bay. It is advised to raise awareness of the vulnerability against flooding and heighten the existing structures (flood walls, quay walls, levees) in time. The simplified model can also be improved with a more complex model where bathymetry, wind speed and direction is included. The assumption to model a Land Barrier as a weir holds. Resilience is a measure to improve the reliability of a structure. There are some investments needed to upgrade the inner slope for example, but the total probability of failure is reduced and therefore improve the design. It is assumed that a resilient structure has a milder slope for the fragility curve, but measures to truly milden this slope were not found in this research. A cost-benefit analysis on adding resilience would be a next step for investigation as well as finding true measures to milden the slope of the fragility curve.","overtopping discharge; inner slope; Coastal Spine; Land Barrier; dike; levee; probalistic; design; resilience","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","","29.455241, -94.632619"

(mentor); Molenbroek, J.F.M. (mentor)","2016","INTRO Rijndam is a rehabilitation centre in Rotterdam that is specialised in complex rehabilitation problems. Rijndam has different locations and different departments. At the Ringdijk there is a children’s department where the toddlers are supported by caregivers of rehabilitation daycare, social workers, psychologists, rehabilitation pediatricians, speech therapists, physiotherapists and an occupational therapists. This graduation assignment focuses on the therapeutic toddler groups (TTG) (age 2-4) treated at Rijndam location Ringdijk. IDENTITY & DISCOVER One of the TTG is Dikkie Dik, a group with children who have cognitive and physical limitations. During these toddler classes the caregivers and therapists play and exercise with the children. They change the childern’s diapers and feed them. The TTG takes places twice a week, for three hours. Due to all the different activities in this time frame a toddler at the Dikkie Dik group needs to be transferred by a caregiver approximately 8 times an hour. A lot of these activities are performed on the rehabilitation mat (on the floor). Lifting the children up and down from a low level so many times can cause back and knee problems for the caregivers and therapists. Observations and interviews showed that the lift from the mat (ground) is one of the most common lifts and also the heaviest lift. Although the caregivers suffer from knee and back pain, they only use muscle power to lift the toddlers. It is easier and much faster to lift the children than grabbing a lifting tool. It is important for the caregivers to stay close to the children. Due to the cognitive limitations it is very important that the (inter)action between the child and caregiver is familiar and pleasant. EXPLORE As concluded from the observations the caregivers want the transfer to be fast, personal and pleasant for the children. The available lifting equipment is not capable of these interactions. Especially for lifting from the ground no solutions that do not cost a lot of time to set up, are available. When designing a new product it is important that the caregivers are motivated and willing to use the product. Motivation is more easily triggered by tasks that are easy to perform. A good trigger could also be a product that benefits the rehabilitation of a child. It is very important to make use of the childern’s capabilities and possibilities. Otherwise the toddlers can be discouraged and this will also influence the caregivers use. DEFINE Out of the first phase some conditions for the design can be summed up. The caregiver should be triggered to use the design, it should be easy to set up and relieve tension from the knees and back. The child should have the ability to use the design. It is extra beneficial if the product stimulates the revalidation process of the toddlers. The interaction should be personal, empowering and clarifying. From this a design goal is formulated. DESIGN GOAL Relieve weight fast and easily for the caregivers during the transfer from the ground while lifting a toddler. The design should be able to support the childern’s rehabilitation process. This design goal should fit in the context of Rijndam. Rijndam is constructing a new building with an emphasis on different themes. Living Lab, Flex Workspaces and Healing Environment. These themes are important for the context of the design. DEVELOP & DESIGN With these findings and an ideation phase, the first concept direction was created. The concept direction of a mat that can move up and down was evaluated and iterated. This mat, named UP, is an adjustment of the current rehabilitation mat. The mat replaces the vertical lift from the ground. A scenario was presented to the employees of Rijndam and discussed. The main concerns of the employees were: being afraid that the child could fall; all the children have to go up and down at the same time; and the ability to reach each child. The caregivers from different TTG’s were positive about the concept direction. They could see themselves working with the product and found it useful. After the feedback and conversations with experts the design was iterated and the user tests where conducted. The users test tested a few interactions and gave an idea of the user scenario. With this information the UP was created. The UP, has a lifting system similar to an electric pallet lifter and a sensory screen to stimulate the rehabilitation of the toddlers. The mat is able to move to different heights. This makes it possible to not only work on the ground, but also at sitting and at standing height. By making the mat able to go all the way down to the ground the children are still able to crawl on and off the mat. The implemented railings with adjustable hinges on the sides of the mat can be put in an upward position to prevent the children from falling off. With the UP the vertical lift can be avoided for the caregivers, only horizontal lifts are needed. This can relieve the back and knees of the caregivers. VALIDATION A final user test was conducted with a prototype scale 1:1. This was done to find out if the measurements were right and how the product was used during different tasks. The working regulations were analysed and a safety risk matrix was made to make sure the UP meets these standards. A working height of 1.10 m and no sharp edges are of these standards. This information was processed in the design. CONCLUSION The design goal described the qualities the product should have. The interaction qualities describe how the use of the product should feel. With questions asked and tasks performed during the user test, there could be seen if the interaction qualities were triggered. Personal. Using the UP still feels personal. The design felt personal, because the caregivers are still able to feel and make contact with the child. The interaction is less personal than lifting the child. But this way is more personal than current solutions. Instantly clarifying. This quality was difficult to test. Only the main function of the UP could be tested. The fact that the UP can move up and down was instantly clarified and easy to use. The railing system was clear. Furthermore a child lock should be added to both the railing system and the controller. If this is instantly clear needs to be tested. Also folding the mat for storage and locking the wheels could not be tested. When the final prototype is made this can be determined. Empowering. The UP is empowering on different levels. The caregivers need less strength while transferring, during a rehabilitation class. It gives the caregivers more power during the classes for extra activities. If they suffer from less physical pain this can also be beneficial outside their working environment. The classes cost less physically effort this will benefit the working attitude. In another way it empowers the children by providing an extra stimulus with the sensory screen. During this project several tests were performed to try out the use and principle of the UP. The product still needs another iteration and testing round with a final prototype before the UP can be implemented. A safety expert should check the final design on different safety aspects. By finding a partner who is willing and able to develop the product, manufacturing of the UP could be realised.","lifting; transfer; rehabilitation; children; caregivers","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor)","2016","Wave energy is a promising renewable resource for the extraction of energy. To increase the efficiency of this technology a parabolic reflection wall is located behind a wave farm of heaving point absorber wave energy converters (WECs) to increase the power output of the WEC array by altering the wave field. The WECs are modelled with patches of bottom friction in the linear wave model PHAROS. The modelling of the wave energy converters is validated with both numerical results on a single WEC and scaled lab measurement data of WEC arrays of 25 WECs of the WECwakes project with both long and short crested wave spectra. The validation of the numerical WEC modelling shows an error in the reflection zone but a good approximation of the bottom friction approach in the shadow zone that is of most interest to this study. The reflection wall increases the power output of the WEC array with approximately 130% for standard rectilinear and staggered array configurations. When the WEC array configuration is optimised to the standing wave pattern generated by the reflection wall, this increase in power output increases to 175-200% which is approximately 9 to 10MW with respect to the situation without the reflection wall. A rough feasibility study is made using an internal rate of return analysis based on a conceptual design using proven technology. The design consists of a reinforced concrete shell, forming the reflective surface, that is attached to driven steel monopiles for structural support. The cost-benefit analyses using the internal rate of return shows there could be potential in this concept. Finally some remarks are made detailing options of combining the reflection wall with other functions to increase the added value, e.g. wind parks, ports etc. Part of this study is also published in the RENEW2016 conference proceedings as Van der Wiel et al., 2016.","Wave energy; wave energy converter; WEC; WEC array; reflection wall; wave field enhancement; focussing of waves; green energy; blue energy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

In this study, we developed a state of the art mechanistic toolbox which embodies the core of SOM degradation, while maintaining a model structure that allows ﬂexible addition of interactions with other soil components. The theoretical framework of the toolbox is an aerobic reaction network where SOM is deﬁned as a mixture of known organic compounds from plant and microbial origin, that interact with microorganisms in a non-limiting aqueous environment. Simulations of the toolbox show that the bulk properties of SOM can be interpreted as weighted averages of the properties of individual organic compounds. The downside of implementing a novel theoretical approach in the toolbox, is that some crucial parameter values are poorly documented in literature. To tackle this issue, we incorporated a Bayesian inference tool, which is capable of selecting an experimental design that makes optimal use of the inherent model structure to maximise the future parameter identiﬁability. The toolbox shows promising outlooks to both a) increase the acceptance of the state of the art insights in SOM degradation by reinterpreting older experimental ﬁndings, while b) further enhancing mechanistic modelling of interaction processes between SOM and other soil components to, ultimately, make accurate predictions of SOM degradation within a complex soil environment.","soil organic matter; aerobic degradation; mechanistic modelling; reaction network; stabilisation mechanisms; microorganisms","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","Adaptive optics (AO) is a technology widely used in astronomy, microscopy and lithography that reduces the degrading effect of wavefront aberrations on optical systems, by cancelling out the induced wavefront phase profile. A critical part in AO is the wavefront reconstruction, in which an estimate of the phase profile is made from sensor intensity measurements. For real-time implementation, this involves a trade-off between reconstruction accuracy and computational efficiency. A recently developed method for wavefront reconstruction is the SABRE method [3]. This new method, uses bivariate simplex B-spline basis functions to reconstruct the wavefront locally using wavefront slope measurements from a Shack-Hartmann (SH) sensor. The local nature of this method makes it possible to be implemented in a distributed way, that can highly increase computational efficiency. Improvement of the accuracy of this method was suggested, by extracting higher order information that is present in the intensity distributions of the SH sensor. In this study, novel moment-based sensor models for the SABRE are introduced: three alternative first moment methods, the SABRE-integrals, that use the first moment information from the SH sensor by integration of the first order partial differential equations for the phase over the lenslet domain, and preserve the linear regression parameter estimation; and a second moment method, the SABRE-moments, based on the relation between the second moment information and the phase mean square gradient, that was shown in a recently developed wavefront sensorless technique [16]. Described are: the derivation of the models, by two different approaches: a spline approach and a polynomial approach; the simulation of a SH sensor for second moment measurements; the selection of the spline degree and continuity order with respect to the different methods; a prove of concept of the methods and evaluation of the performance subjected to different order aberrations and signal to noise levels. Simulation results demonstrate that the second moment method is able to achieve the maximal accuracy that the nonlinear spline models posses, which makes the method especially suitable for higher order phase reconstruction and small lenslet grids. This model, however, appeared to be more sensitive to measurement errors in the second moment data. With further research toward improved second moment measurements and higher computational efficiency for realtime implementation, this method could be useful for wavefront reconstruction in adaptive optics systems.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-09-16","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Delft Center for Systems and Control","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","In this work, a system level design for a wireless, multi-subject ElectroCorticoGram (ECoG) monitor- ing system for epilepsy research on mice is presented. It is a continuation of previous collaborations between the Erasmus Medical Centre (EMC) neuroscience department and the section Bioelectronics at Delft University of Technology. The system is realized by using discrete components and custom PCB development. The innovative focus has been put on the design of a flexible wireless link that uses backscattering, Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA) and an Software Defined Radio (SDR). The combination of a high bitrate (up to 320 kbit/s) backscattering link that uses digitally generated subcarriers and FDMA to support multiple concurrent measurements has not been presented in litera- ture before. Weight, size and power consumption have been identified as the most stringent limitations. The 915 MHz ISM band is used for communication, for which the potential GSM interference should be taken into account. The design of the system contains the RHD2132 IC by Intantech to function as Analog Front-End (AFE), a Cortex M0+ low-power microcontroller (MCU) and an RF switch and chip-scale antenna for backscattering communication. The MCU communicates with the AFE and generates the data packets and the subcarrier frequency. This subcarrier is modulated on the main 915 MHz carrier by means of on-off-keying. A prototype receiver has been designed to be able to evaluate the wireless link. Up to three wireless tags were tested simultaneously with different subcarrier frequencies. Provided that the power levels of these subcarriers do not differ more than 6 dB, the receiver can distinguish between the different tags and thus FDMA on a backscatter link has been demonstrated. Furthermore, it was proven that using multiple, orthogonally oriented antennas on a tag can increase the backscattered power by an order of magnitude while providing more immunity to the location and orientation of the tag. Power consumption has been measured for 2 scenarios. For a 500 Hz sampling rate scenario, the complete system consumes 14.5 mW. For a 20 kHz sampling rate scenario, the power consumption amounts to 20.3 mW. In-vivo measurements of the AFE have been performed, showing a potential improvement over the current measurement set-up at the EMC. This improvement is mostly found in the reduction of 50 Hz interference and the compactness of the set-up. Additionally it was found that a signal resolution of 8 bit can be enough for epileptic seizure detection, which means the requirement on the wireless link can be reduced.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-09-16","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics","","Bioelectronics","",""

(mentor); Gutierrez-Neri, M. (mentor); Barnhoorn, A. (mentor); Abels, H.A. (mentor)","2016","Compaction occurs in many consolidated hydrocarbon reservoirs and is responsible for both improvement and loss of recovery. This study assesses the effects of rock compaction and the consequences on the production and recovery in unconsolidated shallow gas reservoir a topic of which little is known. The compaction behaviour in unconsolidated to weakly-consolidated reservoirs is studied by compiling a large data set from published laboratory experiments data. Analysis of the data set indicates that the initial porosity, the pre-consolidation stress and the degree of consolidation of the reservoir formation are the main controlling parameters on the rock compressibility. To account for compaction in unconsolidated sands, a set of equations describing plastic deformation is derived fromthe equations describing linear elastic compressibility. The pore volume reduction and permeability reduction calculated based on these equations tend to over predict the effects of compaction when compared to measured data. Empirical relationships are derived for pore volume and permeability reduction based on compaction behaviour trends which can be applied to unconsolidated reservoirs. With these derived empirical trends compaction is simulated on shallow gas reservoirs. A simplified reservoir model is built capturing the main characteristic of shallow gas reservoirs in the Netherlands. The integration of the effects of compaction within the simulations is done by incorporating the range observed in the pressure-dependent rock characteristics i.e. pore volume (porosity) and permeability. The assumption of a constant reservoir compressibility leads to an uncertainty in the recovery factor of up to 10%when compared to the pressure-dependent assumption. Two effects of pore volume reduction are visible in P/Z plots (mass balance plots) of compaction-sensitive gas reservoirs: 1) the P/Z line decreases more gradually than when no pore volume reduction occurs, 2) P/Z line deflects downwards with ongoing production and deviates from the straight-line. The higher the pore volume reduction, the more pronounced is this bending of the P/Z-line. The effect of permeability reduction is not visible on the shape of the P/Z plot. In all cases, it is observed that the effect of reservoir compaction is, with respect to the no-compaction case, positive for the recovery of gas. The predicted recoveries show differences which can amount up to 20% additional recovery. For a typical shallow gas reservoir of 1 BCM, these difference translate to a potential underestimation of 0.2 Bcm of gas produced.","Unconsolidated; Compaction; Gas production; Shallow; Compressibility","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","Petroleum Engineering","",""

(mentor); Kranendonk, W. (mentor); Vermolen, F.J. (mentor)","2016","Many models for nucleating and growing precipitates have been developed. Each model with their own advantages and disadvantages. Only few of those models are made for heterogeneous nucleation (on dislocations) and most of them are based on the mean radius approach. In the literature study by Vonk (2016) one of these models (by Zurob et al. (2002)) was explained, analysed and tested for different values of the model parameters and different initial values. The model showed to be flexible, but still had some drawbacks, of which the mean radius aspect was the most limiting. A new distribution model is developed in this master thesis, based on the KWN model by Robson (2014) and Den Ouden et al. (2013). Even though the approach has changed, the nucleation and growth rate were adopted from the model by Zurob et al. (2002), which still included some drawbacks. Some of these drawbacks are eliminated by extending the model and some are recommended for future work. The two main drawbacks that were eliminated, were the lack of influence of all elements in the system and the competition between nucleation sites and different precipitate compositions. All elements in the system influence the nucleation and growth of the precipitates, even when the elements do not participate in the precipitate. A multi-component model is the extension to capture this complexity (Den Ouden et al. (2013)). Because most steel alloys contain many alloying elements, different precipitates can occur simultaneously (for instance, Nb(C,N), AlN and MnS) and complex precipitates may exist, like (Nb,Ti)(C,N). Also precipitates may nucleate at various nucleation sites. A multi-precipitate model is the extension to capture this complexity. The results of the simulations using the distribution model and its extensions are analysed and compared, showing the flexibility of the model. The implementation includes the multi-component and multi-precipitate extension, but no model for complex precipitates yet.","Model by Zurob et al.; precipitation; dislocations; grain boundaries; homogeneous; nucleation; growth; NbCN; AlN; MnS; distribution; KWN model; precipitate; backward euler","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Delft Institute of Applied Mathematics","","Numerical Analysis","",""

(mentor)","2016","The insufficient prediction of ammonium permeability through RO membranes by calculation software in combination with the high ammonium concentrations in ground water result to the waste of money and time by the drinking water treatment companies. This research is focused on the parameters that affect ammonium permeability by reverse osmosis membranes in an attempt for some general conclusions to be derived and less or no testing experiments to be necessary in the future. During this research project three different reverse osmosis membranes were tested: XLE-440, Espa2max and LG BW 440 R. Artificial, water that composed in the pilot plant, was used during the experiments. Three parameters were investigated for their influence on ammonium removal: the ration between monovalent anions and monovalent cations (molar ratio), the ionic strength and the pH. In order to check the results of each parameter, three groups of experiments were done. In each group, one of the above parameters was changing while all the other characteristics of the feed water were kept the same. Results show that the higher the molar ratio, the higher the ammonium permeability of the 3 RO membranes. XLE has the highest ammonium permeability while LG and Espa2max show approximately similar results. Sodium removal was also checked and it was proved that LG has a strange behavior with ammonium. Regarding the ionic strength, XLE show higher ammonium permeabilities at higher ionic strengths while ammonium permeability of Espa2max and LG was not affected by the increasing ionic strength. Besides, comparison between raw water and artificial water took place. Despite the fact that the solutions had similar characteristics, the permeability of ammonium had a decreasing trend at higher ionic strength when raw water was used while with artificial water the changes in ionic strength did not affect the permeability. The strange behavior of raw water is considered to be caused due to the supersaturation of CaCO3. Finally, the pH, when it ranges between 4.9 and 8.3, seems to have no influence on ammonium permeability in case of Espa2max and LG, in contrast to XLE where the changes in ammonium permeability are significant. These changes do not depend on the fraction of ammonia which is found to be negligible until the pH of 8.2.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Water Management","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","The latest developments in power electronics along with the increased generation from Renewable Energy Sources (RES), the new prosumers who both generate and consume electricity and the rapid adoption of DC loads in the household are forcing us to rethink the manner with which power is distributed and consumed. The proposal to make DC technology an integral part of the distribution network seems to have more merit. This change would lead to energy savings in power conversion and enable the creation of meshed DC grids, highly controllable and flexible networks which will be able to facilitate the more sustainable energy future towards which we strive. To build such a system, however, a different approach than the one used in AC systems is needed, due to the peculiarities of DC technology. In our research for the best possible way to protect these systems, it is imperative to constantly test the protection circuit not only as a standalone, but also incorporate it in the systems that will be built and test them together. In other words, transient analysis of the systems with the proposed protection included is an integral part in gauging the impact of the latter on the former during operation, and therefore in assessing and improving the protection for this specific application. This thesis presents such a transient analysis of various configurations of DC distribution systems. A combination of theoretical and practical methods were used to investigate the behavior of the systems' variables after the occurrence of faults and current interruption. A number of networks of varying complexity were built with detailed cable models using the EMTP/ATP software package in order to simulate a multitude of faults and assess each network's response at various positions and most crucially, the effectiveness of the protection scheme in reducing the impact of the transients after the fault. The travel speed of the transients was also investigated. At the same time, a set of measurements was conducted on a DC street lighting network to study the transient behavior of a real system. A separate model was built to resemble the measured system, in order to compare between the simulations and the measurements. The evaluation of the measurement and simulation results led to conclusions that will contribute to the creation of better, safer and more versatile DC distribution grids. The comparison showed that the models used can approach the behavior of the real system to a reasonable degree. The other simulations indicated that the transient impact is significantly smaller in locations far from the fault, but continued operation of the healthy pole cannot be guaranteed, especially after earth faults.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2017-09-01","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Electrical Sustainable Energy (ESE)","","","",""

(mentor); Van der Geer, S. (mentor)","2016","The world around us is constantly changing. Organizations are forced to change with it in order to stay successful. How these organizational changes should go are often captured in a vision or a strategy. The key is to get on board all of the stakeholders, starting with their own employees. This is often not as easy as it looks like. Jam visual thinking helps organizations to deal with complex changes by guiding them through a design process in which visualizing is an important tool to create clarity, ownership and enthusiasm. Once Jam helped them to create their vision and provide them with a visual tool to communicate their story, the time has come to transfer this story to the rest of the organization. This is called the ‘implementation phase’ of change. This thesis holds a designers’ study on ‘how to implement changes into an organization using visual thinking’. In other words, how can Jam help their clients to implement the intended change by using their expertise of visual thinking? The scope is to design a product which Jam can offer to their clients in order to make the first step towards implementation. The goal is to inform, enthusiast and activate internal stakeholders to increase the chances of successful implementation. To get a grip on the world of organizational change, an extended analysis is performed. The problem as researched from different point of views i.e. visual thinking, change management and corporate anthropology. Some of the main insights are the following: People want to have a say in the subject to feel ownership and overcome fear or stubbornness The employees should be addressed both as a group and as individual Clear communication and commitment of a core team (e.g. managers) is key Fun and relatedness are important aspects for enthusiasm A visual and iterative way of working allows people to make their own story Based on all insights, a toolkit that provides employees to explore the vision and share their own ideas is designed. The toolkit will be used in a workshop-setting and stimulates employees to take a closer look at the vision and define their own role within implementation of the future plans. This workshop is organized based on a design process with elements of visual thinking, meaning an iterative way of working, alternating constructing and deconstructing the subject, combining visual and textual ways of communicating etc. A ‘line of ambassadors’ is created by organizing a series of workshops, each facilitated by a different person assigned at the end of each workshop. In that way, the group of involved stakeholders keeps growing over time. The product is prototyped, tested and redesigned several times. Finally, most goals were reached when considering short-term usage. When the product would be developed further, the recommendations in the end of the report would be a good starting point.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2017-09-15","Industrial Design Engineering","Integrated product design","","","",""

Albert Heijn is now in a transition from good standardized supermarkets to good unique supermarket, to develop supermarkets that better match with individual needs. Albert Heijn started with differentiation by creating six store profiles: Premium, City Premium, Modern Family, Mainstream, Traditional and City Budget. These store profiles are clusters of supermarkets with similar customer characteristics. Albert Heijn needs more information about its customers. The store profiles form a solid qualitative foundation, but do not explain the real story of the customer. The assignment is to use customer journey maps to enrich the store profiles with insights about the grocery trips of customers and to use those insights to give practical solutions that will aid the development of differentiated supermarkets. The store profiles are improved by prototypical persona. The prototypical persona provide a collective image of the fictional representative of the common customers of a store profile. This prototypical persona is used a leading figure in customer journey maps for the different store profiles. These customer journey maps are based on shop along research with customers in Albert Heijn supermarkets. The customer journey maps improve the store profiles by giving insights in the routing through the supermarket, the touch points, the attitudes and the emotional journey. The conclusions are a Premium supermarket that has a specific assortment, an exploring format, personal service and an exclusive experience. A City Premium supermarket that has new products, a compact format, self service and a trendy experience.

In this thesis however, we focus on finding the image that would best explain the observed measurement in a least squares sense, given an ultrasound model. This enables the use of prior knowledge such as transducer impulse responses and acoustic wave field theory to be fully taken into account, resulting in a spatio-temporal imaging technique. Since performance is dependent on modeling accuracy, this thesis investigates the formulation and verification of a linear ultrasound model that also takes the transducer lens into account. Additionally, a technique to easily estimate the transducer impulse response is proposed. After defining the linear model, several techniques that solve this linear system for the image are considered, namely Tikhonov regularized least squares, Tikhonov regularized non-negative least squares, basis pursuit de-noising. Using a synthetic aperture transmission scheme, these techniques are compared to delay-and-sum beamforming in both a simulation based resolution analysis, as well as in a real experiment using a high-resolution phantom in water. Results show that the proposed imaging techniques perform significantly better than conventional delay-and-sum beamforming.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2017-09-14","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics","","Circuits and Systems","",""

(mentor)","2016","‘ How to enhance the entering experience of various passengers.’ Crowds of passengers have different moods and expectations. Although the importance of the entering experience has been shown in previous research (Ahmadpour, Robert & Lindgaard, 2014a; Vink, 2014), there is yet to be a product or service designed that focuses on this. In the current boarding process, passengers share a similar entering route and routine. Moreover, cabin crews are busy working on service preparation or scanning for safety reasons. Passengers might not have a warm welcome and they could even have feel as if they are entering through the back door of a restaurant. Therefore, research on how to enhance the entering experience of various passengers will be an opportunity for stakeholders to improve the product and/or service where there have been blind spots. Moreover, as a design approach, mood-driven design can have its influence verified through this case study. Afterwards, the range of the scope could be widened to the entire flight experience. One’s experience can be influenced by several factors, and mood plays an import role. Understanding what the factors are that have an effect on one’s mood, how it transitions from one to the other, and how to stimulate such mood is required. For understanding the current entering experience, firstly literature research was conducted for understanding the trends in the air travel industry and analyzing various types of passengers and flight user experiences. Then empirical research was done on passengers in the given context in order to identify their concerns and moods. Various methods including mood measurement tools such as Pick-A-Mood was used. After a pilot test, the main passenger research was conducted with 30 participants. For this phase, participants were provided by the commercial partner, Boeing. As a result of this phase, an understanding of passengers’ current boarding experience, mood transition, internal and external factors that influence this, and what passengers consider an ideal boarding experience was gained. For the relationship between mood and contextual factors, all contextual factors in the flight that can affect mood were analyzed, and research was carried out on how these factors can be used to form ‘the mood for the ideal experience’. Empirical research methods were used for this phase. Lastly, in the design phase, based on findings from the research phase, the vision for the boarding experience and several inspirational concepts were carried out as design applied case. During this phase, an evaluation of the concepts suggested was conducted.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design for Interaction","","","",""

(mentor); Bocken, N.M.P. (mentor); Stolk, M. (mentor)","2016","In the Netherlands, about 50% of the food is wasted in the consumer phase (Netherlands Nutrition Centre, 2014). Wasting food has an enormous impact on the environment and on social-economical aspects for example. To address this problem, a product is designed according to the Vision in Product design approach (Hekkert & Van Dijk, 2011) to decrease consumer food waste. This project is executed in collaboration with Milieu Centraal (The Netherlands). Only avoidable food waste will be taken into account, whereby the analysis pays particular attention to food waste in the Netherlands. General motives of consumers to waste food include wrong planning, hygiene or a lack of knowledge. Also developments as the elongation of the food supply chain increase food waste. Additional consumer research showed consumers emotions from purchase to discarding. Steps in the beginning of this chain were in general experienced positive, final steps however, were negatively experienced, especially discarding. In order to change behaviour pro-environmentally, literature about sustainable behaviour and design for (sustainable) behaviour change has been reviewed. This information, together with the information from the analysis is further complemented with trends and developments around the subject of food waste. Aspects considered as relevant, interesting and original are combined into drivers. It became apparent that the main driver around food waste is the gap between thinking and doing. To intervene in this context a statement was defined: ""I want people in the supermarket to anticipate on their food purchases by giving them trust and making them feel proud about doing so"". Together with the interaction and product qualities, it formed the starting point for the ideation phase. Eventually, a selection of the ideas with potential was made and the idea 'Packaging' was chosen. The product helps people combine their groceries in the supermarket and makes them feel proud about doing so. In the detailing phase, this idea was transformed into a realistic product. The Value Mapping Tool (Bocken et al., 2013) is used to discover what values are exchanged between the involved stakeholders, including the environment. Also the Triple Layered Business Model Canvas (Joyce, Paquin, & Pigneur, 2015) is used to show the social and environmental benefits and impacts of the design. To conclude this project, a final evaluation is carried out and revealed that the design has potential to decrease food waste.","Food waste; Pro-environmental behaviour; Vision in product design; Value mapping tool; Triple layered business model canvas","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor)","2016","In a non-ideal scenario for an IPT system, a transmitter coil magnetically couples with both the receiver coil and the adjacent transmitter coils. Such mutual coupling between transmitter coils is not desirable since they affect the maximum power that the transmitter can transfer to the receiver. A dual frequency IPT (DFIPT) system focuses on this issue and reduces the coupling between two transmitter coils by tuning each coil to a different resonance frequency, 85 kHz and 100 kHz. The two frequency values are chosen such that each coil has a large impedance at the other operating frequency. Currently, a DF-IPT system consists of two receiver coils, each tuned to receive the power transferred by the corresponding transmitter. Such a system not only gets bulkier and more expensive, but also reduces the tolerance of misalignment between the receiver and transmitter. Therefore, this thesis aims at resolving the drawbacks of the existing DF-IPT by developing a DF IPT system with single pick up network which is capable of tuning to both 85 kHz and 100 kHZ. A design has been developed for this by manipulating the impedances of combinations of multi-frequency resonance networks and single frequency series resonance networks. Results obtained from simulations and experiments prove that the pick-up network attains series resonance at 2 frequencies.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Electrical Sustainable Energy","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","The partitioning inter-well tracer test (PITT) is a method to determine average oil saturation between an injector-producer pair. Tracer tests can be used to quantify incremental oil recovery in enhanced oil recovery (EOR) pilots and for reservoir surveillance purposes. This study provides a sensitivity analysis of the inter-well tracer test, with specific focus on reservoir geometry and heterogeneity. The uncertainty of oil saturation determination from tracer production responses is quantified and visualized. Various interpretation methods can be applied: peak arrival time comparison, Residence Time Distribution Analysis (RTDA), extrapolation methods and projection methods. Various sensitivities influence the outcome, accuracy and consistency of these methods. First and foremost, reservoir geometry and heterogeneity have significant impact on the shape of the tracer response curve, and on the accuracy of the subsequent oil saturation estimation. The presence of multiple flow paths can be clearly identified from tracer responses and oil saturation of each flow path can be determined individually by use of extrapolation and projection methods. Thus, potential permeability baffles or barriers can be identified and static reservoir models can be improved by evaluating tracer response data. Further key sensitivities are sampling duration, sampling frequency and measurement errors. An incomplete tracer response can lead to significant loss of accuracy of oil saturation determination by RTDA. A low sampling frequency has severe impact on the accuracy of oil saturation estimation, especially if large measurement errors are present. For timely execution of an EOR project, an early estimation of oil saturation is desirable. In this study, a new and robust analytical projection method is proposed that enables early time estimation of oil saturation based on limited data. The projection method is based on a translation of the non-partitioning tracer response curve to the partitioning tracer curve using a time and amplitude scalar. Robustness of this method is achieved by performing a least squares optimization that takes into account all available data in order to find optimal fitting time and amplitude scalars for tracer data translation. This projection method provides accurate early time oil saturation estimations based on limited partitioning tracer data. Especially if responses are incomplete, contain multiple peaks caused by reservoir heterogeneities, have a low sampling frequency and contain large measurement errors, the least squares projection method provides a most accurate oil saturation estimate, compared to other methods.","EOR; enhanced oil recovery; oil saturation; residual oil saturation; sensitivity analysis; tracer test; partitioning tracer; heterogeneity; ASP; alkaline surfactant polymer; IPTT; Inter-well partitioning tracer test; RTDA; chromatographic transformation; reservoir surveillance; least squares","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","Petroleum Engineering","",""

(mentor)","2016","An accurate corner strength modelling method is required at Fokker Aerostructures to design canisters (missile launch tubes) with rounded corners for an internal pressure load case. To this end a combination of experiments and calculation methods has been developed that enable to predict the corner strength more accurately. Internal pressure experiments on canisters are costly; hence four point bending of a curved beam was used to represent the internal pressure experiment. The bending moment in the corner is such that the radius of the curved laminate increases while deforming. This causes Inter Laminar Tensile (ILT) stress in the corner, with its magnitude depending on the ratio of inner radius to thickness (Ri/t). As a result of ILT stress the curved laminates fail in a delamination failure mode. The Inter Laminar Tensile Strength (ILTS) of four different adjoining ply orientations was determined experimentally. These ILTS values were much higher than expected based upon results from previous experiments at Fokker. The reason for this underestimation was that the specimens used in the previous experiments were made by towpreg filament winding instead of prepreg hand layup, and had ratios that might have been too high to determine the ILTS. Based upon simulation and literature study it was decided that modelling of delamination initiation without modelling delamination propagation can be applied to determine the strength of a corner specimen without initial delaminations. Therefore stress based failure criteria were chosen for failure prediction. These criteria were applied to a 3D stress field calculated using FEA with solid elements, such that all stress components, and the effect of finite width was taken into account. Subsequently, the strength calculation method was validated by applying it to validation specimens with higher Ri/t ratios. For both the [90]n and the crossply layup the highest accuracy was obtained using the maximum stress criterion, of 3% and 6% respectively. Based on the simulation results it was concluded that for both of these specimens delamination occurred as a chain reaction after initiation by fiber failure or matrix cracking. Further improvements could be made by validating the current method for different layups, other materials and production processes.","Composite; Curved beam strength; Finite Element Analysis; Validation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-09-13","Aerospace Engineering","Aerospace Structures and Computational Mechanics","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","The handling of a payload by a crane at sea poses numerous challenges. One of the main technical challenges is the movement of the vessel due to the hydrodynamic forces exerted by the waves. The resulting heave, pitch, and roll of the vessel results in time-varying crane-tip motion. This motion propagates to the payload through the rope and this motion needs to be attenuated for safe handling of the payload. One way to do this is through heave compensation. Active heave compensation (AHC) and passive heave compensation (PHC) can be distinguished. AHC means energy external to the system is used to compensate heave motion. PHC means only energy within the system is used to compensate heave motion. The combination of AHC and PHC is hybrid heave compensation (HHC). The objective of the thesis is to produce a numerical time-domain model of a HHC system coupled with an existing vessel model. With this model the performance of the coupled system is investigated. The approach to obtain the model is described below and the performance is then discussed. The methodology to achieve the goal of the thesis is described in three parts. First, the equations of motion for the PHC system were developed taking into account the non-linear accumulators. The accumulators of the PHC system were sized so the natural period of the system is outside the wave period range to avoid resonance effects. The PHCS system was linearized and the natural frequencies and frequency response obtained. The natural periods and frequency response were verified by examining the time-domain response. The time-domain performance of the PHCS was examined and showed effective performance of the PHCS. At the natural periods there was an amplification of the motion, as expected. Secondly, the PHCS was coupled with the vessel model through the crane-tip model to form a coupled model, called the C-PHCS. The C-PHCS exerts small forcing moments on the vessel. However, the effect on the vessel is negligible. Thus, the effect of coupling between the PHCS and vessel is negligible. Thirdly, the AHC system was designed and equations of motion developed. This was coupled with the PHC system to form the HHC system. The HHC system was coupled with the vessel model through the crane-tip model to form the C-HHCS model. This formed the final model. Furthermore, the Dyneema rope in the final model is modeled as a discrete mass. As a sensitivity study of the final model, the Dyneema rope was modeled as a continuous structural element with a coupled string-rod model. This took into account the damping from water at the large water depths considered, such as 2500m. With the AHC system disconnected, this additional damping attenuated the motion of the Dyneema rope leading to smaller hook/payload motion. The performance of the final model was investigated. The effect of enabling the AHC system is that the compensation performance is lowered across the wave periods 3s to 12s. The effect of enabling the AHC system does not lead to a change in the natural period of the HHC and vessel system leading to resonance. Instead, the lower performance can be attributed to the controller parameters and the controller strategy and possibly the controller type. To obtain the controller parameters, the optimization algorithm within Simulink was used. This was trusted to provide effective controller parameters although they may correspond to local and not global optimum points, meaning they are not truly optimal. Instead, the controller strategy likely has a stronger role. The strategy employs two control loops, one to control displacement of the hook/payload and one to control the tension in the Dyneema rope. The displacement disturbances are lower frequency than the tension disturbances meaning ideally the control loops do not interfere with one another. There could be interference leading to a counter-productive effect and explaining the lower performance. Various controllers within the PID scope were tried to obtain the PI control for both control loops. For further work, it is suggested a different type of controller (outside PID control) could be used with a different controller strategy to obtain better performance.","active heave compensation; passive heave compensation; hybrid heave compensation; vessel; offshore crane; PID control","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-09-13","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Ellerbroek, J. (mentor); Hoekstra, J.M. (mentor)","2016","Introducing a decentralized air traffic management system could potentially increase the capacity of enroute airspace. Previous research in this field shows that a layered airspace might have benefits compared to an unstructured airspace, but the exact extent of the benefits are unknown. This research compares four layered airspace concepts, with a variation in heading range per layer, to assess the effect on capacity using fast-time simulations. First, a theoretical model is presented and validated to predict the number of conflicts in a three-dimensional airspace. When performing a model fit to the simulation results at low densities, it can be used to accurately predict the number of conflicts at high densities. Secondly, the influence on capacity of layered airspace concepts is determined based on safety, stability and efficiency. The results show that the safety is the most limiting performance metric, due to a steep increase in the number of conflicts and intrusions for an increase in traffic density. A priori separation of traffic using a layered airspace positively influences the performance compared to an unstructured airspace. Comparing the different layered airspace concepts, a clear improvement in capacity is observed for a decreasing heading range per layer.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Control & Operations","","Control & Simulation / Air Traffic Management","",""

(mentor); Van Engelen, J.M.L. (mentor)","2016","This graduation project has been executed together with the company Graypants. Graypants is a Unites-stated based design label, well-known for their signature Scraplights collection: A series of pendant light fixtures constructed from recycled corrugated cardboard. Graypants has a clear focus on sustainability and the use of recycled materials. This project has been focusing on a new concept that Graypants is introducing to the market: Prop panels. Prop panels is a ceiling product that replaces traditional ceiling solutions. The Props are suspended 3-pointed stars, constructed from perforated steel. The panels overlap each other and form a beautiful ceiling solution. The concept -like existing ceiling products- features two main functions; lighting and sound absorption. The objective of this project has been to determine the context in which the panels will perform best, the embodiment design of the acoustic function of the ceiling panels and the design of an addition to the concept to extend the product line. After performing an internal and external analysis into Graypants, Prop panels and the market for traditional ceiling panels, an extended test set-up has been drafted to verify the acoustic performance of a range of natural and sustainable materials. The test results verified that the test samples, expanded cork sheets and coco-husk fibre sheets, perform as well or better than their synthetic counterparts. On top of that, the materials also perform well when looking at other important material properties like fire retardancy and maintenance. Therefore, a proposal has been drafted on how to construct acoustic inlays for the Prop panels from these materials. After the embodiment design of the acoustic inlays and verifying the viability of the entire concept, an addition to the existing idea has been designed as a proposal for a potential future Graypants product. The additional product to the Prop product line is based on the analysis that the original Prop panels are too busy and distracting to be installed in every office environment as a full ceiling solution. The tranquil work environment would be disturbed by a product that is too extravagant. Therefore, an additional product has been tried to come up with that extends the intended Prop panel styling, but in a milder form. By doing so, an entire office complex can be outfitted with the Prop panel range. The additional product is a range of modular lighting products, to be installed on either the wall or ceiling: The Prop lighting system. The base shape of the product is a hexagonal light fixture, fitted with an LED module. The hexagonal light fixture can be complemented with acoustic tiles in the same size and shape, featuring the expanded cork and coco-husk sheets that were used for the Prop panels as well. The acoustic tiles come in several sizes and colours, providing endless possibilities to cover a wall. The product will be sold with the Prop panels as a product line, mainly as a business-to-business product. This means that project developers and architects can incorporate the system into their projects, covering large walls with the Prop lighting system.","noise reduction; ceiling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Integrated Product Design","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","Context: Clouds form in the atmospheres of brown dwarfs and extrasolar planets. Recent observations of planets orbiting extremely close (<0.1 AU) to their stars indicate possible atmospheres with silicate compositions resulting due to vaporization of silicate magma from their surface. Such atmospheres are heavily dependent on compositions of the planetary crust which in turn might influence the kind of dust particles that form in such atmospheres. Aims: We identify five types of silicate compositions commonly found on Earth and derive atmospheric chemistry with Earth silicates as starting compositions using an equilibrium chemistry atmospheric model. Following the mineral cloud modelling approach for hot atmospheres of brown dwarfs and giant gas planets, we model the dust cloud formations resulting due to varying Earth silicate compositions and apply that to investigate the possibility of clouds on sample atmospheres of a giant gas planet, 55 Cnc e, HD149 026b and CoRoT-7b. Methods: Atmospheric compositions for the planets have been derived using a previously validated Equilibrium chemistry code. We derive our atmospheric chemistry using element abundances from previously studied Earth surface compositions which is provided as an input to the 1D kinetic cloud formation model, DRIFT. We perform cloud modelling on each of the atmospheres with varying silicate compositions and study the resulting cloud properties such as particle growth, particle sizes and their composition at various stages. Results: We present the cloud structures resulting due to varying Earth silicate compositions on four different types of planets. The clouds show variations in the dust properties due to different starting compositions with differing average particle sizes but the formation conditions such as average particle size, cloud thickness and condensation altitude largely remain dependent on the local gas density and temperature. The cloud layers on 55 Cnc e, HD149 026b are found to be greatly varying in terms of their geometrical thickness, particle sizes and number densities and are primarily composed of silicates of elements such as Mg, Si, Fe and Al.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Space Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","The importance of Electric Energy Storage has been recognized as early as the 1970’s. When integrated into electrical networks Electric Energy Storage has the potential of numerous technological and financial benefits. The importance of Electric Energy Storage is growing as more renewable energy sources and higher consumer loads are added to existing networks. However, many of the beneficial effects derived from Electric Energy Storage remain to be examined in detail. Therefore, it is the objective of this thesis to examine several of these benefits, determine the methods by which they can be incorporated into a Medium Voltage network and ascertain their precise effects on this network. In this thesis three Electric Energy Storage benefits are reviewed and examined: peak shaving, frequency control and voltage control. Following this examination the technique of peak shaving has been chosen to be further explored by subjecting it to various scenarios. Peak shaving has been selected as it appears to have the most potential benefits when applied to an electrical network. These benefits are expected to be power supply increase, congestion relief, transmission upgrade deferral, and distribution upgrade deferral. For the analysis process the Electric Energy Storage technology used is a Battery Energy Storage System. The Battery Energy Storage System provides for peak shaving on the Medium Voltage network. In order to test five different scenarios an algorithm is developed using the DigSILENT Programming Language. This algorithm is tested using a simple reference network in order to determine if it functions properly. After this, a test model based on an existing Medium Voltage network is created using PowerFactory on which the five different scenarios are tested. These scenarios are based on future growth of the network and an increase of the use of Photovoltaic and Electric Vehicles. Several simulations are run using these scenarios on different parts of the Medium Voltage network of Goeree- Overflakee to ascertain the effects of peak shaving on the network. In order to test the effects on different network configurations three different actual network feeders are analyzed, two radial configured feeders and one meshed configured feeder. From the results of this examination and research it is concluded that it is possible to use peak shaving to increase the power supply, reduce congestion, and defer transmission and distribution upgrades on a radial configured network. However, the process for meshed configuration simulation is not as straight forward. While the initial results are positive, additional research into the parameters of the simulation software is required to provide a definite conclusion for meshed configurations. Finally, the addition of Electric Vehicles creates complications in the operation of the Battery Energy Storage System. Several solutions are proposed to alleviate these complications. The addition of Photovoltaics partially removes some of these complications.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Electrical Sustainable Energy","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","A large power transformer, is often, a custom designed equipment that entails a complex and capital intensive manufacturing process. It is an integral part of the power system and the cost of failure during service can be significant. Due to its importance in the power system, transformers should perform reliably under the conditions for which it has been designed while keeping the manufacturing costs to a minimum. Therefore, it is important to optimize the production process. Standing time, or hold time, is the period between the end of tank filling with mineral oil and factory acceptance tests (FAT). During this period, the newly completed transformer is left undisturbed for several days, depending on its design. It is necessary in order to improve insulating properties of the cellulosic insulation, thereby preventing partial discharges (PD) and failure during FAT. Moisture is disadvantageous to any insulation design and is particularly true in the case of cellulosic insulation (widely used in transformer construction). Cellulosic insulation is highly hygroscopic and moisture ingress in small concentrations during the final clamping procedure is inevitable. Based on the research at TU Delft, moisture in cellulosic insulation was found to be the major factor leading to PD and can also have an influence on standing time. This thesis focusses on the moisture ingress into pressboard insulation when dried insulation is exposed to ambient air during manufacture. The aim of the thesis is to investigate the effects of moisture on partial discharges in pressboard insulation and its influence on standing time. The results of this thesis could help optimize the production of transformers. This thesis discusses the results of experiments investigating the effects of moisture in pressboard samples with respect to standing time. 3 different configurations of pressboard samples are subjected to various conditions in a climate chamber (to simulate moisture ingress during clamping) and impregnated with dry mineral oil. PD tests on samples are carried out one by one over 9 days of standing time. The effect of standing time on partial discharge inception voltage and discharge magnitudes on samples with different moisture contents are observed. Additionally, during the course of the thesis, several tests were carried out to study the effect of oil temperature during FAT and the effects of moisture transients in oil. Furthermore, moisture ingress and egress to and from the samples are also analysed. Based on the results of the experiments it can be concluded that the standing time can be reduced considerably. Furthermore, the presence of a temperature gradient along with moisture content greater than 2 % in pressboard can produce discharges which can lead to failure during FAT. A moisture estimation tool is also developed which can be used to vary the vacuum cycle duration in order to control moisture content in pressboard.","pressboard; moisture; partial discharge; standing time; holding time; power transformers","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-09-12","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Electrical Sustainable Energy","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","Heerema Marine Contractors (HMC) owns and operates several semi-submersible crane vessels (SSCVs), used for offshore heavy lift operations. In preparation of these operations, hydrodynamics analyses in the frequency domain are conducted using software developed in-house at HMC. These analyses result in Response Amplitude Operators (RAOs), which are used for estimating dynamic response to a certain sea state. Crane hook load fluctuations response modelled in this manner is generally larger than measured, however. Since hook load is often a limiting criterion, an overestimation of hook load fluctuations in the models could undesirably affect perceived operability. Three possible root causes for this discrepancy have been identified: 1. Modelled hydrodynamics are inaccurate 2. Measured dynamic tension does not represent dynamic hook load 3. Dynamic tension measuring equipment is inaccurate In order to assess root cause (1.), a comparison study is conducted. Hydrodynamic rigid body models are created for four stages of a typical heavy lift operation: the free-floating, lift-off, free-hanging and set-down stages. Wave forcing, added mass and damping properties for the floating bodies are obtained from diffraction analyses performed using WAMIT. Model sensitivity to different hydrodynamic properties, obtained from single- vs. multi-body and infinite vs. actual water depth diffraction analyses, is tested as well. Measurements have been obtained for a project where a topsides module was lifted from a barge onto a jacket support structure. Measuring equipment included 6DoF motion sensors on the SSCV, module and in one of the SSCV's crane boom tips. Generally, modelled motion response is found to be quite accurate. Originally, discrepancies between modelled and measured hook load fluctuations spectra were observed during the lift-off stage of a heavy lift operation. However, measured hook load fluctuations prove to be smaller than modelled for all stages considered. Hook load fluctuations are governed by relative vertical motions of the module and the SSCV's crane boom tip. Magnitude and phasing of these signals imply over- and underestimations of wire rope elasticity and damping properties respectively. Furthermore, the ratio between measured hook load fluctuations and hook load fluctuations corresponding to measured relative motions is quite different per stage. A stage dependent contribution of root causes (2.) and/or (3.) is therefore expected to add to the overall discrepancy. In an attempt to obtain accurate crane wire rope elasticity properties from a simplified 2DoF dynamic crane model, natural frequencies during the free-hanging stage are searched for. Implementing these frequencies in the 2DoF system allows for two unknowns to be solved: a stiffness for the boom suspension wires, and an equivalent stiffness for the grommets and main hoist wires. Response peaks found within a frequency range corresponding to probable stiffnesses of the wire rope sections in the system are not very explicit. For the most probable and explicit response peaks found, no combination of stiffnesses exists for which this 2DoF model is solvable. These response peaks therefore cannot be explained by the modes searched for, and stiffness properties cannot be obtained from this model unfortunately. Therefore, elasticity properties for wire rope elements in the model are obtained from a stiffness test in literature. Subsequently, lift object vertical motions time traces are modelled, using imposed (measured) motions of the SSCV's crane tip as input. Alternative damping values are applied in order to minimize phasing between modelled and measured vertical motions of the lift object. This yields a supercritical damping value, whereas damping values are set at 1.5\% of the critical damping in the models by default. Applying the new elasticity and damping properties in the models results in a significant change in modelled hook load fluctuations. However, correspondence to measured hook load fluctuations does not necessarily increase, and discrepancies remain. Furthermore, the measured signals used contain quite some noise, and root causes (2.) and/or (3.) are expected to add to the overall discrepancy observed. An assessment of root causes (2.) and (3.), and repetitions of this research for other lifts using more accurate measuring equipment are therefore recommended.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-09-12","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","","",""

Improved cook stoves are designed in order to change this situation. This thesis is about the further development of the ACE-1 stove. Aim is to increase the chance of successful adoption in the contexts of rural South Africa, Uganda and Cambodia. The focus is on the user-product-interaction-level by improving the usability and consequently desirability of the stove. The “Context variation by Design-approach” (CVD) is used, and will be evaluated with the ACE case. The concepts of improvement are designed with a main focus on Cambodia, recommendations are given for further development for all three contexts. The difference in functionality and use between the ACE stove and the traditional cooking context is still too large to achieve exclusive and proper use of the stove, and fulfill the main design goal: “To improve the fit of the stove in its context by optimizing its usability for its traditional cooking context, and consequently encourage women to use the stove in a proper way and utilize its full potential.” The main shortcomings relate to the stability of pans on the stove and the interaction with respect to fueling. The stability problems cause that the ACE stove doesn’t match with traditional dishes and cooking behavior. With respect to the handling of fuel, the women don’t use the stove in the right way. Design Deep context research and design analysis lead to the following improvements of the stove’s design: - An improvement of the stove top, leading to increased stability of traditional pans on the stove and consequently enhancing the comfort of cooking and refueling. - Various concepts supporting the design are designed to educate and encourage the women in proper stove and consequently increasing the stove’s usability and desirability: 1. A concept of a manual. 2. A set-up of a stove doctor team, a team consisting of locals responsible for training women in stove use, and taking care of maintenance. 3. Recommendations for context specific promotion. Evaluation concepts in CVD perspective Tests in Cambodia showed how improvements lead to a more usable and consequently more desirable stove. The use of the CVD approach proved itself. Deep context research proved essential to identify subtle interactions determining the usability of the stove and its value for the women. More research needs to be done in the African contexts to confirm all findings in Cambodia.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","","",""

Assuming among other that each layer is operated by a single injector-producer pair as well as that each layer is homogeneous and isolated from other layers, simplifies the equations and prevents cross-layer flow.

(mentor)","2016","The global demand for natural gas is growing as gas is a cleaner partner to renewable energy than oil and coal. To be able to exploit remote offshore gas fields Shell is developing a floating facility to produce, treat and liquefy natural gas, called a Floating Liquid Natural Gas (FLNG) vessel. To make the FLNG vessel a cost effective option for LNG production the costs of the vessel need to be reduced. This thesis evaluates which changes to the current electrical system on FLNG vessels are able to reduce the total costs of the vessel. For this evaluation a current design of an electrical system for FLNG vessels is used as a template, but reference is also made to all-electric electrical systems that have a larger total load. The possible changes are evaluated in three areas: First an estimate on the cost advantages of implementing each change to the electrical system is made. Besides the equipment and installation costs also the cost impact of the required space and weight of the equipment is taken into account. Secondly the technical operational performance of the system is evaluated using simulations of the electrical system. A final evaluation is made for the impact of the change to system performance factors such as safety, availability, maintenance and efficiency. The analysis shows that a cost reduction of approximately 30 M USD can be achieved by removing large HV transformers from the system, resulting in an electrical system with one voltage level less than the original design. The electrical performance simulations show that a number of additional changes are required to keep the short-circuit current levels of the system within the switchgear ratings. Alternative system designs are proposed for currently typical 130 MW systems and for future all-electric systems with a total load of over 300 MW.","Electrical Power Distribution; Floating Liquid Natural Gas; Superconductive Fault Current Limiter","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Electrical Sustainable Energy","","DC systems, Energy conversion & Storage","",""

(mentor); Jones, S.A. (mentor); Rossen, W.R. (mentor)","2016","Foam has many useful features as an injection fluid for EOR. One of the most important aspects, is to reduce the gas mobility in a porous media. The manners in which the mobility of gas is reduced, is both by the increase of the gas apparent viscosity and by the trapping of the gas within the porous media, which reduces the relative permeability of gas. However, the dynamics and stability of foam in a porous network are not fully understood due to the complexity of foam behaviour in a porous media. A visual understanding of the dynamic processes is therefore of great value. In this project a better understanding of the aging mechanism of foam namely coarsening, and the gas entrapment (together with its effects) in an ideal micromodel with uniform permeability is pursued. Previously, all methods to identify the quantity of trapped gas in a 3D porous media required injection of a tracer gas. Similarly, direct measurements of the dynamics of coarsening in a porous media are scarce in contrast to the coursing studies of foam in bulk. The shortcomings can be addressed by using a 2D porous media to directly measure the trapped gas fraction of foam flow at steady state conditions and also give an insight into how the quantity of trapped gas depends on the Darcy velocity, the foam quality and the position in the micromodel. Furthermore, the coarsening time scale for microfoam in a confined porous media was investigated with the deviation from Von Neumanns law. Foam flood experiments were conducted in a 2D idealized micromodel with an average pore size of 60 μm and total dimensions of 60mm x 0.8mm x 5um. Firstly the mechanism of foam generation and flow in a porous media was observed. Secondly, the different stages of coarsening was investigated, by analysis of the increased average bubble size and the quantification of the characteristic times for the evolution of the numbers of bubbles. Thirdly, coarsening experiments were conducted in a core, to test the hypothesis that a additional pressure would be required to reactivate flow after coarsening. Fourtly, foam quality scans were made at steady state conditions to measure the pressure drop and the apparent viscosities for different solution concentrations of Alpha Olefin Sulfonate (AOS 14-16). The characteristic time for a foam to coarsen is found to be approximately 4 minutes, while bubbles with a size around 40 um disappear in under 1 minute. Coarsening in a porous media is limited to the pore size, the bubbles and lamellae gain a stable, minimum energy position in the pore throats. Coarsening observed during foam flow caused a conversion of plug foam flow into preferential flow paths. Results show trapped gas fractions ranging from 64% to 11% for velocities from 0.05 m/s to 0.4 m/s and the fraction of trapped gas as function of increasing foam quality ranged from 21% down to 6%. Apparent viscosities found were low but in line with the apparent viscosities obtained in core flood experiments. Fg* seperating two foam regimes of 0.65, 0.44 and 0.4 were observed for three different AOS concentrations of 0.1wt%, 0.05wt% and 0.01wt% respectively in the micromodel. Furthermore, with the required alterations made, the microfluidic device provides great information on foam flow in a 2D porous media and holds great potential for further research.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","Petroleum Engineering","",""

A gas-gap heat switch, which is currently in its third design iteration, has been developed by University of Twente in collaboration with the European Space Agency. This device is filled with a gas, whose thermal conductivity varies with temperature and pressure. It is a promising technology that could find extensive applications in Earth Observation and interplanetary missions due to the extreme variations in the thermal environment encountered throughout a mission lifetime. The gas-gap heat switch is manufactured out of a titanium alloy using 3D-printing technology. The main idea is to offer a quick and cheap plug-and-play solution for electronics units thermal control. The main purpose of this thesis is to evaluate the performance of the heat switch by building thermal simulation models and through experimentation, providing a correlation between the experimental and theoretical data. Additionally, the various parameters that affect the performance are identified and quantified. A preliminary analysis to evaluate the impact of the device in future missions has been conducted, using the straw-man concept analysis method. Design and manufacturability improvements and recommendations are also provided in order to facilitate the manufacturing process and improve the attainable tolerances. The experimental data shows a good correlation with the theoretical data with a deviation of less than 20% when adequate manufacturing tolerances are achieved. The experiments showed that the second prototype has an ON-conductance of 2.60 W/K and an OFF-conductance of and 0.30 W/K, with an overall ON/OFF ratio of 8.67, when operating with Helium. The third iteration exhibited a degraded performance that is attributed to manufacturing problems. A scale analysis shows that theoretically the performance of the heat switch reaches a plateau at a size of 0.1 m2, with an ON-conductance of 241 W/m2∙K and an OFF-conductance of 8.5 W/m2∙K for an ON/OFF ratio of 27.29. All the mentioned values include a contact heat transfer coefficient of 700 W/m2∙K on both sides of the switch. The switch has a surface area density of 8.16 kg/m2.","heat switch; thermal switch; gas-gap; variable thermal conductance; satellite thermal control; thermal vacuum tests; selective laser melting; straw-man concept","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Space Engineering","","Space Systems Engineering","",""

Several new design concepts based on the findings were evaluated with stakeholders and the final design was evaluated with users.

This, in combination with the redesigned user interface, allows for a faster throughput. The validator light, the guiding light, the display, the lights underneath the gates and sound give feedback to the users about their validation.

The step-by-step approach uses a tagged graph to represent the road network data. A rule-based reasoning mechanism representing relevant traffic rules, identifies potential sign locations in the graph. After a context-based reduction step of sign inclusion and redundancy, determination of the actual location and orientation of the sign takes place. Real world input data allows to compare the output model on performance and validation.

Recently, researchers have been using light as a means to achieve indoor localization. LED lights inside our buildings can transmit information and they can be seen as “internal GPS satellites” playing the role of localization anchors. But most of these works require the user to have an electronic device. In this thesis, we would like to achieve indoor localization with visible light but in a passive manner. By passive, we mean that the object of interest would have no electronic device or tag.

(mentor); de Reuver, G.A. (mentor); van de Poel, I.R. (mentor)","2016","The payment services market is growing; more and more companies introduce new payment methods, transaction systems, payment administration platforms, subscription methods and so on. These innovative new payment services, part of the innovative financial services or ‘FinTech’ industry, often introduce new challenges compared to the conventional payment methods via incumbent banks. As a lot of these new payment methods are intro-duced by start-ups, the responsibility for guaranteeing security, privacy and accuracy of money transfers that previously lay with the incumbent banks now shifts towards these start-ups. Furthermore, these start-ups are increasingly often structured as a (software or cloud) platform, introducing extra challenges with respect to how to control the behavior of the users of such a platform in order to prevent e.g. fraud. The purpose of this report is to explore the pro-active responsibility of such platform based start-ups in the FinTech sector by adopting the Responsible Innovation concept and relating this concept to specific challenges faced by start-ups and methods to control a plat-form. This report is intended to provide insight in how a start-up can include a responsible view to its innovation process when developing a new platform in the FinTech sector. An explorative case study into two start-ups with payment service platforms is conducted in order to explore to what extend the concept of Responsible Innovation is implemented, to explore the applied methods to maintain control over the platform, the specific challenges faced by start-ups and the FinTech industry, and the relations between these topics. The study shows that the acquisition of external knowledge and an entrepreneur’s ex-isting knowledge and experience is particularly important in order to be able to anticipate potential issues and to include values from a wide range of stakeholders in the platform. This can be done by either engaging in collaboration with representations of the (future) stakeholder groups directly or by collaborating with market parties already involved with these stakeholder groups and with significant experience. The anticipated future challenges can be translated into control mechanisms that allow the entrepreneur to respond ade-quately whenever an issue on the platform occurs. Such control mechanisms can be the re-striction of which customers are accepted on the platform, monitoring behavior on the plat-form and applying adequate measures in situations of misuse, and, specifically for FinTech companies, the control of money flows such that payments are only activated when the platform user does comply with the platform’s terms. Furthermore, designing the platform’s software modularly together with the organizational focus to adopt new knowledge increas-es the ability of a start-up to respond to new issues that arise. This also gives the platform owner the ability to change or add control mechanisms in order to increase his control over the platform and to decrease the misconduct by users of the platform. Lastly, making sure customers and other stakeholders accept the platform and agree with its business practice, preventing reputational damage, helps with becoming or remaining responsible when de-veloping a new platform.","Responsible Innovation; RI; platform; platform control; FinTech; start-up","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Values Technology and Innovation","","Management of Technology","",""

(mentor); Ortt, J.R. (mentor); Kamp, L.M. (mentor)","2016","The transformation of a new technological principle into a marketable product usually signifies a long and risky route for organizations engaged in the commercialization of radically new high-tech products. New products often fail to make it to the market, are delayed for their market introduction, or are withdrawn shortly after their market introduction. The period that spans from invention to (first) market introduction of radically new high-tech products (i.e. the innovation phase) has been found to last on average ten years (Ortt, 2010). Furthermore, the duration of the innovation phase may significantly vary per product. Arguably, this duration is suspected to encompass several barriers and strategic interaction. This thesis explores the erratic nature of the innovation phase by asking “what are the key actors and factors that facilitate or hamper innovation?”, “how are these interrelated?”, and “what strategies can be derived for organizations?”. The issue of successfully developing and commercializing innovative products pertains to a vast literature and several theoretical domains that have different units of analysis and orientation towards the innovation process. Although, theories propose different actors and factors as barriers and/or facilitators to bringing new technological products to the market, a comprehensive picture of how these actors and factors interact and influence the course of the innovation phase is lacking. This thesis argues that a more complete picture of the innovation phase can be achieved by synthesizing a wide range of notions from different theories. In turn, this can assist the process of devising more holistic innovation strategies. For the purpose of this research, a two-phase methodological approach has been followed. The first phase consists of a literature review that selectively examines the fields of: Strategic Niche Management, Organizational Capabilities/Characteristics and Innovation, the Valley of Death in Innovation, and the Fuzzy Front End of Innovation. The project theorizes that the concepts presented by these theories can be better understood if categorized along three broad and separate but interrelated levels: (i) a macro-level that comprises the market environment within which transitions to new technological regimes take place; (ii) a meso-level that is composed by the organization that considers the commercialization of radically new technologies; and (iii) a micro-level that consists of the project within which a new product is developed. The examined theories emphasize interrelations among factors that are usually found at the same level of analysis. However, this study attempts to reveal interaction among factors both within and across these levels. The integration of actors, factors, and interrelations is realized through the construction of a multi-level framework based on the distinction of the three aforementioned levels of interaction. The framework serves both as a static list of key influencing actors and factors, and for addressing interrelations among them. It is presumed that the same actors and factors can act as barriers and/or facilitators to innovation. Several simple mechanisms of interaction between factors are proposed, such as barriers reinforcing other barriers, or facilitators diminishing barriers. These mechanisms concern interaction among factors, both within and across levels. Consequently, more advanced mechanisms are derived, such as a chain of reinforcing barriers might create a negative feedback loop that possibly blocks radical innovation. A web consisting of barriers and facilitators that may have multiple causes and effects at the same time is revealed. With regard to the interaction among actors, a systematic way of interrelating is more difficult because of their complex nature. The framework is illustrated and refined in a second phase, with the investigation of two historical cases of Automatic Identification and Data Capturing (AIDC) technologies: Radio Frequency Identification and barcode. The analysis, which is based on secondary published documentation, enables not only the identification of several actors and factors, but also demonstration of interactions among factors and factors both within and across the distinguished levels. In addition, generic strategies for companies to cope with the innovation phase are derived as a result of empirical observations within the case studies. The major outcome of the project is the multi-level framework to address key actors and factors, and interrelationships that influence the innovation phase. Macro-level factors include: Technological Factors, Economic Factors, Competition, Supply Networks, Infrastructure & Maintenance Networks, Social Networks, Psychological & Cultural Factors, Social & Environmental Effects, Government Policy, Legislation & Regulation (Laws, Standards and Rules), Institutional Risk, and Competition; Meso-level factors include: Scientific Knowledge and Firm-Specific Techniques, Technical Systems, Managerial Systems, Organizational Culture and Values, and Financial Resources; and Micro-level factors include: Opportunity, Product Concept & Definition, Project Planning, and New Product Development process. With regard to the actors, Macro-level actors include: Governments, Research Institutes, Universities, Industries, Policy-makers, Regulators, Suppliers, Providers of Complementary Products, Potential Users (Early Adopters), Scientists, and Autonomous Entrepreneurs; Meso-level actors include: (Network of) Companies-Developers, Top - management, Executives, and Consultants; and Micro-level actors include: Product Champions, Project Managers, and Project Teams. Moreover, the emergence and influence of actors and factors within the case studies, indicated the following four key generic strategies for companies to deal with to the innovation phase: (i) Collaboration with other Knowledge Producing Institutions, (ii) Strategic Patent Acquisition, (iii) Working together with Potential Early Adopters, and (iv) Long-term Investment in Technology. These should not be viewed as competing alternatives, but, rather as mutually supporting options for firms that are engaged with development and/or commercialization efforts. The overall findings suggest a rather complex landscape for organizations seeking the commercialization of radical high-tech products. The innovation phase is characterized by significant dynamics in terms of the actors involved with research and/or NPD projects. Moreover, the successful market introduction of new technologies is more likely to be determined by a dynamic combination of factors functioning at different levels. Companies might take advantage of developments at all levels and successfully market a new product, without necessarily being active in investments for a long period of time. However, the context matters. The context might refer to the type of application (i.e. more systemic or less systemic), or the degree of complexity of the technology (i.e. relatively simple or complex systems). Finally, caution is required as there is no panacea for the challenges faced by actors during the innovation phase. Solutions must be tailored to the specific context with which development and commercialization efforts are confronted.","Innovation; Technology; High-tech; Radical; Development; Pre-Diffusion; AIDC; Barcode; RFID","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Values, Technology and Innovation / Economics of Technology and Innovations","","Management of Technology","",""

(mentor)","2016","The goal of this thesis is to improve the singulation process for pears. In this thesis a machine that is manufactured by Aweta is investigated. In the singulation process, pears arrive by means of a belt. The pears are transferred onto V-belts to align them in single rows. Then the pears fall between brushes. These two steps singulate the pears. Sensors can now inspect every individual pear to check its quality and dimensions. This is done over a distance of 600 mm. Beneath the sensors, the pears should be positioned properly and perform a full rotation so that the complete pear can be inspected. After the inspection, pears are dropped into a cup. At the right exit, the cup opens and the pear exits the system, making it ready for packaging. The research question of this thesis is: “How can Aweta’s current singulation process for conference pears be improved in such a way that 80% of the pears are singulated properly and make a full rotation within a distance of 600 mm.” First, a problem analysis was conducted in order to find out how the current system could be improved. Then experiments were conducted to find the percentage of pears that are orientated properly and rotate properly in the current system. This was 63 per cent. The Discrete Element Method (DEM) was used to build a computer model of the singulation process. The computer model was validated by comparing the amount of pears positioned properly and the amount of pears rotating properly with the data derived from the current system. Also, films of both experiments and the model were compared. The results differed less then two per cent. This computer model was then used to model possible solutions. Several designs were tested. The influence of several parameters on the performance of the current design and a new design were tested. Moreover, several options to deliver the pears to the brushes were tested. The simulations predicted that the current design could be improved with 7 per cent if several variables were changed. For the delivery of pears no significant improvements were found. For the new design the best result was 24 per cent higher then the current system. In total 86 per cent of the pears were positioned properly and rotating properly. This thesis shows that the Discrete Element Method can successfully be used to model the current singulation process for pears. The outcomes of the improved designs predict that more then 80% of the pears will be positioned and rotated properly beneath the sensors. It is therefore expected that the real system will perform as desired and that the research question can be positively answered.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-09-08","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Marine and Transport Technology","","Transport Engineering and Logistics","",""

(mentor)","2016","In hydrological models evaporation is often still quite uncertain. Potential evaporation is used as input, but the modelling of plant stresses is not always accurate enough to describe the behaviour in reality. In situ measured actual evaporation data is rare, and doing measurements is time consuming and expensive. With the advance of satellite technology, remote sensing products modelling actual evaporation have been developed. To see if models can be easily improved using this actual evaporation data, it will be directly imposed. As remote sensing data product, the LSA SAF actual evaporation product will be used. As input it uses most importantly Meteosat-10 data. As other sources it has ERA-interim and ECOCLIMAP. Accuracy is generally high when comparing it to in situ measurements (R2=0.90 when comparing it to eddy covariance at Cabauw), although a correction factor might be necessary for some locations. Three models were tested, WALRUS, SIMGRO and FLEX. Two sites in the Netherlands were studied (Cabauw and the Hupsel Brook) and two catchments in Spain (Ubierna and Ulzama). WALRUS was applied to the Cabauw Polder and the Hupsel Brook, SIMGRO was applied to Cabauw, and FLEX was used in Spain. SIMGRO did not perform well, and modelled water stress during summers at Cabauw, while in situ measurements showed that water stress was not an issue. The performance was too low for LSA SAF evaporation to make a difference. WALRUS performed well at Cabauw, although there was no difference between the performance of the model when using actual evaporation instead of Makkink evaporation (NS=0.693 and NS=0.673 respectively), as the catchment does not suffer from water stress. In the Hupsel Brook water stress does occur, and the model performs slightly better when using actual evaporation instead of Makkink evaporation (NS=0.762 and NS=0.733 respectively). In Spain the uncertainty of the input data was high, and some corrections were necessary. For the Ubierna catchment, the performance was clearly better with the LSA SAF actual evaporation instead of the Makkink evaporation (log-NS=0.787 and log-NS=0.698). For the Ulzama catchment the model using LSA SAF actual evaporation also performed better than the Makkink evaporation (log-NS=0.769 and log-NS=0.708). These results show that the LSA SAF product can give a good representation of actual evaporation, and that directly using it in hydrological models can improve their performance if the vegetation in the catchment experiences water stress.","hydrology; modelling; evaporation; actual evaporation; remote sensing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Water Management","","Hydrology","",""

(mentor)","2016","Current X-ray machines often rely on off-the-shelf PCs to implement image processing chains. These PCs have a limited lifetime and need to be replaced every few years. If such a PC is not commercially available anymore, the image processing chain has to be redeveloped for a new target platform to ensure the exact same performance and functional correctness and as is required in medical devices and embedded solutions. A solution to this is to develop a Register-Transfer Level (RTL) design from the image processing algorithm, and load this on a Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). Certain types of FPGAs have increased lifetimes compared to PCs, and will decrease total maintenance cost. Also, this design will have the same performance and correctness when transferred between compatible boards. An added advantage is a performance increase in throughput. However, an RTL design takes a long time to develop and is thus very costly. To accelerate the design process, Computer-Aided Design (CAD) tools can be used. Yet the performance of such a generated RTL design may be low, compared to a manually crafted RTL design. A functionally correct design is required in medical devices as well. This thesis investigates if it is possible to reduce the design time of hardware-software co-design while maintaining a level of optimized performance, and ensuring the same functional correctness of the original algorithm. To this end, a workflow is produced, implementing a proof-of-concept system using Vivado HLS. This CAD tool generates an RTL design automatically which can be optimized using user-input. This design is implemented on Zync 7z030 System-on-Module (SoM) and is connected using the Dyplo framework. A detailed optimization guide is given to explore the trade-offs between throughput and area usage. A rough estimate of the development time of the final produced workflow indicates that the development time of an RTL design can be decreased up to ten times compared to manual creation, while ensuring portability, easy modification and functional correctness. Using optimizations and restructuring a high performance close to a manual design could be reached for individual filters, as well as an estimated performance for the entire hardware implementation. This thesis represents a public summary of the original thesis with summarized background, implementation and results to protect the confidentiality of its information.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Quantum Engineering","","","",""

Customers in other cities will be provided with the Picnic service soon. Currently, Picnic is preparing customer orders in a fulfilment centre (FC) in Nijkerk. This FC (FC0) operates fully manual. The maximum capacity of FC0 is expected to be reached in December 2016. However, Picnic foresees further growth. To facilitate expected growth, Picnic will have to expand FC capacity. For online retailers, FCs generate the main supply chain costs. Therefore, these centres should be highly efficient i.e. operational costs per item should decrease. Combined with the ambition of Picnic to continuously improve service levels, it is expected that a certain level of mechanization of FC processes is required. In literature, a very limited number of studies can be found on the specific design of online grocer FCs. There is however, substantial literature on warehouse design. Considerable differences between online grocer FC- and warehouse design are the presence of multiple temperature zones, the order preparation in consumer units, the high number of items within one order, the high number of order lines within one order, the high variation of sizes and weights of products and the high variation in fragility constraints of products. To explore the logistic design characteristics of online grocer FCs and to provide recommendations for the expansion of FC capacity of Picnic, the following research question is defined: What are the logistic design characteristics of a (semi-) mechanized fulfilment centre of a fast growing pure play online grocer handling 20000 orders per day, taking into account operational and capital expenditure? To answer this question, research is performed in different phases: an exploration, an analysis, a design, an assessment and an advice phase. Based on the exploration and the analysis phase, it can be stated that an online grocer FC can vary on 11 major system functions within the design. These system functions are: receiving, replenishing, product storage, picking of fast movers, picking of mid movers, picking of slow movers, order storage, consolidating, storing, transportation of products within the FC and the transportation of orders within the FC. The picking process is split up for different product sales categories to assess if higher efficiencies can be reached when different pick strategies are installed. The main input variables for the design are: the number of stock keeping units (SKUs) within the ambient range, the number of ambient items in one order, the number of items per tote, the number of items per line, the average volume per SKU (in litres) and the percentage of orders which has to be consolidated. Based on different manual and mechanized system solutions for the system functions, four design alternatives focussing on the ambient temperature zone are generated: 1. Fully manual: based on the current FC, pick circuit also includes pallet pick to scale the number of orders. 2. Semi-mechanized: manual picking with mechanized surrounding processes, splitting is performed with a sorter, replenishment with conveyor belts, pick cart preparation, consolidation and dispatch frame (DPF) storing is performed mechanically, a shuttle automatic storage and retrieval system (AS/RS) is installed to buffer order totes. 3. Highly mechanized (product transport with conveyor belts): three pick strategies (pallet pick, zone pick and goods to person (GTP) pick) to optimize pick productivity per sales category, shuttle AS/RS is installed to buffer and sequence order totes for a mechanized DPF frame loader. 4. Fully mechanized (product transport with KIVAs): one pick strategy for all products, KIVAs transport products to GTP stations, order totes travel on conveyor belts, shuttle AS/RS is installed to buffer and sequence order totes for the mechanized DPF frame loader. The alternatives are assessed in a deterministic model on the following criteria: all-in productivity, surface area, full time equivalent (FTE), capital expenditure (CapEx), operational expenditure (OpEx) and total fulfilment costs per year. The main results of the assessment are presented in Table 1. Alternative 3 results in the lowest fulfilment costs and the highest all-in productivity (153 items per hour). When alternative 3 is chosen, around 200 FTE and 18K square meters of surface area is required for the ambient temperature zone. There also has to be stated that the assessment showed that when handling 20K orders, the obtained manual pick productivity for alternative 1 and 2, is 37% lower than the required pick productivity. This leads to order totes not being on time for further shipment and therefore, a decrease of the service level. When handling less than 15K orders, the required pick productivity can be reached within the manual alternatives. Table 1: Results of the assessment when handling 20K orders Design criteria Unit Alternative 1 Alternative 2 Alternative 3 Alternative 4 All-in productivity [Item/hour] 54 81 153 132 FTE on site [FTE] 641 327 198 245 Labour costs per item [€/item] 0,28 0,20 0,11 0,13 Surface area [m2] 14.6K 18.1K 17.8K 21K Tests with the model also showed that: - When handling 5K orders, the semi-mechanized alternative becomes nearly as attractive as the fully mechanized alternative 3 - Order growth results in a higher increase of the total fulfilment costs per year for manual alternatives compared to order growth for mechanized alternatives - Increase of the ambient range has a major effect on all-in productivity of manual alternatives, but a minor effect on the mechanized solutions - Rental costs of FC housing have such a low share within operational costs per year that this does not have to be taken into account when choosing a location - The ‘Christmas’ order profile scenario result in the largest increase of the total fulfilment costs and the largest decrease of all-in productivity for alternative 3 Based on the results of the assessment, it can be advised that to facilitate foreseen growth, Picnic should mechanize fulfilment processes. The assessment also showed that the highest all-in productivity and the lowest fulfilment costs can be reached when, together with an automatic storage and retrieval system and conveyor belts for internal transport, different pick strategies for fast fast moving, mid moving and slow moving articles are installed. This is because picking of least sold products with a high productivity, results in maximal operating efficiency. Since the maximum capacity of FC0 is approaching rapidly, it is recommended to first realize a semi-mechanized FC (FC1), in which picking activities remain fully manual but surrounding activities are mechanized. Based on the growth forecast and the outcomes of the model, it can be concluded that the maximum optimal capacity of FC0 combined with FC1 will be reached around July 2017. Prior to reaching this capacity, the highly mechanized FC with three different pick strategies should be realized (FC2). Before realization of FC2, the assumption made regarding on-time performance of order totes should be investigated thoroughly. In consideration of depreciation costs, FC1, should remain operational for at least six years. After realization of FC2 however, FC0 can be shut down because of relatively high operational costs.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-09-05","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Marine and Transport Technology","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","This graduation project aims to decrease loneliness among elderly in Rotterdam with help of the method Design for Happiness. The analysis phase existed of five different studies. Context mapping with elderly, literature research, interviews with experts, interviews with the target group and home visits with Rotterdam citizens aged 75 and older. Goal of this research was to understand how to effectively design against loneliness. One of the main insights from this research is that loneliness is a subjective feeling that causes a downward spiral of mental and physical implications, which is hard to breach. Despite loneliness being subjective, certain people have a higher risk of becoming lonely. Elderly aged over 75 years old are included in this group, due to multiple reasons: the taboo on loneliness, the higher chance of losing their social network and the societal perception that elderly are vulnerable and incapable. To overcome these risk factors, it is important that the design intervention gives elderly a meaningful place in society in which they become aware that they can do more than they might think. This gives them a feeling of pride and helps them achieve their personal significance. To be able to reach these elderly, they must be addressed positively and personally maintaining a low threshold. Giving them the possibility to enter a new phase of life, rather than entering their last. Solely bringing people together cannot solve loneliness in itself. Especially not if someone has fallen into a downward spiral. However, by facilitating the creation of emotional contacts, the social network can be enhanced which can be used as a safety net that prevents falling into said spiral. These connections can be made with use of a superordinate goal in combination with leisure activities. The target group of baby boomers is not ready to start retirement at the age of 67. They want to stay active, follow their passion, have control over their lives, want to contribute to society and work at flexible hours. Collaborating with the Y-generation can help them fulfill these needs. In contrast to what senior institutions are doing at the moment, it is important to address a specific target group as possible. It is chosen to design a new residential form. Communal living can be effective against emotional loneliness as long as it avoids caring for, includes something for the residents to discuss together and respects everyone’s privacy. Besides, this should answer to the need for a fitting house for elderly, in which they can grow old independently. Furthermore it decreases the risk of an unsafe living area, is experienced as entering a new phase in life and people meet each other on a regular basis as a starting point. The design intervention ‘Thuis &’ is an alternative residential form for elderly based on a collaborative entrepreneurial activity with youngsters which brings the neighbourhood closer in an accessible way. Since there are different variants, it is likely to fit someone’s passion and narrows down the target group. To lower the threshold there are different layers of participation. The higher the level of participation, the more loneliness is prevented effectively. The concept has been evaluated and validated with help of nine elderly, one youngster and two stakeholders. By means of interviews. Finally a last iteration has been made based on the results of the evaluation interviews, concluding with recommendations for further development and implementation of the design.","housing concept; elderly; preventing loneliness","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Integrated Product Design","",""

(mentor)","2016","STS cranes (Ship-to-Shore cranes) are designed for a finite fatigue life, but it is often preferred by the terminal operators to keep the crane in operation once the design fatigue life has expired. When the crane is operated after it reached its expected service life, the risk of fatigue failure increases. Therefore the structural lifetime of the crane needs to be assessed in order to enable operation of the crane after it reaches its design fatigue life without compromising safety. Methods to assess the remaining fatigue life in industries like offshore and aviation are stan- dardized, but for cranes such methods do not exist. Therefore an assessment method for the structure of the crane needs to be put forward. The assessment method should be able to calculate the remaining lifetime of the crane and determine whether inspection of the crane is necessary (and if so, how long the intervals should be). After inspections are completed, the method should determine whether repair works need to be performed to ensure the structural integrity of the crane. The main research question of this thesis is formulated as follows: What is the most appropriate method to assess the remaining fatigue life of steel structures of existing STS cranes? To determine which type of fatigue assessment methods can be applied to STS cranes, a review of assessment methods for STS cranes, bridges, aircraft and offshore structures is performed. The method that is selected when the crane is operated within its design fatigue life is the calculation procedure for fatigue used in the design stage, because this means that the remaining fatigue life can be determined using information that is already available. When the crane is operated outside its design limits, a crack growth model is used to calculate the remaining fatigue life. The steel structure of a general STS crane consists of four main components; bolted con- nections, pinned connections, welded connections and base material. It is determined that the majority of fatigue failures in steel structures occurs at welds, fatigue cracks in the base material contribute slightly and the amount of fatigue failures of bolted and pinned connec- tions is negligible. The fatigue assessment model therefore only considers cracks in the base material and in welds. The components at the connections at the forestay and backstay, the connections between the crane boom and the portal beams as well as the connections at the legs are even more susceptible to fatigue failure because these areas are subjected to relatively large fluctuating loads. In order to determine the remaining fatigue life of the crane, the crack size which will cause failure needs to be known. This critical crack size depends on the geometry of the detail under consideration, the used material and the stress at that detail. This means that the critical crack size is not constant across the steel structure of a general STS crane. When the critical crack size is known, the crack growth rate needs to be calculated in order to determine the time between crack initiation and failure. The structure needs to be checked for cracks before a member is expected to fail. Therefore the value for the remaining fatigue life is used to schedule inspections as well. The inspection interval depends on the crack size which can be determined with sufficient reliability, which in turn depends on the type of inspection method that is deployed. In case cracks are found during inspections, repair methods are available to extend the re- maining fatigue life of the crane. The methods that can be used to repair cracks in steel structures of STS cranes are the gouge-and-weld method, mounting doubler plates, drilling crack arrest holes and modifying the structure. The selection of the repair method is based on the remaining fatigue life of the structure, the location of the crack and potential earlier fatigue crack repair works. The most appropriate method to assess the remaining fatigue life of the crane therefore consists of an inspection schedule, where the inspection intervals are determined based on the remaining fatigue life. When the crane is operated within its design limits, the inspection intervals are based on the safety factors for fatigue as defined in the EN 13001 design standard for cranes. When the crane is operated after its design fatigue life is expired, the remaining fatigue life is calculated using a crack growth model. The inspection methods that are used to inspect the crane are determined based on the value for the critical crack size and the crack size which can be accurately determined by the inspection methods. When the remaining fatigue life is insufficient, repair works are scheduled to repair the crack and thus extend the fatigue life of the crane. The repair methods are selected based on the type of crack (cracks at the surface or internal cracks) and its location. This method is repeated until it is not economically feasible to further extend the fatigue life of the crane.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Marine and Transport Technology","","Transport Engineering and Logistics","",""

(mentor)","2016","In this research a workflow for upscaling polymer flooding is developed. The workflow generates pseudorelative permeabilities (pseudos) to represent flow behaviour affected by fine scale heterogeneities in a coarse grid. With this workflow, a better estimate of the difference in production from a polymer flood compared to a water flood can be made. In case history-matched pseudos for a water flood are readily available, the workflow provides insight in whether and how the pseudos generated for water should be adjusted to correctly model a polymer flood. In case no production data and no pseudos are available for a water flood, the workflow can be used to generate pseudos for both a water and a polymer flood. Using pseudos in a coarse model is needed because heterogeneity affecting connectivity and thereby flow behaviour is not (fully) represented as a result of upscaling. Therefore an error may be made in cumulative oil and water production when simulating a water or a polymer flood in a coarse model. Pseudos can be used to represent flow behaviour from a fine grid in a coarse grid. Polymer flooding improves sweep around heterogeneities compared to water flooding. This means flow behaviour differs for water and polymer flooding. As a result, pseudos for water and polymer flooding may differ (depending on circumstances). The need for the use of pseudos when using an upscaled grid is assessed by comparing cumulative production from a coarse grid simulated with optimized pseudos to cumulative production from a coarse grid simulated with rock relative permeabilities. The difference in upscaling a water flood from a polymer flood and the need for adjustment of pseudos generated for a water flood when simulating a polymer flood is assessed by comparing simulating a polymer flood in a coarse grid with pseudos optimized for polymer flooding to simulating a polymer flood in a coarse grid with pseudos optimized for a water flood. A sectormodel is used as a basis for upscaling. The upscaling procedure is based on adjustment of relative permeabilities using Particle SwarmOptimization, which is an exploring optimization algorithm. Endpoint water relative permeability, kr,we , and the Brooks-Corey coefficient for oil, no, are selected as optimizing parameters.The least square difference between cumulative oil production from the fine grid and from the coarse grid is taken as the objective function to be minimized. Results are post-processed by converting non-unique pseudos resulting from the optimization in unique fractional flow curves. A novel way of characterizing the fractional flow curve is developed, which allows representation of the entire curve through vshock . This provides insight in how pseudos change in sensitivity studies. Generally, the match in cumulative production is very good. The models investigated in this work show that the improvement of generating pseudos compared to simulating a coarse grid with fine grid relative permeabilities is significant. In 3D channelized turbidite models, shale draping causes a too late breakthrough and an overestimation in recovery when pseudos are not adjusted, e.g. when rock relative permeabilities are used in the coarse grid. Errors in breakthrough time are reduced from 0.3 PV injected when not adjusting relative permeabilities to 0.05 PV injected. Errors in late time recovery are reduced from a 0.2 to 0 difference in recovery (fraction of OIIP). The required adjustment in rock relative permeabilities to match cumulative production depends on heterogeneity and method and degree of upscaling. Sensitivity of pseudos to polymer concentration, and thus the need for adjustment of water pseudos when simulating a polymer flood, differs for surface-based upscaled models and voxelized models and depends on heterogeneity. Deriving a general trend for the difference between water and polymer pseudos fromthiswork is therefore not possible. In surface-based upscaled models, vshock increases, e.g. the fractional flow curve shifts left, with increasing polymer concentration. As a result, breakthrough time is estimated too late and recovery is overestimated when simulating a polymer flood with water pseudos. In voxelized models, vshock decreases, e.g. the fractional flowcurve shifts right,with increasing polymer concentration. As a result, breakthrough time is estimated too early and recovery is underestimated when simulating a polymer flood with water pseudos. Robustness of generated pseudos to changes in injection rate, amount of PV injected and streamlines due to different perforated intervals or well-placement is tested and found to be good for the simulated cases.","polymer flooding; upscaling; relative permeability; fractional flow; turbidites; Particle Swarm Optimization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); van Dongen, K.W.A. (mentor)","2016","In this thesis, we try to prove the stability of spiral arms using the density wave theory. This theory assumes that the spiral arms are not rigid structures, but instead they are regions with increased density that move through the galaxy like a wave [1]. The spiral structure, in this theory, are driven by the Lindblad resonances, which occur when the star has had an integer amount of radial oscillations for every encounter with the spiral structure. Here, we consider the standard Lindblad model for a two-armed galaxy. We consider the corotation resonance, where the star has the same orbital frequency as the spiral structure, and the Lindblad resonances where the star has completed two radial oscillations for every revolution it has made with respect to the spiral structure. If the star moves more slowly than the spiral structure, it is in the outer Lindblad resonance; if it moves faster than the spiral structure, we call it the inner Lindblad resonance. To derive a formula for the density of stars in a galaxy, we make a few approximations. We assume that the spiral arms are Archimedian spirals, even though spiral arms are generally shaped more like logarithmic spirals [2]. We also make linear approximations, as we approximate the Hamiltonian in the case without spiral arms with the linear Hamiltonian H0. To calculate the density of stars, we assume that the stars follow a certain distribution in phase-space. We then integrate this distribution to obtain the spatial density of the stars. This density shows a clear spiral structure at outer Lindblad resonance and corotation. However, the linear approximations mean that the distribution around inner Lindblad resonance does not show any spiral structure. This is because we linearized the unpertubed Hamiltonian, which means that we assumed that the radial and orbital frequencies are constant for all stars in this resonance. However, when calculating these frequencies using the non-linearized Hamiltonian, we show that this approximation does not work for inner Lindblad resonance, despite being a good assumption for the other resonances. So using this model, we have derived the outer part of the spiral structure. Even though the density in the structure does not differ much from the surrounding galaxy, the increased star formation [3] means that these arms stand out more in luminosity than in density.","spiral structure; spiral arms","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Delft Institute of Applied Mathematics","","Applied Physics/Applied Mathematics Double Bachelor programme","",""

(mentor); Cusini, M. (mentor)","2016","Accurate numerical simulations of multiphase flow in fractured porous media require high resolution grids to explicitly capture the effect of fractures on the flow field without using excessively up-scaled quantities (e.g., modified rock permeabilities). For field-scale applications, as the consequence of large-scale domains and many explicit fractures, the size of the (non)linear systems becomes out of the scope of the classical numerical methods. Thus, various advanced numerical methods have been introduced to reduce this computational challenge. The Embedded Discrete Fracture Model (EDFM) which employs sets of independent grids for the rock matrix and the fractures (represented as lower dimensional domains). By employing two separate grids, coupled by a transfer function, EDFM allows to avoid adapting the matrix grid to accommodate the presence of fractures. Therefore, computational complexities with respect to the fracture geometries are significantly reduced. Even after employing EDFM, the size of the systems for real-field applications is still too large to be solved accurately with classical solvers. This challenge motivates the development of Multiscale Finite Volume (MSFV) method, which is the focus of this work, as well. The MSFV method efficiently solves the pressure (flow) equations by solving it at a coarser resolution, while honoring the fine-scale heterogeneous data. Recently, an efficient MSFV method for EDFM approach (F-AMS) was developed and tested for many cases of practical interests. Even though the F-AMS was found efficient for many scenarios, its applicability is limited to only the use of 2 levels of grids (fine and coarse). For real-field applications, where there exist several millions (or billions) degrees of freedom, the construction of only 1 level of coarse grid resolution may not be sufficient. Of high interest to the community is the development of a multiscale method which allows for arbitrary number of accurate coarse resolutions. In this work, for the first time in the multiscale community, a novel multilevel multiscale finite volume method for fractured porous media (F-MLMS) is developed. F-MLMS is successfully applied to a set of synthetic 2D test cases and its performance is carefully studied. Employing a multilevel strategy becomes crucial for field-scale applications, where a single level of coarsening is not enough to reduce significantly the size of the linear systems to be solved. The use of two independent grids allows to employ different coarsening strategies for the two media. Consequently, F-MLMS represents an important step forward for the application of multiscale methods to naturally and induced fractured reservoirs, with complex fracture networks.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","Petroleum Engineering and Geo-sciences","",""
